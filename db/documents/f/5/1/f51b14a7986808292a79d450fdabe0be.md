The chin represents an often underappreciated aesthetic component of the face; however, the chin remains an essential facial subunit that plays a significant role overall facial attractiveness. Chin augmentation, or genioplasty, is a common facial plastic surgery procedure used to improve facial aesthetics. To fully appreciate the effects that chin augmentation can provide for the patient, the surgeon must perform a complete facial evaluation and possess a thorough understanding of the relevant anatomy. Although several methods exist to augment the chin, including osseous genioplasty, this activity will focus specifically on chin augmentation using alloplastic chin implants. This activity also describes the process of patient assessment, critical facial analysis, and the techniques involved with alloplastic chin augmentation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different methods for chin and facial analysis when considering chin augmentation using alloplastic implants.

- Identify the most common indications for chin augmentation using alloplastic implants.
- Summarize the techniques of inserting chin implants.
- Review the risks associated with chin augmentation using alloplastic implants.
