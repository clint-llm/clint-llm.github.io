Thirty-three vertebrae make up the entirety of the spine. Each vertebra is shaped differently and can group into cervical, thoracic, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal.

The lumbar spine consists of fine boney vertebrae that follow a similar shape. Between each vertebra, there is a fibrocartilage intervertebral disk that provides cushioning. The anterior surface of the bone is the body. Most of the weight of the spinal column is placed here. Since the lumbar vertebrae are towards the caudal end of the spine, they carry most of the most bodyweight and are thus thicker than the cervical and thoracic vertebrae.

The vertebra arch forms the posterior surface of the vertebrae. The arch consists of a left and right-sided pedicel and lamina. The arch creates a circular opening in which the spinal cord runs through down the length of the back. Many structures project off of the arch.

Two transverse processes project off the vertebral arch laterally, one to the left and one to the right. There is a thick and rounded spinous process that projects off the arch posteriorly in the midline. Four articular processes arise from the arch; two superiorly on the left and right sides and two inferiorly on the left and right sides. Each of the articular processes connects with articular processes from the vertebra above and below it; this allows for the major motion of the lumbar vertebrae to be flexion and extension.

Since there is a significant amount of movement that can exist in the lumbar spine, individual lumbar segments can move out of place. Each segment can become improperly aligned by being either rotated, side bent, flexed, or extended. With many muscular attachments and nerves surrounding the bones, there is potential for the out of place vertebral segments to cause pain.

One of the major functions of the spinal vertebrae is to house the spinal cord. Some nerves run through the spinal cord and exit out the intervertebral foramen. In the lumbar spine, five pairs of nerves emerge from the cord and carry both motor and sensory neurons. These nerves correspond to a vertebra and exit below their corresponding segment. These then provide innervation to structures surrounding the spine. It is important to note the pain pattern the patient describes. Knowing where each nerve root exits and what the nerve innervates will allow the practitioner to target the treatment to the appropriate spinal segment.

To perform a CS or FPR technique, one must find a somatic dysfunction or an area of exquisite tenderness in a muscle, tendon, or ligament. The practitioner then places the patient’s body in a position where the tenderness significantly decreases. In a CS technique, the practitioner holds the position for 90 seconds. To complete an FPR maneuver, the practitioner adds a facilitating force of compression or rotation for three seconds. There are many theories of how CS and FPR manipulation work, but the most common theory is that the tender point exists because of the overstretching of myofascial tissue resulting in a neuromuscular imbalance.
