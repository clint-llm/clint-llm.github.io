With the help of GWAS and EWAS, we now understand how genetics and epigenetics play an important role in obesity. Diagnosing, managing, and supporting patients with genetically predisposed obesity requires a dedicated team of health care professionals experienced in their various fields with good teamwork. Since the origins of obesity are directly associated with maternal health, a team of obstetricians, pediatricians, nutritionists, geneticists, psychologists can help mitigate risk factors associated with maternal and childhood obesity.

Pediatric endocrinologists play a significant role in diagnosing early childhood obesity. In contrast, adult endocrinologists can help treat and control diabetes and other cardiometabolic parameters that cause epigenome changes passed on from generation to generation. Early lifestyle interventions, bariatric surgery, and medications form the basis of the treatment of genetically predisposed obesity.
