Cherry angiomas mostly appear with age. Although they are found to have an association with some malignancies, they are mostly developed in healthy individuals. These lesions begin as bright red, flat macules and grow to become 1Â to 5 mm red papules. They are usually asymptomatic but can bleed with trauma.

It has been noted that the color of the cherry angiomas changes with hypoxia; they become blue rather than red. The small spots are noted to turn blue sooner than the larger ones. Once the patient is restored to cardiovascular stability, the lesions revert to their ruddy red color.
