Pernicious anemia is often an insidious and under-diagnosed autoimmune disorder, which can lead to fatal complications. The most appropriate way to supervise this disorder is through interprofessional team coordination with clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists working together to ensure the patient is treated promptly. The healthcare team should strive to increase awareness of the disease and educate patients on potential complications. The nurse can intervene in a primary screening during triage by asking for signs and symptoms suggestive of neurologic or gastric complications. The most at-risk population includes people over 60 years of age. Once treated, the patients should be supervised routinely by a well-integrated interprofessional team of providers and nurses to help improve clinical outcomes for these patients.[Level 5]
