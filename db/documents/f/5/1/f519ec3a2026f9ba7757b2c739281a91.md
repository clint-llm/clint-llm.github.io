As with any medical condition, prevention is preferable to late interventions. Some conditions leading to a coma may allow interventions prior to the development of a coma. Closer monitoring and education of patients with poorly controlled diabetes might be an opportunity for prevention. Another category amenable for intervention would be patients at risk for drug overdoses or illicit drug use. Particularly with the epidemic of opioid abuse there is increasing evidence that prompt interventional counseling and medication-assisted treatment may decrease future overdoses.
