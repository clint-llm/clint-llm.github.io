The exact mechanism of action for black cohosh is not known. Some studies suggest that several biologically active substances are responsible for their action. A partial list of active compounds includes the isoflavone formononetin, isoferulic, caffeic, salicylic, and fukinolic acids. There are also miscellaneous fatty acids, tannins, and sugars.  Phytosterin and resins that include Cimicifuga and triterpene glycosides are also present. Most evidence points to several different mechanisms of action. Some researchers have shown evidence that it may exert its effects centrally through alterations in the serotonin pathways. Others have demonstrated its ability to act as an antioxidant or anti-inflammatory. Others still have shown that it works as a selective estrogen receptor modulator similarly to tamoxifen. The only thing that can be said with certainty is that it is not completely understood and appears to have multiple potential mechanisms of action.
