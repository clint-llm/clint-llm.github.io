The adult trachea is about 15 cm long. It extends from the lower end of the cricoid cartilage (C6 level) and divides into the right and left main bronchus at the level of T5. The right bronchus is broader and more in line with the trachea. It divides into the upper, middle, and lower lobe branches. The left bronchus is more horizontal and divides into upper and lower branches. The lung lobes are subdivided into bronchopulmonary segments, each supplied by a segmental artery and a segmental bronchus. The veins lie between these segments. It is important for the surgeon to be aware of these surgical units of the lung.

The surgery is usually performed by making incisions in the intercostal space. The incisions are parallel to the long axis of the intercostal space. The surgeon must take care that these incisions are in the center of the space to avoid injury to the intercostal nerves that run in a groove at the lower border of the ribs.
