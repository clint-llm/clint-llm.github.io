External snapping hip syndrome most commonly is caused by the iliotibial band snapping over the greater trochanter of the femoral head during movements such as flexion, extension, and external or internal rotation.

Internal snapping hip is most commonly caused by the iliopsoas tendon snapping over underlying bony prominences, such as the iliopectinal eminence or the anterior aspect of the femoral head.
