Hyperlipidemia is a term that encompasses various genetic and acquired disorders that describe elevated lipid levels within the body. It is a very common disorder, especially in the Western hemisphere, but also throughout the world. Hyperlipidemia itself does not typically lead to critical symptoms itself, however, having this underlying pathology will often lead to serious illnesses that may ultimately lead to death. To lower morbidity and mortality rates associated with this disorder, it is critical to establish an early diagnosis and prevent the progression of the disease. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment guidelines associated with hyperlipidemia. It also highlights the role of interprofessional communication and teamwork when managing the diagnosis and the correct treatment of patients diagnosed with hyperlipidemia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of hyperlipidemia.

- Review the steps in the evaluation of hyperlipidemia.
- Outline the management options available for hyperlipidemia.
- Explain the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of hyperlipidemia.
