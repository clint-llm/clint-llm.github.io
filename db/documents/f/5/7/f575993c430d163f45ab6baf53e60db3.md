There are many indications for capsule endoscopy. The most common indication is for obscure gastrointestinal bleed thought to be located in the small bowel after upper and lower endoscopic procedures failed to find a bleeding source. Video capsule has a 35% to 77% detection rate of obscure gastrointestinal bleeds. Other indications for small bowel capsule endoscopy are as follows: diagnosis of Crohn's disease and evaluation of Crohn's disease activity, diagnosis of celiac disease, and evaluation of refractory celiac disease, polyposis syndrome surveillance, small intestine tumors such as neuroendocrine tumors, or carcinoid tumors. Capsule endoscopy is indicated to evaluate the esophagus for esophageal varices screening, Barrett’s esophagus screening, and esophagitis identification. Colon capsule endoscopy is indicated for colon cancer screening in patients with a previous incomplete colonoscopy, patients that have major risks for a colonoscopy itself, and patients that cannot tolerate sedation.

**Canadian Association of Gastroenterology clinical practice guideline on CE**1) CE is recommended for patients with suspected, known, or relapsed CD when ileocolonoscopy and imaging studies were negative. However, it was not recommended in patients with only chronic abdominal pain or diarrhea, and no evidence of biomarkers associated with CD.

2) CE was not recommended for the diagnosis of celiac disease but may be useful in patients with unexplained symptoms despite treatment and appropriate investigations.

3) In patients with overt gastrointestinal bleeding and negative findings on EGD and colonoscopy, CE should be performed as soon as possible. CE may be used in selected patients with chronic iron-deficiency anemia.

4) CE is recommended for surveillance in patients with polyposis syndromes who require small- bowel studies. CCE should not be substituted routinely for a colonoscopy, especially in patients with IBD.
