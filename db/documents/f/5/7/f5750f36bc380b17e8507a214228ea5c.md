Linear immunoglobulin A bullous dermatosis (LABD), also known as linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis or linear immunoglobulin A disease, is a relatively rare subepidermal vesiculobullous disease that can occur in both adults and children. In children, the disease is known as "chronic bullous disease of childhood" and tends to have a distinct clinical appearance, but the underlying pathogenesis of the disease remains the same. In the adult form of the disease, a drug-induced etiology must be thoroughly considered. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, presentation, and evaluation of linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis.
- Review the presentation of a patient with linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis.
- Summarize the treatment options for linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by linear immunoglobulin A dermatosis.
