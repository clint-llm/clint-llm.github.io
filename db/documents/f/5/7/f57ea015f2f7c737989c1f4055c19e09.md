It is imperative that hand injuries are splinted with proper technique.  As the proper technique is followed, the versatile capabilities of the hand are preserved, nerve impingements are avoided, and the full range of motion is retained. In certain settings, evaluation by an orthopedic specialist is not readily available and the hand should be splinted to prevent further injury prior to a proper follow-up appointment.
