Medical errors are a significant concern for patient safety in the healthcare industry. Healthcare professionals and policymakers can reduce the burden of medical errors on patients and clinical providers by focusing on clinical education and implementing healthcare systems that deter "easy mistakes." It is essential to recognize that faulty or inadequate knowledge is not a common cause of medical errors.

Clinical nurses and pharmacists can help prevent medication errors by helping the providers obtain an accurate medication reconciliation on admission and discharge from a medical facility. The clinical nurse also plays a vital role in preventing healthcare-associated infections, pressure ulcers, and falls. The clinical nurse is also tasked with patient monitoring and effective communication with the providers to ensure all critical information points are conveyed concisely to help minimize errors in clinical decision-making.

Accreditation agencies and training programs must focus on medical errors as an inherent part of human medical practice and teach ways to minimize such errors. A collaborative interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and education specialists can greatly reduce the incidence of medical errors in the healthcare industry.[Level 5]
