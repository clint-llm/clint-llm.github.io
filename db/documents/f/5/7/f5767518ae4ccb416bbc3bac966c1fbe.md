Since the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against a population screening for testicular cancer, patients at high risk of testicular cancer must be identified and educated regarding their specific risk, explaining the most common signs and symptoms of testicular teratoma. Even though no specific data recommends a self-examination, high-risk patients can be trained to perform a regular palpatory exam and consult with a clinician in doubtful cases. This method could increase mass detection and decrease ultrasound examinations as a screening method. Finally, education and reassurance in high-risk men and patients with known testicular cancer contribute to eliminating patient-doctor barriers and improving communication.
