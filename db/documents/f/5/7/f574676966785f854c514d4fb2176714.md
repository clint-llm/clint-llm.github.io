Postoperative fever is a common occurrence on all surgical floors. Because there are so many causes of fever, the problem is usually managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals. The nurse is probably the first person who monitors the patient and discovers the fever. In order to know the cause, the nurse should first check the wound site, auscultate the lungs, and assess for deep vein thrombosis. Other causes of postoperative fever may be a urinary tract infection, an intravenous line (thrombophlebitis), or sepsis. Once the fever has been noted, the health care provider should be notified, and the workup depends on patient presentation and the day of the fever. If pneumonia is suspected, a chest x-ray may be ordered, blood and urine culture for sepsis, and a urinary tract infection and duplex ultrasound if a deep vein thrombus is suspected. The key is to examine the patient as it may provide a clue to the cause.
