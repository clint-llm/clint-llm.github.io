As described previously, hydatiform moles are divided into complete and partial moles. Complete mole is the most common type and does not contain fetal parts, whereas in a partial mole there might be identifiable fetal residues. Complete moles are typically diploid, whereas partial moles are triploid. Complete moles tend to cause higher levels of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is one of the main clinical features of this process. In complete moles, the karyotype is 46,XX 90% of the time and 46,XY 10% of the time. It arises when an enucleated egg is fertilized either by two sperms or by a haploid sperm that then duplicates and therefore, only paternal DNA is expressed. On the other hand, in partial moles, the karyotype is 90% of the time triploid and either 69,XXX or 69,XXY. This karyotype arises when a normal sperm subsequently fertilizes haploid ovum duplicates and or when two sperms fertilize a haploid ovum. In partial moles, both maternal and paternal DNA is expressed.
