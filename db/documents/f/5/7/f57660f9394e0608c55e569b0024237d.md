Adequate pain medication is appropriate, as patients often report mild harvest and donor site pain for 1 to 2 days postoperatively. To minimize edema and ecchymosis, the patient may intermittently ice the affected areas for 48 hours, sleep with their head elevated for one week, and avoid vigorous activity for two weeks. The patient may be given a low-dose corticosteroid taper to help lessen bruising and swelling as well. Post-operative antibiotics are often prescribed as well to mitigate infection, though data supporting its routine use is limited. To promote wound healing, the patient is instructed to keep the affected areas moist by routine application of an emollient for the first several days. Also, a small spray bottle may be used to gently apply moisture to the area, which also helps prevent scabbing. Regular shampooing may resume on postoperative day 2, though caution is advised against scratching/itching the scalp, and to avoid direct water contact from a high-pressure faucet or showerhead. Patients are asked to return at seven days for suture removal (if applicable) and are followed closely over the following months until the maturation of the implanted grafts (around 6 to 12 months) occurs.Â  Photographic documentation should occur at around 6 to 12 months postoperatively. Topical minoxidil, oral finasteride, and low-level light therapy may be continued throughout the perioperative period and indefinitely after that to help maximize results.
