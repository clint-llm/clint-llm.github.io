Anoxic brain injury can be devastatingÂ after prolonged cerebral hypoxia; further, it is often challenging to predict the prognosis based on clinical findings.

Consequently, examiners must ensure that the patient is normothermic and that sedating medications have been held for an adequate period before performing a neurological assessment for prognostic purposes. It has long been appreciated that patients who demonstrate one or more absent brainstem reflexes in the hours immediately following an arrest can often be observed to improve with time. For that reason, it was often recommended to delay prognostication until 72 hours after the arrest; in particular, the absence of corneal and/or pupillary reflexes at 72 hours has been established as a reliable sign of poor neurological outcome. The motor exam at 72 hours has also been noted to correlate with prognosis in non-hypothermic patients. Specifically, an absent or extensor response to central pain at 72 hours has a high positive predictive value for poor outcomes. Some investigators have attempted to validate these findings in the era of therapeutic hypothermia. In one such study, bilateral absence of pupillary light reflexes was found to be a reliable indicator of poor neurological outcome in patients treated with hypothermia; however, the authors note that it is necessary to exclude surgical pupils and pre-existing pupillary abnormalities. Unfortunately, corneal reflexes and motor examination appear to be somewhat less reliable.

In addition to clinical assessment, electrophysiological studies have been shown to be useful for prognostication. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) can be useful because they can typically be evaluated even in the setting of hypothermia and/or moderate sedation. Specifically, bilaterally absent cortical N20 responses following median nerve stimulation SSEPs are highly specific for poor prognosis. It is important to note that the absence of cortical responses is unreliable unless peripheral and spinal responses are preserved. If this is not the case, the possibility of a confounding spine or peripheral nerve process cannot be excluded. Unfortunately, SSEPs are not very sensitive, as this finding is present in a relatively low percentage of patients who go on to have poor outcomes. In contrast, electroencephalography (EEG) can be valuable for identifying patients who may be more likely to recover. EEG monitoring is often used in patients with anoxic brain injury to identify status epilepticus. Postanoxic status epilepticus is associated with an increased likelihood of a poor neurological outcome, but increasing evidence suggests that this entity may respond to aggressive antiepileptic therapy. In addition, investigators have identified several EEG patterns with prognostic implications. Malignant patterns such as generalized suppression, alpha coma, and burst suppression not attributable to medication effect have been demonstrated to correlate with poor outcomes. Conversely, reactive and continuous EEG patterns have been shown to predict awakening from a coma.

The value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in survivors after cardiac arrest has been investigated thoroughly. The literature describes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in anoxic brain injury in four phases: an acute phase which lasts 24 hours after anoxia or hypoxia; an early subacute phase lasting from one to thirteen days, a late subacute phase lasting from fourteen to twenty days; and a chronic phase, starting at day twenty-one. MRI will show swelling, a hyper signal of basal ganglia, delayed white matter degeneration, cortical laminar necrosis, and atrophy occurring in succession.

Although there is considerable interest in identifying serum biomarkers for prognostication in the setting of brain injury, these have not been widely adopted in practice. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) has been evaluated extensively for this purpose, and levels > 33 micrograms/liter have been correlated with poor prognosis.
