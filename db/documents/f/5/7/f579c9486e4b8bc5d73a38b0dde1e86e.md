IVUS is an important adjunctive tool in the cardiac catheterization laboratory that can be useful to determine plaque morphology and guide percutaneous coronary interventions.  Image interpretation is an important skill with IVUS use to optimize clinical outcomes. The use of IVUS has been associated with improved clinical outcomes in both an all-comers population and those with long lesions undergoing stent implantation (28 mm stent implanted).

To provide the best outcome, interprofessional team involvement is necessary. The nurse needs to be well aware of the procedure and complications and assist the interventional cardiologist or vascular surgeon as they manipulate the catheter inside of the body. Prior to the procedure, the nurse should assist with pre-operative screen for allergies or injuries that may hinder the performance of the procedure. If there is a concern, the should report back to the clinician. Often the nurse will need to assist with position and preparation of the patient. The nurse should also monitor vital signs and the ECG during the procedure and should alert the surgeon if there are changes in vitals signs or an untoward change in the cardiac monitor. Always quickly reporting to the surgeon if there is a concern. Post-procedure the nurse must monitor for signs of bleeding or infection. Again, quickly informing the surgeon if there is a concern. The best outcomes will be achieved if an interprofessional approach is taken in regards to the performance of this procedure. [Level V]
