The recommended dose for Parkinson disease-associated psychosis is 34 mg orally once daily. Pimavanserin is only available for oral administration. Patients may take pimavanserin with or without food. Titration is not required. It is only available as an immediate-release formulation. No significant drug interactions with carbidopa/levodopa have been observed, and therefore, no dosage adjustments are necessary.

As mentioned above, pimavanserin undergoes significant hepatic metabolization by CYP450 3A4 and 3A5. Thus, the recommendation is to reduce when co-administered with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (i.e., itraconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir) pimavanserin dose by 50%. In contrast, when given in the presence of a strong CYP450 34A and 3A5 inducer (for example, rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John’s wort), providers should monitor for reduced efficacy and increase the pimavanserin dose as needed.

Pimavanserin requires no renal dosing adjustment, although clinicians should exercise caution for patients with a creatinine clearance below 30. Peritoneal and hemodialysis dosing are undefined.

Pimavanserin has no pediatric dosing or indications.
