The few histological studies regarding osteitis pubis come from bone and cartilage samples taken during surgical procedures on athletes with osteitis pubis. Verrall et al. performed a study in which they took samples of pubic rami from Australian rugby players with pubic bone stress injuries. The samples, surprisingly, revealed the lack of inflammatory cells or signs of osteonecrosis. However, the samples did demonstrate woven immature bone with neovascularization, osteoblasts, and fibroblasts consistent with a bony stress response.
