Patients affected with lymphomatoid papulosis are at risk of developing another hematological disorder in 5% to 20% of the cases, mainly mycosis fungoides, erythrodermic T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, or large-cell CD30+ lymphoma. Therefore, cooperation between dermatologists and hematologist-oncologists is necessary to improve patient-centered care.

Furthermore, histologically, the distinction may be impossible between lymphomatoid papulosis type B and mycosis fungoides or between lymphomatoid papulosis type C and CD30 anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Without a proper history, the pathologist may be misled. Therefore, the diagnosis should be based on the anatomo-clinical confrontation privileging the clinical aspect.
