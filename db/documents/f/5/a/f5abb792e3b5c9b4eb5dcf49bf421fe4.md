Technical considerations for fluoroscopic guided injections are described below. 25 gauge needle is superior because of the small joint space. Using sterile technique under fluoroscopy, use the needle alone to start and superimpose it over the joint to guide entry point, then direct needle under X-ray guidance into the joint space desired. This provides evidence that the injection is in the correct area. The clinician uses a combination of the imaging with a tactile feel to guide the needle. The clinician will often feel the hard stop of bone, then pull back, readjust and then feel the resistance, then give after going through a joint capsule. The small joints, such as metatarsophalangeal joints, only hold 1 to 1.5 mL of fluid, so it is imperative to use both tactile and imaging to confirm accurate placement. Once the needle is in position, then the clinician can attach the injection and proceed with the injection. This use of the needle alone for direction allows for easier imaging and direction of the needle compared to the syringe attached to the needle. Following are some common joint-specific injection positioning and structures at risk.

One must avoid the dorsalis pedis artery with the first, second, and third TMT joint injections for the tarsometatarsal joints. These can be done with the patient supine and knee bent with the foot flat on the table, approaching from the dorsal surface of the foot. To better visualize the fourth and fifth metatarsals, have the patient lay on their side, and the foot is internally rotated, allowing better visualization of the TMT joints. The posterior, middle, and anterior subtalar joint facets can be injected by having the patient lay on their side and internally rotating the foot; the approach is from the lateral side of the foot, and one needs to be aware of the peroneal tendons. Also, be mindful that the posterior subtalar joint does not communicate with the middle and anterior facets.

To inject the metatarsophalangeal joints, position the patient supine with the knee bent and foot flat, approach from dorsal medial or lateral to avoid the extensor tendons. It is also easier if you approach from an angle and aim distal to avoid the lip of the proximal phalanx. The interphalangeal joints can be positioned the same as the MTP injection and approached from dorsal medial/lateral to avoid the extensor tendons.

The abduction pronation stress exam is a technique to evaluate the Lisfranc ligament integrity in the setting of injury with no obvious fracture or first TMT joint widening. To perform the X-ray image focused on AP of the foot, obtain a neutral X-ray, then apply an abduction and pronation stress to the forefoot while holding the hindfoot at neutral and look at the space between the first and second metatarsals for widening.

To assess for great toe plantar plate function, visualize the location and motion of the sesamoids. Have the patient positioned on their side and obtain a lateral view of the foot with the sesamoids clearly visible. On static X-ray, proximal migration of the sesamoids may be visible. To assess under fluoroscopy, take images with the great toe at neutral, then apply dorsiflexion stress to the great toe keeping the foot and first metatarsal static. The normal sesamoid function is distal migration with dorsiflexion of the great toe. When there is a plantar plate tear, the sesamoids will not move distally and either stay in place or move proximally.
