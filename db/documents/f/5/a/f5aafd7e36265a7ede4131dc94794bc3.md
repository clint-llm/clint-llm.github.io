**Contraindications to Brow Lift Surgery**

- Lagophthalmos

- More than 3-4 mm of brow height asymmetry. Because this technique raises the entire forehead as a unit, it is difficult to apply significantly more upward tension to one side compared to the other.

- History of dry-eye symptoms or previous blepharoplasty (increased risk of lagophthalmos)

- Unrealistic patient expectations. In women, the brow should be arched with its highest pointÂ between the lateral limbus and lateral canthus, and it should lie just above the supraorbital rim. However, this approach contrasts to working on men whose brows should be flatter and sit at the supraorbital rim. Nevertheless, a standardized ideal eyebrow does not exist; thus, surgeon-patient communication is essential to optimize outcomes.

- Body dysmorphic disorder

**Contraindications to Endoscopic Brow Lift Surgery**

- Excessive hairline recession (endoscopic brow lifting may raise the hairline slightly)

- Excessively curved forehead and/or frontal bossing (inhibits the passing of endoscopic instruments to the periorbita)
