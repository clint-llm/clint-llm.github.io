The presence of exposed bone characterizes BRONJ. In the absence of exposed bone, BRONJ should be differentiated from the following:

- Periodontal and periapical pathosis

- Sinusitis

- Gingivitis or mucositis

- Temporomandibular disorders

- Osteomyelitis

- Metastatic bone tumors

- Osteonecrosis induced by neuralgia

- Osteoradionecrosis

Other conditions that may present with exposed bone but are not linked to bisphosphonate use include:

- Cement osseous dysplasia with secondary sequestration

- Trauma

- Infectious osteomyelitis

- Osteonecrosis following Herpes zoster infection

- HIV-associated necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis
