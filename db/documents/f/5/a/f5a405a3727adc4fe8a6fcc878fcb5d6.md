The role of nurses in the management of patients with PAH is pivotal. Although these therapies significantly improve clinical outcomes, they are associated with adverse reactions such as flushing, headache, and hypotension. Frequent and accurate measurement of vital signs is required in patients receiving intravenous therapies to avoid severe hypotension.

Moreover, there is an increased risk of falls secondary to deconditioning, syncope, and presyncope in these patients. Additionally, patients receiving continuous I.V. infusions are at an increased risk for catheter-related bloodstream infections. Nurses play a pivotal role in monitoring the insertion sites for these catheters for potential infections.

Given the complex and progressive nature of this disease, patients require extensive education on the expected clinical course of the disease, potential adverse effects of therapies, and preventive measures to limit adverse outcomes.Â Nurses play an integral role in educating and monitoring these patients to optimize clinical outcomes.
