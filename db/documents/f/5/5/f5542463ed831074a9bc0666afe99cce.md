Contraindications to TTMPB are similar to those of other regional nerve blocks.

- Patient refusal

- Allergy to local anesthetics

- Infection at the site of injection

- Tumor at the site of injection

Additionally, caution should be taken in patients with liver dysfunction, given that local amide anesthetics are hepatically metabolized. Using a local amide anesthetic such as bupivacaine in these patients puts them at risk for local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST), which may manifest as neurologic symptoms (circumoral numbness, altered mental status, seizures) and, if severe enough, cardiac arrest and death.

Pneumothorax is a serious potential complication of the TTMPB block. As such, care should be taken when performing a TTMPB for patients with compromised pulmonary function. The development of a pneumothorax could be catastrophic for such a patient.

Lastly, while not a neuraxial technique, coagulopathy should be considered when performing a TTMPB, as some may consider it a deep nerve block in a non-compressible fascial space. If inadvertentÂ vascular damage occurs, bleeding might be challenging to control.
