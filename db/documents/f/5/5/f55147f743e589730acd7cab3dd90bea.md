Gestational pemphigoid is an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease known to be associated almost exclusively with pregnancy. In pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), it is believed that stretching of the abdominal skin damages the underlying connective tissue leads to an inflammatory process. PUPPP is more common in pregnant women with twins or triplets. Impetigo herpetiformis is believed to be a type of pustular psoriasis triggered by pregnancy. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is due to intrahepatic obstruction to bile flow occurring late in pregnancy in the absence of any hepatitis. Atopic eruption of pregnancy may occur in atopic subjects or others without atopy. The etiology is unknown. Many patients have elevated IgE.
