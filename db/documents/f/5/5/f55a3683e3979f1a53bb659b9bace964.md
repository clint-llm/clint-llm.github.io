Congenital ptosis is the presence of a droopy eyelid or eyelids since birth. The ptosis may not be immediately noticeable after birth but is usually noticeable within a few months. It can be unilateral or bilateral. Severe ptosis can cover the visual axis and lead to interference with vision development and may lead to amblyopia if not corrected. This activity describes the evaluation and management of congenital ptosis and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of congenital ptosis.
- Review the evaluation of congenital ptosis.
- Outline management options available for congenital ptosis.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance congenital ptosis and improve outcomes.
