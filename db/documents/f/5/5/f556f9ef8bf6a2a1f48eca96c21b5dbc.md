Dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) is an ocular motor disorder characterized by slow upward drifting of one eye when the patient fixates with the other eye. This can be unilateral or bilateral. The deviation may be manifest (spontaneously visible to others) or latent (only seen after a cover-uncover test). This activity describes the evaluation and management of DVD and highlights the role of the healthcare team in managing patients with this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of dissociated vertical deviation.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with dissociated vertical deviation.
- Review management options available for dissociated vertical deviation.
- Summarize conditions similar to dissociated vertical deviation and key patient counseling points.
