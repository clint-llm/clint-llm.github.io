In general, neurological symptoms often manifest weeks to months before recognition of the tumor in at least 80% of PEM cases.

Any part of the nervous system can be affected by paraneoplastic disorders:

- Single cell-type involvement eg. Cerebellar Purkinje cells

- Single area involvement eg. Limbic encephalitis

- Multi-level involvement eg. Encephalomyelitis, is the main focus of this article.

All assessments should begin with a careful history, focusing on the patient’s neurological complaints, the time-course of symptom complex onset and rate of progression, and more general questions that might suggest the presence of an oncologic process.  A family member or multiple patient contacts might need to be questioned to obtain this history in cognitively impaired patients.

In paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, there is widespread neural dysfunction, involving symptoms from at least two or more regions, such as the temporal lobes, limbic areas, brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and the autonomic nervous system. The clinical presentation therefore widely varies depending on the neural axis components affected, which can manifest as a relatively isolated syndrome, a multifocal process, or a more generalized syndrome involving widespread CNS regions.

- **Paraneoplastic Limbic Encephalitis (PLE)**which predominates in 20% of cases of PEM, affects the hippocampus, hypothalamus, and amygdala. Patients often present with cognitive impairment, personality change, short-term memory loss, mood changes, behavioral changes, and temporal seizures.

- **Paraneoplastic Brainstem Encephalitis / Rhombencephalitis**develops in around 30% of cases of PEM and can occur as an isolated clinical syndrome affecting the brainstem or more often is a part of widespread encephalomyelitis. It can present with the involvement of 1 or more cranial nerves in the pons and medulla with trismus, horizontal conjugate gaze palsy, extraocular movement deficits, opsoclonus, nystagmus, dysphagia, dysarthria, sensorineural deafness, central hypoventilation, and vertigo. Anti-Hu antibodies are more linked with the lower brainstem, while Anti-Ma2 antibodies are commonly associated with upper brainstem involvement.

- **Paraneoplastic Cerebellar Degeneration**is predominant in 15% of cases of PEM. It can be relatively isolated to the cerebellum when associated with Anti-Yo and Anti-Tr antibodies but can be associated with any of the other mentioned paraneoplastic antibodies when present as a part of PEM. Cases usually present with dizziness, closely followed by motor gait ataxia, oscillopsia, diplopia, dysphagia, and dysarthria.

- **Myelitis**can take place with PEM as well, in the form of either neuronal degeneration, inflammatory infiltrates, necrotizing myelitis, or demyelination. It is known to most commonly involve the dorsal root ganglia. Subsequently, patients show a predominant Subacute Sensory Neuronopathy (SSN) which is distinct from the common peripheral neuropathy in early involving the proximal sensory areas, usually asymmetrically and starting with the loss of vibration and proprioception, which can progress to sensory ataxia. In addition, it can also involve the anterior horn cells causing paraneoplastic motor neuron syndromes, which usually present as spastic paresis that differs from typical ALS by the involvement of other CNS areas and functions, while other times Subacute Motor Neuronopathy is seen leading to asymmetric flaccid weakness.

- **Paraneoplastic Stiff Person Syndrome**represents about 5% of all SPS cases, with tumors typically arising from breast, lung, colon, thymus, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is believed to occur through loss of GABA inhibition of the interneurons at the brainstem and spinal cord levels. It presents as progressive muscle stiffness or rigidity, mainly affecting the proximal and axial muscle groups especially of the neck and upper limbs, and is associated with muscle spasms which are exacerbated by noise, touch, or emotions.

- **Autonomic Dysfunction**occurs in 10% to 30% of cases of PEM when the pathology affects the autonomic centers and can predominate in the form of orthostatic hypotension, pupillary defects, gastroparesis, intestinal disturbances, neurogenic bladder, and impotence.

- **Paraneoplastic Neuromyelitis Optical Spectrum Disorders**(NMOSD) occurs in 4-5% of AQP4 antibody-positive cases of NMOSD and 15% of cases among the older population. Reported neoplasms associated with this syndrome include breast, lung, nasopharyngeal, genitourinary, thyroid cancers, and thymoma.

Involved CNS regions are usually detected by completing a detailed neurologic examination, focusing on regions of the CNS identified as involved by clinical history. This exam can verify the level of neurologic involvement (e.g. – cortical region(s), diencephalon, basal ganglia, cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord), Historical data on cognitive dysfunction can be tested with focused cognitive testing at the time of initial neurological exam, to address regional or more generalized cortical or subcortical encephalopathy.
