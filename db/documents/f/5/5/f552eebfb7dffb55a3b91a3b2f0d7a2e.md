The most common adverseÂ drug reactions of cyclobenzaprine are somnolence, dry mucous membranes, dizziness, and confusion. Like other cyclical antidepressants, cyclobenzaprine antagonizes the muscarinic receptors, which may produce undesired side effects such as xerostomia, ileus, tachycardia, mydriasis, confusion, urinary retention, and hallucinations. Additionally, cyclobenzaprine antagonizes the alpha1 adrenergic receptor, causing a vasodilatory effect, and may contribute further to reflex tachycardia.
