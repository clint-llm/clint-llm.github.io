ECV is best performed by an interprofessional team. The actual procedure is performed by an experienced obstetrician aided by a labor and delivery nurse.Â  This is not a benign procedure and it is recommended that the operating room be informed of the ECV procedure, in case of emergency cesarean delivery, such as nursing, operating room, and anesthesia staff. Fetal monitoring is necessary and steps to ensure safety must be paramount.
