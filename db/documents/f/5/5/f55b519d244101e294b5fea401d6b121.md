Evidence shows that the dose and duration of aflatoxin exposure significantly affect toxicology. Exposure to large doses, known as acute aflatoxicosis, can lead to critical illness and death. High-level exposure produces acute hepatic necrosis, resulting in sequelae of cirrhosis or HCC afterward. Acute liver failure manifests as fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bleeding, digestion problems, edema, malabsorption, mental changes, and coma.

Exposure to chronic sublethal doses has nutritional and immunologic effects, mainly contributing to DNA alkylation by aflatoxin B1. Irrespective of the dose, all exposures have a cumulative effect on cancer risk. The carcinogenic effect of aflatoxin metabolites is via intercalation into DNA and the alkylation of the bases by epoxide moiety. This results in mutations in the p53 gene, an essential gene in preventing cell cycle progression in instances of DNA mutations or signaling of the programmed cell death (apoptosis).

Evaluating the results of human exposure to aflatoxin requires considering various facts. Firstly, not all ingested aflatoxin is biologically significant; a proportion of consumed aflatoxin is detoxified. The relationship between DNA-relevant exposure and carcinogenesis is understood well enough to estimate the results of changing the concentration of aflatoxins in food for the risk to humans.
