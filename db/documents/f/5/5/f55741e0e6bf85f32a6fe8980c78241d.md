It is difficult to ascertain the exact prevalence of stable ischemic heart disease due to the heterogeneity of its patient population and the variable definitions that physicians use. Nonetheless, CAD remains a major public health concern nationally in many regards. An estimated 10 million adults in the United States carry the diagnosis, and despite mortality-reducing therapy, IHD was alone responsible for nearly 380,000 deaths within the United States in 2010. In that approximation, it remains the number one cause of death for male as well as female patients. Furthermore, the increasing survival with the use of modern therapies has produced an aging population where more than 20% of women and 35% of men above the age of 80 have coronary artery disease.
