- Contraindications to atenolol include sinus bradycardia, second or third-degree heart block, cardiogenic shock, heart failure, severe peripheral arterial disease, metabolic acidosis, and pheochromocytoma. It should also be avoided in patients with a history of asthma, bronchospasm, or other obstructive airway diseases unless there is no alternative. In this case, it may be given alongside a bronchodilator.

- Caution is necessary when prescribing to diabetic or thyroid patients as its effects may mask the symptoms of hypoglycemia and thyrotoxicosis - rapid withdrawal may also precipitate a thyroid storm.

- Prescribers should exercise caution during pregnancy - atenolol has been shown to cross the placental barrier and is associated with intrauterine growth restriction.

- American Academy of Pediatrics advises against using atenolol during breastfeeding due to the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia and bradycardia.

- Atenolol is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to atenolol or excipients. Cases of anaphylaxis have been reported with beta-blockers.
