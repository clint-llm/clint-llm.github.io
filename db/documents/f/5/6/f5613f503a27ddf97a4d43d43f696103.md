Factors that contribute to the development of upper airway collapse are those that affect upper airway patency. Because the upper airway is enclosed by the craniofacial skeleton, which serves as the scaffold of the upper airway, the craniofacial skeleton is one of the key determinants of upper airway patency or collapse.

Conversely, the size and compressibility of the soft tissues within the craniofacial skeleton also determine upper airway patency. Upper airway patency decreases with increased soft tissue mass within a given confined space within the craniofacial skeleton. This may be influenced by factors such as the amount of submucosal or lingual adipose tissue, as well as cervical lymphovascular tone, as well as neuromuscular influences on upper airway muscular tone.

Increased age, obesity, male gender, and craniofacial abnormalities are considered to be the primary risk factors for developing OSA. Other risk factors include smoking and a family history of OSA.
