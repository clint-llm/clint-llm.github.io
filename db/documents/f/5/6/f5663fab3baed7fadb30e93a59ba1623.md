The diagnosis and management of RETT syndrome ie very difficult. The disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team.

Currently, there is no cure for RTT, and medical management is aimed to provide symptomatic relief for patients through an interprofessional approach. Some of the medical concerns that need to be addressed in RTT patients include seizure disorders, behavioral alterations, sleep disorders, breathing irregularities, cardiac dysfunction (prolonged QT interval), gastrointestinal dysfunction and bone fractures. Approximately 60% of patients with RTT suffer from some seizure disorder.

The outlook for patients with RETT syndrome is guarded. Most have a reduced life span and a poor quality of life.
