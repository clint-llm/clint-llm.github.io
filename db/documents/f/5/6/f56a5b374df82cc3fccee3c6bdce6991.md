56,535 button battery ingestions were reported to the National Poison Data System from 1985–2009. 68.1% occurred in children who were younger than six years and 20.3% in children who were aged 6 through 19 years.

Most cases of ingestion are seen in children under the age of six, with the peak frequency occurring in children between the ages of one and three years. The majority of ingestions are unwitnessed. More than half of ingestions occur within one-half hour after removal from the device.

There has been a nearly seven-fold increase in the incidence of severe morbidity and fatalities over the last decade.  This increase is not due to a rise in the number of ingestions overall and may reflect the increased use of larger and more powerful batteries.
