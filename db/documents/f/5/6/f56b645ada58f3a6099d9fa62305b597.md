Light microscopy findings can range from normal to mesangial proliferation, endocapillary proliferation, focal or segmental necrosis, or crescents in Bowman’s space. However, the most common abnormality is mesangial hypercellularity. Because the light microscopy findings are non-specific, electron and immunofluorescent microscopy are required to confirm the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy by identifying the immune deposits, immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM), and complements (C3 being the most commonly found) associated with the disease. The immune deposits are most commonly located in the mesangial and paramesangial areas, but can also be observed in the subepithelial and subendothelial areas of the glomerular basement membrane.
