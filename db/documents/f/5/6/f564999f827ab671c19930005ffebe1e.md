**Proper Donning and Removal of PPE**

Donning of PPE

The CDC recommends that PPE be donned in the following sequence: (1) gown, (2) mask or respirator, (3) goggles or face shield, and (4) gloves.

Removal of PPE

The safe removal of PPE also follows a specific sequence that requires special attention to areas that are now considered contaminated: (1) gloves should be removed by first grasping the palm of the other hand and peeling off the first glove, keep hold of the removed glove in the gloved hand, slide the fingers of the ungloved hand under the remaining glove and peel it off over the first glove, (2) goggles or face shield should be removed by lifting from behind the head, (3) gowns should be untied and removed by pulling away from the neck and shoulders, turning the gown inside out and only touching the inside, (4) mask or respirator should be removed by reaching behind the head and grasping the bottom ties then the top ties and removing without touching the front. Alternatively, the gloves and gown may be removed at the same time by grasping the gown from the front and pulling away from the body, rolling the gown into a bundle, and removing the gloves at the same time using the inside of the gown. Hand hygiene should be performed after removal of all PPE and anytime during removal if they become contaminated.
