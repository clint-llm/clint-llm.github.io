The vertebrobasilar system has an intimate relationship with many nerves along its course. The V1 segment of the vertebral artery courses anteriorly to the inferior cervical ganglion and the sympathetic trunk at the level of C7. As V2 ascends within the transverse foramina, it is surrounded by branches of the sympathetic plexus. As V3 crosses the posterior arch of C1, it passes laterally to the suboccipital nerve. After entering the cranium, V4 courses along the medulla oblongata between the anterior nerve root of C1 and the hypoglossal nerve. The basilar artery ascends along the anteroinferior surface of the pons and terminally gives off the superior cerebellar artery and posterior cerebral artery withÂ the sixth cranial nerve traversing between them.
