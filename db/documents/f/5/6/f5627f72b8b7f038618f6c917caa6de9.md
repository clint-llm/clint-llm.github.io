There are no absolute contraindications in performing a splenectomy. However, there are special considerations that must be taken into account prior to performing a splenectomy, especially in patients with splenomegaly or portal vein hypertension.

When the spleen exceeds anywhere from 1000Â to 2000 grams, laparoscopic splenectomy becomes difficult due to the limited working space in performing dissection around the surrounding structures and even extracting the specimen from the abdomen. Studies have shown longer operative times, more blood loss, and more frequent conversion to open for those with splenomegaly compared to the normal-sized spleen.

Patients with portal hypertension are at risk of hemorrhaging due to the presence of esophagogastric varices along with thrombocytopenia. Studies have shown longer operative times, more blood loss, and more frequent conversion to open for these individuals.
