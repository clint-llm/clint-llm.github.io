Epidemiology of fever of unknown origin (FUO) varies based onÂ etiology of fever, age group, geography, environmental exposure, and immune/HIV status. In developing countries, an infectious etiology of FUO is most prevalent whereas, in developed countries, FUO is likely due to non-infectious inflammatory disease.
