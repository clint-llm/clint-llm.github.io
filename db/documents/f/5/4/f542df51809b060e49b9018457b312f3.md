Nerve agent toxicity is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes nurses and respiratory therapists. Because these agents can be inhaled and absorbed via the skin, minimum interaction with the patient is the key. In addition, healthcare workers should wear personal protective equipment to prevent self-poisoning.

The outcomes for patients poisoned with nerve agents is guarded and depends on the dose and time to treatment.
