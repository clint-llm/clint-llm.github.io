The “ordinary variant” of smallpox was actually the best-case scenario and held a case fatality rate of 30 percent.

Younger, unluckier patients, however, might develop a malignant variant, also known as flatpox. This variant had unique maculoid lesions as opposed to vesicular lesions, these are soft and velvety to the touch. And the prodromic symptoms are particularly harsh with sustained hyperpyrexia.

Older or pregnant patients could develop a hemorrhagic variant, also known as hemorrhagic smallpox. Here the development of sudden and acute thrombocytopenia could be reminiscent of many other hemorrhagic viral syndromes; but compounded by depleted coagulation factors, fluid third spacing, bleeding, and hypotension. Liver and concomitant bone marrow failure advance the hemodynamic instability quite synergistically.

Either variant was almost universally fatal, holding what could be considered predominantly grim outcomes.

No other Poxviridae infection in humans comes even close to attaining such a morbid prognosis. With much milder disease seen in vaccinia, cowpox, monkeypox, other orthopox, and Parapoxviridae, case fatality rates rarely exceed 5 to 10 percent.
