Skin grafts consist of fully detached pieces of skin taken from one anatomic site and placed in a wound elsewhere. Full-thickness skin grafts include the full thickness of both the epidermis and dermis. This activity describes and explains the role of the surgeon and nursing assistants in performing this procedure and identifying situations in which this represents an appropriate option in re-establishing function and appearance in patients who have undergone excisional surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, skin and wound characteristics, indications, and contraindications of full-thickness skin graft technique.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to performing full-thickness skin grafting.
- Outline the evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of full-thickness skin grafts.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing coordination and communication to advance surgical outcomes.
