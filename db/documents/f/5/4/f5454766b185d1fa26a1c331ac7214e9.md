**Corneal Injury**

Fragile and easily damaged, the corneal epithelium is richly innervated, and therefore, very painful when an injury occurs. The epithelium does regenerate quickly, with most abrasions healing within 24 to 48 hours.

**Corneal Healing**

Corneal healing is via cellular migration, proliferation, and differentiation, with extracellular matrix remodeling. The corneal epithelium regenerates via limbal stem cells and remodeling of the basement membrane. The response of healing to a corneal abrasion is dependent on the defect size and depth. Cellular proliferation and migration are necessary to heal larger abrasions. Limbal stem cells migrate and differentiate to cover the defect with a single layer of epithelial cells, which "slide" over the wound. Proliferation from the basal layer restores the normal thickness of the epithelium and the formation of normal adhesions can take up to 6 weeks.
