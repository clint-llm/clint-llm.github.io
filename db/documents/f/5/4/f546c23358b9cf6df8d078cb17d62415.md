Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that results in chronic inflammation and damage of more than one organ. It is diagnosed clinically and serologically with the presence of autoantibodies. "Lupus" is a Latin term meaning "wolf," since one of the hallmark facial SLE rashes is similar to the bitemark of a wolf. In 400 BC, the "father of medicine," Hippocrates, was the first to document a case of lupus. From 1700 to 1800s, it was debated whether lupus was associated with tuberculosis or syphilis. Lupus evolved from being viewed as solely a dermatologic manifestation into an all-inclusive multisystemic disease.

One common and dire manifestation that should be looked for in SLE is the involvement of the kidneys, known as lupus nephritis (LN). Evaluating kidney function in patients suffering from SLE is important as timely detection and management of renal impairment can greatly improve renal outcomes. Lupus nephritis typically occurs three years after and usually within 5 years of the onset of SLE. Histological evidence of lupus nephritis is present in most patients with SLE, even in those who do not clinically manifest renal disease. Monitoring for the development of lupus nephritis is done with serial creatinine, urine albumin-to-creatine ratio, and urinalysis. This helps in gauging a rise in serum creatinine value from the baseline as well as for the presence of proteinuria that is commonly observed with lupus nephritis. Since lupus nephritis carries a high risk for increased morbidity, treatment plays an important role in preventing progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).

The primary goal of treatment in lupus nephritis is the normalization of the kidney function or, at least, the prevention of progressive decline of kidney function. There is variability in the treatment options depending on the underlying pathologic lesion.
