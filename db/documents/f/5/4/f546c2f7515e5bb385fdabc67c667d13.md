The presentation of pulmonary hypoplasia encompasses a broad spectrum that is dependent upon the extent of hypoplasia, as well as other abnormalities associated with the underlying cause. In most cases, it is lethal. Sub-lethal cases present in early infancy as mild to severe respiratory insufficiency, depending on the extent of involvement. Prenatal care may illustrate decreased fetal movement, premature rupture of membranes fluid, and oligohydramnios. The severe cases may be associated with pulmonary hypertension with persistent fetal circulation, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or alveolar hemorrhage. The mild forms of pulmonary hypoplasia remain undiagnosed until adulthood when they present as an incidental finding on chest radiograph or as recurrent respiratory infections. Isolated exercise desaturation may sometimes be the only clinical feature.

In cases of unilateral hypoplasia, there is an asymmetric appearance of the thoracic cage with restricted chest wall expansion and reduced breath sounds on the affected side. There is herniation of contralateral organs to the affected hemithorax. Bilateral pulmonary hypoplasia typically presents with bell-shaped thoracic cage deformity. The majority of these patients are often tachypneic and in respiratory distress with a shallow breathing pattern. Secondary pulmonary hypoplasia may have associated with congenital anomalies, and sometimes the anomaly is the index for suspicion of pulmonary hypoplasia.

There may be coexisting defects in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and skeletal system. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias present with a scaphoid abdomen and respiratory insufficiency at birth. There are associated congenital heart defects, neural tube defects, or renal anomalies along with the hernia. Potter syndrome presents with many characteristic physical findings at birth. The non-renal features of Potter syndrome, including facial abnormalities, hypertelorism, large floppy ears, flat nose, spade-like hands, and flexion contractures, are seen in conjunction with hypoplastic lungs due to oligohydramnios.
