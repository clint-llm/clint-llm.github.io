There are many hypotheses of which can contribute to the pain response following craniotomy. One of the more straightforward mechanisms is the direct trauma from the surgery itself to the soft tissue, musculature, bone, or meninges. Other potential causes include nerve injury, debris from drilling bone irritating the internal structures and meninges, muscle adherence to the dura mater, formation of neuroma in the surgical scar, central sensitization, and aberrant nerve regeneration.

Risk factors for PCH may include age, gender, and the previous history of headaches, all of which have been disputed and remain in question. However, neurosurgical duration of greater than 4 hours has been associated with a higher prevalence of PCH. Some studies suggest that incidence increases with specific surgical approaches, for example, craniectomies have a higher incidence than craniotomies or cranioplasties, and the suboccipital approach has a higher incidence than the translabyrinthine approach.

Although psychiatric disorders are not risk factors for PCH, the presence of uncontrolled anxiety or depression may increase the intensity and frequency of PCH, while worsening quality of life.
