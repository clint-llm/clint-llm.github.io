Balint syndrome, as described initially, is a rare disorder associated with difficulties in visual and spatial coordination and is characterized by the three cardinal features:

- Optic ataxia

- Oculomotor apraxia

- Simultagnosia

**Optic ataxia**is the lack of coordination between visual input and hand movements. For example, the patients can accurately touch their own body voluntarily, but when given a visually guided task, they are unable to complete it. However, once provided proprioceptive or auditory cues to reach for a target object, they can perform the task smoothly. Theories are that this deficit may arise due to damage to the superior parietal lobule, which is responsible for coordination between visual input and hand movements.

**Oculomotor apraxia**is the inability to voluntarily shift gaze despite the intact function of extraocular muscles. Although described initially in patients with bilateral parietal lesions, later studies have shown that isolated lesions of frontal eye fields can also cause this deficit.

**Simultagnosia**is the lack of ability to perceive more than a single object at a time. For example, when provided with a picture of a forest with trees, they are unable to see the forest, although they can see each individual tree. Because of their attentional visual deficit, they can appear to be functionally blind and will have difficulty reading and counting because these activities require viewing more than one object at a time. It further classifies as dorsal and ventral types. In the dorsal variant, the lesion is postulated to be in the bilateral parietal lobes, and the patient is often unable to see more than one object at a time. In the ventral type, the lesion is postulated to be in the left inferior occipitotemporal lobe, and the patient has a slower visual processing speed and is unable to identify individual parts of a multi-part object.

The three defining features of Balint syndrome involve a lack of coordination between visual inputs and motor outputs, which causes an inability to use visual information to guide the patient’s hands or eyes. Patients with this syndrome have normal visual acuity, do not have paralysis of extraocular movement, and can name colors and objects.
