**Anatomy**

The ovaries are the female gonads responsible for the production of the majority of a femaleâ€™s sex hormones and ovulation. In the infant and young child, ovaries are located intra-abdominally (around T 10) and are less than 2 ccs.

**Blood Supply**

Blood supply is primarily through the ovarian artery, which runs through the infundibulopelvic ligament (i.e., IP ligament or suspensory ligament of the ovary); however, there are anastomoses with the ovarian branch of the uterine artery through the utero-ovarian ligament.

**Lymphatics**

There are three lymphatic drainage pathways for the ovary. The two most common routes are through the IP ligament to the paraaortic lymph nodes and the ovarian ligament to the pelvic lymph nodes (internal iliac lymph nodes, external iliac lymph nodes, and obturator nodes).

**Histology**

Histologically, ovaries have a medulla, cortex, and mesothelium. The inner medulla is comprised of ovarian stroma with an array of spindle-shaped fibroblast-derived cells and their collagen matrix, as well as other active cell lines, including smooth muscle cells and luteinized stromal cells.
