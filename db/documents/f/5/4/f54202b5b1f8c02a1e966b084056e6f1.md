Doxazosin is a quinazoline derivative that acts as a competitive alpha1-antagonist at the post-synaptic receptor.

**In Hypertension**

- Doxazosin competitively inhibits post-synaptic alpha1-adrenergic receptors causing vasodilation of arterioles and veins, which results in decreased total peripheral resistance and blood pressure.

**In Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia**

- Symptoms of BPH are caused by mechanical or dynamic obstruction of urine flow through the urethra. Mechanical obstruction is mostly due to prostate size. Dynamic obstruction is associated with an increase in smooth muscle tone at the neck of the bladder and the prostate. Doxazosin works by blocking alpha1 receptors, thereby decreasing urethral resistance and improving urine flow.
