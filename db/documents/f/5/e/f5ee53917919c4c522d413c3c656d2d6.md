Physicians primarily diagnoseÂ patients with a history and physical examination. Frequent measurements of temperature are recommended. Electrolytes and lactic acid should be obtained in patients in which MAOI toxicity is suspected. Salicylate, acetaminophen and alcohol levels should be obtained in any patient in which intentional overdose is suspected as should a pregnancy test in any woman of child bearing age. MAOI levels are not clinically useful. Radiologic tests are not useful for the evaluation of MAOI toxicity.
