The pathophysiology of asthma involves the infiltration of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes into the airway, activation of mast cells, and damage to the epithelial cells. These inflammatory responses lead to the classic features of airway swelling, increased mucus production, and bronchial muscle dysfunction, which produce airway flow limitation and asthma symptoms.Â Remodeling, a term used to describe persistent changes in the airway structure, can occur, ultimately leading to fibrosis, mucus hypersecretion, epithelial cell injury, smooth muscle hypertrophy, and angiogenesis.
