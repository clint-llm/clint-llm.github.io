Ixazomib is currently the only oral proteasome inhibitor being used in treating multiple myeloma, so all interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists, should be aware of this drug, its indication, dosing, adverse event profile, potential drug-drug interactions, and requisite monitoring. Due to increasing use and the many adverse effects of ixazomib, there needs to be diligent patient monitoring by the entire interprofessional team, irrespective of their specific discipline. It is crucial to remember to monitor patients' liver function tests as well as platelet and neutrophil count. The healthcare team should coordinate their activities and share information for patients on ixazomib if they are experiencing any rashes, feeling unwell, diarrhea, and other possible adverse reactions that dose modifications or other therapeutic alterations can be made in time. This approach will permit patients to carry on with their triple therapy that includes dexamethasone and lenalidomide and optimize outcomes. [Level 5]
