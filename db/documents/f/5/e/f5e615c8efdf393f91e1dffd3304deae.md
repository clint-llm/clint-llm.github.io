Simulation-based medical education reduces risk to patients and trainees, improves learnersâ€™ confidence and competence, increases patient safety, and leads to reduced future health care costs. A reliable healthcare system should have a firm commitment to a culture of safety and leadership committed to continual process improvement. Effective QI processes require interdisciplinary team preparedness, with simulation serving as an ideal tool so that members can learn to prevent adverse events, or expeditiously manage them after they occur. A common area of focus for QI relates to communication errors during the handoff between teams or during a shift change. Simulation has successfully been used to prepare for effective handoff, and to diminish hierarchy-related medical errors.

Simulation is not used as a replacement for didactic or clinical learning but as an important adjunct. The aviation and aerospace industries have utilized simulation for decades, and it also frequently works in high-risk professions, including the military, nuclear power plants, business, and medicine. Experiential learning is defined as an active process whereby a trainee constructs knowledge by linking novel information with previous understanding.
