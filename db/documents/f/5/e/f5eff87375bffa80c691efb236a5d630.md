Nurses, pharmacists, and providers are typically responsible for providing patients with immunizations and monitoring compliance. Often patients and the patient's parents are not the only ones responsible for poor vaccination compliance. Primary care providers, nurses, and pharmacists also sometimes overlook preventive measures, as they are focused on appointments regarding specific illnesses or symptoms or the need to fill prescriptions. Provider recall and reminder systems have also been created and also have shown improvement in vaccination compliance. The team needs to work together to ensure the community and individuals are protected by appropriateÂ immunization. [Level V]
