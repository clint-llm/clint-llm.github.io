The wrist is one of the most complex joints in the human body, allowing for stability during movement in all three cardinal planes of the human body. Categorically considered a hinge joint like the elbow, the wrist has additional planes of movement and rotation thanks to robust anatomy. Made up of eight carpal bones, the radius, ulna, and five metacarpals, the number of articulations and degrees of motion are quite extensive.

Trauma or other pathology, including degeneration, to any of these structures, can cause a wide range of pain and dysfunction that may not be easily diagnosed due to the inherent anatomic complexity. Perhaps it is no coincidence that the first human radiograph taken in 1895 by William Roentgen was that of the hand and wrist, though far from diagnostic in such primitive form.
