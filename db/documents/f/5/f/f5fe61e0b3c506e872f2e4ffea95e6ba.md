The optimum result after decortication surgery is very much dependent upon the underlying lung condition. The duration of the fibrothorax does not predict the outcome. In patients with extensive parenchymal lung disease, there may not be a significant improvement in the vital capacity and on the contrary may decrease further. Thereby judicious selection of patients with significant pleural fibrosis and relatively well-preserved underlying lung parenchyma (whose quality of life is limited by exertional dyspnea) is necessary to have a meaningful outcome.
