**Imaging**

A CAC score is collected via CCT by 3 mm axial slices confined to the cardiac region. The images are synchronized to an electrocardiogram (ECG) R-R interval, typically collected in late/mid diastole. Significant calcification is defined as at least 1 mm of hyperattenuation of the coronary artery wall with either greater than or equal to 3 pixels or greater than 130 Hounsfield units (HU).

**Pharmacology**

A beta-blocker will be administered before scanning to lower heart rate and attempt to normalize any arrhythmia. Contraindications include severe asthma, cocaine abuse, symptomatic bradycardia, AV block.

Immediately before capturing images, a sub-lingual nitrate will be administered to vasodilate the coronaries for optimal imaging quality. Contraindications include the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors within 24 hours.
