The thoracodorsal nerve is significant for its use in a variety of nerve reconstruction procedures, as well as its innervation of the latissimus dorsi muscle that

When considering the harvesting of C7, the upper and lower trunks of the brachial plexus have less propensity to contribute to the thoracodorsal nerve and may be safest to use to avoid injury to the thoracodorsal nerve.

The lateral branch of the thoracodorsal nerve is used in nerve graft reconstruction surgery for injuries to the facial, musculocutaneous, accessory, and axillary nerves. The thoracodorsal nerve is also used in surgeries to reinnervate the triceps muscle and restore elbow flexion.

In breast reconstructive surgery the latissimus dorsi muscle may be used as a flap to cover an implant or create breast volume. Complications of latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap techniques for breast reconstruction include weakening of the shoulder, scarring, and undesired movement of the reconstructed breast. There is no solid consensus regarding the decision to transect or preserve the thoracodorsal nerve or leave it intact.

The latissimus dorsi flap may also be useful in neophalloplasty procedures in surgeries for gender affirmation and repair of congenital abnormalities and penile trauma.
