The initial assessment of patients with an accidental or intentional overdose should include a comprehensive history whenever possible, stabilization of the patient's condition, a thorough physical examination with close attention to airway, breathing, and circulation. Acute iodine poisoning can result in the burning of the mouth, fever, nausea, and vomiting. Vital signs and mental status require continuous monitoring. Decontamination should be implemented when appropriate. Consultation with a poison control center may prove helpful when managing overdoses. If history is limited or unavailable from the patient, it is essential to obtain as much information as possible from bystanders, family, and/or EMS.  It can be useful to remember the "Five W's" when taking a history: who, what, when, where, and why. Timing, quantity, and type of ingestion are of crucial importance.
