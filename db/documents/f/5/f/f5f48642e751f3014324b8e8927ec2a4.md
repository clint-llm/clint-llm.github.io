Gonadotroph cells in the anterior pituitary gland produce luteinizing hormone. Gonadotroph cells have large round cell bodies with prominent Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum. These cells are diffusely spread out and comprise around 10 to 15% of the functional anterior pituitary cell mass. These cells do not react well with acid or basic stains and appear either basophilic or chromophobic under the microscope

LH and FSH are made from similar genes and thus have similar properties. They are both glycoproteins made up of an alpha and beta subunit. The alpha subunit is the same between the two hormones, and the beta subunit of each is different and gives each hormone its biological specificity
