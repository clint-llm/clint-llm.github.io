Indications for laser scar revision include atrophic, hypertrophic, and keloid scars in patients who desire an improvement in scar appearance and texture.

Hypertrophic scars are red or pink, firm, raised scars that remain within the border of the initial injury. They form within the first month after the initial injury and may regress over time.
