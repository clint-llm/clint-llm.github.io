The neoadjuvant first approach in resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma is implemented more and more frequently at high-volume centers nationwide and internationally. The rationale behind the neoadjuvant first approach is that the patient is in the best shape to receive chemotherapy and at best odds of completing chemotherapy for 4-6 months. In addition, tissue is thought to be still well-oxygenated having not gone through a large procedure such as the Whipple. Many patients do not complete or even start adjuvant chemotherapy after surgical resection, thereby decreasing their survival.

SWOG 1501 Trial recently evaluated neoadjuvant treatment first approach in resectable pancreatic cancer with disappointing results. Only approximately 73% went on to have a resection. Survival rates were comparable to those of adjuvant trials
