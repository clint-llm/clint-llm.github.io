**"External Structures of the Eye":**

1. Conjunctiva

- The conjunctiva lines the inner part of the eyelids.

- The tarsal plate lies beneath the conjunctiva and contains meibomian glands, which secrete an oily substance to decrease the evaporation of the tear film.

2. Tear film: The tear film consists of aqueous, mucus, and oily secretions.

3. Accessory glands: Apocrine glands of Moll, meibomian glands, lacrimal glands.

4. Muscles: Orbicularis oculi, levator palpebrae superioris, superior tarsal muscle.

5. Eyelid: The eyelid, likewise known as the cover of the eye, a mobile layer made up of skin and also muscular tissue and also covers the eyeball.

**"Internal Structures of the Eye":**The innermost structures of the eye are organized in the three layers as follows

**(A)-"Outermost Layer: Sclera and Cornea":**

1. "The sclera (white of the eye)"

- The sclera is dense connective tissue made of mainly type 1 collagen fibers, oriented in different directions. The lack of parallel orientation of collagen fibers gives the sclera its white appearance, as opposed to the transparent nature of the cornea. However, the collagen of the sclera and cornea are continuous.

- The four layers of the sclera from external to internal are episclera, stroma, lamina fusca, endothelium.

- The episclera is the external surface of the sclera. It is connected to the Tenon capsule by thin collagen fibers. At the corneoscleral junction, also known as the limbus, the Tenon capsule contacts stroma of the conjunctiva.

2. "Cornea (transparent front layer of the eye)":

- Consists of type I collagen fibers oriented in a uniform parallel direction to maintain transparency

- Consists of five layers: epithelium (non-keratinized, stratified squamous epithelium), Bowman layer, stroma (also called substantia propria), Descemet’s membrane, corneal endothelium.

- Corneal epithelium: fast growing, regenerating multicellular layer which interacts directly with the tear film.

- Bowman layer: This is a layer of subepithelial basement membrane protecting the underlying stroma. It is composed of type 1 collagen, laminin, and several other heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

- Stroma

- Descemet’s membrane

- Corneal endothelium

**(B)- "Middle Layer: Uvea (Iris, Ciliary Body, Choroid)":**

1. "Iris":

- Consists of (1) stromal layer with pigmented, fibrovascular tissue and (2) pigmented epithelial cells beneath the stroma

- The sphincter pupillae and dilator pupillae muscles connect to the stroma

- The pigmented layer of cells blocks rays of light and ensures that light must move through the pupil to reach the retina

- The angle formed by the iris and cornea contains connective tissue with endothelial channels called the trabecular meshwork, which drains aqueous humor in the anterior chamber into the venous canal of Schlemm

2. "Ciliary Body": The tissue that divides the posterior chamber and vitreous body

- Consists of the ciliary muscle and the ciliary epithelium

- The ciliary muscle, via the lens zonules, controls the structure of the lens, which is vital for accommodation. Zonules are connective tissue fibers that connect the ciliary muscle and lens.

- The ciliary epithelium produces aqueous humor which fills the anterior compartment of the eye.

3. "Choroid":

- Consists of a dense network of blood vessels supplying nourishment to structures of the eye, housed in loose connective tissue.

- The choriocapillary layer is located in the innermost part of the choroid and supplies the retina

- The Bruch membrane is an extracellular matrix layer situated between the retina and choroid and has significance in age-related macular degeneration, where an accumulation of lipid deposits prevent diffusion of nutrients to the retina.

**(C)- "Innermost layer: Lens, Vitreous, Retina":**

1. Lens: separates the aqueous and vitreous chambers

- Consists of an outer capsule, a middle layer called cortex, and an inner layer called the nucleus.

- The capsule is the basement membrane of the lens epithelium which lies below

- New lens cells differentiate from the lens epithelium and are incorporated peripherally, pushing older lens cells towards the middle.

2. Vitreous: a jelly-like space made of type II collagen separating the retina and the lens

3. Retina: nervous tissue of the eye where photons of light convert to neurochemical energy via action potentials

Moreover, the retina itself is divided into various layers as follows

Retinal pigment epithelium: made of cuboidal cells containing melanin which absorbs light. These cells also establish a blood-retina barrier through tight junctions.

"Rod and cone cells": the layer of cells with photoreceptors and glial cells. Rods are located peripherally and are more sensitive to light and motion than cones. Cones have higher visual acuity and specificity for color vision.

- "Outer limiting membrane": a layer of Muller cells and rod/cone junctions which serves to separate the photosensitive regions of the retina from the areas that transmit the electrical signals.

- "Outer nuclear layer": This layer consists of nuclei of rod and cone cells.

- "Outer plexiform layer": This layer contains synaptic processes of rod and cone cells.

- "Inner nuclear layer': This layer contains the cell body of glial, amacrine, bipolar, and horizontal cells

- "Inner plexiform layer": This layer relays information from cells of the inner nuclear layer. Thus, this layer has axons of amacrine, bipolar, and glial cells and dendrites of retinal ganglion cells.

- "Ganglion cell layer": This layer contains nuclei of retinal ganglion cells.

- "Nerve fiber layer": This layer contains axons of retinal ganglion cells and the astroglia which support them. Collectively, these axons constitute the optic nerve.

- "Internal limiting membrane": A thin layer of Muller glial cells and basement membrane which demarcates the vitreous anteriorly from the retina posteriorly.
