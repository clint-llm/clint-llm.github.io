Reactive perforating collagenosis lesions are commonly self-limited and rarely problematic. The mainstay of treatment is avoiding trauma to decrease risk factors for acquiring reactive perforating collagenosis lesions. Treatment is also aimed at controlling pruritus with topical corticosteroids, emollients, and systemic antihistamines. The use of keratolytics, topical and oral retinoids, phototherapy, liquid nitrogen, methotrexate, and allopurinol have been reported without much improvement of the lesions. No randomized controlled trials have evaluated the treatments for reactive perforating collagenosis, and all treatment suggestions are the result of case reports. It appears that treatment is patient-specific and can vary with the degree of severity of the lesions. Most lesions will regress spontaneously in six to eight weeks with hypopigmentation, scarring, or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Unfortunately, most patients will have a relapsing and remitting course of lesions throughout their life.
