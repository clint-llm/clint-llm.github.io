Lymphoma of the kidney may be primary or secondary, but in both cases making a diagnosis is not easy. The disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the pathologist, radiologist, urologist, oncologist, radiation specialist and a team of specialty nurses. To differentiate lymphoma from other renal cancers usually requires a biopsy. Once diagnosed, the treatment is chemotherapy plus radiation. The prognosis of these patients depend on whether the lymphoma is primary or secondary. With advances in treatment, most patients have improved survival but complications of therapy often can be life-threatening.
