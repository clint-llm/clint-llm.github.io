Given its propensity to cause immune-mediated adverse reactions, the clinical use of atezolizumab requires an interprofessional team approach of healthcare professionals, including clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists. Clinicians prescribing this drug should educate their patients about the immediate and long-term adverse reactions. The clinical pharmacist should educate the nurse administering the drug infusion to the patients about the mechanism of action, recommended doses, and infusion-related adverse reactions of atezolizumab. Laboratory tests must be performed and reviewed before and during treatment with atezolizumab. This interprofessional approach will yield optimal therapeutic results. [Level 5]

There should be close communication between the ordering physician, the pharmacist, and the nurse about any infusion-related reactions or laboratory abnormalities related to the drug. Signs and symptoms of immune-mediated adverse reactions during treatment or long after discontinuation of atezolizumab should be monitored, and appropriate clinical investigations must be performed to rule out other etiologies. Detailed prescribing information for important dose management information specific to adverse reactions should be available for review at all times. Applicable clinical specialties must be promptly consulted. Such a holistic approach would lead to timely identification and management of this drug's potential side effects, resulting in improved outcomes.
