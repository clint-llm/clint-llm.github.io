Patients with documented thyroid conditions should receive education regarding the association of the Jod-Basedow syndrome with ICM. If they require contrast-enhanced imaging in the future, they need to communicate the previous problems and report their potential risk of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism to the ordering provider. Together with the provider, a decision will need to be made about the necessity of the test. If the test is deemed necessary, the provider may consider treating the patient prophylactically with an anti-thyroid medication, such as methimazole, or with a beta-blocker. The clinicians should also perform a thorough medication review before ordering ICM, as many supplements and medications may contain significant amounts of iodine. If the treatment history is significant for supplemental iodine, it may be necessary to adjust the patient's medication regimen in anticipation of ICM use to minimize the risk of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism.
