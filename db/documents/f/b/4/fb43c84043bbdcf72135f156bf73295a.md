All patients of ectopia lentis who have undergone surgical correction in the form of lens extraction and primary or secondary IOL implantation should be meticulously evaluated in detail postoperatively. A detailed anterior segment evaluation to look for IOL position and presence or absence of vitreous prolapse and a thorough fundus evaluation to rule out retinal detachment as these patients are at high risk of retinal detachment.

All patients should be started on topical antibiotic and steroid combination in the form of 0.1% dexamethasone and 0.5% moxifloxacin or 0.5% gatifloxacin in tapering doses 6/5/4/3/2/1 per week. Some surgeons prefer to add a separate antibiotic like 0.5% moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin four times per day for 15 days to prevent secondary bacterial infection.

The patient should be followed-up on days 1, 30, and 90 days to rule out any postoperative complications. The patient should be counseled regarding the long-term outcomes of ectopia lentis and the importance of regular follow-up and postoperative drug use.
