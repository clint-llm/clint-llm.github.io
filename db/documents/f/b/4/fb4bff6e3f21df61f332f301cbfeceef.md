Dystrophin is a rod-shaped protein present in the cytoplasmic side of muscle fibers cell membrane as a part of a glycoprotein complex that connects the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix. It provides mechanical reinforcement and stabilizes the cell membrane.

Neuronal nitric oxide (nNOS) is secured as a part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex that produces nitric oxide, which regulates vasodilation and increases blood flow to the muscle. The absence of dystrophin causes loss of neuronal nitric oxide associated with exercise-induced muscle weakness and fatigue.

Damage to the cell membrane causes the outflow of creatine kinase from inside the cell, and the influx of calcium ions into the cell due to markedly increased open probability of leak channels.
