Patients with entropion may first present to the advanced practice or primary care provider. Since entropion is a progressive disorder with the potential to cause injury to the cornea, it is important to refer these patients to an oculoplastic surgeon or an ophthalmologist. Several techniques exist for repairing entropion, and skill and experience are required.

Operating room and ophthalmology nurses assist in care and provide patient education. The outcomes for most patients are good, but some patients require revision, and cosmesis is not always perfect.
