Lumbar puncture was the first diagnostic tool that recognized changes in CSF pressure indicative of benign ICH. As previously mentioned, an opening pressure of 0 to 70 mmH2O was required to make this diagnosis. Lumbar puncture is no longer utilized as a first-line diagnostic procedure to diagnose ICH. Also, many patients with this syndrome are found to have normal CSF opening pressure on LP. The MRI brain has superseded LP in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected ICH.

Radiographic findings in cases of benign ICH most often present on MRI as Subdural fluid collections, enhancement of the pachymeninges, Engorgement of the venous structures, Pituitary enlargement, and Sagging of the brain, which can be referred to by the acronym SEEPS.

Radioisotope cisternography is not commonly used due to less availability but is useful in the setting of spontaneous ICH if a CSF leak is suspected following a non-diagnostic MRI. The test is performed by injection of radioisotope intrathecally via lumbar puncture. It is not typically the best test for identifying the exact site of CSF leak secondary to a dural defect. This is where CT myelography comes into play as it is useful for localizing the level of the spinal leak.
