Optimal monitoring of busulfan uses the concentrations expressed as the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). AUC has significantly helped clinicians monitor the therapeutic concentrations and correct them as needed for better outcomes after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. An AUC of 100 mg*h/L reaches optimal efficacy in most patients, but the optimal target varies due to factors that include age, diagnosis, and many others. Anything less than 100 mg*h/L increases the risk of graft rejection or disease relapse. Anything greater than 100 mg*h/L or 1500 microM for AUC increases a patientâ€™s risk of hepatic venous-occlusive disease.
