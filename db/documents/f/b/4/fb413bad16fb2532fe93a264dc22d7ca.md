The chemoreceptor trigger zone is a circumventricular organ (CVO), in that it serves as a link between the brain parenchyma and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) containing ventricles. Its composition is of glia and neurons, covered by a thin ependymal cover, and penetrated with convoluted capillaries lacking tight endothelial junctions. This specialized structure means the CTZ within the AP forms a permeable blood-brain barrierÂ and can detect emetic toxins in both the blood and the CSF.

Blood flow velocity in the capillaries of the chemoreceptor trigger zone is slow, extending the length of time blood, circulating messengers, and toxins are moving through this zone, allowing increased contact time for blood and its contents to penetrate the permeable capillaries and interact with receptors for various substances involved in homeostasis and body fluids.

Receptors of the CTZ that induce emesis include opioid mu, kappa, dopamine-type 2 (D2), neurokinin-1 (NK-1), and serotonin-type 3 (5-HT3).
