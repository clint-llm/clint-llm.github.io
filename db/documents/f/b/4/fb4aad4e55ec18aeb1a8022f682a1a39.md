The management of Morel Lavalle lesions begins with appropriate evaluation, which requires a thorough and comprehensive clinical examination after adequate history-taking. Also, radiologists help in clinching the diagnosis as well as providing details of the lesion using ultrasonography, CT scan, and MRI. In advanced stages, where the overlying soft tissue envelope is fully necrosed, the help of a plastic surgeon is sought for providing adequate coverage of the underlying muscles and often the underlying orthopedic implants. The role of physical therapy and rehabilitation cannot be undermined in getting the best functional outcomes after the underlying fractures; hence physiotherapists should be informed about the rehab protocol after each case.
