Most parasomnias can be treated, in some capacity, with benzodiazepines (BZD). There have been suggestions that the therapeutic value of BZDs arises from their ability to suppress stages of deep sleep and REM, which are the stages implicated in parasomnias.

However, because of their undesirable side effect profile and addiction potential, alternatives are commonly suggested; such alternatives include tricyclic antidepressants, melatonin, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Alpha-1 antagonists, such as prazosin, have demonstrated specific efficacy in the treatment of nightmare disorders.

Another therapeutic approach specific to nightmare disorder is 'imagery rehearsal.' This psychotherapeutic approach consists of identifying a recurrent nightmare and changing the storyline to a more agreeable thematic sequence. As the patient rehearses this novel storyline, he or she will inadvertently change subsequent dream imagery.
