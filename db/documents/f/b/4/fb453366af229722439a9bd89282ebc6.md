A number of tests have been developed to evaluate quantitative gustatory disorders. These are either chemical or electrical in nature. Chemical testing uses the natural stimuli and chemical tastants (sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami) to assess taste, whereas electrical testing adopts electrical currents applied directly to the surface of the tongue. Other investigations are employed in the assessment of gustatory dysfunction, such as certain imaging techniques, though these are not as useful in quantifying taste disorders. However, imaging can help diagnose both peripheral and central lesions that may affect the gustatory pathway.

**Chemical Testing**

**Three-drop Method**

This method makes use of aqueous solutions comprising the five basic tastes. Three samples are presented to the subject, one of which contains the tastant, the other two being simply water. It is either delivered as three droplets or larger volumes that require the participant to sip, swill, and spit. The subject indicates which of the three samples contained the taste solution. This must be correctly identified three times, or else the next (higher) concentration solution is used. It can be used to test for both the detection threshold (the concentration at which the subject correctly identifies the presence of a taste) and the recognition threshold (where the subject also correctly identifies the taste).

**Taste Tablets**

The transport and utilization of aqueous solutions posed some logistical challenges, overcome by developing tablets or wafers impregnated with the basic tastants. These can be easily stored and used for routine clinical practice. They suffer the same drawbacks as any whole-mouth testing method but are a suitable alternative to the three-drop method. The same technique can be employed with taste tablets as long as increasing concentrations of tastant are available.

**Filter Paper Discs**

Edible or inedible filter paper may be used in discs or ‘taste strips’ and placed in specific tongue or mouth regions, allowing for regional testing. This is particularly used to detect isolated lesions of the chorda tympani (anterior two-thirds of the tongue) or glossopharyngeal nerve (posterior tongue). Typical testing methods include a number of strips/discs applied to each side of the tongue while it is protruding from the mouth (thus eliminating the role of the olfactory or trigeminal pathways). The correct answers are added up, and a score below a certain threshold, or a difference in score between sides of the tongue, is considered abnormal and requires further investigation.

**Taste Strips**

The Taste Strips are another clinical method to assess taste.

**Electrical Testing**

- 
**Electrogustometry**

A monopolar or bipolar tool is used in the assessment of taste detection thresholds. A current between 1.5 and 400 µA has been proven to reliably stimulate the gustatory pathway, and this test can therefore provide localizing information about gustatory deficits.

- 
**Gustatory Evoked Potentials**

An attempt to develop an objective test of gustation resulted in the assessment of action potentials with EEG.

**Imaging**

- 
**Functional MRI (fMRI)**

Modern MRI techniques allow us to highlight areas of the brain that may be involved in the gustatory pathway. This relies upon the blood-oxygen-level-dependent contrast that occurs after a cascade of physiological events resulting in dynamic cerebral blood flow changes and oxygen consumption.

- 
**Positron Emission Tomography (PET)**

Using FDG to measure uptake in PET scanning elicits much the same results as fMRI. It has not yet been used to investigate gustatory dysfunction; however, it has been used to investigate the anosmia being widely reported during the COVID-19 pandemic (suggesting a cortical neuronal loss and not just transient damage to the olfactory nerve.

- 
**Confocal Microscopy**

Confocal laser scanning microscopy provides a magnified (up to eight hundred times) view of the surface of the tongue.

- 
**Photography**

A less magnified approach to examining the tongue involves using advanced cameras and dye application to specific areas of the tongue. This then allows counting of the papillae (using photo software) to create a quantitative assessment of fungiform papillae. Papillae quantification has not been shown to correlate with other measures of gustation, but photography might allow us to appreciate oral pathology better when investigating disorders of taste.
