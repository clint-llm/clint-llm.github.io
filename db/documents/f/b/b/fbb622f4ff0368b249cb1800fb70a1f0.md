As bone marrow edema syndrome is self-limiting, the goal of treatment is primarily symptom management. Offloading of the affected region can help control pain while nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy remain the mainstays of symptomatic management.

Iloprost is a prostacyclin analog that has historically been used in the treatment of critical ischemia but has also been shown to improve functionality and pain in patients with bone marrow edema syndrome.

A regimen of bisphosphonates and vitamin D supplementation may also be used to increase anabolism and revascularization of bone. Ibandronate and other nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates have been shown to have an analgesic effect in addition to their anabolic effects within bone tissue.
