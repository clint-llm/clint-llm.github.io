Hereditary angioedema has an incidence of approximately 1 in 50000 individuals. While there are nearly 300 pathogenic variants, most are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, with approximately 25% of cases arising from de novo mutations. This condition leads to about 15000 to 30000 emergency department visits per year.
