There are no measures to suggest to prevent MDE in view of the fact that etiology is still unknown, but generally, patients who start with mild disease with nipple discharge need to be educated on wearing a supportive bra with breast pads to absorb any nipple discharge to maintain nipple and areola hygiene to prevent secondary infection.

Patients will be reassured about the benign nature of MDE. Abstaining from smoking reduces the development of periductal mastitis, which can make the course of the disease more severe and with a higher rate of recurrences.

Patients should seek a general or breast surgeon's opinion to exclude malignancy.
