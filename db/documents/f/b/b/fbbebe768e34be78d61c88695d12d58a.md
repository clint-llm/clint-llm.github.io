Thoracic ultrasound complications

- Minimal

- Point tenderness at the site of probe placement

Massive hemothorax may lead to

- Hemodynamic instability

- Shock

- Hypoxia

- Death

Improper chest tube placement may lead to

- Solid organ injury

Inadequate placement of chest tube may lead to insufficient hemothorax drainage which promotes empyema formation. Studies show a 26.8% incidence of empyema in patients with post-traumatic retained hemothorax. Fibrothorax results from fibrin deposition within the pleural space. Improper hemothorax drainage causes an inflammatory coating within the pleural space which impedes proper lung expansion. This phenomenon is known as lung entrapment.
