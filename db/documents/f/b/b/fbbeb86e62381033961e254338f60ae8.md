A fistula is an abnormal communication between two epithelial surfaces. An intestinal fistula is a fistula that connects the intestine to an adjacent organ or surface. Examples include enterocutaneous fistulas, which connect the intestine to the skin, and enterovesicular fistulas, which connect the intestine to the bladder. Common causes of intestinal fistulas include surgical procedures, diverticular disease, inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, radiation, and injury due to trauma or foreign bodies. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of intestinal fistulas and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of intestinal fistulas.
- Review the etiology of intestinal fistula.
- Summarize the treatment options for intestinal fistulas.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of intestinal fistulas and optimize outcomes.
