Distal radius fractures, commonly known as a wrist fracture, are defined by the involvement of the metaphysis of the distal radius. In younger patients, they are commonly associated with high-energy mechanisms, and in older patients, they more frequently occur with lower energy mechanisms or falls. They can result in significant morbidity if left untreated. Treatment can involve both non-operative and operative management and ultimately depends on several factors. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of the wrist fractures and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of wrist fractures.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with wrist fractures. 
- Explain the criteria for non-surgical management of wrist fractures.
- Outline the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team in the evaluation of wrist fractures and the care of affected patients.
