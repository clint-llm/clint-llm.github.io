Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) characterized by a (1,14) translocation resulting in overexpression of the cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene. The variety of morphologic variants may make this a challenging diagnosis, although some cases are uncomplicated. It typically follows an aggressive clinical course (aggressive MCL), although an indolent leukemia variant (indolent MCL) has been described.
