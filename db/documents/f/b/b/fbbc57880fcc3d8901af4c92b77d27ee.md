Medical practitioners diagnose photosensitivity by a history of a skin problem arising from exposure to sunlight. They determine the specific type by taking a careful history, examining the skin and performing specific tests. Photosensitivity is sometimes confirmed by photosets, which only is available in specialized centers.

- Minimal erythema dose (MED) testing (broadband or monochromators) to determine threshold dose

- Provocation photoset procedure using repeated exposures to UVA and/or UVB over four consecutive days in an attempt to reproduce the dermatosis

- Photopatch tests in association with standard patch tests to determine photoallergy

Investigations may include:

- Full blood count

- Connective tissue antibodies including antinuclear antibodies (ANA), extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) if suspicious of lupus erythematosus

- Porphyrins in blood, urine, and feces

- Liver function and iron tests in patients suspected of porphyria

- Skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immune fluorescence in primary and photo-exacerbated dermatoses

- In cases suspicious of xeroderma pigmentosum, measurement of post-UV cell survival and DNA repair capacity in fibroblast assays

- Tiger hair appearance on polarised microscopy of brittle hair (dark and light areas) should lead to chromatography to determine amino acid content, which shows reduced cysteine in trichothiodystrophy

- Gene sequencing may confirm Bloom syndrome or Rothmund Thomson syndrome.
