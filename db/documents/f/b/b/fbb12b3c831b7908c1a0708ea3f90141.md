Different pulmonary artery catheters are commercially available. Some can be used to perform the thermodilution assessment of cardiac output in addition to pressure measurements. Catheters with a dedicated thermistor can be used to perform thermodilution cardiac output assessment. The pulmonary artery catheter is 110 cm long, and the French sizes of catheters vary based on the manufacturer from 5F to 8F. All catheters have a distal yellow port and a proximal blue port. The presence of a thermistor adds the third port to the catheter.
