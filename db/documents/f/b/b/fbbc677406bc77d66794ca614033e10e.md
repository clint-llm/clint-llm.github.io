Worsening CAD is a precursor of ischemic cardiomyopathy. CAD starts as vascular endothelial cell dysfunction which leads to macrophage and LDL accumulation. This results in foam cell formation and fatty streaks. There is a migration of smooth muscle cells on the coronary vessel. Once there is proliferation with extracellular matrix deposition, it forms fibrous plaque which has a potential for rupture and thrombosis. In ischemic cardiomyopathy, there is a significant impairment of the left ventricular systolic function, with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40%. Previous myocardial infarctions with consequent ventricular remodeling lead to an irreversible loss of myocardial tissue. There is no recovery of contractile function in these patients, even with coronary revascularization since the infarcted tissue is no longer viable.
