As describedÂ above in the history and physical, tests for causes of peripheral vertigo such as Dix-Hallpike test and simple screening test for hearing are important. A detailed neurological exam including assessment of extremity and truncal ataxia, gait, and HINTS test should all be performed.

When the examination findings suggest central vertigo, most of the time the patient will need to be further evaluated and very often requires hospitalization. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice for visualization of a potential infarction, tumor, hemorrhage, or evidence of demyelination that would reveal the cause of central vertigo. Computed tomography (CT) may be employed if MRI is unavailable. CT angiogram and MR angiogram may be performed at the same time or sequentially to look for any occlusion of the vertebrobasilar arterial system which may be the cause of vertigo. Rapid evaluation, especially in preparation for thrombolytic therapy in the emergency department or interventional therapy, is extremely important to improve the outcome. MRI has reduced sensitivity in the first 48 hours following posterior circulation stroke and a positive HINTS result, regardless of imaging findings, is worrisome.
