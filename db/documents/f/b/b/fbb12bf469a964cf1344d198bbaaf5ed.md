The gallbladder will distend to varying degrees. Clear, watery mucus replaces the normally colored bile, and a distended gallbladder can contain over 1500 mL of this mucus. There will be varying degrees of acute inflammation of the gallbladder wall with possible microabscesses present. Various species of bacteria are present in 11% to 30% of the cases. Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses are present 90% of the time in cholecystitis specimens. These are a herniation of intraluminal sinuses from increased pressures possibly associated with ducts of Luschka. Most often, an impacted gallstone is located in the cystic duct or Hartmann pouch. This stone is usually singular, but multiple stones can also be present. Cases caused by other etiologies such as polyps, tumors, or parasites exhibit these findings in pathology. Extreme or prolonged cases can lead to actual perforation of the gallbladder.
