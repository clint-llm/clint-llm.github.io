- Preparation for anticipated severe abdominal bleeding is part of trauma centers requirements. The surgeon and the OR team ensures a methodical effort to minimize start time.

- The emergency team, ICU team, general and trauma team, AnastasiaÂ team and nursing staff should be available and involved in providing care for severe intraabdominal bleeding.

- Exploratory laparotomy is performed under general anesthesia after appropriate intravascular access is obtained. A nasogastric tube and an indwelling urinary catheter are inserted to decompress the stomach and the urinary bladder to decrease the risk for aspiration of gastric contents and monitor urine output.

- The operative field for torso trauma extends from the chin to above the knees, between the posterior axillary lines and with both arms fully abducted. This wide sterile field provides free access to the abdomen and chest and both groins while giving the anesthesia team access to both upper extremities and the head and neck.
