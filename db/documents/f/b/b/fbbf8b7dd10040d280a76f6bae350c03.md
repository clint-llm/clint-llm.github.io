Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) uses ultrasound waves to examine the heart and great vessels. There are four basic TEE rescue views that are all easy to obtain and helpful in determining the potential cause of cardiac arrest. TEE can provide valuable information quickly and at low risk, and therefore is a useful tool to improve outcomes and patient survival. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing transesophageal echocardiography and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the contraindications to performing a transesophageal echocardiogram.
- Describe the technique involved in performing a transesophageal echocardiogram. 
- Summarize the complications of transesophageal echocardiogram.
- Explain the importance of an interprofessional approach to evaluating patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiogram.
