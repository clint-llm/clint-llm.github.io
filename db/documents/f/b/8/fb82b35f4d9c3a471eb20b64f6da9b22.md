The management of patients with SIADH requires an interprofessional healthcare team approach because of the diverse etiologies and the challenge in treating the patient successfully without causing further complications. The aim is to control the primary condition causing SIADH and monitor the fluid status and electrolytes. The nursing staff and clinicians involved must work as an interprofessional team to minimize complications and provide the best care. Several newer agents are available that can lower or block actions of ADH, but expertise is necessary when using these medications; therefore, the team also requires pharmacist input. The prognosis for patients with SIADH depends on the cause. For benign causes, the prognosis is excellent, but those cases caused by malignancies tend to have a poor outcome.
