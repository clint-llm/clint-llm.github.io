As mentioned above, the conus medullaris is the distal tapering end of the spinal cord. It is continuous with the epiconus (L4 to S1 segments) superiorly and consists of S2 to S5 as well as the coccygeal segments.

The conus medullaris give rise to the lumbar sympathetic, sacral somatic and sacral parasympathetic nerves which continue downward within the cauda equina. These nerves have important functions which can be impaired by injury or ischemia.
