Pancrelipase, a combination of lipase, protease, and amylase, has been shown to benefit patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

The different conditions that are associated with pancreatic insufficiency that may require supplementation with pancrelipase are:

**FDA-Approved**

- Chronic pancreatitis: Structural damage involving the pancreatic ducts and acinar cells, which result from a prolonged inflammatory reaction in the pancreas, is the most common cause of insufficiency

- Tumors: Obstruction of the pancreatic duct by a tumor in the pancreas/ampulla leads to atrophy, causing enzyme deficiency

- Post-surgery:

- Pancreatic resection: Loss of glandular tissue or duct occlusion post-procedure
- Gastric resection: Insufficient mixing of chyme with pancreatic enzymes because of rapid gastric emptying
- Small bowel resection: Inadequate secretion of cholecystokinin-pancreozymin and secretin
- Lymph node dissection: Postcibal asynchrony and decreased pancreatic stimulation

- Genetic disorders:

- Cystic fibrosis: An autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in both copies of the gene for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CTFR) on chromosome 7. The resultant protein regulates chloride and sodium transport across the endothelial cell membranes in exocrine glands. The major implication of this condition is the blockage of pancreatic ducts from the inspissated secretions resulting thereof
- Schwachman Diamond syndrome: An autosomal recessive disorder that presents in infancy. The usual presentation includes skeletal abnormalities, neutropenia, bone marrow dysfunction, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.
- Hereditary hemochromatosis: An autosomal recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the HFE gene coding for hepcidin, transferrin, hemojuvelin, and ferroportin results in the increased absorption and deposition of iron in the body. Deposition of iron in the pancreas leads to reduced glandular function.
- Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: A rare condition resulting from the development of gastrinomas or gastrin-secreting tumors in the stomach and duodenum. About 30% of cases occur as a part of MEN1 syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Increased gastrin production leads to the suppression of pancreatic enzymes.
- Celiac disease: An autoimmune condition inherited in either an autosomal dominant or recessive manner that may result in a decreased CCK secretion which secondarily results in reduced pancreatic secretion
- Crohn's disease: An autoimmune condition that may cause the production of antibodies directed against the pancreas, which interferes which enzyme production
- Autoimmune pancreatitis: IgG4-related disease that eventually progresses to exocrine pancreas insufficiency

**Non-FDA Approved**

- Enteral feeding tube occlusion: Administration of a pancreatic enzyme and sodium bicarbonate solution to blocked feeding tube effectively relieved the obstruction. The efficacy was further improved by applying the solution closer to the clogged area using a catheter.
