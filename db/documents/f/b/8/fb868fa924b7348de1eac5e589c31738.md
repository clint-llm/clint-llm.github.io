Delusions can manifest as primary psychiatric phenomena or secondary sequelae in the context of other mental or other medical conditions.

Some of the most clinically encountered types of delusions are:

- Erotomanic: A delusion that another person, more frequently someone of higher status, is in love with the individualClerembault syndrome)

- Delusional jealousy: That one's sexual partner is unfaithful (Othello syndrome)

- Grandiose: A conviction of great talent, discovery, inflated self-worth, power, knowledge, or relationship with someone famous or deity

- Persecutory: The central theme is being conspired against, attacked, harassed, poisoned obstructed in the pursuit of long-term goals

- Religious delusions: The belief that the affected person is a god or chosen to act as a god

- Bizarre: A delusion involving a phenomenon that is impossible, not understandable, and unrelated to normal life

- Somatic: Involve bodily functions and sensations (i.e., pseudocyesis, alien hand syndrome, Alice in Wonderland syndrome)

- Control: the delusion that some external force is controlling one's feelings, impulses, and thoughts

- Thought broadcasting: A delusion that one's thoughts are projected outwards and perceived by others

- Thought insertion or withdrawal: A delusion that one's thought is not one's own but inserted into their mind by an external source or entity; or one's thoughts are being removed

- Delusional Misidentification Disorder: a) Cotard Disorder the belief that one is dead or does not exist, or one's organs are putrifying or have been removed b) Fregoli syndrome,

- Delusions of infestation: also known as the delusions of parasitosis or Ekbom syndrome, is an infrequent psychotic disorder characterized by a firm and false belief that there is a parasitic infestation of the skin, with no medical evidence that could support this claim

- Delusions of misidentification: The belief that a familiar person/place has been switched with a look-alike (Capgras disorder)

Picardi (2018) noted that delusions of grandeur were commonly seen in bipolar disorder, whereas delusions of guilt were consistently associated with psychotic depression, both unipolar and bipolar. Although persecutory delusions are common across diagnostic groups, these were found more frequently in schizophrenia and delusional disorders rather than in mood disorders. Delusions of thought broadcasting, insertion, or withdrawal appear to be most frequently associated with chronic psychotic disorders.

Young, Kim, and Park (2012) reviewed shifts in persecutory delusions between the differing generations. They noted a shift in delusional themes, temporally related to current political issues. In the earliest group reviewed, delusions were somatic in origin, primarily of having syphilis. With the onset of the second world war, delusions in American patients contained an increased number of references to Germans, and, during the Cold War, of communists.
