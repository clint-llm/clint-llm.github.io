Patients with HD commonly have an affected parent.

Family history is negative if:

- Failure to recognize the disease.

- The early death of a parent.

- Presence of intermediate allele (27 to 35 CAG repeat) with reduced penetrance.

- Late-onset of disease in the parent.

There is a 50% chance for each offspring of aÂ patient with HD to develop the disease. Each child homozygous for the repeat will inherit an HD causing allele. An offspring of a patient with an intermediate allele are at risk of developing HD due to the instability of the repeats.

The risk of the child inheriting repeats greater than 35, depends on:

- Size of the CAG allele, larger the size, more is the chance for expansion.

- Intermediate alleles that are inherited paternally are more prone to CAG expansions.

- Repeats that are interrupted by CAA and CCG are more stable.
