The process of cobalamin transportation and absorption begins early in life and utilizes a variety of mechanisms with fetal development.

The fist of these mechanisms is the intrinsic factor-dependant system of absorption. During embryo-fetal development, cobalamin and intrinsic factor are as a meal via the ingestion of amniotic fluid. The Cbl and Cbl-binding proteins contained within the amniotic fluid parallel to maternal blood concertation.

In neonates, the digestive tract is not well developed compared to the adult GI tract. Intrinsic factor secretion is low at this period, and there is a gradual increase in IF secretion during the first four months. Therefore, the presence of intrinsic factor independent system of absorption proposed. Cbl binds haptocorrin found in mother's milk, and Cbl-HC complex is absorbed via putative intestinal receptor until the IF-dependent system develops well.
