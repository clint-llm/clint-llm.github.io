Biliary strictures or bile duct strictures refer to segments of narrowing of the intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal system. When narrowed, they impede the normal antegrade flow of bile, causing proximal dilatation resulting in clinical and pathological sequelae of biliary obstruction. Patients with chronic biliary strictures present a unique challenge when malignancy is suspected. The diagnosis and management of patients with biliary strictures potentially encompass an interprofessional approach, including endoscopists, surgeons, interventional radiologists, and hepatobiliary specialists.
