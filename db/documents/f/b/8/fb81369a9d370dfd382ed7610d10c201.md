Multidirectional instability (MDI) of the shoulder was first described in 1980 as a complex condition of the shoulder defined by instability in 2 or more planes of motion. This activity will discuss MDI, including general principles, causes, symptoms, exam findings, treatment, and recovery as it relates to the disease process. It will also highlight the role of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the process of multidirectional shoulder instability.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of multidirectional shoulder instability.
- Outline the management options available for multidirectional shoulder instability.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance multidirectional shoulder instability and improve outcomes.
