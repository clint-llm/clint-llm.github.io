Amantadine is an antiviral agent with mild antiparkinsonian activity. Amantadine was used in the early 2000s for Influenza A treatment. However, high levels of resistance have emerged recently, initially from Asia and now in North America. As of 2011, the CDC does not recommend treatment or prophylaxis of influenza A due to the high levels of resistance. Amantadine is now used mostly for Parkinson disease. This activity outlines the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse drug reactions, warning, precautions, toxicity, and limitations of amantadine in the clinical setting as relates to the essential points necessary for members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with Parkinson disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the proper indications for amantadine therapy.
- Describe the mechanism of action of amantadine.
- Review the potential adverse effects of amantadine.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team and how it can enhance patient care when dosing amantadine to improve patient outcomes for Parkinson patients.
