Treatment for partial tears is non-operative. Surgical evaluation occurs when there is a full-thickness tear, depending on the activity level or profession of the individual and patients who fail conservative management. Surgery is performed either by arthroscopy or open technique. Biceps pathology frequently co-occurs and may require tenotomy or tenodesis.
