PEX material is most readily found in the structures of the eye bathed by the aqueous. PEX is a systemic disorder that causes the accumulation of extracellular material in various other organs and body tissues including blood vessels, lungs, heart, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, meninges, and skin.

The exact pathophysiological processes that underline PEX remain unclear. Still, it is now well known that PEX is a fibrillopathy. PEX material arises from the abnormal accumulation of elastic microfibrils composed of fibrillin-1, fibulin-2, vitronectin, the enzyme lysyl oxidase, and clusterin, amongst other proteins.

Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-B1) is considered a key mediator of abnormal accumulation of PEX material. It has been shown to promote PEX material formation in vitro and, increased concentrations have been found in the aqueous humor of PEX eyes. There is evidence that oxidative stress plays a role in developing PEX.

The vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 is found in increased concentrations in PEX, and nitric oxide (a vasodilator) is reduced. It has been suggested that this may further exacerbate cellular stress and lead to the processes behind the development of PEX. Accumulation of abnormal PEX fibrils may be promoted via a deficiency of clusterin, a molecular chaperone that inhibits aggregation of misfolded proteins. Moreover, the dysfunction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) prevents the breakdown and clearance of this abnormal material.
