TypicallyÂ melanosis coli causes no symptoms and is incidentally found during colonoscopy for other reasons. A detailed history should be focused on chronic laxative use, typically senna or cascara which contain anthraquinone, and a history of inflammatory bowel disease or colitis. These stimulant laxatives also can be found in over-the-counter herbal supplements and teas. Physical findings of melanosis coli are described through colonoscopy as black pigmentations lining the colonic mucosa.
