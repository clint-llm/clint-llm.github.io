Hemifacial microsomia results from trauma or blood supply disruption to the first and second brachial (also known as the pharyngeal) arches.

The secondÂ pharyngeal arch, known as the hyoid arch, is responsible for forming the neck and many of the muscles and structures associated between the head and neck.

Understanding the anatomy involved provides the basis for understanding potential issues when providing an anesthetic to these patients. The mandible, temporomandibular joint, and neck can all be underdeveloped or affected to varying degrees, leading to a potentially difficult airway.
