Ultrasonography (US) is a relatively inexpensive, readily available, non-ionizing radiation imaging method that uses sound waves to evaluate the human body including the wrist.

Ultrasound is unique from other imaging modalities in its reliance on the skill of the technologist or clinician performing the study. An incredible amount of anatomic knowledge is required to evaluate and interpret wrist US images accurately. Also, understanding imaging artifacts, such as anisotropy, normal variations, normal and abnormal appearance of anatomic structures, and familiarity with the equipment (probe selection and machine settings), is essential for obtaining and interpreting US images. Often a review of US images in a vacuum (interpreter not present for examination) severely limits the interpretation of the images. Ultrasound's diagnostic strength lies in its ability to assess soft tissue structures. It is of limited or no use for the assessment of osseous abnormalities and pathology.

Examples of appropriate uses of US for wrist pathology may include:

- Soft tissue masses

- Tendon pathology (tendinosis, tear, tenosynovitis)

- Ligamentous injury

- Real-time dynamic evaluation (tendon subluxation)

- Carpal tunnel syndrome

- General vascular flow
