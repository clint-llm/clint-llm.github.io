Rupture of the tibialis posterior tendon (TPT) would require surgical assistance. With a rupture of the tibialis posterior, there would be a decrease in the ability to plantarflex and invert the foot. The muscles of the posterior compartment would be able to plantarflex the foot, and some inversion of the foot would be possible due to the actions of the tibialis anterior, but the loss of the tibialis posterior tendon would lead to an everted flat foot due to the inability to maintain the medial arch. This loss would also lead to a valgus deformity, and a gait disorder, where the treatment required is surgical reattachment and repair of the tibialis posterior tendon.
