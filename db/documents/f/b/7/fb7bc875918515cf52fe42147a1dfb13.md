Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis (PsO) and is found in about 20% of such patients with psoriasis. It shares many clinical features with other spondyloarthropathies and also rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is usually seronegative, but a small percentage of patients may be positive for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP antibodies). The clinical manifestations are varied and can change over time, evolving from one articular pattern to another. This activity reviews the important aspects related to the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of psoriatic arthritis and highlights the importance of an interprofessional approach to managing the different facets of psoriatic arthritis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of psoriatic arthritis.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with psoriatic arthritis.
- Summarize correct interpretation and utilization of diagnostic modalities and the selection of appropriate treatment according to available guidelines and evidence-based medicine.
- Outline reasons why psoriatic arthritis patients are best managed with an interprofessional approach to treat articular disease, skin disease, other manifestations, and medical comorbidities.
