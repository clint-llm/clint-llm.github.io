Healthcare workers who prescribe amiloride should be aware of its indications, dosage, contraindication, and adverse effects. Periodic monitoring of serum potassium and renal function is an integral part of managing heart failure and hypertension when receiving amiloride. In addition, management of hypertension usually involves prescribing angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Nevertheless, concomitant use of amiloride and ACE inhibitors carries a significant risk of developing symptomatic hyperkalemia.

When a clinician (MD, DO, NP, PA) initiates amiloride therapy, they should collaborate with otherÂ healthcare team members to enhance care coordination and communication. It is prudent to work with a pharmacist and coordinate with the lab for necessary blood values pertinent to amiloride monitoring (e.g., potassium). The pharmacist should also perform medication reconciliation and check for drug interactions and verify dosing. Nursing staff should also have involvement, including patient counseling, monitoring medication adherence, and being aware and alert to signs of adverse events and toxicity. When using amiloride for its indicated purpose, it is necessary to have a collaborative interprofessional team that includes physicians, specialty-trained nursing, and pharmacists to monitor therapy and achieve optimal patient outcomes.
