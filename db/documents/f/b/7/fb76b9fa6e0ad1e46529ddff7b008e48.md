Pythium is a parasitic aquatic oomycete that causes vision-threatening keratitis. Clinically, morphologically and histopathologically, it closely mimics fungal keratitis. Prompt diagnosis, meticulous management, and regular follow-up are vital to get a good outcome. This activity describes the etiology, risk factors, clinical features, investigations, treatment options, differential diagnosis, and complications of Pythium keratitis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical features that distinguish Pythium from fungal keratitis.
- Outline the evaluation of Pythium keratitis.
- Explain the appropriate microbiological investigations in a suspected case of Pythium keratitis.
- Review the management options available for the interprofessional team to treat Pythium keratitis.
