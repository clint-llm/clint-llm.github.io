Aortic arch aneurysms can lead to life-threatening cardiovascular and neurological complications, including aortic rupture most often into the left chest or pericardium, presenting as severe chest pain and hypotension or shock; aortic dissection, and atheroembolism causing ischemic strokes. Some rare complications of the formation of aorto-esophageal or aorto-bronchial fistula have also been documented.

Embolization during the placement of the graft leading to stroke or spinal ischemia from obstruction of spinal arteries, endoleaks, and hematoma formation are also some of the well known and concerning peri-operative complications associated with the aortic repair.
