There are two main materials used in pit and fissure sealants,**resin-based**and**glass ionomer sealants**.

Resin-based sealants are the first choice of treatment, and glass ionomer sealants may be utilized as a provisional agent when the placement of a resin-based sealant is indicated, but absolute isolation cannot be achieved, and therefore moisture control is compromised.

Glass ionomer sealants contain fluoride that can help to prevent caries through their release over a prolonged period
