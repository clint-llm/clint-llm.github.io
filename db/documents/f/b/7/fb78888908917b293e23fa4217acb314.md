Hypercapnia is the increase in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) above 45 mmHg. Carbon dioxide is a metabolic product of the many cellular processes within the body, and there are several physiological mechanisms that the body has to moderate of carbon dioxide levels. These include the an acid-base buffering system that involves a balance between bicarbonate and carbon dioxide. Consequently, hypercapnia leads to acid-base imbalance. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of hypercapnia and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the causes of hypercapnia.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with hypercapnia.
- Summarize the treatment options for hypercapnia.
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with hypercapnia.
