Initial treatment involves rest until the patient can walk without limping. A walking boot may be needed for ambulation if the pain is severe. Heel lifts that decrease dorsiflexion and stretch may be helpful. The patient should apply ice for 20 minutes four times daily to decrease swelling with an NSAID or acetaminophen to help with the pain. Compression sleeves that reach 20 to 30 mm Hg may help reduce hematoma formation and may help speed recovery.

Severe injuries associated with an inability to walk are treatable with a progressive physical therapy regimen tailored to the individual’s patient’s level of baseline function and progress. The clinician should assess for swelling and hematoma with ultrasound and calf measurements at the first one week follow up appointment; if present, the patient should continue icing and use of a compression sleeve. The patient can discontinue crutches as tolerated and start walking several times daily. They can begin heel raises and progressively increase their sets and reps with a pain-free goal of 3 sets of 15 repetitions daily, both with knees bent and knees straight. The patient should continue the use of a compression sleeve, heel lifts, and icing until swelling resolves.

The Alfredson protocol involves a progressive eccentric heel drop program and has been well documented for Achilles tendon injury rehabilitation. This protocol can also be an option for gastrocnemius injuries as the calf muscle, and Achilles tendon work together as part of the same musculotendonous complex.

The patient can start light running if they can perform 15 calf raises on the affected leg with minimal pain and have a normal gait. Light running can progress as tolerated, and the clinician should carefully observe for signs of gait disturbance. The patient can increase running times and distances at a subsequent follow-up visit, but these increases should be gradual, with only minimal increases per week.

There is not a clear goal or cutoff for when the patient should be allowed to return to full play. This progression is generally the recommendation when the patient can perform three sets of 15 heel raises with both bent knee and straight knee of the injured leg without pain; and the ability to run for a half-hour without pain or gait disturbance. The patient can anticipate a full recovery in 3 to 4 months and should continue compression sleeves and heel lifts for several months after return to full play, after which they may elect to discontinue use on their own.
