Body lice are often encountered by the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, internist, emergency department physician, and pharmacist. Improving healthcare practitioners' understanding of risk factors, transmission, clinical manifestations, and management of pediculosis corporis, with an emphasis on educating patients on the importance of personal hygiene and laundering clothes in hot water, will ensure timely treatment and prevent further transmission of body lice.

The symptoms like pruritus are managed with antihistamines and topical corticosteroids.

While the use of pediculicides is not required for the eradication of body lice infections, they are often utilized, especially if body lice or nits are found on body hair or if there is co-infection with head lice, pubic lice, or scabies.

The most significant difference between body and head lice is the distinct ability of body lice to transmit the bacterial diseases trench fever, relapsing fever, and epidemic typhus to humans.

The outcomes for patients who remain compliant with good body hygieneÂ are good.
