The superior alveolar nerves are three branches that come from the maxillary nerve. Numerous variations exist with the superior alveolar nerves. The origin, path, and branching patterns vary considerably.Â  In some individuals, the dental plexus formed by the superior alveolar nerves maybe be larger or smaller. Some individuals may lack one of the superior alveolar nerve branches. For example, the middle alveolar nerve may be absent in some individuals.

In contrast, the superior alveolar nerves, the inferior alveolar nerve, str usually only one nerve. The inferior alveolar nerve is typically the only alveolar nerve that branches from the mandibular nerve. The origin, path, and branching pattern of this nerve can also vary. In some cases, there is a bifid inferior alveolar nerve instead of just one nerve. The inferior alveolar nerve may also have small connections to the neighboring nerves. The path in the mandibular foramen may also vary. The path variations can be due to several factors. The most common cause of the path to differ is the variable shape of the mandible, which could cause the inferior alveolar nerve to travel lower or higher in the bone itself.
