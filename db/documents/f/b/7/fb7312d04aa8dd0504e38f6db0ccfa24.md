Detailed history taking, such as family and drug histories, is important in the evaluation of angioneurotic edema. For example, the use of ACEIs is important in diagnosing drug-induced ANE. ANE patients present with swelling of distensible tissues such as face, eyes, lips, mouth, throat, extremities, and genitalia. Some of the patients with angioneurotic abdominal edema can also present with colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal distention due to bowel wall submucosal edema and intestinal obstruction.

Uvula or tongue swelling can be visualized directly on asking to open the mouth. However, it is advisable to do laryngoscopy to assess vocal cords. Airway concerns should be suspected in patients who present with hoarseness of voice, stridor, dysphonia, difficulty in breathing, and wheezing. The first step in airway assessment is assessing airway patency. In allergic ANE attacks, there may be itchy urticaria, skin rashes which appear as wheals on trunk and limbs, which may resolve spontaneously. Non-pitting edema may also be present in extremities.
