Sympathomimetics incorporate a large group of drugs, both prescription and nonprescription, which have the potential for abuse. Because of the ready availability of these agents on the illegal market, toxicity is common. In general, agents injected or inhaled produce immediate toxicity whereas those taken orally have a delayed onset. The treatment of sympathomimetic toxicity is chiefly supportive.
