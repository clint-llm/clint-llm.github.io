Renal angiomyolipoma is a rare benign neoplasm, but it may still impose significant morbidity and mortality due to the tumor's unique vascular characteristics and the possible complications associated with treatment.

The risk of bleeding associated with renal angiomyolipomas is a challenging factor in saving the patient's life while preserving renal function.

Another important complication includes the need for long-term surveillance and the potential for renal impairment over time associated with renal angiomyolipomas.
