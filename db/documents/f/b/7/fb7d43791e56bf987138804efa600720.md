Contraindications for a technique such as muscle energy include patients who are unable to actively participate in the treatment or are unwilling to do so. Rib fractures, recent spinal injury, or known ligament laxity is another contraindication to this technique. Finally, active infection of the skin or underlying muscle is another contraindication, as is metastatic cancer, which could potentially spread due to muscle energy to the ribs.
