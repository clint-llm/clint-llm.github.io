Stress fractures are due to an abrupt increase in activity or training patterns. There are intrinsic and extrinsic factors contributing to the development of the injury, with the bulk of the information coming from studies on military personnel.

In general, with male and female athletes participating in the same training regime, female athletes have a higher incidence of stress fractures.

The most common sites for stress fractures are as follows in decreasing order metatarsals, tibia, tarsals, femur, and fibula, followed by the pelvis. In female athletes, stress fractures of the pelvis and metatarsals are most common. Upper extremity stress fractures are rare but have been reported in gymnasts, weightlifting, and throwing sports.  The clavicle, scapula, first rib and proximal humerus/shaft (thrower's shoulder), medial epicondyle (thrower's elbow), olecranon, and radial physis (gymnast's wrist) are the most common sites.

Some stress fractures are more common in specific sports. Runners see tibia and metatarsal with pelvic stress fractures in female runners, and in long-distance running, there is an association with femoral neck and pelvic injuries. Hurdlers see an increased risk of patella fractures. Gymnasts, female soccer players, some American football position players like offensive linemen and linebackers, and Olympic-style weightlifters are at increased risk of spondylolysis. This is a unique stress fracture related to repeated hyperextension of the spine.
