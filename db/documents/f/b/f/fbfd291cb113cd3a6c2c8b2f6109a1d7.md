Human serum or plasma specimens can be used to determine procalcitonin (PCT). For accurate results, serum and plasma specimens should be free of fibrin, red blood cells, and other particulate matter.

The PCT specimens should be free of bubbles. Remove bubbles with an applicator stick before analysis. Use a new applicator stick for each specimen to prevent cross-contamination. To ensure consistency in results, recentrifuge specimens before testing if theyÂ contain fibrin, red blood cells, or other particulate matter.
