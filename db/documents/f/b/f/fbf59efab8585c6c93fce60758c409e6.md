Osteogenesis imperfecta is a rare genetic disease. In the majority of cases, it occurs secondary to mutations in the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes. More recently, diverse mutations related to OI have been identified.

The following is the OI classification according to the International Society of Skeletal Dysplasias based on the mode of inheritance and genes involved.

**Osteogenesis Imperfecta / Type / Inheritance / Genes**

- Nondeforming OI (Type I) / AD / COL1A1, COL1A2 / X-linked / PLS3

- Perinatal (type II) / AD, AR / COL1A1, COL1A2, CRTAP, LEPRE1, PPIB, BMP1

- Progressively deforming (type III) / AD, AR / COL1A1, COL1A2, CRTAP, LEPRE1, PPIB, FKBP10, SERPINH1, SERINF1, WNT1

- Moderate (type IV) / AD, AR / COL1A1, COL1A2, CRTAP, FKBP10, SP7, SERPINF1, WNT1, TMEM38B

- Calcification of interosseous membrane or hypertrophic callus (type V) / AD / IFITM5
