Nail clubbing is a physical exam finding that often correlates with a serious underlying disease. Proper recognition of clubbing, therefore, plays a vital outcome in the progression of the disease. The initial physical exam in the case of clubbing may be at either an inpatient or outpatient setting depending on the underlying cause. Clubbing is identifiable by anyone conducting the physical exam including medical students, nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and physicians. Regardless of who recognizes the clubbing first, an interprofessional team approach is the ideal way to evaluate and manage a patient with clubbing.

In many cases, depending on the underlying cause of the clubbing, evaluation by specialists may be required. These include pulmonologists, oncologists, infectious disease specialists, cardiologists, gastroenterologists, endocrinologists, and/or radiologists. Cases where clubbing results in increased stress due to impaired physical appearance may warrant intervention from a behavioral therapist.

Only through such a team approach can the diagnosis be confirmed.
