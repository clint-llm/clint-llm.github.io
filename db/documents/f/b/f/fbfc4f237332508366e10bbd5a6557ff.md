The most important point regarding Tietze syndrome is that it is a diagnosis of exclusion. In and of itself, it is not a deadly disease. To decrease the patient's physical discomfort, mental anguish, wasted time, and expenses, practitioners should be aware of the clinical presentation, identify the condition, complete a thorough workup for any acute life-threatening disorders that may be possible,Â and inform patients about this condition to reassure the patient about this generally benign and self-limited condition.
