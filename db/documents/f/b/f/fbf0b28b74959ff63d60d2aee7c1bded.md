Since the sensory homunculus represents where the terminal sensory impulses of the body end up in the cortical cortex. If the cerebral cortex is to become compressed or compromised due to mass effect. The results of the mass effect will manifest in the body like loss of sensation and motor function. The loss of sensation is usually coupled with motor function loss due to the motor homunculus on the precentral gyrus being located cephalad to the postcentral gyrus. While, if only the postcentral gyrus is affected, this will manifest as a purely sensory loss. Mass-effect on the brain can come in many forms, such as neoplasms, cysts, infections, traumas, and hematomas.
