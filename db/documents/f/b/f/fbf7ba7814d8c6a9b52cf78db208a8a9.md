**Thick ascending limb of Henle**

[DIAGRAM 1]

Bartter syndrome, which presents as a salt-wasting disease with hypokalemia, was initially described in 1962 and thought to be already a genetic disease.

Early studies of renal physiology demonstrated that most of the lumen of the nephron has a negative charge except in the thick ascending limb of Henle, which led to the discovery of sodium and chloride transport in this part of the nephron. It appears that chloride first binds to the transporter, followed then by sodium and potassium. It is this first move of chloride that leaves a positive charge in the lumen. Researchers later identified this transporter as NKCC2.

Potassium is not abundant in this segment of the nephron and is however necessary for the transport of sodium and chloride by NKCC2. It felt intuitively that potassium needed to be recycled by the thick ascending limb cells into the lumen. Also, creating a more positive charge. That intuition led to the discovery of the ROMK channel.

This potassium channel gets expressed at the luminal side of the cell and, when available, allow potassium to travel down their concentration gradient into the lumen. Any genetic defect of this channel will cause Bartter syndrome (now called Barter syndrome Type II).

That still did not account for all the patients with Bartter syndrome. The ingenuity of nephrology physiologists led to think that maybe chloride played a role in some cases of Bartter syndrome. Sure enough, researchers discovered a mechanism that transports chloride to the interstitium.

The diagnosis of Bartter syndrome results from the association of volume depletion, metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, and hypercalciuria. To explain the hypercalciuria, we need to review the calcium absorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle.

As most molecules, most of the calcium undergoes reabsorption in the proximal tubule.

Much more common conditions can mimic these diseases:

- Loop Diuretic use or abuse

- Induced Vomiting

- The Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT) [Diagram 2]

In the DCT, sodium is absorbed through a sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC).

More common conditions can mimic this disease:

- Thiazide use or abuse

- Induced vomiting

Earlier, this activity described salt-wasting conditions accompanied by hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. It will now review salt retention conditions with hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, which involve the principal cells of the connecting/collecting duct.

[Diagram 3]

Early experiments have shown that increased urine flow through the distal part of the nephron induces potassium losses. That finding led to the discovery that potassium excretion is proportionally related to the sodium content of this segment of the tubule. Further electrophysiological studies have shown that electrical charges in this segment were responsible for this effect.

Potassium-sparing diuretics affect this segment of the nephron. Spironolactone binds and blocks the aldosterone receptor.

Amiloride blocks the sodium channel ENac.

Several syndromes affect the regulation of this system.

**Primary Hyperaldosteronism**

Dr. Conn initially described this syndrome and is due to excessive secretion of aldosterone by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal gland. The histopathology will not be reviewed here. Excess of aldosterone binding to its receptor in the principal cells will, as mentioned, increase the expression of ENaC and potassium channels on the luminal side of those cells; this will dramatically increase sodium absorption and potassium excretion in the tubule. The excess of sodium absorption will leave a negatively charged lumen, which will augment potassium trapping in the lumen as well as protons leading to hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

The treatment of this condition, in addition to blood pressure control, is the administration of spironolactone or eplerenone.

After the initial cases of Conn syndrome, multiple patients demonstrated similar features.

**Primary Reninism**

In 1967 a case of HTN due to a renin-secreting tumor was reported which led to the description by Dr. Conn of primary reninism.

The features of this syndrome are almost identical to primary hyperaldosteronism including volume retention, severe hypertension, and hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis with the only difference being that the culprit of all the clinical findings is an excess secretion of renin.

Evaluations of multiple patients with hypertension and hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis left many cases without an increase in aldosterone secretion to be called pseudohyperaldosteronism.

**Liddle Syndrome**

Initially described in 1963 by Dr. Liddle as a "familial renal disorder simulating primary hyperaldosteronism but with negligible aldosterone secretion" (Liddle G.W et al. 1963) was further determined to be a genetic mutation of the epithelial sodium channel inducing its overexpression at the luminal side of the principal cell causing unregulated absorption of sodium.

**Cushing Syndrome (Glucocorticoid excess)**

Initially described by Dr. Cushing in 1932.

The use or abuse of steroids can mimic this.

**Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess**

Even in the absence of glucocorticoid excess, several cases of apparent mineralocorticoid excess were described. It was found to be due to a genetic mutation of 11-beta-HSdehydrogenase which leaves the aldosterone receptor available to be bound by cortisol and leads to volume retention, hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis.

Of note, 11-beta-HSdehydrogenase can be inhibited by glycyrrhizic acid contained in natural licorice, and it is a well-known fact that the consumption of large amounts of licorice causes HTN with apparent mineralocorticoid excess.
