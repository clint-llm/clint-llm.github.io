Adult onset Still disease (AOSD) is a rare systemic inflammatory disorder characterized by daily fever, inflammatory polyarthritis, and a transient salmon-pink maculopapular rash. AOSD is alternatively known as systemic onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Even though there is no specific diagnostic test, a serum ferritin level of more than 1000ng/ml is common in AOSD.
