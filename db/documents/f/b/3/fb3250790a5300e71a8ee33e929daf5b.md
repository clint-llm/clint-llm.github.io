It is essential to take a proper clinical interview and correctly differentiate between vomiting and regurgitation. Rumination syndrome is severely underdiagnosed, which is most likely related to wrongly labeling regurgitation as vomiting. Differentiating between these two entities can help establish the diagnosis sooner and prevent prolonged suffering by the patient. As most patients tend to wait years for the right diagnosis, patient education about the benign course and non-pharmacologic treatment options like diaphragmatic breathing are crucial to establishing a patient's understanding of the disease and eliciting compliance with behavioral modifications. Prolonged intensive cognitive-behavioral therapy is often required, and patients need repetitive training to learn the diaphragmatic breathing pattern. Consistent patient education regarding the disease and behavioral modifications is essential for the improvement in patients' symptoms.
