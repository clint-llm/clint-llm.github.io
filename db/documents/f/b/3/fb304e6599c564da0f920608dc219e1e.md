The most common cause for accessory nerve injury is iatrogenic, such as lymph node biopsies that involve the posterior triangle of the neck, neck surgeries including removal of a tumor, carotid or internal jugular vein surgeries, neck dissection (including radical, selective, and modified), or cosmetic surgery (e.g., facelift) from the mechanical stress exerted on the neck due to positioning throughout the procedure. Other causes are penetrating trauma such as knife or gunshot trauma, blunt trauma from pressure, stress to the neck area from a sudden movement, or acromioclavicular joint dislocation affecting SCM. Other possible sources of injury are neurological, in which the nerve or the foramen it passes through are affected, leading to CN XI palsy. Examples are a tumor at the jugular foramen, which causes cranial nerve palsies such as Collet-Sicard syndrome, involving the cranial nerves IX, X, XI, and XII, and Vernet syndrome, involving the cranial nerves IX, X, and XI.

Syringomyelia, brachial neuritis, poliomyelitis, and motor neuron disease are other possible causes of CN XI injury. Other examples are traction palsies to the brachial plexus and thoracic outlet.

Certain neck surgeries can result in iatrogenic injury to the accessory nerve. These include the excision of benign neck growths, parotidectomy, endarterectomy, and internal jugular vein cannulation.

Some sports injuries can cause accessory nerve damage, such as a hockey stick blow, a sling knot, wrestling, a noose in an unsuccessful hanging, and a "whiplash" injury.
