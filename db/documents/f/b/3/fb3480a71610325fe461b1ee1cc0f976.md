The odontoid process, or dens, is a superior projecting bony element from the second cervical vertebrae (C2, or the axis). The first cervical vertebrae (atlas) rotates around the odontoid process to provide the largest single component of lateral rotation of the cervical spine. Fracture of the odontoid process is classified into one of three types, which are type I, type II, or type III fractures, depending on the location and morphology of the fracture. The most common mechanism of injury is a hyperextension of the cervical spine, pushing the head and C1 vertebrae backward. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of fractures of the C2 dens and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the unique vertebral anatomy of the second cervical vertebra (axis), including the odontoid process.
- Discuss the components of proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with a potential odontoid process fracture, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Summarize the treatment and management strategies available for C2 odontoid fractures based on the specific fracture type.
- Discuss the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of C2 odontoid fracture and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
