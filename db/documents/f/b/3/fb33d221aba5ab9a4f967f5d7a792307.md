- The most common surgical indication for awake craniotomy is resection of the tumor in the vitally important area of the brain like the motor cortex located in the prefrontal gyrus (Brodmann area 4), the sensory cortex located in the postcentral gyrus (Brodmann areas 3,1,2), and language cortex (Broca’s and Wernicke’s area). The awake patient can provide invaluable inputs, which help delineate the patient's functional brain topography and thus help the surgeon know to what extent the tumor can be excised while minimizing the risk of neurological injury to this vital area of the brain.

- Awake craniotomy is used to facilitate electrocorticography for seizure focus localization and resection as it minimizes interference from anesthetic medications.

- Awake craniotomy is also used for deep brain stimulation surgery classically for Parkinson disease and other central movement disorders, Alzheimer disease, and psychiatric disease.

- It is also commonly used for stereotactic brain biopsy and ventriculostomy.

- Awake craniotomy is also used in interventional pain procedures such as pallidotomy and thalamotomy.

**Benefits of Awake Craniotomy**

The most important benefit of awake craniotomy is that it allows the neurosurgeon to maximizes tumor resection while preserving neurological function.  Other benefits of awake craniotomy include:

- Reduced need of monitoring in ICU after surgery and thus shorter or eliminated intensive care unit (ICU) stay.

- Patients undergoing awake craniotomy have fewer neurological deficits (7% vs. 23%) and shorter hospital stays (1.7 vs. 9 days) than patients undergoing craniotomy under general anesthesia.

- Patients undergoing awake craniotomy under sedation do not need general anesthesia and avoid the risk inherent to general anesthesia, intubation, and mechanical ventilation.

- Postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting are also reduced in awake craniotomy compared with the craniotomy under general anesthesia.
