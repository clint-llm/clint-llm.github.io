The management of macular edema needs a stepwise therapeutic approach. Most of the cases can be treated with systemic and ocular pharmaceutical agents. Additionally, surgical management may be needed in selected cases.

**1. Systemic therapy**: The majority of the patients develop macular edema secondary to systemic health conditions like diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, or inflammatory conditions. Therefore, systemic treatment is of prime importance. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) showed that intensive therapy in type 1 diabetic patients decreased the incidence of CSME compared to conventional therapy. However, the difference did not reach statistical significance. It took nearly three years of intensive treatment for the beneficial effect to appear.

The United Kingdom prospective diabetes study (UKPDS) showed that strict sugar and blood pressure control slows macular edema development in Type 2 diabetic patients.

The action to control cardiovascular risks in diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid study found that a combination of fenofibrate and statins (increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases low-density lipoproteins (LDL) levels) led to a more significant reduction in the incidence of macular edema compared to statins alone (reduce LDL levels).

**2. Ocular topical medications: a)**Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): They reduce the production of prostaglandins by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase. Most studies show that NSAIDs have a beneficial role in IG syndrome. However, further well-designed RCTs are needed to confirm this.

**3. Ocular laser**: The various types of laser treatment include**:**

**a) Focal laser (Original ETDRS):**The focal lesions located within 500-3000 microns from the macular center are treated with moderate intensity, 50-100 µm sized burns of 50-100 ms duration. The**ETDRS**defined ‘focal lesions’ as microaneurysms, intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), and short capillary segments that leak on FFA. Whitening or darkening of focal lesions is considered the endpoint of treatment. Directly hitting the focal lesions reduces the leakage from them.

**b) Grid laser (Original ETDRS):**The area with a diffuse leak or nonperfusion (on FFA) located within 500-3000 microns from the macular center is treated with 50 to 200 microns sized burns of 50 to 500 ms duration placed two burn widths apart. Mild RPE whitening is considered the endpoint of treatment. In addition, the focal leaks within this area are treated focally. The possible mechanisms of action include improved oxygen supply to the inner retina as laser damages the oxygen-consuming photoreceptors and RPE; decrease in autoregulatory vasoconstriction; and restoration of the RPE barrier and the RPE pump.

**c) Modified ETDRS grid laser (mETDRS):**The only modification is that the burns should not be heavy to produce a change in the color of microaneurysms; merely mild gray-white burns evident beneath all microaneurysms is enough.

**d) Mild macular laser photocoagulation (MMG):**Light burns (barely visible or light grey) are placed over the whole macula (both thickened and normal retina). Microaneurysms are not treated directly.

The laser can be used for the treatment of macular edema secondary to various diseases.

a. Diabetic macular edema: The ETDRS showed that laser reduced the risk of moderate visual loss (VL) at 36 months. Moderate VL was defined as a loss of ≥15 ETDRS letters or doubling of the visual angle. It is recommended that a new treatment can be administrated after six weeks only if treatable lesions were missed during the initial treatment. Otherwise, repeat treatment should be administrated at least 4-months after the initial treatment.

The DRCR.net Protocol A reported that the MMG laser protocol was less effective in reducing the retinal thickness than the mETDRS protocol. However, the visual outcome was similar with both protocols.

b. Branch retinal vein occlusion: The Branch vein occlusion study (BVOS) reported that nearly one-third of cases improve spontaneously within the first three months. It showed that the eyes with persistent macular edema, visual acuity ≤20/40, and absence of macular ischemia on FFA had better visual outcomes (3 years) if treated with macular grid laser compared to observation. The grid laser spots were placed in the area of capillary leak located outside the edge of the foveal avascular zone and inside the major vascular arcades.

c.  Central retinal vein occlusion: Central vein occlusion study (CVOS) showed that macular grid laser reduced the angiographic evidence of macular edema. However, there was no visual benefit.

d. Retinal artery macroaneurysm: Leaking RAM can be treated with either direct or indirect laser or a combination of both. Direct laser is performed by applying 200 to 500 microns size, 200 to 500 ms duration burns over the microaneurysm to seal the aneurysm. However, this can weaken the already thin and distended wall of the aneurysm, potentially leading to aneurysm rupture, causing vitreous and/or pre-retinal hemorrhage and arterial occlusion. Indirect laser is performed by applying 100 to 200 ms duration confluent burns around the lesion. This reduces the oxygen demand of the surrounding tissue, which subsequently reduces the blood flow and pressure inside the aneurysm.

e. Optic nerve head pit: Juxtapapillary laser has been tried to create a barrier against fluid migrating from the optic nerve. However, the success rates have been low.

**4. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections**are the current standard of treatment for macular edema for most of the pathologies. The various molecules include:

a) Pegaptanib was the first drug to be approved for use in humans. It is a 40-kDa aptamer, i.e., mRNA polyethylene glycol-linked molecule that targets only VEGF165. It is currently not used for treatment.

b) Bevacizumab (1.25mg/0.05mL) is a 148-kDa humanized full-size monoclonal IgG1 antibody that targets all the subtypes of VEGF-A.

The DRCR.net Protocol H (Phase II trial) showed that intravitreal bevacizumab (IVB) could reduce DME in some eyes; however, the study was not designed to determine its beneficial role.

c) Ranibizumab (0.3 mg and 0.5mg/ 0.05 mL) is a 48-kDa humanized monoclonal antibody fragment (Fab) that targets all the subtypes of VEGF-A.

**Diabetic macular edema:**The RESOLVE trial (phase II trial) showed the efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab (IVR, 0.3 mg and 0.5 mg) over sham injections.**RISE and RIDE****trials**(two parallel phase III trials). They showed that IVR (0.3mg and 0.5 mg) was superior to sham injection in terms of both visual improvement and central retinal thickness reduction.

**Retinal vein occlusion**: The BRAVO trial (phase III trial) showed that the eyes with BRVO, which received six monthly IVR injections (0.3 mg and 0.5 mg), experienced superior visual improvement compared to sham injections. The visual acuity at 1-year was well maintained even after shifting to pro-re-nata (PRN) dosing for the next six months.

d) Aflibercept (2mg/ 0.05mL) is a 115-kDa fusion protein, i.e., a combination of the Fc portion of a monoclonal antibody; and high-affinity extracellular domains of VEGF receptor type-1 (R1) and VEGFR2. It targets VEGF-A and B; and placental growth factor (PlGF).

**Diabetic macular edema:**The DA VINCI study (phase II trial) showed that intravitreal aflibercept (IVA) achieved better anatomical and functional improvement compared to laser.

The DRCR.net Protocol**T**showed that there was no difference in the visual improvement at 1-year and 2-year among patients receiving either bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or aflibercept in case the initial best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/32-20/40. However, if the initial BCVA was ≤20/50, aflibercept was the most effective till the end of 1-year, and ranibizumab and aflibercept were equally effective at the end of 2-years.

The DRCR.net Protocol V showed that there was no significant difference in the visual loss at the end of 2-years among eyes with center-involving DME and BCVA≥20/25 irrespective of the treatment given (observation or laser or aflibercept). The study proposed that the eyes with good visual acuity should be observed and treated with aflibercept only if the visual acuity worsens.

**Retinal vein occlusion**: The VIBRANT study showed that six monthly aflibercept injections followed by bi-monthly injections helped achieve greater visual benefit and edema reduction than macular grid laser in eyes with BRVO-related macular edema at 24 and 52 weeks.

e) Brolicizumab (6mg/ 0.05mL) is a 26-kDa single-chain variable fragment that targets all subtypes of VEGF-A.

**5. Intravitreal steroids:**The molecules used include:

**a) Fluocinolone acetate**: Retisert (0.59mg) is a non-biodegradable implant. The implant was reported to achieve better visual and anatomic outcomes compared to laser in eyes with DME; however, the rates of cataract progression (91%) and IOP elevation (61.4% patients with IOP ≥30 mm Hg) was very high.

**b) IVTA:**The Standard care vs. corticosteroid for retinal vein occlusion (SCORE) trial (2009) showed that IVTA (1mg or 4mg) did not provide any significant benefit over the standard treatment (at that time, i.e., macular grid laser) in eyes with BRVO-related macular edema in terms of either visual acuity or foveal thickness. A significant proportion of eyes receiving IVTA developed cataracts and raised IOP. However, in eyes with CRVO-related macular edema, IVTA was superior to the standard treatment (at that time, i.e., observation). The safety profile of the 1-mg dose was superior to the 4-mg dose.

**c) Dexamethasone:**A biodegradable sustained-release device (0.7 mg) is implanted with the help of a 22-gauge injector. It received US FDA approval for the treatment of DME based on the results of the MEAD study. The study showed that the implant (0.7 mg and 0.35 mg) met the primary efficacy endpoint for visual improvement without the need for monthly injections. In the 0.7 mg group, 67.9% of eyes developed cataracts, 59.2% eyes underwent cataract surgery, 27.7% eyes had ≥10 mmHg IOP elevation, while only 2 required trabeculectomy surgery.

The DRCR.net protocol U showed that adding dexamethasone implant to continued IVR therapy is not likely to improve visual acuity (24 weeks) compared to continued IVR therapy alone among the eyes with persistent DME. However, the combined therapy is likely to reduce the retinal thickness and cause IOP elevation.
