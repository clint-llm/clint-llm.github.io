Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the non-invasive imaging techniques that have superior soft tissue contrasts and potential physiological and functional applications. As MRI does not expose the body to radiation, it has become a mainstay of non-invasive diagnostic radiology modality since the 1980s. MRI uses a very powerful magnetic field, rapidly changing magnetic fields, radio waves, and a computer to obtain detailed images. However, MRI is not without risks. As clinical demand for MRI has increased, healthcare professionals have to be trained in MRI safety to protect patients from the potential risks of MRI.

There are three major magnetic fields in an MRI scanner that have potential safety risks:

- The strong static magnetic field (B0) of MRI scanners can attract and accelerate ferromagnetic objects toward the center of the machine and turn them into dangerous projectiles. This magnetic field can also displace implants or affect the function of devices such as pacemakers and pumps.

- The radiofrequency (RF) field that is created by RF-coils can potentially cause tissue heating, especially in the presence of implants. Even non-ferromagnetic implants can cause heating due to eddy currents that propagate in metals exposed to oscillating magnetic fields.

- The Time-varying fast-switching gradient magnetic field function is a spatial encoding of the MRI signal and can stimulate muscles or peripheral nerves and induce implant heating. They also produce noise in the MRI scanner space, which can reach levels of 100 dB or more and damage the hearing system. Using hearing protection such as Headphones and earplugs are essential for patients and anybody present in the room during an MRI examination.

These magnetic fields in MRI scanners can cause five dangerous interactions in patients with metallic foreign bodies: projectile effect, twisting, burning, artifacts, and device malfunction (interference with a pacemaker).
