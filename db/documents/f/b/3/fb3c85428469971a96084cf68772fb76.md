There are approximately 11 hypotheses suggested as a possibleÂ causal factor for the development of heart failure.

- Viral myocarditis during a peripartum period possibly due to echovirus, coxsackievirus, parvovirus B19, human herpesvirus 6, Epstein bar virus, or human cytomegalovirus

- Unable to clear cardiac antigen autoantibodies due to reduced humoral immunity

- Inadequate response to hemodynamic stress of pregnancy

- Aggressive cardiac cell apoptosis

- Inflammation due to cytokines

- Selenium deficiency due to malnutrition

- Familial predisposition due to a genetic mode of transmission

- Increased prolactin effect on the heart

- Estrogen and progesterone effect

- Myocardial stunning due to adrenergic surge

- Myocardial ischemia
