The significance of obtaining simulation center accreditation lies in its support of best practices in a field where such practices may be the difference in a life or death outcome. To Err is Human, a report published by the Institute of Medicine, stated that over 400,000 deaths occur annually secondary to preventable medical errors. It has been noted that the majority of the sentinel events leading to these errors fall in the domains of leadership, communication, and teamwork.  This report significantly increased the interest in medical simulation as a platform that might address these domains in a meaningful way. Hence the credibility and value of medical simulation centers are at stake. Indeed, the next vital “phase” of simulation education research shall be the demonstration of translation of skills and learning in simulation centers to real clinical sites and, hopefully, better patient outcomes. Obtaining accreditation helps to ensure the creation of valuable curricula, onboarding skilled and qualified instructors and staff, and that policies and procedures are appropriately codified and formalized.
