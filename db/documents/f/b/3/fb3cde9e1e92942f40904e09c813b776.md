Cerebral perfusion imaging can be performed with a variety of different imaging modalities, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and nuclear imaging.

This article will focus on cerebral perfusion imaging in nuclear medicine, specifically single-photon emission CT (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). Both PET and SPECT have important roles in evaluating stroke, chronic cerebrovascular disease, and epilepsy, among other diagnoses, by providing qualitative and quantitative information about cerebral hemodynamics.
