Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are often seen in the body and tail region of the pancreas in middle-aged women. They are considered premalignant lesions and require surgical excision depending on the size and imaging features. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in surveillance and surgical treatment including post-surgical complications.
