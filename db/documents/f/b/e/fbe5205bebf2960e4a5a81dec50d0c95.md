Compromise of the optic nerve results in visual field defects and/or visual loss. The type of visual field defect depends on which region of the optic pathway is disrupted. Damage to the optic nerve anterior to the optic chiasm results in ipsilateral monocular vision loss. Damage at the optic chiasm disrupts the nasal retinal fibers of both eyes resulting in a loss of both temporal visual fields. This is termed bitemporal hemianopia and may result from a pituitary adenoma compressing the optic chiasm. Damage to the optic tract results in contralateral homonymous hemianopia. For example, a lesion in the right optic tract results in a loss of the left visual fields of both eyes.

Damage to the optic nerve may also attenuate the pupillary light reflex resulting in an afferent pupillary defect (APD) or a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD), also known as a Marcus Gunn pupil. When light is directed at an eye with a healthy optic nerve, constriction of both pupils is achieved. When light is directed at an eye with an APD or RAPD, a reduced amount of constriction occurs. The difference in pupil constrictions can be appreciated by performing the swinging flashlight test. For example, when performing the swinging flashlight test on a patient with a right APD or RAPD, both pupils constrict appropriately when a light is directed into the left eye. When light is directed into the abnormal right eye, both pupils mildly constrict and appear to be dilated. The light is then directed back to the left eye and both pupils again constrict appropriately. The difference in pupil constrictions is a result of damaged afferent retinal fibers originating from the right eye. Pathologies affecting the optic nerve and severe retinal diseases may result in an RAPD. Optic neuropathies, such as glaucoma; optic neuritis, as seen in multiple sclerosis, and severe macular degeneration may all cause an RAPD.
