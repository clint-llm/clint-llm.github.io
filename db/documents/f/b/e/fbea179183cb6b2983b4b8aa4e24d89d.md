Diagnosis of pilar cysts is mainly clinical, based on signs and symptoms and additional investigations rarely need to be done. Radiological studies sometimes are needed to exclude other differentials, especially with midline head and neck lesions and to check for the extent of the lesion and the involvement of the underlying central nervous system (CNS). CT scan is the best way to determine the extent of bone invasion. MRI can be used for more deeper soft tissue involvement and to visualize very tiny invasion.
