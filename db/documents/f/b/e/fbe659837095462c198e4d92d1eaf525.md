Many medical conditions rely upon strict numerical definitions to provide a diagnosis: diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, for example. In the case of brow ptosis, diagnosis is determined predominantly by the judgment and experience of the examining physician. Brow ptosis exists when inferior malposition of the brow interferes with aesthetics or function; therefore, the brow level deemed low in one person may be perfectly acceptable or "normal" in another. With the brow being a mobile structure and prone to the secondary effects of age, solar elastosis, muscle action, trauma, and gravity, some degree of brow descent will eventually occur in everyone. Ideal brow position is regarded differently in different genders, races, ages, and even generations. In some communities, the concept of changing the brow's position or shape is considered anathema; in many Western societies, however, it is considered routine. This activity describes the pathophysiology of brow ptosis, its presentation, and the role of mid-forehead brow lift to reverse ptosis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of brow ptosis.
- Review the indications for brow lifting.
- Summarize the complications of the mid-forehead brow lift procedure.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients who undergo mid-forehead brow lifting.
