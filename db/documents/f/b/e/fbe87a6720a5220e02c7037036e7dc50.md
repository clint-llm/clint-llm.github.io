Patients at risk for pulmonary oxygen toxicity should be monitored for oxygen saturation and elevated work of breathing. They can be evaluated by pulmonary function testing and chest x-ray which can show signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Similarly, eye exams assessing acuity and looking for lens opacification can be done to detect early ocular oxygen toxicity. CNS toxicity manifests as described above and will often have associated tachycardia and diaphoresis. Aborting a hyperbaric exposure when these signs are present can prevent seizure occurrence
