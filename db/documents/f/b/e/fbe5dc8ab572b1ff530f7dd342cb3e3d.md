Beta-blockers are readily absorbed when ingested with peak absorption within one to four hours except for sustained-release preparations. Absorption may also be delayed in cases involving the co-ingestion of drugs which can decrease gastrointestinal motility. While most of the beta-blockers are moderately lipophilic, certain beta-blockers have extensive lipophilicity and have a large volume of distribution. Propranolol, the most lipophilic beta-blocker, can easily cross the lipid cell and blood-brain barrier and may cause seizures in overdose cases.

The liver excretes beta-blockers most frequently. Atenolol, carteolol, and nadolol are the only exceptions that undergo renal excretion. Various beta-blockers may cause sodium or potassium channel blockade and therefore cause prolongation in QRS and QTc interval, respectively. Sodium channel blocking beta-blockers are said to possess “membrane stabilizing activity” which potentiates toxicity in overdose.
