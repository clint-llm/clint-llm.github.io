Vecuronium bromide is an FDA-approved peripherally acting, monoquarternary, steroidal, non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker with an intermediate duration of action used during general anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation, to aid in surgical relaxation, and, less commonly, in the intensive care setting to achieve paralysis to facilitate mechanical ventilation for adequately sedated patients. This neuromuscular blocking agent is often used to facilitate endotracheal intubation and surgical relaxation in patients under general anesthesia. This activity provides an overview of the indications, mechanism of action, methods and timing of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring for vecuronium use to be successfully dosed as part of a general anesthesia process.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indicated uses for vecuronium as part of the anesthesia process.
- Summarize the adverse event profile for vecuronium, including how monitoring can help prevent adverse reactions.
- Describe the relative and absolute contraindications for vecuronium use.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use typhoid vecuronium to improve patient outcomes during general anesthesia.
