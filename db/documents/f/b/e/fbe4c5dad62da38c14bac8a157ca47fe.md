Leeches are hermaphroditic parasites of phylum Annelida and class Hirudinea. There are over 600 species of leeches. A minority of these are sanguinivorous and the cause of human morbidity. Historically, leeches have been used for medicinal purposes with the earliest recorded being 1500 BC. Leeches have continued to be used in modern medicine primarily in reconstructive surgery. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of leech bites and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.
