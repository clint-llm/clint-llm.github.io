Ancillary study testing should target the suspected toxin envenomation. In the case of unknown exposure and signs of systemic toxicity, a broad initial workup should take place. Laboratory testing would include a complete blood count, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen in the case of suspected hemotoxin and a creatinine kinase, basic electrolytes, and urinalysis for possible developing hematuria or proteinuria. For cases of neurotoxicity, the patient requires end-tidal CO2 monitoring, or serial arterial blood gases to evaluate for developing respiratory acidosis. They should also undergo frequent neurologic checks to monitor the progression of the toxicity. There has been the development of rapid venom testing within some centers (mostly Australia), but the data shows that these are only useful to confirm the suspected species of envenomation and that a negative result cannot exclude a particular species.

Additionally, the wound site should be monitored carefully for the spread of edema, development of blisters, or signs of compartment syndrome. If compartment syndrome becomes a concern clinically, the definitive diagnosis is possible by obtaining a direct compartment pressure. If this is greater than 30 mmHg of pressure, it is consistent with the early development of compartment syndrome.
