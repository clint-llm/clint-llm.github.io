Bullosis diabeticorum (BD), also known as diabetic bullae or bullous eruption of diabetes mellitus, is a specific type of skin lesion occurring in patients with diabetes mellitus. Kramer first reported it in 1930, and Rocca and Pereyra later described it in 1963. The term “bullosis diabeticorum” was then introduced in 1967 by Cantwell & Martz.
