The MMR vaccine stimulates the immune system to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella. This vaccine is live attenuated and thus is a harmless, less virulent version of the infectious agents from which it provides protection. Since the MMR vaccine is live attenuated, it has excellent efficacy but requires more than one dose to achieve this immunity.
