**Hypercalcemia**

Hypercalcemia is defined as calcium levels elevated above 10.4 mg/dL or ionized serum calcium above 5.2 mg/dL.

Patients who are asymptomatic with albumin-corrected calcium levels less than 12 mg/dL are advised to avoid precipitating factors such as dehydration, inactivity, a calcium diet greater than 1000 mg/day, and certain medications (lithium carbonate, thiazides).

Treatment with normal saline is the most beneficial early management of these patients. The addition of calcitonin should result in a significant reduction of serum calcium within 48 hours. Furthermore, administering bisphosphonates will provide a more sustained effect that will reduce calcium levels in two to four days.

**Hypocalcemia**

Hypocalcemia is defined as total serum calcium levels below 8.8 mg/dL or ionized serum calcium below 4.7 mg/dL.

The physical exam could likely demonstrate contraction of facial muscles ipsilaterally by tapping on the skin overlying the facial nerve (Chvostek sign) and painful carpal spasms with wrist flexion and interphalangeal joint extension while the blood pressure cuff is set 20 mmHg above the patient’s systolic pressure (Trousseau’s signs).

Hypocalcemia can occur due to diseases, treatments, medications, and electrolyte abnormalities. Metabolic alkalosis can cause decreased serum ionized calcium due to calcium-binding albumin more readily during alkalotic states. Chronic diseases of note are hypoparathyroidism, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and vitamin D deficiency.

Other medications of note that can result in hypocalcemia are the long-term use of corticosteroids, antiepileptics, aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and bisphosphonates.

Treatment for hypocalcemia depends on the severity of the symptoms. Patients experiencing mild symptoms should be treated with calcitriol 0.5 mcg orally twice daily and calcium in the combined form of calcium carbonate taken with the dose of 500 mg orally four times daily to achieve optimal absorption. There are several options in which calcium can be administered. Calcium carbonate can be taken orally via pill, or it can be crushed and mixed with liquid. The absorption of calcium carbonate is dependent on stomach acidity. For better absorption, it may be taken with food or substituted with calcium citrate to stimulate an acidic environment.

On the other hand, calcium gluconate is available in liquid form. In severely symptomatic patients with hypocalcemia, it is essential to maintain a calcium level above 8 mg/dL (2 mmol/L). Hence calcium gluconate can be administered by continuous intravenous drip infused over 10-20 minutes to avoid cardiac complications such as arrhythmias.

**Hypocalciuria**

Hypocalciuria can occur due to medications, diseases, and genetic disorders. Common medications that result in reduced urine calcium are thiazides and estrogen. Genetic conditions such as familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), an autosomal dominant disease that decreases the sensitivity of calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) of the parathyroid gland, maintain serum calcium levels at an elevated baseline with resulting hypocalciuria.

**Hypercalciuria**

Hypercalciuria can occur as an effect of medications, diseases, and genetic disorders. Common medications involved are spironolactone, corticosteroids, and acetazolamide.
