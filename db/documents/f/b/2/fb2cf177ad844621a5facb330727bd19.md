Diagnostic ultrasound is a powerful, minimally-invasive tool that improves the diagnostic accuracy of clinical examinations when employed at the bedside. Understanding ultrasound physics is critical to image acquisition, image optimization, image interpretation, and ultimately clinical integration. Once aware of ultrasound principles and how machines use them to manipulate sound waves, sonographers can best utilize the available tools to optimize the clinical utility of diagnostic ultrasound.

Specifically, the ability to discern normal from pathologic findings also requires understanding how sound waves interact with different tissues and how primary ultrasound functions are used to best display the differentiation. Sonographers who examine patients without applying ultrasound physics principles at the bedside competently will struggle to leverage the technology for timely and accurate diagnosis.
