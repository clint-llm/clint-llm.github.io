Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common retinal vascular disease and is a common loss of vision in older patients. There are two types of RVO: Branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Central retinal vein occlusion is an occlusion of the main retinal vein posterior to the lamina cribrosa of the optic nerve and is typically caused by thrombosis. Central retinal vein occlusion is further divided into two categories: non-ischemic (perfused) and ischemic (nonperfused). Non-ischemic CRVO is the most common, accounting for about 70% of cases. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is often better than 20/200. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of CRVO.
- Outline the patient history and physical exam findings associated with CRVO.
- Review the treatment considerations for patients with CRVO.
- Summarize the importance of care coordination and collaboration among the interprofessional team in the treatment of CRVO.
