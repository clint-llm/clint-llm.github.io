One of the strategies used in rehabilitation to help recover arm muscles (for example, after surgery) is to stimulate the healthy contralateral arm. The basis for this therapy is the phenomenon known as crossed facilitation. When the healthy arm is in motion, through corticospinal projections, it activates the nerve fibers of the arm to be recovered are activated. If the spinal cord is injured, this mechanism may have decreased.

Constant pain in the cervical area for various causes could alter the arthro-kinematics of the arm, prolonging or causing chronic neck dysfunction.

The fascial osteopathic approach to the arm muscles can raise the pain threshold by acting on the peripheral receptors of the connective tissue. When the problem causing muscle pain is long-lasting, the proprioceptors can send nociceptive information; by changing the mechanical status of the muscle area, it is possible to improve mechanical afferents and reduce the sensation of pain.
