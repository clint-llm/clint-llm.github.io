Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, and coronary artery bypass graft is considered the mainstay for the treatment of severe multi-vessel coronary artery disease. The internal mammary artery is the gold-standard bypass conduit and is associated with significant improvement in short and long-term outcomes and survival of patients. This activity describes the coronary artery bypass graft surgery using the internal mammary artery and highlights the role of the interprofessional team and multidisciplinary approach in optimizing the management of patients undergoing this complicated procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the clinical benefits of internal mammary artery-coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to internal mammary artery bypass.
- Explain the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and their clinical significance with internal mammary artery bypass.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance internal mammary artery bypass and improve outcomes.
