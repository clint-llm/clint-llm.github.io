Other lysosomal storage diseases should be kept in the differentials, especially Gaucher disease, Tay-Sachs disease, and Metachromatic leukodystrophy. Gaucher disease also presents with hepatosplenomegaly and cytopenias, but bone pain and lesions are more prominent. The deficient enzyme in Gaucher disease is glucocerebrosidase, which leads to the accumulation of glucocerebroside inside cells instead of sphingomyelin, which is found in Niemann-Pick disease. Tay-Sachs disease, although it does not present with hepatosplenomegaly, neurodegeneration, developmental delay, and cherry-red spot on the macula, are prominent features. The deficient enzymeÂ here is hexosaminidase A which causes a buildup of GM2 gangliosides. Metachromatic leukodystrophy causes central and peripheral demyelination and can manifest as ataxia or other neurological symptoms.

Apart from these, other diseases affecting the liver and brain should be kept in mind based on the initial presentation.
