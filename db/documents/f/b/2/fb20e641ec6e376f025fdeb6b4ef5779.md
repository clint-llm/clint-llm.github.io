DJS is a benign disease, does not progress to fibrosis or development of cirrhosis, and does not require any treatment. The importance of diagnosing DJS is to eliminate the possibility of other hepatobiliary disorders that may cause hepatic injury and diagnose those which may be potentially treatable. Phenobarbital and ursodeoxycholic acid are therapeutic for significant cholestasis that occurs in neonatal DJS.
