Sometimes painless cutaneous papillomas may be left untreated and regress with time. They seem to not increase in size over time, and the potential for malignant transformation is low in immunocompetent individuals. If treatment is indicated, it varies depending on the type, size, and location of the papilloma.

- Skin warts and genital warts are managed with topical medications or procedures, such as cryotherapy or laser surgery.

- Skin warts may also be removed by excision (whether cutting it with a scalpel or cauterizing it).

- Surgical removal is a primary treatment for papillomas of the brain, breast ducts, and respiratory tract.

- Papillomas tend to recur around the primary site of infection, and the need for retreatment may be required.

- No-touch techniques of surgical removal with cryotherapy have been found to help prevent viral dissemination and reduce the papilloma recurrence.
