**Stages of Labor**

There are 3 stages of labor. Delivery of the fetus occurs in the second stage ofÂ labor.****

- Stage 1: Passage of cervical mucus plug. Dilation and effacement of the cervix

- Stage 2: Starts once the cervix is fully dilated at 10 cm and ends after delivery of the fetus

- Stage 3: Delivery of the placenta

Indications that it is time for the mother to give birth include a strong urge to push, more intense contractions occurring every 2 to 5 minutes, and the fetal head beginning to crown.
