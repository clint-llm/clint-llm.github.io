In the 1980s, researchers discovered that virtually all cervical cancer cases were caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). There are more than 100 types of HPV, and 40 can be transmitted sexually, while 15 are considered "high-risk HPV" or cancer-causing. There are two subtypes of HPV, 16 and 18, which cause about 70% of cervical cancers worldwide.

Cervical infection with high-risk HPV is usually required for the development of cervical cancer. However, HPV infection alone is not sufficient for progression to neoplasia. Most infections with high-risk HPV are transient and do not progress to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). A small portion of women infected with high-risk HPV will develop cervical cancer. Cigarette smoking, a compromised immune system, and HIV infection are all cofactors in HPV persistence.
