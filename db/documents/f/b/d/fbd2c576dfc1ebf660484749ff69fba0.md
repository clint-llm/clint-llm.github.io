The face musculature arises from prechordal mesenchyme and the unsegmented paraxial mesoderm. The prechordal mesenchyme derives from the prechordal plate, which is in front of and on the tip of the anterior notochord. The musculature will have multiple functions, including feeding, relaxing, breathing, and more.
