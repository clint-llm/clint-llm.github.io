Presbycusis is multifactorial in origin.****In addition to age-related degeneration leading to physiologic and anatomic changes, other contributing factors include genetic factors, hormones, exposure to loud noises or ototoxic agents, history of ear infection, and the presence of certain systemic diseases.

**Age-Related Factors**

Presbycusis can be broken down further with regards to which structures and functions are primarily affected. Some argue that there is little clinical utility in subdividing presbycusis as there is no significant change in approach or treatment, and oftentimes mixed pathology is present.

- Sensory presbycusis: loss of receptor hair cells at the basal aspect of the cochlea resulting in characteristic high-frequency hearing loss.

- Neural presbycusis: loss of cochlear nerve fibers as well as the loss of spiral ganglion neurons.

- Strial presbycusis: degeneration of stria vascularis cells. These cells are essential for maintaining the appropriate ion composition of endolymph to generate the endocochlear potential for signal transduction.

- Mechanical presbycusis (cochlear conductive): due to physical changes of the cochlear duct. This is accompanied by a specific audiogram pattern.

- Mixed presbycusis: characterized by pathologic changes in more than one of the above structures.

- Indeterminate presbycusis: cases in which changes to the above structures are not significant.

**Genetic Factors**

Genetic factors, specifically, differences in mitochondrial DNA expression genes related to oxidative stress, have been found in patients with presbycusis when compared to controls.

**Ototoxic Factors**

There are multiple medications associated with ototoxicity, including salicylates, loop diuretics, aminoglycoside, and certain chemotherapeutic agents.****Minimizing exposure to these agents can help to prevent age-related hearing loss.

**Noise Exposure Factors**

Some long-term studies have shown that individuals who have sustained noise-induced cochlear damage in their youth go on to develop more severe presbycusis**.**Anatomically, noise exposure may lead to damage and subsequent loss of spiral ganglion neurons.

**Hormonal Factors**

Glucocorticoids, sex hormones, and glutamate signaling are thought to play a role in presbycusis.
