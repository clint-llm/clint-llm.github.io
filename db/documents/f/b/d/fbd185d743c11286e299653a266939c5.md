Mitral valve repair is commonly used to treat mitral valve pathology due to mitral regurgitation. Mitral regurgitation (MR) is classified as primary or secondary, depending on whether the lesion is located at the mitral valve apparatus or due to left ventricular changes. This activity reviews and highlights the role of an interprofessional care team in managing patients who undergo mitral valve repair.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the relevant anatomy, indications, and contraindications for mitral valve repair.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to mitral valve repair.
- Review appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of mitral valve repair. 
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance mitral valve repair and improve outcomes.
