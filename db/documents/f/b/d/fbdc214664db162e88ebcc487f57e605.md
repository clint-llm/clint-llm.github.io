For operative technique, an upper midline incision is made, once, inside the abdomen, entrance to lesser sac is created with harmonic scalpel. Kocherization of the duodenum is performed. Once the pancreas is identified, the tissue is dissected where the IPMN is involved. As much as possible, the pancreatic parenchyma should be preserved to ameliorate the side effects of diabetes mellitus and exocrine insufficiency secondary to missing pancreatic tissue. One trick for intraoperative surgery is to palpate the duct of the pancreas. If it feels dilated, then it has to be resected as it needs to be assumed that it is dilated due to increased mucin production (abnormal). Confirm negative margins with a frozen section by sending to pathology.
