- Increased mortality risk among preterm and VLBW infants

- Increased morbidity among preterm infants. More severe outcomes occur with prolonged hyperglycemia. Neonates with hyperglycemia have an increased risk of following, 

- Intracranial hemorrhage 

- Hyperglycemia may cause Intracranial hemorrhage by causing hyperosmolarity with osmotic shifts.
- Each increment of 18 mg/dL in blood glucose concentration accounts for a rise of 1 mOsm/L in serum osmolarity.  If serum osmolarity exceeds 300 mOsm/L, rapidly shifting water may cause cerebral hemorrhage.


- Dehydration due to osmotic diuresis
- Electrolyte imbalance occurs due to osmotic diuresis. Glycosuria also increases sodium excretion. 
- NEC
- Retinopathy of prematurity
- Bronchopulmonary disease 
- Impaired immunity and increased risk of sepsis
- Poor wound healing

- Long term impact 

- Adverse neurodevelopmental outcome
- Insulin resistance and glucose intolerance

- Side effects due to the management 

- Insulin infusion increases the risks of hypokalemia and hypoglycemia.
