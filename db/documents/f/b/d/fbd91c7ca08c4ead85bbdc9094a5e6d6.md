The leakage of CSF from the craniospinal vault is thought to be the cause of spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Normally, the weight of the brain is nearly 1500 grams in air. This weight is decreased to about 48 grams in a pool of CSF due to the buoyancy provided by the fluid.

Another hypothesis for the underlying mechanism of precipitation of headache in spontaneous intracranial hypotension is that there is an increase in compliance at the lower end of CSF spinal space whenever there is a spinal CSF leak. The lack of equilibrium in the craniospinal elasticity precipitates orthostatic headaches. Other supporting evidence for this hypothesis is the fact that orthostatic headaches are more common with spinal CSF leakage as compared to cranial CSF leakage (e.g., with CSF otorrhea or CSF rhinorrhea).

Connective tissue disorder can also be the underlying cause of the development of spontaneous CSF leaks. The connective tissue abnormality, which includes abnormalities of fibrillin or elastin, can cause dural weakness, which eventually plays a role in causing spontaneous low CSF pressure due to cryptic CSF leaks.

There are different events that can incite a rupture of spinal epidural cysts, a tear of the dural nerve sheath, or the rupture of perineural cysts.

In rare cases, a CSF venous fistula can develop between the subarachnoid space and their adjacent spinal epidural veins. There is direct drainage of CSF from subarachnoid space into spinal epidural veins without the formation of any dural defect.
