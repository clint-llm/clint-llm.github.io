**Value of Poison Centers**

Poison centers have evolved to serve a unique and key role in both direct patient care and public health.  They serve as an easily accessible and cost-effective resource for healthcare professionals and the public alike and provide access to the most up to date and evidence-based information on exposures to poison.  Finally, the ongoing robust data gathering has significant potential to assist in the understanding of the evolving public health crisis of drug abuse and drug-related deaths that exists in the United States.  Clinicians are encouraged to continue to use poison center services and report all poison exposures.
