In late 2018, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) announced that it had incorporated IFR into its updated revascularization guidelines. [Level of Evidence: Class 1 A] The recommendations noted that IFR should be performed alongside FFRÂ for the objective assessment of the hemodynamic relevance of coronary lesions. At this time the current AHA/ACC guidelines do not formally address the use of IFR during coronary revascularization.

While an invasive cardiologist performs the procedure, the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and internist should give the patient information on the importance of lifestyle changes to lower the risk of coronary artery disease.
