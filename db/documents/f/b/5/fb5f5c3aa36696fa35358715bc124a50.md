Absorptive Hypercalciuria is the most common type of excessive urinary calcium excretion. It is found in about 50% of all calcium stone forming patients. Increased gastrointestinal calcium absorption increases serum calcium levels while lowering serum Vitamin D and parathyroid hormone levels. Only about 20% of ingested calcium is absorbed, normally taking place in the duodenum. A Vitamin D dependent version of absorptive hypercalciuria can be identified by its relatively high serum Vitamin D levels.

Renal Calcium Leak Hypercalciuria is found in about 5% to 10% of all hypercalciuric stone formers. It is caused by a renal defect that causes an obligatory loss of calcium in the urine regardless of serum calcium levels or dietary calcium intake. This is usually accompanied by hypocalcemia and an increase in serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels. The calcium/creatinine ratio tends to be high in this condition (usually greater than 0.20), and there is an association with Medullary Sponge Kidney.

Renal Phosphate Leak Hypercalciuria is perhaps the most interesting from a pathophysiological point of view. A renal defect causes excessive urinary phosphate excretion which leads to hypophosphatemia. This induces higher Vitamin D activation in the kidney which increases intestinal phosphate absorption to correct the low serum phosphate. Unfortunately, the extra Vitamin D also increases intestinal calcium absorption. The extra calcium absorbed is eventually excreted in the urine resulting in hypercalciuria. This type of hypercalciuria is Vitamin D dependent and is relatively unresponsive to thiazides. The diagnosis is made by the findings of low or low-normal serum phosphate, hypercalciuria, high urinary phosphate, and high serum Vitamin D3 levels with normal serum calcium and PTH levels.

Resorptive Hypercalciuria accounts for only about 3% to 5% of all hypercalciuric patients and is almost always due to hyperparathyroidism. Sustained, inappropriate, and excessive serum parathyroid hormone causes a release of calcium from the bone leading to osteopenia and hypercalcemia. Eventually, the hypercalcemia overcomes the normal parathyroid hormone effect of decreasing urinary calcium excretion, and the result is hypercalciuria (e.g., similar to spilling sugar in the urine in diabetics). This explains why hypercalciuria from hypercalcemia is less for any given elevated serum calcium level in patients with hyperparathyroidism than in other patients who are hypercalcemic.

Pregnancy increases hypercalciuria during all three trimesters, but this does not appear to increase the risk of new stone disease as there is also an increase in kidney stone inhibitors.

Cortical bone is more affected by hypercalciuria than cortical bone. Interestingly, bone mineral density is inversely related with hypercalciuria in nephrolithiasis patients but not in patients without nephrolithiasis.

In children, there is an apparent connection between recurrent abdominal pain and hypercalciuria. A recent study has connected hypercalciuric pediatric kidney stone patients with an increase in their urinary excretion of lipid metabolism/transport-related proteins. This suggests that abnormalities in lipid metabolism may be responsible or connected in some way to pediatric hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis.
