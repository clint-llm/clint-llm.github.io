Bloodborne pathogens pose a significant risk to health care workers; consequently, employers are faced with many challenges related to controlling the frequency of exposures and transmission in a hospital setting. The cost of healthcare-associated diseases and percutaneous injuries is high, and the emotional burden on health care workers immeasurable. Administrative, behavioral, and engineering interventions have been mandated to reduce the frequency of exposure and prevent the transmission of bloodborne pathogens.  Support is essential at every institution level to monitor compliance with mandated interventions, thus ensuring a safe workplace environment.  The occupational health and safety professionals who are part of a multidisciplinary team consisting of physicians, nurses, safety professionals, and occupational health psychologists are pivotal in delivering essential overarching support to the institution’s healthcare team.

Adequate and regular interprofessional training of all employees with a reasonable risk of occupational exposure is key to this process. While experts in their field of medicine, clinicians may not be as familiar with the current strategies related to the transmission and prevention of bloodborne pathogens and benefit from this type of training. Similarly, non-clinical employees who have no prior experience in handling hazardous materials or potentially infectious tissue or materials but are occupationally exposed will also benefit from this type of training. All participants must measure proficiency in handling potentially infectious materials and sharps before starting their assigned work activities. Training of the entire healthcare team will increase the overall awareness of occupational hazards, positively affecting healthcare team outcomes.

Even with a well-developed plan and comprehensive employee training, accidents will happen, and exposure to bloodborne pathogens will occur. Knowledge of post-exposure protocols is of critical importance to minimize harm to the employee. While not all exposures are preventable, the number of accidents has been significantly reduced by using safer medical devices, including needleless systems and sharps disposal containers.

Both employers and the healthcare team have a shared responsibility to meet the patient's needs and minimize the exposure and transmission of infectious disease. As it affects so many people on the healthcare team, the outcomes of this multifactorial, comprehensive risk-reduction standard must be measured and followed. multifactorial. From a healthcare worker safety lens, improvement in outcomes requires workers to be comfortable recognizing risks, attentive participation to training, reporting incidents, and adapting to the challenging and potentially hazardous situations associated with working in a healthcare setting. From the safety lens of healthcare workers, the goal of outcome improvement necessitates that workers recognize risks, are active participants in their training, and are adaptable to the ever-changing situations faced as employees in a healthcare setting.
