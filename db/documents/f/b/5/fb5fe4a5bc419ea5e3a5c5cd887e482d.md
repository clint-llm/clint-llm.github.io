LAM can present sporadically (S-LAM) or can be associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC-LAM); however, pathologically, these two types are indistinguishable.

The etiology of LAM is not known; however, the genetic and hormonal etiologies have been recently elucidated based on the following:

- The disease is exacerbated by high estrogen states points towards a hormonal role.

- The genetic predisposition and various mutations have been linked to both types of LAM (S-LAM and SCL-LAM).

- The sporadic form affects almost only premenopausal women, although some rare cases were reported to occur in men.

- The most common type of LAM, TSC-LAM, is an autosomal dominant genetic disease and is considered the most common type of LAM.

- TSC genes function as tumor suppressor genes. TSC1 encodes hamartin and TSC2 encodes tuberin. These two key genes are linked to a complex called TBC1D7, which regulates the kinase mechanistic target of the rapamycin (called mTOR).

- The mutations in the TSC genes, such as TSC2 mutation, have been linked to causing overactivation of the mTOR pathway leading to defects in smooth muscle cell proliferation and the formation of benign tumors (angiomyolipomas) in multiple organs that are commonly seen in LAM.

- Mutations in TSC2 account for the majority (75%) of TSC cases.
