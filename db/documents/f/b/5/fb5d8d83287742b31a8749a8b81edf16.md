The CD4 count normal range is 500 to 1500 cell/mm^3. If aÂ patient is left untreated, levels can drop below 200 cells/mm^3, which is one indication for the diagnosis of AIDS. The broad range in the normal value is the product of three variables: the white blood cell count, the percentage of lymphocytes, and the percentage of lymphocytes that bears the CD4 receptor.
