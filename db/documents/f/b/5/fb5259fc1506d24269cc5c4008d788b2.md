Prognosis is heavily influenced by initial exposure and a decrease in visual acuity as well as time to treatment with steroids. Patients with mild exposure and minimal symptoms who were treated early with steroids all improved within days to months. Patients with severe exposure, systemic effects, visual acuity worse than 20/200, or requiring surgical intervention faired much worse; with reported cases of persistent corneal scarring and neovascularization, limbal cell failure with conjunctival overgrowth and permanent vision loss, and best-corrected visual acuity worse than or equal to 20/100 after treatment.
