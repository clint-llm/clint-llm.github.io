Due to the long half-life of luspatercept, toxicity is not of significant concern. Dosing should be monitored according to hemoglobin levels and should not exceed 1.25 mg/kg in the treatment of beta-thalassemia and 1.75mg/kg in treating lower-risk MDS to avoid toxicity. The main concerns are adverse events, including bone pain, fatigue,Â diarrhea, asthenia, nausea, and dizziness, as well as general physical health deterioration.
