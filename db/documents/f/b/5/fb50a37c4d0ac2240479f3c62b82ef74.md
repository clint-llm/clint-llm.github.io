Patient care transfer can be defined as moving a patient from one flat surface to another. The most common patient transfers are from a bed to a stretcher and from a bed to a wheelchair. While seemingly intuitive, successful patient transfers rely on understanding each patient’s specific needs while simultaneously adhering to evidence-based guidelines. Patient care transfer can also be defined as transferring patients within the same facility and between facilities.

Patient care transfers are an essential yet often neglected aspect of patient care. Patient care transfers are an indispensable aspect of patient care, requiring rigorous adherence to clinical guidelines.

Depending on the complexity, patients often receive care in multiple settings during and after hospitalization. While some aspects of patient transport vary depending on the patient’s status, intrahospital transports are inevitable, particularly in critically ill patients. Poorly organized patient transfers can result in increased morbidity and mortality and should be performed with careful attention.
