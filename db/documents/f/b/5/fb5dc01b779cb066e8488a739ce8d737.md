Optic nerve drusen are refractive, calcified nodules located within the optic disc, the most anterior part of the optic nerve. The optic disc is visible in the retina on indirect fundoscopy. Anatomically, optic nerve drusen are located just anterior to the lamina cribrosa and are most commonly seen in the nasal part of the disc.

These largely acellular calcifications, usually detected incidentally on an exam, may progress and become more visible during earlier decades of life but rarely change significantly over a patient's lifetime and are generally asymptomatic.

Superficial drusen can be diagnosed clinically; however, deeper or buried drusen may give the appearance of a swollen disc or edema (i.e., papilledema or bilateral disc swelling secondary to increased intracranial pressure) and require further evaluation and testing to confirm the diagnosis.

While drusen may give the appearance of disc edema or swelling, or pseudo papilledema, the presence of drusen does not exclude the presence of actual edema. For example, there is a high prevalence of nerve drusen in young patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.
