Diagnosis of PDPH is clinical, and laboratory studies or imaging are typically not necessary. Severe or persistent cases, especially those which no longer are alleviated with recumbent positioning should prompt neuroimaging to exclude subdural hematoma or cerebral or venous thrombosis.

Lumbar puncture in patients suspected of PDPH is discouraged (since this would likely exacerbate symptoms) but would demonstrate low to even negative (less than zero) CSF opening pressure. CSF may reveal white and red blood cells, elevated protein levels or xanthochromia.

In patients with long-standing PDPH or intracranial hypotension, MRI with gadolinium enhancement may demonstrate descent of the cerebellar tonsils (similar to a Chiari type 1 malformation), effacement of the basilar cisterns, thickening of the meninges, subdural fluid accumulation, venous sinus engorgement and an enlarged pituitary gland. These changes are reversible with treatment. Effacement of the basilar cisterns can also be seen on computerized tomography (CT) brain imaging and could be confused with subarachnoid hemorrhage. CT myelography or MRI of theÂ spine can reveal the location and extent of CSF leak.
