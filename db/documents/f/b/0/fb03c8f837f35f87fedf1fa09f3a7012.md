As the nevus sebaceus tends to appear in infancy, it may be first evaluated by a pediatric primary care provider, such as a physician or nurse practitioner. When a lesion is in its early stage (smooth) and small, reassurance is appropriate. If the lesion is of significant cosmetic concern, or if it appears that a secondary neoplasm has developed within the nevus sebaceus, referral to a dermatologist is warranted. A biopsy or excision may be performed if indicated. When the nevus sebaceus is very large, and reconstruction may be highly complex and involve tissue expansion, for example, a referral to a plastic surgeon should be considered. If there are any of the aforementioned extracutaneous features present on physical examination, a referral to neurology is appropriate to investigate other central nervous system conditions that may manifest as a part of theÂ nevus sebaceus syndrome. Other subspecialists such as an orthopedist or ophthalmologist may be consulted as indicated. The subspecialists should report any relevant diagnoses and recommendations to the primary care provider when longitudinal follow-up is needed.
