Patients affected with lymphomatoid papulosis are at risk of developing another hematological disorder, mainly mycosis fungoides, erythrodermic T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, or large-cell CD30+ lymphoma. The hematological malignancy may precede, follow, or be concomitant with the appearance of lymphomatoid papulosis. This risk varies from 2% to 15% after 5 years of evolution, but it increases with the duration ofÂ the disease. Older age and especially the presence of a T-cell clone in the papulosis lesions are significant risk factors for the occurrence of a second haemopathy.
