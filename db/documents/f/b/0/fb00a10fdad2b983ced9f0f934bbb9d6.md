As demonstrated by the pressure-volume loops, left ventricular myocardial function is determined by the combination of preload, afterload, and contractility. Thus, changes in preload are associated with a myriad of different clinical scenarios.

Increases in preload, as demonstrated through an elevated PCW, are seen in several conditions such as heart failure, mitral stenosis, and mitral regurgitation. At higher preloads, the heart also has an increased oxygen demand, further debilitating the already diseased heart. Â In cases of heart failure, eventually, the heart cannot keep up with the increased load, and deleterious ventricular remodeling and loss of function ensue.

Abnormally low preload is associated with several related pathologies, including distributive and hypovolemic shock. For example, in the beginning phases of sepsis, a hypovolemic state, induced by the capillary leak and low vascular resistance, can lead to low preload and afterload. A similar response occurs in the setting of hemorrhage. Severe blood loss leads to a decrease in circulating blood volume and consequently decreases the amount of blood returning to the heart, which accounts for the reduction in stroke work and cardiac output seen in this setting.
