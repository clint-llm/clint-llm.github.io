Patients with hereditary defects of the protein C and protein S pathways are prone to thromboembolic events such as deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke, and organ ischemia.******Treatment**

The long-term treatment for protein C and S deficiencies is anticoagulation with heparin bridged to warfarin. The medications should overlap for five days until the therapeutic range of the international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 is reached for two consecutive days.

The warfarin dose should be carefully assessed and bridged with a therapeutic dose of heparin as it can impose warfarin-induced skin necrosis in protein C and S deficiency. Warfarin inhibits the Vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and proteins C and S. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis transpires due to the relatively short half-life of proteins C and S, which are inhibited first when warfarin is administered. This further promotes the procoagulant effects of other vitamin K-dependent clotting factors and forms microthrombi.

**Monitoring**

Patients prescribed warfarin for long-term use warrant recurrent monitoring to confirm the medication is in the optimal range and that benefits exceed the risk of harm.
