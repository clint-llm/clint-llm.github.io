Necrosis of the mucosal villi is the initial change, which usually happens within 3 to 4 hours after intestinal ischemia. Following that, transmural, mural, or mucosa infarction can happen. Splenic flexure and rectosigmoid junction are the common susceptible area to hypoperfusion and hypoxia. Initially, in response to the injury, the intestinal wall becomes congested. It then appears edematous, friable, and hemorrhagic. Without intervention, bowel hemorrhage can occur within 1 to 4 days. Subsequently, enteric bacteria leads to intestinal gangrene and perforation.
