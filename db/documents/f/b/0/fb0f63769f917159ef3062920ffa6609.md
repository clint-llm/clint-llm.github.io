Eventration of the diaphragm is often an incidental finding and most patients are asymptomatic without a need for extensive management. Patients and parents of children with confirmed eventration of the diaphragm should be educated on recognizing symptoms and when to seek medical treatment. Pulmonary rehabilitation may also be beneficial in teaching patients about diaphragm eventration as well as breathing exercises.
