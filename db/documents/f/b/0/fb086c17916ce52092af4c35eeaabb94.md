Sleep-related movement disorders are an important group of sleep diseases encountered commonly in clinical practice that requires thorough evaluation and treatment. Periodic limb movement disorder or PLM is also referred to as sleep-related myoclonus syndrome or nocturnal myoclonus syndrome. These movements of the legs or upper limbs during sleep are periodic and have stereotypic behavior. Movements include flexion of the hip and knee and, most commonly, dorsiflexion of the foot, with the big toe extended. It is a common finding in a sleep study, and its mere presence alone does not satisfy the diagnosis of PLMD if there are no appropriate clinical symptoms. This activity explains the pertinent facts regarding a common finding of PLMS (periodic limb movements of sleep) in polysomnograms and PLMD (periodic limb movement disorders) and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of periodic limb movement disorder.
- Summarize the appropriate evaluation of periodic limb movement disorder.
- Outline the management options available for periodic limb movement disorder.
- Describe how an interprofessional team may coordinate care in patients with periodic limb movement disorder to improve outcomes.
