Assisted reproductive technologies are most frequently performed secondary to infertility. In patients with tubal factor infertility, IVF directly bypasses the fallopian tubes. Other infertility etiologies in which IVF is employed include male factor infertility, diminished ovarian reserve, ovarian failure (with donor eggs), ovulatory dysfunction, and unexplained infertility.

IVF is also used outside of infertility settings. It can be used in patients desiring preimplantation genetic testing before conception (such as those known to be carriers of certain genetic disorders), fertility preservation, such as prior to gonadotoxic therapy, or in patients desiring to delay childbearing. These women can opt to freeze their eggs or embryos if they are in a stable relationship.
