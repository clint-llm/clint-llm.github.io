The management of piebaldism at birth requires an interprofessional team approach, including providers from dermatology, pediatrics, gastroenterology, and genetics. The reason for this approach is that this disorder is rare and acquired at birth. Secondly, it has features that mimic many other skin disorders, and often, an exhaustive workup is required. When the condition presents at birth or soon after, the patient should obtain a referral by the primary care provider to a dermatologist.

The first step is accurately diagnosing piebaldism as either isolated or part of a syndrome with extracutaneous manifestations.

A dermatologist can help in the initial diagnostic workup to determine the cause (Wood's lamp evaluation, biopsy), the extent of lesions, and the presence of extracutaneous manifestations. Upon making the diagnosis of isolated piebaldism, family members need reassurance that this is a benign condition that is unlikely to progress. Affected individuals may experience significant social disability during childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. In these cases, referral to a mental health professional is a prudent course, and they can report back to the team on the results of therapy. Some patients may need cognitive behavior therapy. For the skin lesion, treatment to improve cosmesis can be sought with a dermatologist or plastic surgeon.

Due to the absence of the photoprotective effects of epidermal melanin, patients with piebaldism should receive education from the pharmacist, nurse, or primary care provider on proper sun protection of depigmented areas of the skin, including sunscreen and protective clothing.

All members of the interprofessional team need to keep each other informed and up to date on their activities. While piebaldism is a benign condition, it does not obviate the health care team from collaborative activity. The education of the family must be coordinated by clinicians. [Level 5]
