The fibula's lateral surface, deep fascia,Â and intermuscular septum form the borders of the lower limbs lateral compartment. Within this compartment runs the superficial fibular nerve, which is responsible for plantar flexion and eversion. The fibula's posterior surface, deep fascia, and interosseous membrane form the borders of the lower limbs posterior compartment. The tibial nerve runs through this compartment and is responsible for plantar and digit flexion. The fibula's medial surface partially borders the lower limbs anterior compartment.
