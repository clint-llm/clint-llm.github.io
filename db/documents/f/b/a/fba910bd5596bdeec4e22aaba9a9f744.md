Vitamin E has a few interactions with medications that are listed below:

- Anticoagulation and antiplatelet medications: due to vitamin E inhibiting platelet aggregation and disrupting vitamin K clotting factors, there is a protentional increase risk of bleeding combining these two.

- Simvastatin and niacin: Vitamin E can reduce the amount of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is the opposite desired effect of taking simvastatin and/or niacin.
