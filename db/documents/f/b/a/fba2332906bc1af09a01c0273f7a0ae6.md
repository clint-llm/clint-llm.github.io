Gonococcal arthritis is ideally managed with an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals. While the acute joint problem is managed by a physician, many patients may require a short program in physical therapy to regain their joint mobility and muscle strength. The nurse should educate the patient on sexually transmitted infections and how to practice safe sex. Once a patient has been diagnosed with one STD, the nurse should inform the patient about getting tested for other STDs. The pharmacist should ensure compliance with antibiotics to ensure that full healing occurs. Finally, the social worker should recommend that the partner be examined and treated, otherwise the cycle of infection transmission will continue.

**Outcomes**

When patients with gonococcal arthritis are treated with antibiotics, there is usually full recovery without any sequelae. For those who have other manifestations besides the arthritis, the prognosis may depend on the severity of the infection. For example, if a patient has gonococcal endocarditis, antibiotics may be required for 4 to 6 weeks and if the valve is damaged, valve replacement may be required. In general, complications following gonococcal arthritis are rare.
