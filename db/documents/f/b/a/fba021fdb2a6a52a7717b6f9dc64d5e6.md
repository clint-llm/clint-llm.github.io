Papillomas arise from the skin or some mucosal surfaces depending on the different types of Human Papillomavirus involved and their affinity to different sites. For example, conjunctival papilloma is caused by HPV infection type 6, 11, 16, 33, and 45, which is somewhat dissimilar to genital warts caused by types 2, 3, 6, 11, 16, 18, and 30-32 and cutaneous papillomas (types 1-4 and 26-29).

Infection is established in the basal cell layers of the epithelium, but this involves the expression of a limited part of the viral genome. It's not until the basal cells develop and move externally through the different layers of the skin of the stratum spinosum and granulosum, that the virus begins to replicate itself, and the lesion becomes infectious.

Normally papillomavirus infects the epidermis in sites near the site of entry, but self inoculation often occurs, and the virus can infect farther sites. This phenomenon is known as the Koebner phenomenon. It has been observed that the immune system has an important role in controlling the spread of the virus, as, despite the virus infecting the intraepidermal cells that are considered "hard-to-reach" by the immune system, it was found that papillomas tend to reactivate and are more extensive in immunocompromised individuals.
