Adenomyomatosis has been found in 1 to 8.7 percent of cholecystectomy specimens. Although there is a wide age range of patients diagnosed with adenomyomatosis, patients are most frequently diagnosed in their 50s. There are discrepancies in the literature regarding the prevalence of adenomyomatosis in males and females. It is well known that adenomyomatosis is more prevalent in women than in men (3Â to 1). Other authors declare that the prevalence is similar in men and women. There is no known race predilection.
