The following items require periodic monitoring when the patients take chlorthalidone.

- **Serum electrolytes**: Serum sodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium levels should be checked periodically.

- **Fluid status and Blood pressure**: All patients taking chlorthalidone require observation for dryness of mouth, thirst, lethargy, hypotension, oliguria, tachycardia, palpitations, and gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea and vomiting. Chlorthalidone is a diuretic, so an inappropriately high dose can cause severe volume depletion.

- **Magnesium level**: It can increase the urinary excretion of magnesium and may result in hypomagnesemia.

- **Uric acid level**: Hyperuricemia may occur, or frank gout may be precipitated in certain patients receiving chlorthalidone.

- **Serum glucose level:**serum glucose may increase with chronic use.

There is insufficient research performed to check teratogenicity, but chlorthalidone should be used during pregnancy only if absolutely necessary.
