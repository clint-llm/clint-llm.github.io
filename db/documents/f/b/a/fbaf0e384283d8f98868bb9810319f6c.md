Voice rehabilitation with speech and language therapists (SLT) is an integral part of the management of UVCP and can be used both before and after surgical intervention. Management aims to improve glottic closure by increasing intra-abdominal pressure through humming and abdominal breathing. Studies have suggested that early voice therapy may help avoid the need for surgical intervention.
