To begin the procedure, the patient should be undressed from the waist down and remain covered with a sheet to maintain modesty. The patient should only be uncovered as necessary for the procedure and should remain covered until properly positioned. The first part of the procedure is non-sterile. The patient is first placed in the lithotomy position, and a bimanual examination is done to determine the uterine size and position of the uterus. The speculum can now be inserted to allow for cervical visualization. Of note, if a Pap smear is necessary, this is an ideal time to obtain the appropriate samples before continuing the procedure. Once visualized, the cervix can be anesthetized and cleansed by spraying a 20 percent benzocaine spray for 5 seconds and then applying an iodine solution. At this time, it is appropriate to wash hands and don sterile gloves.

The next step is to determine the depth of the uterus, which is done with a uterine sound. The first step is to stabilize the cervix. A tenaculum is placed on the anterior lip of the cervix and allows the provider to straighten the uterocervical angle. The uterine sound is then inserted to an average depth of 6 to 10 cm within the uterus. The provider can discern that the sound is fully inserted when feeling resistance from the fundus. One common complication at this step is that the uterine sound will not pass through the internal cervical os; this can be overcome by using cervical dilators. The smallest size is inserted, followed by successively larger dilators' insertion until the sound can reach the fundus.

Once achieving adequate os dilation and determining the uterus' depth, the sampling pipelle can be inserted. The pipelle should be advanced until encountering resistance. This resistance should be at the same depth as the sounding of the uterus. Once the pipelle is in the uterine cavity, the internal piston on the catheter is fully withdrawn, creating suction at the catheter tip. This suction, accompanied by moving the tip with an in and out motion, allows for sample collection. This motion should be completed with a 360-degree twisting motion to reach all four quadrants of the endometrium. The pipelle is now removed, and the collected tissue sample is placed into a formalin solution. A second pass into the uterus can be done to ensure the collection of adequate tissue. If a second pass is made, ensure the catheter is not contaminated when being emptied of the first specimen.

Gently remove the tenaculum to complete the procedure. Most bleeding will be controllable with pressure via cotton swabs or a sponge stick. If bleeding persists, use silver nitrate sticks to cauterize the site.

Post-procedure care consists of allowing the patient to remain semi-recumbent as long as the patient deems it necessary to avoid any vasovagal reactions. While there are no established guidelines, many providers and hospital groups inform patients it is safe to bathe or shower immediately after the procedure but should refrain from sexual intercourse or placing any intravaginal device until any bleeding has stopped.
