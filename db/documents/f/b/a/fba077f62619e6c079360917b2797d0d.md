Patient comfort is critical in properly performing the procedure as significant patient movement can affect satisfactory targeting of the hip joint. Movement can also affect needle trajectory with a potential injury of the femoral neuro-vasculature. The technologist plays an important role in assisting in fluoroscopic image acquisition.
