Mucocutaneous eruptions are rashes that have both mucous membrane and cutaneous distribution. Differences between the history and physical exam patterns of these rashes and associated inciting etiologies have led to the development of separate names for these mucocutaneous eruptions, such as erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS).  Recently, a separate pattern of the mucocutaneous rash pattern

- Evidence of “atypical pneumonia” by clinical symptoms (fever, cough) and laboratory evidence of M. pneumoniae infection (elevated M. pneumoniae IgM antibodies, positive cultures or polymerase chain reaction for M. pneumoniae from oropharyngeal or bullae, and/or serial cold agglutinins) AND

- A rash to the mucosa (usually greater than or equal to two sites)

However, the three types of MIRM differ by the characteristics of their cutaneous, non-mucosal rash patterns:

- Classic MIRM has evidence of a. and b. above plus a non-mucosal rash (vesiculobullous lesions (77%), scattered target lesions (48%), papules (14%), macules (12%) and morbilliform eruptions (9%).

- MIRM sine rash has a. and b. above, but there is no significant cutaneous, non-mucosal rash (although there may be a “few fleeting morbilliform lesions, or a few vesicles”).

- Severe MIRM has 1 and 2 (above), although greater than 2 sites have been reported, but the cutaneous rash is extensive with widespread non-mucosal blisters or flat atypical target lesions.

Recognition of MIRM as a clinical entity distinct from other mucocutaneous eruptions may be clinically beneficial as treatment options, disease prognosis, and patient education of MIRM will be different from that of the latter.
