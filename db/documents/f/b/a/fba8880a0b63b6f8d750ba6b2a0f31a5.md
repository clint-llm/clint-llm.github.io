The pituitary gland has two embryological origins. The first being the ectodermal layer that later transforms into the anterior pituitary; the other is the neuroectoderm which forms the posterior pituitary gland. The posterior pituitary is similar to the anterior, where they both ultimately control endocrine function and the body’s hormonal response to the environment. This occurs when the hypothalamus receives neural signals from the brain and secretes polypeptide and neuropeptide hormones that are then transported down the axon for storage in the posterior pituitary gland until they are ready for release. The posterior pituitary hormones are in charge of regulating water retention and inducing uterine contraction.
