Perioperative vision loss (POVL) is a rare but devastating complication following non-ocular surgery. It includes the clinical manifestations of various ophthalmologic conditions. Prevention is paramount, given the poor prognosis in the majority of cases. Prompt recognition is critical as rare subtypes are treatable within a time-sensitive window. This article reviews the patient-specific and perioperative factors that place patients at risk of developing POVL and highlights the interprofessional team in prevention and prompt recognition of POVL.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the proposed pathophysiology which contributes to peri-operative vision loss (POVL) and identify how certain patient and peri-operative factors influence the pathophysiology.
- Review the differential diagnosis for the subtypes of perioperative vision loss (POVL) and identify which subtype is the most common in prone spine surgery.
- Summarize how common co-morbidities influence the risk for developing peri-operative vision loss (POVL).
- Outline the peri-operative factors that place patients at higher risk of developing peri-operative vision loss (POVL).
