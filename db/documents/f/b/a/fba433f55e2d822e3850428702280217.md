Bowel necrosis is a surgical emergency with poor outcomes even with early recognition, resuscitation, and surgical intervention. Due to the rarity of the condition, there are no Level I recommendations for evaluation and management, and those that do exist are based on case series, reviews, and small studies. The current recommendations call for high clinical suspicion in patients with "abdominal pain out of proportion" and risk factors, followed by prompt evaluation with CT angiography with aggressive resuscitation and surgical intervention.
