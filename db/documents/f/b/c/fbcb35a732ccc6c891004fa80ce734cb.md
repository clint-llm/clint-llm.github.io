Up to 50% of patients with untreated detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) can develop serious urologic complications, which are much less common in females because of the lower detrusor pressures generated compared to men with DSD. If left untreated, DSD can result in urinary tract infection/urosepsis, vesicoureteric reflux, hydronephrosis, upper urinary tract deterioration, renal insufficiency, urolithiasis, and bladder damage. In addition, patients may also suffer complications from the treatment received.
