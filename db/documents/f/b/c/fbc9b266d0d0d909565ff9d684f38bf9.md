In addition to Braxton Hicks contractions, there are other causes of abdominal pain during pregnancy. Some normal reasons for abdominal pain during pregnancy, in addition to Braxton Hicks contractions and true labor contractions, include:

- Round ligament pain or a sharp, jabbing feeling felt in the lower abdomen or groin area on one or both sides.

- Higher levels of progesterone can cause excess gas during pregnancy.

- Constipation may be a source of abdominal pain.

Circumstances in which abdominal pain is a sign of a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention include:

- Ectopic pregnancy.

- Placental abruption. A key symptom of placental abruption is intense and constant pain that causes the uterus to become hard for an extended period without relief.

- Urinary tract infection symptoms include pain and discomfort in the lower abdomen as well as burning with urination.

- Preeclampsia is a condition of pregnancy occurring after 20-weeks gestation and characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine. Upper abdominal pain, usually under the ribs on the right side, can be present in preeclampsia.

If a woman is unsure if she is experiencing Braxton Hicks contractions or another condition, a discussion with a healthcare provider is needed. The healthcare provider may recommend a visit to the office setting or labor and delivery for an examination by a healthcare professional to determine the cause of the abdominal pain.
