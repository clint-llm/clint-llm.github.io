Always repeat calcium levels and check albumin levels to confirm hypocalcemia by correcting calcium levels for low albumin. Also, remember to check a magnesium level when faced with hypocalcemia since it is an important and easily correctable cause of hypocalcemia. Vitamin D deficiency should always be addressed as correction of hypocalcemia will be difficult in patients with untreated vitamin D deficiency.
