Syncope is caused by decreased cerebral blood flow leading to transient loss of consciousness and postural tone, associated with spontaneous recovery. Symptoms like dizziness, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, nausea, and visual disturbances may precede it or occur suddenly with none of the above symptoms. Syncope is a symptom described as fainting, blacking out, falling out, or "having a spell," and represents 1 to 3.5% of all emergency department visits and 6% of all hospital admissions in the United States. This large number of emergency department visits and admissions reflect the varied etiologies of syncope from benign to life-threatening and the high degree of diagnostic uncertainty associated with this symptom.
