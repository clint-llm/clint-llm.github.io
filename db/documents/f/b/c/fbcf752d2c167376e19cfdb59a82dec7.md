Fecal impaction is a significant but preventable problem in the elderly population within hospitals and other institutions. The best way to treat it is to prevent it from developing in the first place. The cause of constipation should be identified early and managed appropriately. The patient should be educated about lifestyle measures and dietary habits to prevent fecal impaction. Unfortunately, recurrent fecal impaction is very common in elderly and institutionalized patients. Often these patients present to the emergency department because the presenting symptoms can mimic other sinister intestinal pathology.
