Iron is a mineral necessary for human life. It plays an important role in DNA synthesis and many other metabolic processes. It is also an essential component of heme, within hemoglobin, the protein responsible for transporting oxygen throughout the body. Hemoglobin is present within erythrocytes (red blood cells) produced by hematopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow. The kidneys provide the stimulus for producing red blood cells within the marrow via a hormone called erythropoietin. Erythropoietin travels from the kidneys to the bone marrow, where it exerts its action. In addition to providing a basal amount of erythropoietin, the kidneys will increase synthesis and secretion in response to hypoxia.

Individuals who have a deficiency of iron have a decrease in their bodyâ€™s ability to transport and subsequently utilize oxygen from the air they breathe. Symptoms may manifest in various ways, including but not limited to fatigue, pallor, tachycardia, and exercise intolerance. Though iron deficiency can occur with or without anemia, it is, in fact, the most common cause of anemia worldwide, representing a significant public health challenge.

Evaluation of iron status is best performed by assessing serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. Serum ferritin represents the level of iron stores in the body. Serum ferritin value less than 30 ng/mL is generally considered diagnostic of iron deficiency; less than 10 to 15 ng/mL is 99 percent specific for iron deficiency anemia. The caveat or ferritin is also an acute-phase reactant, and levels may be affected by inflammatory processes. Transferrin saturation is another metric used to assess iron status, representing the iron level readily available for transport to tissues. Transferrin saturation of under 20% generally indicates iron deficiency. Iron deficiency may also manifest on a complete blood count (CBC) as a microcytic, hypochromic anemia; however, iron status should not be based solely on red blood cell characteristics as hematopoiesis is often unaffected in the early stages of deficiency.

The implementation of iron therapy can be initiated based on several different guidelines depending on etiology. The European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anemia in inflammatory bowel disease (ECCO) suggests iron supplementation for patients with ferritin under 30 ng/mL or less than 100 ng/mL if transferrin saturation is below 20% for those with iron deficiency due to inflammatory bowel disease. Similarly, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines use serum ferritin below 100 ng/mL and transferrin saturation under 20% to indicate therapy in patients with renal disease. The European Society of Cardiology uses ferritin less than 100 ng/mL or 100 to 299 ng/mL with transferrin saturation below 20% in patients with heart failure.

Most oral iron formulations are considered to be dietary supplements. As such, they are not subject to the same set of regulations used by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate traditional drug products. Parenteral, i.e., intravenous iron therapy, is approved by the FDA to treat iron deficiency anemia for patients who are intolerant to oral iron or have demonstrated an inadequate response and for patients with chronic kidney disease. It should be noted that further guidelines and restrictions vary by individual brand of parenteral iron.
