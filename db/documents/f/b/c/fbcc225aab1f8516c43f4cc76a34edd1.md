Clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix is a rare variant of adenocarcinoma accounting for only 4% of all cervical carcinomas. Its etiology and pathogenesis are unclear. The diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix is mainly established based on histopathological examination.  Histologically, clear cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix is predominantly composed of clear or hobnail cells whose architectural patterns are solid, tubulocystic, and/or papillary.
