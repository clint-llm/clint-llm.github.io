The clinical presentation depends on the organ/system involved. Pulmonary involvement is most common and seen in up to 80% of all cases. Extrapulmonary involvement is sometimes seen (most commonly brain and skin) and may coincide with a lung infection. In up to 25%, however, an isolated extrapulmonary disease without lung involvement has been reported. Other sites described include joints, eyes, pharynx, middle ear, lymph node, bone, and implanted devices (peritoneal dialysis and intravenous catheters). Hematogenous spread is relatively common, mostly from dissemination from lungs.

The lung infection is typically subacute and presents with cavitation in more than 50% of cases and pleural effusion in approximately 20% of cases. Necrotizing pneumonia is a common presentation which may spread contiguously to surrounding structures, causing empyema, mediastinitis, and bacteremia. Common symptoms include fever, cough, (may/may not be productive) chest pain, weight loss, fatigue, and occasionally hemoptysis which can be severe and require transfusion or pneumonectomy.
