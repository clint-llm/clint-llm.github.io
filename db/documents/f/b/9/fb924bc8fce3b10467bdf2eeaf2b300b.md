Lissamine green dye and fluorescein 2% dye are routinely used to assess corneal surface changes as well as defects in the epithelium from keratitis. The dyes will stain any microscopic defects or erosions, allowing enhanced visualization during the slit-lamp examination.

A patient with keratitis is evaluated using laboratory examinations to differentiate the causes of keratitis if a corneal ulcer or infiltrate is found on physical examination. Keratitis has many infectious etiologies such as bacteria, fungi, or viruses. Giemsa stain, gram stain, and PCR are used to rule out any infectious causes when a break in the epithelium is found.
