Edwards syndrome is characterized by variable clinical manifestations, with multi-system involvement. More than 125 anomalies have been reported so far as a feature of Edwards syndrome. However, none of the clinical features is pathognomonic of Edwards syndrome.

Most Edwards syndrome cases are diagnosed prenatally, based on antenatal screening with maternal age, maternal serum marker, or by ultrasound findings during the second trimester. Antenatally, Edwards syndrome can reveal intrauterine growth restriction, polyhydramnios, agenesis of the corpus callosum, choroid plexus cyst, nuchal thickening, brachycephaly, clenched hands with overriding index fingers, cardiac defects, omphalocele, and single umbilical artery.

Postnatally, Edwards syndrome is characterized by a cluster of phenotypes, as summarized below.
