Fibrocartilage is a major component of entheses, defined as the connective tissue between muscle tendon or ligament and bone. The fibrocartilaginous enthesis consists of 4 transition zones as it progresses from tendon to bone.

- Longitudinal fibroblasts and a parallel arrangement of collagen fibers are found in the tendinous area

- A fibrocartilaginous region where the main type ofÂ cells present transitions from fibroblast to chondrocytes

- A region called the "blue line" or "tide mark" due to an abrupt transition from cartilaginous to calcified fibrocartilage

- Bone
