The embryological ectoderm gives rise to the sensory system. Surface ectoderm generates the epidermis, neural ectoderm generates the brain and spinal cord, and neural crest generates the dorsal root ganglia and peripheral nervous system.

The cortex derives from the telencephalon of the embryologic brain vesicles, the thalamus derives from the diencephalon, and the midbrain derives from the mesencephalon.
