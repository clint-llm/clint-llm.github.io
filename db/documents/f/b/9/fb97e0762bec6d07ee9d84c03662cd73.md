The identification of a pleural friction rub poses a diagnostic dilemma to the clinician; this is a non-specific finding with a broad differential. Excellent history-taking and documentation will facilitate identifying the cause of the rub. Life-threatening causes of pleural friction rub include pulmonary embolus and malignant pleural effusion, and rapid diagnosis and treatment have a marked effect on patient outcomes. In the emergency department setting, the clinician must rule out life-threatening causes by obtaining the requisite investigations immediately. Effective communication between the referring physician and radiologist is essential to ensure imaging assessment takes place with special attention to the myriad causes of a pleural friction rub. The care of the patient with mesothelioma will necessitate consultations with an oncologist, radiation oncologist, and surgeon, among other physician specialists. At all stages of workup and treatment, patient-centered care is to be the standard.

The prognosis of a patient with a finding of pleural friction rub depends on the underlying cause of this sign. However, to improve outcomes, prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended.
