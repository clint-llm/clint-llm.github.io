Bleeding due to vascular injury is the most dangerous complication during VATS for major pulmonary resection and is the main reason for emergent conversion to open thoracotomy. The surgeon, anesthesiologist and operating room team should be prepared to convert to an open thoracotomy if necessary. Adequate intravenous access should be established before all VATS procedures. VATS with conversion and open thoracotomy were associated with similar early postoperative morbidity and mortality rates. VATS should be preferred to thoracotomy; even in the event of converting to an open procedure since it potentially provides the patient with benefits of a fully VATS-based resection but is not disadvantageous when intraoperative conversion is required.

Because of the surgically induced pneumothorax, patients who have undergone a VATS should be transported to the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), intensive care unit or a step-down unit with supplemental oxygen. Patients are at a high risk of sudden pulmonary decompensation and postoperative bleeding, therefore the anesthesiologist and the PACU or ICU nurses should have a high index of suspicion and patients should be monitored closely.
