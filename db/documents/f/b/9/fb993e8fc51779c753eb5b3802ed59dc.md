The subthalamic nucleus is located at the junction of the midbrain and diencephalon. It is a small lens-shaped structure that functionally participates with the basal ganglia. The subthalamic nucleus contains glutaminergic neurons with projections to the internal globus pallidus. The glutamatergic neurons increase the activity of the internal globus pallidus, which contains GABAergic neurons that, in turn, decrease the activity of the thalamus and inhibit movement. Lesions of the subthalamic nucleus can disrupt the inhibition of movement by the internal globus pallidus and results in hemiballismus.
