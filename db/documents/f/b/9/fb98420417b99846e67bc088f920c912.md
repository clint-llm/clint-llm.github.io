Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is an uncommon disease affecting the eccrine glands, leading to eccrine unit necrosis.

It is most commonly seen in adults receiving cytarabine as part of the induction chemotherapy for the treatment of hematological malignancy.

The diagnosis of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis may signify that the patient has an underlying malignancy (paraneoplastic process), or relapse of previous malignancy. In newly diagnosed neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis patients with no history of malignancy, their primary care provider should be notified, and age-appropriate cancer screening guidelines should be followed.

A skin biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis.

If the patient has a cancer history, the managing hematologist, and, or oncologist should be informed.

There is no widely accepted treated for neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis; supportive care is recommended.
