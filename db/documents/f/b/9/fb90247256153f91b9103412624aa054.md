The diagnosis of malingering is based on history, physical exam, and psychological tests. No diagnostic laboratory tests are available to diagnose malingering. Laboratory studies are, however, useful to exclude organic cause and genuineness of illness. These laboratory studies might include the following:

- Complete blood cell (CBC) count

- Serum electrolytes.

- Renal function tests

- Liver function tests (LFTs)

- Blood alcohol level

- Blood and urine toxicology screen (may also rule in malingering in case of drug abusers seeking opioids)

- Computed tomography (CT) scanning or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain should be considered to rule out organic brain disorders

**Other Tests:**

- The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)

- The F-scale

- Test of memory malingering

- The negative impression management scale

- Rey 15-item test

- The temporal memory sequence test

- Symptom and Disposition Interview (SDI)
