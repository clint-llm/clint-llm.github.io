- Due to the sensitivity of obstetrics and gynecology, simulation can be an effective tool to practice difficult skills and procedures.

- Standardized patients are often utilized in simulation for communication skill practice.

- Mannequins and virtual reality simulations are useful for procedures that are not easily reproducible, contain high-fidelity scenarios, or require repetitive practice.

- Simulations will help to improve the stress and comfort of participants and can be utilized to enhance team performance.

- When considering adding a simulation program to the curriculum, programs must consider the initial and longitudinal costs of equipment maintenance.
