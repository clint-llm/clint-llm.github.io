As stated previously, CPET is performed at specialized centers that often conduct other cardiopulmonary diagnostic tests. Patients should be counseled on the equipment used and the data that is collected. If a patient is at significant risk for falls, the test should be performed with equipment to minimize this risk, such as a cycle ergometer.
