Calcium carbonate is an inorganic salt primarily used in the management and treatment of low calcium conditions, GERD, CKD, and various other indicated conditions. It is classified as a calcium supplement, antacid, and phosphate binder. This activity outlines the significant indications, actions, and contraindications for calcium carbonate as a valuable agent in treating osteoporosis, hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, many other conditions or disorders that lower serum calcium levels. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the healthcare team in the care of patients with low serum calcium, GERD, CKD, and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanisms of action of calcium carbonate.
- Describe some possible adverse effects of calcium carbonate.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients using calcium carbonate.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance calcium carbonate and improve outcomes.
