Ataxia may be due to an interference in the sensory transmission to the cerebellum caused by a lesion. This condition can lead to sensory or spinal ataxia. An interruption in cortical signals from the cerebellum causes cerebellar ataxia. Spinocerebellar ataxias are a result of both of the above mentioned pathologies. They are autosomal dominant and result from CAG repetition on chromosomes.

Friedreich's ataxia is the most common of the inherited ataxias. It has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. It involves the frataxin gene. There is degeneration of peripheral nerve axons and loss of sensory cells. Patients present between the first and second decades of life. Multisystem abnormalities are present and include, gait ataxia, loss in proprioception, sensory loss, pes cavus, spastic extensor plantar responses, atrophy of extremities, and cardiomyopathy. Patients may also have diabetes mellitus, vision loss, and hearing loss.

Depending on the location of the lesion, characteristic findings are as follows:

- Lesions in the lateral cerebellum cause symptoms on the same side as the lesion (ipsilateral), whereas diffuse lesions cause generalized symptoms.

- Lesions in the cerebellum hemisphere cause limb ataxia.

- Lesions in the vermis cause truncal, gait ataxia with sparing of the limbs.

- Lesions at vestibulo-cerebellar areas cause disbalance, vertigo and gait ataxia.
