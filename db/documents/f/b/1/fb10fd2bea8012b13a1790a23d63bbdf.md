The true incidence of the cavus foot is unknown in the population at large, possibly due to the somewhat loose definition, but attempts have been made to define the prevalence in some groups. Studies give different figures according to their geographic location, the pattern of referrals to their practice and healthcare system, and the definition of cavus used. In one study, a patient with bilateral cavovarus feet has a 78% chance of having CMT, and those that have a family history of cavovarus feet have a 91% chance of having CMT.
