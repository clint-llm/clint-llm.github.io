The tissue of the eye and orbit can undergo preparation in several different ways for analysis. For light microscopy, Davidson’s solution and Bouin’s solution are used as fixatives for the eye, while glutaraldehyde is the standard choice for electron microscopy. The widely used hematoxylin and eosin stain can be used as well, staining the nucleus dark purple. The periodic acid-Schiff stain detects carbohydrates in tissue and can be used to visualize basement membranes.
