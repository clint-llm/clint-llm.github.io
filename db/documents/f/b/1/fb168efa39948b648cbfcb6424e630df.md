Work-up before nivolumab therapy consists of extensive clinical history and physical examination. This includes a thorough baseline clinical assessment of all organ systems. Of particular relevance are a complete dermatologic assessment as well as assessing gastrointestinal habits and complaints. A recent imaging study to monitor therapy efficacy is necessary before treatment. Acute and subclinical infections should be ruled out via serologic tests (M. tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C Virus, human-immunodeficiency virus, Cytomegalovirus). Laboratory tests required before and during nivolumab therapy include complete blood counts with differential, and clinical chemistry, including liver function tests and an endocrine panel.

Monitoring cardiac markers such as troponin I or T is relevant as it can be the only alteration in asymptomatic patients with myocarditis, which carries a high lethality.
