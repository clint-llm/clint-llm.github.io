The differential diagnosis of excited delirium syndrome, which is characterized by delirium, agitation, and hyperadrenergic autonomic dysfunction, actually seeks an explanation of the underlying etiology of the syndrome.

In this regard, the differential diagnosis for excited delirium syndrome can be well categorized by a differential diagnosis for delirium and altered mental status. Numerous mnemonics exist for this purpose; the American College of Emergency Physicians recommends SMASHED x 2 as a mnemonic for altered mental status.

- Substrates (hypoglycemia/hyperglycemia, vitamin deficiency)

- Sepsis (severe sepsis/septic shock)

- Meningitis/encephalitis/meningoencephalitis (bacterial, viral (including rabies), fungal, parasitic, autoimmune, prion)

- Mental illness (mania, acute psychosis)

- Alcohol (acute intoxication and withdrawal, delirium tremens)

- Accident (acute pain, atraumatic or traumatic intracranial catastrophe including intraparenchymal hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, epidural hematoma, diffuse axonal injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, ischemic stroke, dural sinus thrombosis, concussion, arterial dissection, and Lemierre syndrome)

- Seizure (and post-ictal)

- Stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, MDMA, PCP, Flakka/bath salts, other sympathomimetics)

- Hyper (hypertension/hyperthyroidism/hypercarbia/hyperthermia)

- Hypo (hypotension/hypothyroidism/hypoxia/hypothermia)

- Electrolyte abnormalities

- Encephalopathy (hepatic, uremic, heavy metals, Reye syndrome, intracranial masses, pheochromocytoma, para ganglioneuroma, adrenal crisis, acute neurovisceral porphyrias, intracranial hypertension)

- Drugs (any medication overdose, or another toxidrome, including hallucinogens, and anticholinergic delirium, carbon monoxide and cyanide, designer drugs, theophylline/caffeine, antipsychotic overdose/withdrawal, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, tyramine crisis, serotonin syndrome, iatrogenic thyrotoxicosis, and withdrawal such as benzodiazepine withdrawal or other CNS depressant withdrawal, fluoroquinolone psychosis.

An organized, systematic approach to the differential diagnosis for these symptoms is essential to formulating the history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation of these patients.
