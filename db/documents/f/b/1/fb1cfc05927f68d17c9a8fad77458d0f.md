**Selection of Correct Tray**

Trays for alginate impressions must have retention, such as perforations.

**Mixing**

The mixing method can significantly affect the elastic recovery and tensile strength of the impression. Dental alginates are often manually mixed, but proprietary mechanical mixing devices are available. Alginate is supplied as a powder with a measuring scoop and a cylindrical cup for measuring water. The recommended powder-to-water ratio is usually 1:1 but is set by the manufacturer.

Manual mixing is performed by adding the measured powder to a flexible rubber bowl and subsequently adding the corresponding amount of water. Mixing must be rapid, wiping or stropping against the side of the rubber bowl with a wide-blade spatula. The final mixture must have a creamy consistency but should not fall from the spatula when lifted.

Manufacturers have introduced a "dustless" alginate designed to reduce the dust encountered after tumbling; the powder is thicker and less prone to become airborne. In addition, color indicators have been added to some formulations to identify setting reactions, allowing the operator to decide when to proceed to the next step of impression-making.

Semiautomatic mechanical mixing devices, available since 1978, create a less viscous mixture with fewer bubbles.

**Loading**

Alginic adhesives are required to dry for five minutes and must be applied before preparing the alginate.

**Impression Taking**

When placing the tray in the mouth, retract one side of the lip using a mouth mirror or gloved finger.

Remove the set impression with a quick snap, breaking the seal between the oral tissues and the tray by gently pushing with the finger or applying air directly into the buccal sulcus and then pulling with downward pressure. Rinse the impression with cold water to remove any surface saliva, debris, or blood. Disinfect the rinsed tray.

**Disinfection of Impressions**

Impression materials will contact saliva and blood during impression taking. Oral microorganisms and other infectious pathogens can be transmitted from impressions to dental laboratories.

The first step in disinfecting impressions is to rinse them well with tap water, which removes a significant number of microorganisms from the impression.

Alginates are usually disinfected during the preparation step by spraying or mixing the alginate powder with a disinfectant solution instead of water, allowing the impression to be poured immediately.

Disinfected gypsum die stones may also be used, avoiding the distortion experienced by the impression material during other disinfection maneuvers.
