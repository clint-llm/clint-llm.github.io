Myocardial perfusion testing is a noninvasive diagnostic evaluation performed on patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Pharmacological stimuli, most commonly adenosine, are used to assess myocardial blood flow and coronary flow reserve. Adenosine is a powerful vasodilator used in these tests to produce maximal hyperemia during imaging.

Acute vasodilator testing can help to identify patients with pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) who may respond to calcium channel blocker therapy. The testing procedure is performed during a right-heart catheterization. Vasodilatory medications are administered to assess the ability of the pulmonary arteries to relax before and after administration. Commonly used vasodilator drugs for the procedure include nitric oxide, epoprostenol, and adenosine.
