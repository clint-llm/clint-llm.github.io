For palpation of the pectoralis major muscle, the musculature is accessible with the hand, between the axilla and the nipple.

For a palpatory clinical visit, the pectoralis minor muscle can be palpated by placing a finger in the axilla and pushing obliquely towards the coracoid process of the scapula. If it is sore, the muscle is in spasm.

To palpate the subclavian muscle, look for the angle between the clavicle and the sternum; if it is sore, then the muscle may be in spasm. This situation means that there could be a problem with the passage of the vascular system and the brachial nervous system, causing thoracic outlet syndrome.
