The etiology of PRS is typically separated into isolated and syndromic PRS. Non-syndromic PRS has been associated with mutations on chromosomes 2, 4, 11, or 17. Some evidence suggests SOX9 or KCNJ2 mutations (on chromosome 17) may affect the development of facial structures and cartilage development, leading to PRS.

**Associated Syndromes**

Stickler syndromeÂ is the most common syndrome associated with PRS. In one study, 47% of syndromic PRS patients were diagnosed with Stickler syndrome.

Velocardiofacial syndrome is a 22q11 deletion syndrome or TBX1 gene resulting in abnormalities in heart, parathyroid, thymus, and facial development. Clinical features include long upper lip and philtrum, elongated face, slender digits, hypothyroidism, immune dysfunction, hearing loss, pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defects (VSDs), and hypoplastic pulmonary arteries.

Treacher Collins syndrome****has mutations in TCOF1, POLR1C, and POLR1D genes. Clinical features include hypoplasia of zygomatic, maxillary, and mandibular bones, and anomalies of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), cleft palate, and external ear.
