While the creeping eruption and clinical signs lead to a diagnosis in most cases, other organisms may be confused about this infective processes. Scabies, loiasis, myiasis, schistosomiasis, tinea corporis, and contact dermatitis may have some overlapping features. These are all easily differentiated by a lack of serpentine migration. The most similar disease is the migrating lesion of Strongyloides stercoralis, termed larva currens. This progressing serpiginous infection is differentiated by its rate of progression with intermittent movement and rates of several centimeters by the hour. Additionally, the pattern is haphazard, and disease more often occurs on the perianal skin, thighs, or the trunk. A human trematode, Fasciola gigantica, causes a disease called fascioliasis and is also in the differential. Non-infectious linear or serpiginous dermatoses include jellyfish stings, lichenoid eruptions, and phytophotodermatitis, which again are non-migratory. Creeping ingrown hair may present but is rare.
