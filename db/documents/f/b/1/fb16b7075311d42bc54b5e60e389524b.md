Polymyositis is a chronic inflammatory disease, so multiple small foci of inflammatory and necrotic changes and regenerative nodules can be seen on biopsy. Histopathological findings of polymyositis show endomysial mononuclear infiltrate consisting of mostly CD8 T cells and macrophages along with necrotic myofibrils in the early-stage. Late-stage changes include occluded capillaries secondary to inflammatory changes caused by endothelial damage and increased deposition of connective tissue and extracellular matrix. Polymyositis can be differentiated from inclusion body myositis due to the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in IBM, and from dermatomyositis due to perimysial infiltrates of CD4 cells as well as B lymphocytes.
