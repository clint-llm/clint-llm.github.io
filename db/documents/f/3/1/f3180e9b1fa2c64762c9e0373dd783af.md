After completing a focused history and physical examination, the diagnosis is confirmed by a local anesthetic blockade of the suspected nerve. This is a required step for diagnosis per ICHD-3 standards. The patient should have pain relief with the nerve block for at least the duration of the local anesthetic. Single diagnostic blocks carry false-positive rates up to 40%, so the performance of a second block is prudent. If both blocks are positive, the provider may be more confident as to the correct diagnosis. As compression is thought to be the main etiology for ON, imaging should be considered if there is suspicion of a lesion or mass at the affected site.
