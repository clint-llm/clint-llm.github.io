Phenazopyridine is an azo dye first synthesized in 1914 and adopted by the U.S. Pharmacopoeia in 1928.

Over the decades, the drug was marketed alone and combined with an antibiotic or other agents.

Phenazopyridine is compatible with concurrent antibiotic therapy, and its analgesic properties should improve the patientâ€™s comfort until antibiotics can control the infection. Because of its analgesic properties, it should decrease the need for systemic analgesics and other medications. In clinical and inpatient environments, phenazopyridine alleviates these same symptoms following endoscopic procedures, the passage of catheters, trauma, and surgery. The drug has limited diagnostic uses.
