Progressively worsening dyspnea, tachypnea, and rales (or crackles) on examination with associated hypoxia are the clinical features common to both cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Cough with pink frothy sputum noted due to hypoxemia from alveolar flooding and auscultation of an S3 gallop could suggest cardiogenic edema. Similarly, the presence of murmurs, elevated jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema may point towards a cardiac etiology.

In patients with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema, the symptoms of infections such as fever, cough with expectoration, dyspnea pointing to likely pneumonia, recent trauma, blood transfusions should be carefully assessed as these patients may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Auscultation remains the mainstay of bedside assessment in all patients with respiratory symptoms. More specifically, hearing of either fine or coarse crackles is crucial to determine the next steps in the management. Fine crackles are heard in cardiogenic pulmonary edema. They are exclusively heard in the inspiratory phase when the small airways, which were shut during expiration, open abruptly.
