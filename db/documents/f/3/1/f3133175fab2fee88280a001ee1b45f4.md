S. pyogenes is a gram-positive, catalase-negative, oxidase negative, β-hemolytic streptococci. It is a facultative anaerobe, grows best in 5 to 10% carbon dioxide, and forms pinpoint colonies on blood agar plates. Lancefield serological grouping system is used to differentiate group A streptococci (GAS) from other streptococci. The type A antigen of S. pyogenes is a polysaccharide which comprised of N-acetylglucosamine attached to a rhamnose polymer backbone.S. pyogenes cell wall, and GAS strains are further divided into different serotypes based on the antigenic characteristics of the M protein. More than 80 different serotypes have been identified on the basis of M protein.S. pyogenes are categorized into two classes: Class I and Class II. Class I strains cause rheumatic fever while class II strains result in acute glomerulonephritis.

S. pyogenes usually colonizes, pharynx, anus, and genital mucosa. Infections caused by S. pyogenes are highly contagious. Transmission can occur through airborne droplets, hand contact with nasal discharge or with objects or surfaces contaminated with bacteria, skin contact with contaminated lesions, or contaminated food sources. GAS Strains may acquire access to the skin via abrasions and skin lesions and may lead to erysipelas or cellulitis.S. pyogenes can cause the infection of the vaginal mucosa and uterus causing septicemia.S. pyogenes infections.
