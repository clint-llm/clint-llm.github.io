A range of routine and specialized tests should be utilized to aid clinicians in making a diagnosis of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis. These should be supported with careful history taking and comprehensive patient examination. Bloodwork should including a complete blood count, renal and liver function, coagulation studies, serum lipase, and peripheral blood cultures. The complete blood count may reveal microcytic anemia of chronic disease and neutrophilia. Raised urea and creatinine may be seen in more unwell, septic patients. Importantly, liver function tests will likely be deranged with values consistent with obstructive pathology, namely raised gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and bilirubin.E.coli.

Imaging has a major role in disease evaluation. Ultrasonography is the first line bedside investigation of choice. Abdominal ultrasound in patients with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis may show intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree dilatation, more prominent in central zones than peripheral zones. Intraductal calculi may be visible however echogenicity is variable. Associated periportal echogenicity is often present.

Abdominal computed tomography (CT) provides similar information to ultrasound with the added benefit of less user dependence and more clearly visualizing other abdominal structures and associated potential pathologies. CT findings include intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree dilatation (central > peripheral zones), hyperdense intraductal calculi (especially on unenhanced scans), biliary wall thickening, biliary stricture, and in rarer cases, pneumobilia. Patients with later-stage disease may demonstrate hepatic parenchymal atrophy, most commonly in the left lateral segment.

Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography  (MRCP) is the gold standard non-invasive imaging modality for the diagnosis of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is an invasive procedure useful in both diagnosis and management of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis. ERCP will be covered under “Treatment/Management.”
