Stent thrombosis, also known as abrupt vessel closure and acute stent thrombosis, is one of the fatal complications of percutaneous coronary intervention. A high clinical suspicion is needed for the evaluation of this condition, and measures are needed to promptly restore patency of the thrombosed vessels. This activity reviews the evaluation of stent thrombosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the causes of stent thrombosis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of stent thrombosis.
- Summarize the treatment of stent thrombosis.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team in having a high clinical suspicion for this condition in patients who present with angina and a recent history of coronary stenting for prompt diagnosis and better outcomes.
