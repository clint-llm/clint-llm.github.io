History and physical examination in pregnant women with hypothyroidism are similar to those with hypothyroidism in non-pregnant adults. Many women are asymptomatic while others may have fatigue, constipation, weight gain, and cold intolerance.

Physical examination findings may include dry skin, puffy faces, periorbital edema, delayed relaxation of deep tendon reflexes and bradycardia.
