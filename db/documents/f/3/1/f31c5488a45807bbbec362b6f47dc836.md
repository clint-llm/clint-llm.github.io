Percutaneous liver biopsy indications encompass those of liver biopsy in general. A liver biopsy has three major roles: (1) establishing a diagnosis, (2) for assessment of prognosis or disease staging, and (3) assisting with treatment options and clinical management.

Liver biopsy plays a major role in diagnosing numerous liver pathologies and can add additional information where blood testing may not. For example, a biopsy can assist with evaluating abnormal liver function tests if another workup is unremarkable.

Liver biopsy findings can have prognostic significance in the evaluation of liver disease. It can be useful in determining the stage of fibrosis and grade of inflammation for those affected with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and/or hepatitis C (HCV). However, there are increasing biochemical and virological measurements that are assisting with prognostication in these diseases.

Liver biopsy aiding the diagnosis of AIH can lead to the initiation of steroid therapy and guide with tapering and/or discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy. Treatment plans for those with PBC can be guided based on the severity of fibrosis.
