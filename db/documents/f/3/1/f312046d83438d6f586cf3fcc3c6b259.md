Narrowing the valve in aortic stenosis occurs due to the fusion of the leaflets or calcifications that cause the valve to have decreased mobility and obstruct the orifice. Calcified aortic stenosis occurs via progressive endothelial damage that can initially cause inflammation and infiltration of macrophages and other inflammatory cells. This inflammation and damage lead to profibrotic factors that establish a collagen matrix, which not unlike bone formation, later becomes calcified. The most common consequences of aortic stenosis stem from decreased anterograde flow from the left ventricle into the aorta, leading to a backup of blood in the left ventricle and increased left ventricular pressures. This backflow can cause symptoms of heart failure beginning with left atrial dilation and mitral regurgitation and eventually leading to pulmonary edema and right-sided heart failure. A healthy aortic valve measures 3 to 4 cm; symptoms generally do not precipitate until the valve area has decreased to less than 1.0 cm. The more severely stenotic the valve becomes, the more difficult it becomes to maintain adequate cardiac output. The left ventricle undergoes hypertrophy and remodeling, which can lead to increased left ventricular oxygen demand; this coupled with decreased cardiac output can lead to ischemia and arrhythmias and decreased cerebral perfusion.

Aortic regurgitation leads to retrograde flow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle, an increase in left ventricular volume, and dilation of the chamber. Initially, this leads to an increase in cardiac output and is maintainable for a prolonged period. However, this increase in cardiac output leads to distention and increased pressure in peripheral arteries, causing increased peripheral systolic pressure. Eventually, this causes worsening of the regurgitation, which can give rise to a rapid decrease in peripheral systolic pressure and, in severe disease, cardiovascular collapse (this phenomenon causes the characteristic wide pulse pressure in severe aortic regurgitation).
