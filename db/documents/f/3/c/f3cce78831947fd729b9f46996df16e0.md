Postpartum hemorrhage is one of the surgical emergencies in obstetrics. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that also includes laboratory personnel and labor and delivery nurses.

The treatment and management of postpartum hemorrhageÂ are focused on resuscitation of the patient while identifying and treating the specific cause. However, in many cases, the cause is surgical. Maintaining the hemodynamic stability of the patient is important to ensure continued perfusion to vital organs. Ample intravenous (IV) access should be obtained. Careful direct assessment of cumulative blood loss is important, and a focus should be on the early initiation of protocols for the release of blood products and massive transfusion protocols. Rapid identification of the cause of postpartum hemorrhage and initiating treatment should be made simultaneously. To improve outcomes, the resuscitation should be done in an operating department setting as anesthesia assistance may be indicated for help with a difficult laceration repair, to correct uterine inversion, to help provide analgesia if needed for removal of retained products, or if surgical exploration is indicated.
