OTFC is available as a sweetened lozenge with a fentanyl citrate base for oral administration by sucking to facilitate oral transmucosal absorption. OTFC is available in six different dosages based on the strength of the fentanyl citrate base: 200, 400, 600, 800, 1200, and 1600 micrograms. In BTP, it is necessary to initially establish control of chronic pain using long-term opioids. Afterward, OTFC is used to treat the episodic breakthrough pains that occur. It is necessary to titrate under supervision to establish the correct dosage for controlling BTP. Start with 200 micrograms; if the BTP remains uncontrolled after 15 minutes, the patient should wait 15 more minutes and then take another lozenge (30 minutes total after the first lozenge). The patient may receive no more than two lozenges per episode of BTP during the titration period to minimize adverse side effects. If the pain is relieved after the second dose of 200 micrograms, then for the next episode of BTP, one 400 microgram lozenge is used. If pain relief of a BTP episode requires more than two lozenges, an increase of OTFC strength is applied to the next BTP episode. After establishing the correct strength of OTFC for the control of a BTP episode, a limit of 4 units per day is set. OTFC has a rapid onset of analgesia with peak effects occurring at 20 to 40 minutes after administration and lasting 2 to 3 hours.
