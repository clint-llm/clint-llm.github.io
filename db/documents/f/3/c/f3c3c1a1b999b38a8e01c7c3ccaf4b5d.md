C. tetani is part of a genus of obligate anaerobic, saprophytic, gram-positive organisms well known for its toxin-producing ability making it one of the most dangerous of its genus. It is a spore-forming organism that cannot be eliminated from the environment and can withstand extreme temperature conditions in both indoor and outdoor environments. It is well known that tetanus spores can survive in the environment for many years and are often resistant to heat and disinfectants. The source of infection in most people is a wound. In others, tetanus may develop from a burn injury, abscess following a surgical procedure, intravenous drug abuse, or gangrene. In many cases, the patients have incomplete immunization or have not been vaccinated. In most people, the immunity from the tetanus vaccine declines with advancing age. Thus, vaccination or booster shots are required for prevention.

Neonatal tetanus is often the result of home delivery with the unsanitary cutting of the umbilical cord.
