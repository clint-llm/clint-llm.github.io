Superoxide and its partially reduced metabolites can react with various biomolecules, which implicates them in cell death, cellular dysfunction, inflammation, and several other pathophysiological conditions.

Large amounts of superoxide areÂ produced as the body generates inflammatory NO, leading to increased peroxynitrite concentrations, a cytotoxic mediator molecule.
