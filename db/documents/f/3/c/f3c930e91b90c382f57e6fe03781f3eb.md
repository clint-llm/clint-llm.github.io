**In Cases of Methanol/Ethylene Glycol Toxicity**

The loading and the maintenance dose should be carefully monitored in an intensive care setting to prevent the patient from any toxic manifestation of the antidote ethanol itself. Furthermore, ethanol must not be administered concurrently with fomepizole as the latter will inhibit the metabolism of ethanol in the same way as it inhibits the metabolism of methanol/ethylene glycol. This inhibition will result in an exaggerated rise in ethanol level in the body as its half-life is now prolonged and will inadvertently result in the manifestation of ethanol's intoxicating nature. Contraindications to ethanolÂ also include pregnancy and breastfeeding.

**For ABHS**

Though there is no clear-cut contraindication in any particular medical setup, it has been well established that ABHS doesn't kill the spores of several microorganisms, including the likes of Clostridium difficile. It is also not effective against certain protozoan oocysts, for example, cryptosporidium. ABHS has also been inefficient against a certain non-enveloped virus-like norovirus.

**As an Ablative Agent**

Percutaneous ethanol injection is contraindicated when:

- Prothrombin time (PT) is less than 40% of the normal.

- In thrombocytopenia (count < 40,000/ mm^3)
