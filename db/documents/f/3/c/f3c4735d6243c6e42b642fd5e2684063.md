In all adults preparing to begin isoniazid treatment, the clinician should order baseline measurements of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, serum creatinine, and platelet count. Regular monitoring of hepatic and renal function during treatment is unnecessary unless the patient has abnormal baseline levels or is at increased risk for hepatotoxicity (alcohol abuse, hepatitis B or C infection, etc.). Serum transaminases should be measured again two to four weeks after treatment initiation for those patients.

In patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, monthly sputum specimens are necessary (until there are two consecutive negative cultures) to assess response to treatment.
