A pre methotrexate evaluation is necessary before initiating medical therapy with methotrexate; this evaluation involves the blood tests, which include: complete blood count with differential, renal function tests include the serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and urinalysis, and liver function tests include serum bilirubin, AST, ALT,  serum albumin, hepatitis serology.

Methotrexate is administered orally or as injections (intramuscular, intravenous, intrathecal, or subcutaneous) injection.

Orally: Usual dosing is as a weekly "pulse," administered as a single dose or in three divided doses over 8 hourly in 24 hours every week. Folate supplementation with 1 mg per day or 5 to 7 mg once weekly should be considered for all patients to prevent bone marrow suppression. In adults, oral absorption is dependent upon the dose taken. Peak serum levels are achievable within one to two hours.

Injection: Single-dose auto-injector can deliver MTX in certain doses such as: 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, 15 mg, 17.5 mg, 20 mg, 22.5 mg, 25 mg, 27.5 mg, and 30 mg.

After initiation of medical therapy with methotrexate, follow-up tests should include monitoring of CBC, renal function test, and liver function tests are recommended weekly for 4 weeks and then at least bi-monthly.
