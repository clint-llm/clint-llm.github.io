Patients with ankylosing spondylitis are often not diagnosed by rheumatologists upon onset of symptoms. Since lower back pain is a prevalent complaint, often they go undiagnosed for decades.

In patients who have a diagnosis of spondyloarthropathies may see an impact on several aspects of daily life. Psoriatic arthritis can have significant effects on the patient’s physical, psychological, and sexual function.

Similarly, ankylosing spondylitis may impair physical function, contributing to work absence and disability, career changes, and activity modification. Some evidence suggests that aquatic therapy may play an essential role in improving physical function, range of motion, and overall pain in patients with ankylosing spondylitis as compared to home-based self-guided exercises.

Ophthalmologist referrals are essential in the management of uveitis for differentiating between inflammatory and infectious triggers.

Gastroenterologists may lead decisions in the management and diagnosis of IBD in patients with spondyloarthropathies. Subclinical gut inflammation is also common. The involvement of an interprofessional team, including physical therapists, behavioral health counselors, and pharmacists may be helpful in the management of the patient.
