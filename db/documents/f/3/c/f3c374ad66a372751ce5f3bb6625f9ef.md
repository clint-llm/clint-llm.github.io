Breast ptosis treatment requires close cooperation between all interprofessional healthcare team members to achieve good outcomes. It begins with the primary care physician and nurse practitioner, who identify those patients with breast ptosis and assess their pertinent medical history, including breast cancer risk factors and the need for further breast cancer screening.

Since the surgery is elective, all the medical health problems and risk factors should be identified and minimized, including encouraging the patient to stop smoking. The specialist surgeon will navigate the various surgical options with the patient and subsequently perform the most suitable surgery. In the postoperative period, the patient will require vigilant monitoring from the entire interprofessional team, with nursing playing a significant role in monitoring, and coordination with pharmacy if there is needed post-operative pain control. A physical therapist may guide the patient in a slow and progressive return to intense physical activity in 4 to 6 weeks.
