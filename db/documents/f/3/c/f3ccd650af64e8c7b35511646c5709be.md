The prognosis is determined primarily by the associated malformations.

Agenesis of the corpus callosum is associated with the following intracranial anomalies (in decreasing order of frequency)

- Interhemispheric cyst with hydrocephalus

- Dandy-Walker malformation

- Neuronal migration disorder

- Agenesis of the inferior vermis

- Encephalocele

- Lipoma of the interhemispheric fissure

The children with isolated agenesis of the corpus callosum without any significant neurologic sequelae have the best prognosis.

The children with agenesis of corpus callosum associated with the neuronal migration disorder with or without Dandy-Walker malformation have the worst prognosis.
