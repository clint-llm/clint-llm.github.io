DVT increases the risk of pulmonary embolism by 50% and also leads to post-thrombotic syndrome. Using DVT prophylaxis in hospitalized patients decreases the risk of DVT anywhere from 10 to 80%. DVT prophylaxis decreases the risk of DVT/PE in both hospitalized medical and surgical patients. However, mortality benefits have been reported in surgical patients but not medical patients.
