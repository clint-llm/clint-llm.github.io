Tumors in the superior sulcus of the lung, typically non-small cell lung cancer, cause Pancoast syndrome. Among all lung cancers, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority with up to 80% to 85% of all cases, whereas Pancoast tumors by themselves account for roughly 3% to 5% of all lung cancers. More than 95% of Pancoast tumors are NSCLC, and among NSCLC, squamous cell carcinoma used to be the most common histologic type; however, lately, studies have been showing a predominance of adenocarcinoma.

Other than bronchogenic carcinomas, malignancies such as primary adenoid cystic carcinomas, thyroid carcinomas, lymphomas, or metastasis from any primary carcinoma or even benign tumors occupying the superior pulmonary sulcus are known to cause Pancoast syndrome. Rarely, other malignancies, including paravertebral thoracic schwannoma and myxofibrosarcoma, may cause the clinical findings pertinent with the Pancoast syndrome.
