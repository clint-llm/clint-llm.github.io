Biofeedback techniques can divide into two main groups based on the type of action they aim to control â€“ physiologic or biomechanical. Each type requires specific equipment to measure the sensory parameter, transform it to feedback, and display the results.

Physiologic biofeedback uses electromyography to measure muscle activity. The autonomic activity can be monitored through measurements of heart rate, respiratory rate and depth, and electrodermal activity. Electroencephalography is possible but less frequently used.

Biomechanical feedback parameters describe movement and spatial orientation. They are measured with inertial motion detectors (e.g., accelerometer or gyroscope), force plate sensors, and real-time ultrasound. Endoscopy has been used successfully used but is not a common strategy.

The information from the sensors is processed and transformed into the returned feedback, which may be visual (changing graphics display or pattern), auditory (varying tone or music volume), or haptic (vibrating wearable device).

Virtual reality uses wearable motion detector sensors and more extensive processing and display equipment. Virtual reality can help create interactive games that incorporate rehabilitation mechanics, which is especially beneficial for pediatric patients.
