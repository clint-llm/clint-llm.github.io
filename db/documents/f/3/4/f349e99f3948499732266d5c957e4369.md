Generally, the prognosis is good.

- Most small cavernous sinus aneurysms are small and asymptomatic. The risk of rupture is veryÂ low.

- Symptomatic or large lesions can be managed with endovascular balloon occlusion with excellent outcomes.

- The morbidity of these aneurysms is low.

- When surgery is done to repair a cavernous sinus aneurysm, the risk of neurological and ophthalmological deficits is always a concern, and hence, good judgment is required before undertaking an open procedure.
