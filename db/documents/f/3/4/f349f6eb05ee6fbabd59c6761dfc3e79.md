Patients with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia should be promptly evaluated and adequately treated, as it can lead to significant long-term disability when neglected. Due to tibial bowing and decreased tibial growth, the disease can cause extensive bone deformities with pathological fractures and leg shortening. The various surgical options strive to achieve bone union, correct bone deformity, and restore the limb length. Also, interprofessional management is often necessary due to the association of this disease with neurofibromatosis type 1.
