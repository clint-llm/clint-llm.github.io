The parents usually complain that the baby’s head doesn’t look right. Frequently they noted that the deformity continues to worsen as the child’s head continues to grow. Parents are asked for a history of prior cases of craniosynostosis.

Clinical observation is essential. A physical examination will show the elongated head and a palpable bone ridge at the head's vertex. Head measurement shows an increased anteroposterior dimension. The bilateral dimension is shortened, producing biparietal and bitemporal narrowing. Prominent frontal and occipital bossing can be observed. The cephalic index is calculated by measuring the biparietal diameter and the occipitofrontal diameter and obtaining the ratio. The typical average index is approximately 80-83. In scaphocephaly, the index is reduced as the occipitofrontal diameter is larger. There are no visible abnormalities of the cranial base, orbits, or face in nonsyndromic sagittal craniosynostosis.

The baby is evaluated for respiratory difficulty. In severe cases, the head is abnormally flexed when lying supine causing airway compromise. An ophthalmologic examination should be obtained to assess for papilledema, indicating an increased intracranial pressure.
