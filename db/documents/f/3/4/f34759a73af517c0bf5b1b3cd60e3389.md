Electrolytes should be corrected in case of electrolyte abnormalities. Amiodarone is the drug of choice and is given as a loading dose followed by a maintenance infusion. It can be used alone but is often used with other medications, including propranolol and flecainide.

Ivabradine has also been seen as an effective medication for congenital JET. Multiple medications can increase the risk of sudden cardiac death due to proarrhythmic effects. In postoperative JET, induction of hypothermia can also control these arrhythmias. Magnesium sulfate infusion preoperatively can also decrease the risk of these arrhythmias. Postoperative JET usually resolves within 72 hours. Dexmedetomidine, propafenone, procainamide, and sotalol have also been used in treating postoperative JET. Catheter ablation has been reserved for refractory cases.
