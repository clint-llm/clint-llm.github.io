Diagnosis is based on the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the Revised diagnostic criteria.

National institute of health (NIH) criteria were published in 1987.

- **Café-au-lait macules:**six or more with the greatest dimension of 5 to 15 mm under normal light

- **Neurofibromas:**two or more of any type or one plexiform neurofibroma

- **Freckling:**axillary or inguinal

- 
**Optic gliomas**

- **Lisch nodules:**two or more

- **Bony lesions:**sphenoid dysplasia, pseudoarthrosis, and others

- **Family history:**a first-degree relative with the disease.

NIH criteria are both highly sensitive and specific except for young children.

The Revised diagnostic criteria published in 2021 includes the following:

**A: A patient with no family history should have two or more of the following:**

- Six or more café-au-lait macules over 5 mm ( before puberty) and over 15 mm (after puberty)

- Freckling in the axillary or inguinal region

- Two or more neurofibromas of any type or one plexiform neurofibroma

- Optic pathway glioma

- Two or more iris Lisch nodules choroidal abnormalities

- A distinctive osseous lesion such as sphenoid dysplasia, bowing of the tibia, or pseudarthrosis of a long bone

- A  pathogenic NF1 variant

**B: A child with a positive family history can have only one or more criteria in A.**

At least one of the two pigmentary findings (café-au-lait macules or freckling) should be bilateral.

Sphenoid wing dysplasia is not a separate criterion in the case of an ipsilateral orbital plexiform neurofibroma.

Mosaic NF1 should be suspected if the pigmentary lesions are only unilateral. Looking for Lisch nodules/choroidal anomalies or confirmation through genetic testing is the recommended approach in these cohorts.

Neuroradiological findings include neurofibromatosis, bright spots, and a high volume of the brain (megalencephaly).

Other manifestations of NF1 include:

- Focal areas of signal intensity (FASI)

- Glioma

- Interstitial lung disease

- Gastrointestinal neoplasm

- Scoliosis.

Genetic testing is not mandatory for the diagnosis. It can be utilized for establishing the diagnosis in questionable presentations, screening of family members, and prenatal screening. Ninety-five percent of mutations can be detected by genetic testing in individuals with NF-1 clinical diagnosis.

A free-text search algorithm, NF1 ICD-9, and ICD-10 codes are also available for the diagnosis and management of NF1.
