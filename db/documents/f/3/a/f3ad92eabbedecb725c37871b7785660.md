It is crucial that the patient with osteomyelitis be managed by an interprofessional team. This team should consist of a Wound & Hyperbaric Medicine Specialist, Podiatric, General or Vascular Surgeons, Interventional Radiologists and Infectious Disease specialists. Osteomyelitis is usually treated with IV antibiotics but chronic or recalcitrant cases may be managed with HBO therapy. It should be understood that HBO therapy is not a substitute treatment but an adjunct treatment to the antibiotics.

The limited cases indicate that HBO therapy can help improve healing.
