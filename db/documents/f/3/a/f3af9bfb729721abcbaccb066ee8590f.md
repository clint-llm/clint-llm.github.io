Thyroid cancer is often described as an indolent pathology with a good prognosis; however, poorly differentiated subtypes describe an aggressive behavior with extensive metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. PET/CT has been established as an important modality in the detection of poorly differentiated thyroid cancer. This activity reviews the biochemical basis, indications, technique, and clinical significance of PET/CT, highlighting the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with thyroid cancer.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the role of PET/CT in the management of thyroid cancer.
- Review the physiological basis behind radiotracer uptake in thyroid cancer subtypes.
- Summarize imaging findings in thyroid cancer and potential pitfalls.
- Discuss current recommendations and indications for PET/CT use by the interprofessional team.
