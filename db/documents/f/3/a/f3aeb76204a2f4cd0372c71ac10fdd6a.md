Determining the difference between hemodynamic and embolic stroke in the presence of chronic internal carotid artery occlusion is important. Embolic symptoms may be from classic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Symptoms may include contralateral motor or sensory deficits as well as amaurosis fugax. Hemodynamic symptoms may be similar to a classic stroke or TIA but may also be less predictable and atypical. Patients have reported symptoms such as limb shaking, retinal claudication, headache from large pulsatile external carotid artery collaterals, syncope, and generalized fatigue. One-third of all strokes are related to cervical carotid disease. Standard risk factors for coronary and systemic atherosclerosis such as age, male sex, family history, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, sedentary lifestyle, and high dietary fat apply to this patient population. The mechanism of cervical carotid stroke is usually embolization from the carotid bifurcation plaque, but hemodynamic compromise from stenosis may also play a role. The risks of embolization and hemodynamic compromise increase with increasing carotid artery stenosis.
