Similar to all electronic databases, problems that may be encountered include difficulty with obtaining login access, inability to use the database when systems are offline for maintenance and other purposes, lack of integration of comprehensive information into clinical workflow, and presence of incomplete data.

The formation of certain guidelines has also been met with resistance by primary care providers due to the hindrance of patient-provider trust. For instance, some guidelines recommend the use of written agreements (pain contracts) and urine drug screening, which may be interpreted as a confrontational approach by some patients and thus introduce a source of mistrust.

The PDMP has been developed at the level of individual states, leading to considerable variation in policies, query generation, and data reporting. Â This lack of consistent data collection and report standardization between states makes it challenging to interpret results for providers needing to access multiple different state-specific PDMPs. It is likely that these PDMP deficiencies have hindered clinical outcomes research.
