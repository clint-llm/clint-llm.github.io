Evaluation is usually done on imaging initially. Oncocytomas may be discovered incidentally. There are no precise radiologic criteria for distinguishing a benign oncocytoma from a malignant lesion like renal cell carcinoma. However, central scar and hypervascularity can often be appreciated on imaging.

Evaluation of a kidney mass can be done with core biopsy, fine needle aspiration, or resection. Oncocytomas are often small, and since 20% to 45% of small renal masses are ultimately found to be benign, active surveillance is often an option offered to some patients.

If the histology and staining patterns are difficult to interpret, conventional karyotyping and FISH may be considered to look for a diploid karyotype of loss of chromosome 1, which would be supportive for the diagnosis of oncocytoma.
