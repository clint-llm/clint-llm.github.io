In the United States, diltiazem is FDA-approved as an oral immediate-release, extended-release, controlled-release (CD), and intravenous formulation. There are numerous brand names for oral diltiazem (capsules and tablets), and available strengths include 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg, 120 mg, 180 mg, 240 mg, 300 mg, 360 mg, and 420 mg. Compounded topical preparations of diltiazem are used off-label.****

Diltiazem may be confused with diazepam. The use of tall-man lettering is advised to avoid this medication error as it poses a significant threat to patient safety. Hence FDA and ISMP (institute of safe medical practices) have provided the name of these sound-alike look-alike drugs to avoid potential medical errors.

The following represent the dosing variances by condition using generic names under various trade names.

- Maintenance dose: IV continuous infusion 10mg/hr

- Increase dose at 5mg/hr to max 15mg/hr
- Max infusion time is 24 hours

**Renal Impairment**

- No dose adjustment is necessary.

**Hepatic Impairment**

- No dose adjustment is likely needed for mild-moderate hepatic impairment, but diltiazem is extensively metabolized in the liver. Consequently, use with caution in hepatic impairment.

**Pregnancy Considerations**

- Diltiazem is teratogenic in animals, and only limited human data exist; thus, its use is only recommended in pregnancy if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

**Breastfeeding Considerations**

- Diltiazem is excreted in human milk. Based on the current data, the amounts of diltiazem ingested by the infant are small. However, due to serious adverse reactions, if diltiazem is deemed essential, the clinician should suggest an alternative method of infant feeding.
