Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is a chronic, non-infectious, inflammatory condition of poorly understood etiology that affects the urinary bladder. It is often a difficult condition to manage, with a variable response. It has a profound impact on the psychological and social well-being of the patient if symptoms are inadequately treated. This activity explains the approach, investigation, and management of interstitial cystitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating interstitial cystitis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of interstitial cystitis.
- Outline the management of patients with interstitial cystitis.
- Explain the prognosis of interstitial cystitis.
- Summarize how an interprofessional team can coordinate the care of interstitial cystitis to provide the best outcomes.
