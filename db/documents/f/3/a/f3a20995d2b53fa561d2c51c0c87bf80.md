If possible, the skin should be prepared before the placement of the pacer pads. Hair should be removed, but not shaved as this can create a nidus for infection. The skin should be cleansed with an alcohol wipe to remove any dirt, debris, or sweat whenever possibleÂ to ensure maximum conduction between the pads and the skin.
