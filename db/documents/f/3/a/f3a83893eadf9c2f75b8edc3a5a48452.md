Nearly four percent of the global population was using cannabis in 2015.

During pregnancy, four percent of mothers admit to using drugs, most commonly with cannabis.

As consumption increases amongÂ adults, so does the unintended consequence of exposure to children. Between 2005 and 2009, 985 unintentional exposures to children (median age of 1.7 years) were reported. States legalizing marijuana have had a 20-fold increase in calls to poison centers and admissions to critical care units for its exposure.

Overall, the trend for using cannabis is increasing over time for most, if not all demographics.
