Education for patients diagnosed with pylephlebitis should include the importance of compliance with antibiotics, primary causes of this disorder, and possible complications especially if treatment recommendations are not followed. If a chronic predisposing condition to this disorder is present such as an inherited thrombophilia or cirrhosis, counseling regarding appropriate management and follow up for these conditions is warranted as well.
