The mechanical functions of the body are carried out by the coordinated functioning of the musculoskeletal system. Therefore, the functionality of the patient is directly dependent on the efficiency of the musculoskeletal system. Musculoskeletal complaints are one of the top reasons for doctor visits constituting over half of chronic medical conditions in the United States. As primary care physicians often evaluate these problems, it is essential to follow a systematic and organized approach to the musculoskeletal examination. Functionality analysis can be the key to understand the patient and centers the evaluation at what is most necessary for the patient - daily functional ability. To be able to quantify the outcomes and improvements of a patient, the clinician must have quantified records of the tests. It is the only non-subjective way to do it. The clinician also can use questionnaires to comparison before-after as SF-36, Roland Morris, Oswestry, and DASH.
