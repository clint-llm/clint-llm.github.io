Ametropias are the leading cause of oculovisual morbidity worldwide. Prescribing for ametropia involves every member of the eye care team. A clear understanding of presenting complaints by the attending nurses or doctors sets the stage for classifying any vision deficit as a near-of-distance vision problem. The optometrist or refraction nurse is responsible for carrying out proper refraction on the patient to certain types and levels of ametropia. For infants and children, special techniques like cycloplegic refraction and Mohindra retinoscopy may be necessary.

Cycloplegics can significantly affect young children and should be used only when necessary. Cosmetic considerations are important in ensuring compliance with spectacle usage.
