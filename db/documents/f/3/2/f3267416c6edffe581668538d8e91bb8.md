Neurotrophic keratitis is best managed by an interprofessional team that also includes the ophthalmology nurse.

Clinicians should be aware that patients with neurotrophic keratitis rarely complain of symptoms, probably due to their lack of corneal sensation. Occasionally, however, they may present with redness and blurring of vision. The blurring of vision can occur due to persistent epithelial defects, corneal edema, or scarring. Antecedent episodes of redness and eye pain or the presence of cutaneous blistering or scarring suggest previous herpetic infections. History of corneal trauma, surgery, chemical burns, long-term use of topical medications, neurosurgical procedures, or diabetes may be obtained. Once the disorder is suspected, a prompt referral to an ophthalmologist is necessary.

Early treatment can help prevent the worsening of the corneal injury.
