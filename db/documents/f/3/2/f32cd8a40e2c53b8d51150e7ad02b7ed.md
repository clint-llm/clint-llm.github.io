**Posterior Epistaxis**

The sphenopalatine artery carries the most significant volume of blood to the nose and is the source of most posteriorly based nose bleeds.

**Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma**

Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is an uncommon benign tumor that originates in the lateral wall close to the sphenopalatine foramen. This tumor predominantly affects adolescent males and is locally aggressive, often invading the surrounding structures and tissues. JNA commonly presents with painless, progressive unilateral nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and rhinorrhea. JNA has a rich vascular supply primarily from the sphenopalatine artery. Macroscopically the tumor appears as a rounded circumscribed non-encapsulated mucosa covered mass. Microscopically the tumor shows haphazardly arranged collagen with an irregular vascular pattern. Because of the rich vascular supply, the embolization of the sphenopalatine artery and surgical resection of the tumor provides a good prognosis if JNA is diagnosed early enough.
