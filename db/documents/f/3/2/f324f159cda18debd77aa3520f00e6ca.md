The Child Health and Disability Prevention (CHDP) Program Health Assessment Guidelines (guideline #4) recommend anthropometric measurements in all children and adolescents at each preventive visit to ensure adequate growth patterns and to assess the risk of obesity. Accurate serial measurements over time are the most important aspect of anthropometry. Solitary deviations from a growth pattern curve can be a normal variant or due to an acute illness. However, according to the CHDP guidelines, steady change of the growth curve on serial measurements is a reliable indicator of an abnormal growth pattern and warrants further workup. For infants and toddlers less than two years of age, weight, length, and head circumference are indicated anthropometric measurements at each well-visit. For children greater than two years of age, indicated measurements include weight and length.Â Body Mass Index (BMI) measurement is recommended for all children two years and older to determine adequate nutritional status and risk of obesity. These measurements should be plotted on World Health Organization (WHO) charts or the CDC charts, which are gender and age-specific to compare the child to the average population.

In adults, anthropometric measurements are recommended at each well-visit to determine nutritional status and the risk of future disease.
