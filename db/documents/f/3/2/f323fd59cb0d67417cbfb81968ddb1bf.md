Rotator cuff syndrome (RCS) is a clinical entity consisting of a wide range of clinical symptoms, ranging in severity from mild shoulder impingement, but eventually in the long-term setting, can lead to progressive partial-thickness cuff tears (PTTs) and/or full-thickness cuff tears (FTTs). The disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team consisting of clinicians and surgeons.

When clinicians are working up acute or chronic shoulder pain, it is imperative to correlate the clinical examination with radiographic imaging, MRI, and response to nonoperative treatment modalities. The latter consists of physical therapy, NSAIDs, rest/activity modification, and injections.

For patients managed conservatively, the pharmacist should educate the patient on pain management. In addition, the physical therapist should educate the patient on beneficial exercises that can improve muscle strength and joint mobility.

Surgical management is considered after impingement symptoms fail to resolve or worsen after all other management modalities are exhausted. Referral to an orthopedic surgeon should be considered, especially with long-standing persistent symptoms.

Close communication with the members of the team is essential to ensure improved patient outcomes.
