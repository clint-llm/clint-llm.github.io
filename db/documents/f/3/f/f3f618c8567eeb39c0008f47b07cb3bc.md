Giardiasis is a relatively common enteric infection caused by the protozoa Giardia duodenalis. The majority of patients present with watery diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Emergency department providers, nurse practitioners, and primary caregivers need to know that hydration is the key in all patients. Only those with severe symptoms need anti-helminthic medications. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis or management, an infectious disease expert should be consulted. Following treatment, symptoms subside rapidly, but a few patients may develop sensitivity to dairy products for a few weeks or months.
