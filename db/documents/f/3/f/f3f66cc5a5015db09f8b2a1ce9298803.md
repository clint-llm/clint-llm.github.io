**Tibialis Anterior Tendon**

Recent studies have shown variability in the insertion of the tibialis anterior tendon. This may be of clinical significance because different insertion points may cause redistributions of force on the foot and ankle. These differences become significant during anterior tibialis tendon ruptures when it may be necessary for biomechanics to match up the previous tendon type.

**Accessory Peroneal Muscles**

Peroneus quartus is an accessory muscle found in 6 to 22% of people, depending on the study. It typically arises from the peroneus brevis muscle; origins from the peroneus tertius and longus muscles are described. This muscle has been found to have different insertions, including the cuboid, the lateral tubercle of the calcaneus, the apophysis of the cochlea of the calcaneus, or the retrotrochlear eminence of the calcaneus. In some instances, this muscle belly will give rise to a tendon that inserts on a phalanx of the fifth digit, thus earning the name peroneus digiti quinti. If present, the peroneus digiti quinti may help to extend the fifth digit.

Several studies have shown the association between the presence of a peroneus quartus muscle and associated pathology. Symptomatology in the form of ankle pain in the absence of trauma to the lateral ankle is common. Other pathology noted includes peroneal subluxation, tendinous calcification, and hypertrophy of the retrotrochlear eminence of the calcaneus, causing pain.
