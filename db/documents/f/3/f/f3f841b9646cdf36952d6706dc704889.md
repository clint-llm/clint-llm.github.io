Surgery and radiotherapy are the two principle modalities used in the treatment of patients suffering from oropharyngeal cancers. Surgery or radiotherapy can be used primarily if the tumor is small and has not advanced. However, if the disease has advanced or the tumor is larger, then a combination of surgery and radiotherapy is used. Implementing minimally invasive procedures, such as transoral laser microsurgery (TLM), as a first-line treatment modality for oropharyngeal carcinomas, have been found safe and efficacious

Other resection methods include transoral robotic surgery, transoral video laryngoscopic surgery, transoral ultrasound surgery, and endoscopic laryngopharyngeal surgery

Following surgery, an increase in survival is seen in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy or concomitant chemoradiotherapy. In the case of unresectable tumors, concomitant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, along with radiotherapy, is considered the gold standard and has shown to be better in terms of improving survival as compared to radiotherapy alone
