Management depends on underlying etiology. For asymptomatic intermittent hematuria with negative imaging, stable renal functions, and absence of proteinuria, observation may be a reasonable approach. Overt hematuria needs prompt management. Hemodynamic stability should be assured first. Any hematological abnormality should be corrected by blood products, transfusions, or medications. In rare instances, interventional radiology guided embolism is required to stop life-threatening bleeding from renal vasculature or for hemorrhagic cystitis refractory to conventional treatments.

**Non-Glomerular causes of hematuria:**Acute urinary tract infections are treated with a 7-14 day course of oral or intravenous antibiotics. Nephrolithiasis management is supportive, with controlling pain and administering fluids. Kidney stone size and location could warrant further management.

**Glomerular causes of hematuria:**Some hereditary diseases like Alport’s, thin basement membrane disease, and polycystic kidney Disease need monitoring of renal functions, and regular follow up. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis requires supportive care. IgA nephropathy treatment depends on degree proteinuria and renal function. Relatively normal creatinine with minimal proteinuria may be managed conservatively. High-risk features including worsening creatinine, persistent proteinuria 1000mg/day, and active disease on renal biopsy are indications to consider immunosuppressive therapy especially steroids.
