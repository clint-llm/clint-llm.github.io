Primary care physicians and providers (PCP) have an important role in identifying patients with decreased visual loss due to cataracts. With patient complaints of decline in visual functions such as difficulty reading, difficulty recognizing faces, or smaller objects such as golf balls, glare, or worsening vision at night, a PCP should suspect cataracts and do a thorough history and physical exam. If cataracts are visualized, or the PCP has a high degree of suspicion, they should refer to ophthalmology. Within surgery, ophthalmologists rely on anesthesiology, nurses, as well as scrub techs. While ophthalmology follows postoperatively for up to one year, some complications, like posterior capsule opacification, can present up to 3 years later. With these later complications, ophthalmologists rely on primary care teams to recognize these later-term complications as patients might present in their clinic.
