DysbarismÂ includes medical conditions resulting from changes in ambient pressure; they include barotrauma, nitrogen narcosis, high-pressure neurological syndrome, and decompression illness. Because of the varied presentation, these disorders are best managed by an interprofessional team. However, it is important to consult with a diving expert or the individual in charge of the hyperbaric chamber when it comes to management. The presentation of symptoms for DCI often is vague and delayed; therefore, it is important to have a low threshold for treatment.
