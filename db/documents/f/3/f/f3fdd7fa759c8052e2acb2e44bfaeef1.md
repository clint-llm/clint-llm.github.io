When acute promyelocytic leukemia is suspected, evaluation of peripheral blood smear and FISH for the fusion of PML/RARA should be expedited for rapid diagnosis of this time-sensitive disease. A prompt coagulopathy workup including a platelet count, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT), d-dimer or fibrin split products, and fibrinogen should also be performed. Bone marrow biopsy and immunophenotyping should also be performed. Conventional karyotyping should also be performed as a part of initial workup as it detects rare molecular subtypes of acute promyelocytic leukemia and other additional coexistent cytogenetic abnormalities- t(15:17). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for PML-RARA RNA is also used for confirming the diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia and can also be used can for monitoring minimal residual disease.

Acute promyelocytic leukemia is classified into low-risk (white blood cell count (WBC) 10,000/microL or less and platelets 40,000/microL or more), intermediate (WBC 10,000/microL or less and platelets 40,000/microL or less), and high-risk (WBC more than 10,000/microL) to guide treatment.

Lumbar puncture is done in high-risk patients with elevated WBC count if intrathecal therapy is contemplated. Further, a cardiac evaluation is necessary before administering anthracyclines.
