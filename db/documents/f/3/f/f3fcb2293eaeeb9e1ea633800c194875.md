Although the aetiologies of koilonychia are myriad, to simplify they may be divided into hereditary or congenital, acquired and idiopathic causes. It is primarily considered to be a manifestation of chronic iron deficiency anemia due to malnutrition, worms, celiac disease, gastrointestinal blood loss, and malignancy.

At times, koilonychia may also be a manifestation of inflammatory skin diseases such as lichen planus or psoriasis, or maybe secondary to systemic alterations such as endocrine disorders (hypo or hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus), Plummer-Vinson syndrome, alopecia areata, onychomycosis , trauma, occupational exposure to petroleum products, high altitude, vascular disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, genetic or autoimmune disorders etc.

Nail diseases in the pediatric population differ from those in adults with respect to the diagnostic and management approaches; however, few of them are exclusively manifested only in children. Pediatric patients with underlying systemic disorders are more likely to manifest acquired disorders of the nails. Â In the newborns, koilonychia is frequently found to be idiopathic and presents as a normal variant in 33% of cases, especially affecting the big toe, which regresses spontaneously after the age of 9 years once the nail plate thickens and becomes hard.
