The mesenchyme of the head, including the orbit and its structures, arises in mesoderm and neural crest cells primarily. The extraocular muscles originate from mesoderm, but the satellite and connective tissue of the muscle derive from neural crest cells. Most of the remaining connective tissue of the orbit also is derived from neural crest cells.
