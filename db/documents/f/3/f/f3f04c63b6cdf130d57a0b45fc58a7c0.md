Chimeric antigen receptor-T (CAR-T) cell therapy is a type of genetically modified immunotherapy that is directed at cancer cells. The method involves using an individual's own T-cells (or donor cells in allogeneic CART), transduced with gene encodes ex vivo, then introduced to the patient.

Clusters of differentiation-19 (CD-19), a B cell surface marker, -directed CAR-T cells show encouraging outcomes in a variety of malignancies, including pediatric and B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The first approved CAR-T therapy targeting CD-19, tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel, ELIANA), was initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with ALL in 2017, and later diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high-grade B-cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma (JULIET).

Since then, more agents such as lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) have made their way onto the market, demonstrating better tolerance.

Despite the current success rate of CAR-T therapy, it comes with the caveat of significant toxicities. The most common adverse events (AEs) of CAR-T therapy, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), remain barriers to the use of CAR-T cell therapy. Other AEs, such as cytopenia,s, infections, tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), acute anaphylaxis, etc., are also challenging.
