Although other strains ofÂ avian influenza viruses (AIVs) are likely to have infected humans from time to time, the most well-known strains to cause infection are H5N1 and H7N9. To date, there have been no confirmed human cases of AIV infection in the United States, although there has been one confirmed death from AIVs in Canada.
