Education of patients must focus on:

Hygiene: wash hands more frequently to help remove pathogens on the surface of the hands.

Avoid scratching the feet or touching onychomycosis.

Treat tinea pedis in time to prevent it from spreading from the feet to the hands.

Identify and treat possible contacts.

Encourage treatment compliance and avoid self-treatment with topical corticosteroids and antibiotics. These additional and often unnecessary treatments can delay the correct diagnosis.
