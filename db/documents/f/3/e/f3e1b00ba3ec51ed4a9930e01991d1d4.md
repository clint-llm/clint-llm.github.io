Microscopic examination of the infected tissue such as colon, rectum, or distal ileum may result in the following findings including polymorphonuclear cells infiltration of the epithelial cells, and the formation of inflammatory patch pseudomembranes. Shigella multiplies in the colonic epithelium leading to cell death. It then spreads laterally to infect and kill adjacent epithelium causing ulceration of mucosa which leads to inflammation and bleeding.
