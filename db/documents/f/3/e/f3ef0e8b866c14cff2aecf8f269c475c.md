The primary indications for umbilical artery catheterization include the need for frequent measurement of arterial blood gases, frequent blood sampling, or continuous blood pressure monitoring in the extremely low-birthweight infant or critically ill neonates. Occasionally, it can be used temporarily to infusion parenteral nutrition if alternate access is unavailable.

Refractory hypoglycemia is a rare complication of umbilical arterial catheters when dextrose is infusing through them.

An umbilical arterial catheter can be lifesaving in managing critically ill neonates. However, the risks and benefits must be carefully weighed before attempting the procedure due to the potential complications associated with its use. Very low birth weight infants (with less than 1000 g body weight), preterm infants who need mechanical ventilator support, infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy undergoing therapeutic hypothermia, critically ill late preterm or term infants requiring mechanical ventilation are some of the groups of neonates who might benefit from the use of umbilical arterial catheter owing to the need for frequent blood sampling.
