The purpose of the exam should be explained to the patient prior to beginning. Expose the epigastrium, taking care to keep the patient’s chest and pelvic region covered. Clean towels should be used to protect the patient’s gown, clothing, and sheets from becoming soiled by gel. Position the ultrasound machine such that the screen is viewable while the exam is performed. Ideally, the examiner should be standing at the patient’s right side with the ultrasound machine positioned opposite the examiner on the patient’s left side.
