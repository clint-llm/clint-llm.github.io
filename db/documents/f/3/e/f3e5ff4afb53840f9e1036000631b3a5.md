Tumor lysis syndrome is most common in patients diagnosed with leukemia who have a very high white blood cell (WBC) count. It can also be seen in high-grade lymphomas, especially after the initiation of aggressive chemotherapy. Other solid tumors that can cause tumor lysis syndrome are hepatoblastoma or neuroblastoma.

An international panel of experts has stratified tumors based on the risk of developing tumor lysis syndrome.

**High-Risk Tumors**

- Advanced Burkitt lymphoma

- Advanced leukemia

- Early-stage leukemia or Burkitt lymphoma with elevated lactate dehydrogenase

- Acute lymphocytic leukemia with a white cell count of more than 100,000/microliters, or if the increase of lactate dehydrogenase from the baseline is two times the upper limit of normal

- Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and bulky disease with a baseline lactate dehydrogenase two times the upper limit of normal

- Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a white cell count more than or equal to 10,000/microliters

**Intermediate-Risk Tumors**

- AML with A white cell count between 25,000 and 100,000/microliters

- Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) with a white cell count of less than 100,000/microL and LDH of less than twice the upper limit of normal

- DLBCL with a baseline increase in lactate dehydrogenase of twice the upper limit of normal but the non-bulky disease

- Early-stage leukemia and Burkitt lymphoma with a lactate dehydrogenase of less than twice the upper limit of normal

**Low-Risk Tumors**

- Solid cancers

- Multiple myelomas

- Indolent lymphomas

- Chronic lymphocytic leukemia

- Chronic myeloid leukemia

- AML with a WBC count of less than 25,000/microliters and a lactate dehydrogenase elevated to less than two times the upper limit of normal

Rarely, tumor lysis syndrome is associated with the administration of steroids, biological immunomodulators, and monoclonal antibodies. Agents that are associated with the development of tumor lysis syndrome include:

- Thalidomide

- Bortezomib

- Hydroxyurea

- Paclitaxel

- Fludarabine

- Etoposide

- Zoledronic acid

In rare instances, tumor lysis syndrome has been observed in patients under general anesthesia undergoing surgery. Other rare occurrences of tumor lysis syndrome are seen in pregnancy or high fever.
