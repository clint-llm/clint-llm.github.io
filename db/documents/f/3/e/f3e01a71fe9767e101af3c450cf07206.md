The potential side effects of anabolic steroid misuse are significant and chronic. Health care providers should be aware of patients at risk of anabolic-androgenic steroid misuse. Ongoing patient education about the potential side effects should be provided for patients who take androgens for therapeutic use. Timely identification of the anabolic steroid abuse and appropriate referral for treatment is highly warranted.
