It is important to rule out other causes before making the diagnosis of melanosis coli. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an autosomal dominant disorder that leads to numerous hamartomatous polyps in the bowel with distinct findings of melanin deposition in the skin and mucosa, may look like melanosis coli. Patients with this disease are at a 15-fold increase of developing colon cancerÂ and must be ruled out prior to making the diagnosis of melanosis coli.
