Management of lactose intolerance consists of dietary modification, lactase supplementation, and treating an underlying condition in people with secondary lactase deficiency.

**Dietary Modification**

Lactase-containing milk products and calcium supplements are recommended. Limiting the dietary intake of lactose by avoiding the intake of lactose-containing products improves the symptoms of the disease. The following products contain lactose and, therefore, must be avoided:

- Soft and processed cheese

- Buttermilk

- Cream

- Milk

- Ice cream

- Sour cream

- Whey

- Pancakes and waffles

- Mashed potatoes

- Butter

- Margarine

- Custard and pudding

Yogurt contains varying amounts of lactose and may cause symptoms in some patients. Greek yogurt has the least. Yogurt culture microorganisms can produce β-galactosidase as part of their lactose utilization pathway. This may promote lactose digestion in vivo.

**Lactase Supplements**

Lactase enzyme supplements contain lactase which breaks down lactose in milk and milk-containing products. They are available as lactase enzyme tablets or drops.
