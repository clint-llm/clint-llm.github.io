Laryngotracheal stenosis is a rare condition that may result from different etiologies and has serious health implications. Physicians need to consider it in patients presenting with dyspnea, stridor, wheezing, and/or changes in voice. Making the diagnosis is crucial in order to involve the necessary teams to treat the patient, including a critical care physician if there is a concern for airway patency and acute airway protection. In more insidious or chronic situations, it is prudent to involve an interventional pulmonologist and/or otolaryngologist for bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy for further evaluation. A rheumatologist may help if LTS has been deemed to be of autoimmune etiology. A cardiothoracic surgeon should be on board if surgery is required, or general surgery for cases involving tracheostomies. Patients that have changes in speech may benefit from the help of speech pathologists. In hospitalized patients, respiratory therapists will usually assist with tracheostomy care as needed.
