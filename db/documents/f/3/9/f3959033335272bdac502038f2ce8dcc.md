An understanding of platelet function and pathophysiology is essential in the diagnosis and management of both bleeding disorders and pathological thrombus formation in atherosclerosis.

Though platelet disorders can lead to excessive bleeding as described above, it is important to note that platelet numbers generally need to be drastically reduced before spontaneous bleeding starts. Normal platelet levels in adults are between 150 to 350x10^9/L, but spontaneous bleeding often does not occur until the platelet count drops below 10x10^9/L (assuming normal platelet function). Bleeding symptoms may also be sporadic even in severe functional platelet disorders, such as Glanzmann’s thrombasthenia, where the important glycoprotein IIb-IIIa is undetectable.

Antiplatelet medications are commonly used in the management of atherosclerotic coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease—aspirin results in irreversible inhibition of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme, which has a role in thromboxane formation. In patients with otherwise normal platelet function, aspirin results in a modest increase in bleeding risk, but its use is widespread because of its effectiveness in both the treatment and prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke.
