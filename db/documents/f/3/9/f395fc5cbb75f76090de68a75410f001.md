**Neuroimaging.**Neuroimaging studies used alone are not often used clinically to discern pathologic GABA signaling due to high overlap with other, more numerous neurotransmitters, and high required technical expertise in obtaining and interpreting neuroimaging studies.

**Cerebrospinal GABA.**Increased cerebrospinal GABA levels may be indicative of a disorder in GABA metabolism, such as a deficiency in either GABA-T or SSADH, the enzymes that are involved in GABA degradation.

**Plasma GABA.**Plasma GABA testing may be used to support the diagnosis of mood disorders and alcohol use disorder as a specific test.
