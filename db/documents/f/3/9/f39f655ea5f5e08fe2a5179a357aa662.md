**Post-isometric Relaxation**

Golgi tendon organs (GTOs) are mechanoreceptors found in most skeletal muscles. They are sensitive to muscular contractile force, and in contrast to muscle spindles (see below), GTOs are rarely and inconsistently activated by muscle stretch. These encapsulated bundles of collagen are innervated by fast-conducting type Ib afferent fibers, and are present at muscle-tendon or muscle-aponeurosis junctions; they attach to an individual muscle fascicle tendon on one end, and the whole muscle-tendon or aponeurosis of the other. This positioning, often described as “in-series,” meaning the receptor is part of the functional unit, stands in contrast to the muscle spindle that operates adjacent to the functional unit, “in parallel.”

Physiologically, increased tension to the GTO prompts the activation of the type Ib afferent fibers that project to the spine, where they provide positive input on inhibitory interneurons that, in turn, add negative or “inhibitory” input on the efferent α-motor neurons that receive input from the cortex to the homonymous muscle.

**Reciprocal Inhibition**

Muscle spindles are stretch-sensitive mechanoreceptors found in skeletal muscle. A muscle spindle is a bundle of striated, “intrafusal” muscle fibers within the fascicles of force-producing, “extrafusal” muscle fibers. “Fusal,” comes from the term “fusiform,” meaning spindle-shaped. Any stretch, change in length, of the extrafusal fibers thus results in a stretch of the intrafusal fibers, which is then detected in the equatorial and polar regions of the muscle spindle. This physiology stands in contrast to GTOs that are relatively insensate to passive changes in length but respond to an increase in muscle force. The stretch sensation is measured by two types of afferents: primary (type Ia) and secondary (type II). There is a single Ia fiber and anywhere between zero-to-five II fibers per spindle.

Physiologically, stretch to a muscle fiber produces activation of Ia muscle spindle afferents that project to the spine and activate the efferent α-motor neurons, and subsequently, the γ-motor neurons of the homonymous muscle leading to contraction of the intra- and extrafusal fibers. Simultaneously, the Ia fibers activate inhibitory interneurons in the spine to inhibit the α-motor neurons of the antagonist muscle. This circuit is simply described as the “stretch reflex.”
