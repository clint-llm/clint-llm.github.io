After a traumatic event, it is difficult to confuse a cerebral contusion with other disorders. However, on rare occasions, a patient may first have a non-traumatic hemorrhage, which then provoked a traumatic event, including:

- Brain tumor with an acute hemorrhage

- Intraparenchymal hemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm

- Hypertensive hemorrhage

- Stroke with reperfusion hemorrhage
