An interprofessional healthcare team, including the prescribing clinician, nurses, pharmacists, and registered dieticians, should carefully monitor the signs and symptoms of megestrol use and, in particular, for the off-label uses of megestrol. In an article, the CARE model has been described for patients with cancer and cachexia. In the CARE (Cancer Appetite and Rehabilitation clinic) model, the patients would be evaluated and managed by the entire healthcare team, rather than having numerous appointments and being evaluated by multiple providers at further visits. The clinic's interdisciplinary model includes a clinician, a nurse practitioner, a nutritionist, and a physical therapist, which can help patients suffering from cachexia, eventually enhancing patient outcomes.

Patients require specific monitoring for serious adverse effects such as venous thromboembolism and adrenal insufficiency. Stringent criteria are necessary to determine the use of megestrol in patients with clinically significant weight loss due to the risk of severe side effects. Clinicians should properly inform patients about the possible adverse drug reactions associated with megestrol for their safety. They should also be encouraged to consult the prescribing clinician and pharmacist for additional information. By providing evidence-based, patient-centered care, patient outcomes will ultimately improve. [Level 5]
