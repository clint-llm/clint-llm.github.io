The radial forearm free flap has a wide variety of tissue transfer options and can be harvested as a fascial, fasciocutaneous, or osteocutaneous flap, with sensory innervation if desired. The skin paddle raised is typically around nine centimeters; however, the entire skin of the forearm can be harvested if needed.

Distally, this vascular pedicle is located within the intermuscular fascial septum, which separates the flexor carpi radialis and the brachioradialis muscles. Proximally, the pedicle is deep to the brachioradialis muscle. Several vascular perforators supply the muscles, lateral surface of the distal radius bone, and skin. A sensate skin paddle can be achieved by harvesting the medial and/or lateral antebrachial nerves, which are encountered during flap elevation. If osteocutaneous tissue is desired, a 10 to 12 cm segment of the distal radius, with up to 40% of its circumference, may be raised along with accompanying fascial and cutaneous tissue.
