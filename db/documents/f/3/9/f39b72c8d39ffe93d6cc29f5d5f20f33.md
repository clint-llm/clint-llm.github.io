The delay in the diagnosis of TRD carries a worse prognosis. Diabetic patients should be educated for regular ophthalmic evaluation and prompt management of TRD at the earliest. Babies with risk factors of ROP, e.g., prematurity, low birth weight (LBW), and septicemia, should be promptly screened for ROP so that they can be diagnosed in early stages. Patients with hemoglobinopathies should consult ophthalmologist at regular intervals to rule out retinopathy.
