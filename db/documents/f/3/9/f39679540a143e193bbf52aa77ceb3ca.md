The initial therapy of a hip pointer injury includes ice, anti-inflammatory pain medication, compression, rest, and avoidance of weight-bearing as guided by the patient's reported symptoms. As the pain decreases, the initiation of range of motion and active resistance exercises should begin. If a hematoma is present, aspiration can provide someÂ pain relief and may potentially mitigate the risks of developing myositis ossificans. A local anesthetic such as 1 to 2% lidocaine or 0.5% bupivacaine (5 mL to 9 mL) may provide short-term pain relief. It is considered safe, but little data support this practice. Even though there are no studies supporting corticosteroids, it is an accepted practice in the sports medicine community. If compartment syndrome is suspected, measure compartment pressures and consult an orthopedic surgeon or sports medicine specialist. An orthopedic surgeon should also be consulted if an avulsion fracture or pain lasts longer than two weeks.

Physical therapy is often prescribed.
