An isolated fracture of the ulnar shaft is defined as a nightstick fracture. The injury derives its name from the idea that a suspect struck with a police nightstick would hold his forearm above his face in a defensive posture when struck with a police baton, resulting in a fracture to the ulna. While these fractures have historically been treated non-operatively, they were believed to display a high rate of nonunion, leading to increased scrutiny for appropriate management of such injuries.
