Hypotension is most commonly asymptomatic. However, if symptoms become apparent, the most common is lightheadedness or dizziness.  In extremely low pressures, syncope may occur. Other symptoms are possible which typically begin from the underlying etiology rather than hypotension itself. They may include chest pain, shortness of breath, irregular heartbeat, fever higher than 101 degrees Fahrenheit, headache, stiff neck, severe upper back pain, cough with sputum, diarrhea, vomiting, dysuria, acute allergic reactions, fatigue, or vision aberrations.
