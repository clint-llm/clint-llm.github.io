Appropriately managing patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is of absolute importance to the entire healthcare team. DM is on the rise in the U.S epidemiology statistics, so ensuring the appropriate use of insulin to control this disease is essential. The interprofessional team must recognize the importance of insulin in the treatment of DM, considering it will significantly benefit the patient in his morbidity and mortality. Clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists should know of insulin's labeled and off-label indications as well as adverse effects.

Physicians will be prescribing the medication, while the nurse will administer the drug if inpatient and will follow-up on side effects if outpatient, while the pharmacist will work in collaboration with the physician to ensure the proper dosage, indication, and duration of the medication. Finally, the nurse is the first contact with the patient and should coach the patient on administering the medication and being aware of its adverse effects. This interprofessional collaboration will optimize patient outcomes while minimizing adverse effects.Â [Level 5]
