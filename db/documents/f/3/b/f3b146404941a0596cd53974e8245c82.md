Schlichter et al. (1954) described in detail the etiological causes of ventricular aneurysms. The etiology of LV aneurysm is classified as follows:

- **Congenital aneurysm:**It is a sporadic type in either of the ventricles. These aneurysms are usually large and lined with thin fibrous tissue. They have broad-based communication with the ventricular cavity and contain unclotted blood.

- **Acquired aneurysm:**which can be classified into
- Ischemic: Almost 85% to 90% of the ventricular aneurysms occur in the setting of acute anterior wall myocardial infarction. 
- Traumatic: They occur as a result of either accidental or surgical wounds.
- Infective: Common causes include infective endocarditis, rheumatic fever, syphilis, tuberculosis, septic emboli, polyarteritis nodosa, etc.
- Idiopathic: A ventricular aneurysm of unknown etiology usually occurs in Africans and occasionally in the white population. It is an unusual aneurysm often arising close to the mitral ring in the form of an annular subvalvular aneurysm. It stretches the mitral ring and interferes with the function of the papillary muscle, chordae tendinae, and cusps of the mitral valve.
- Postpartum: Rarely left ventricular aneurysm can be seen secondary to postpartum cardiomyopathy.
- Other causes: systemic hypertension, steroids, and NSAIDs use may predispose to aneurysm formation. Other causes include Chagas disease, sarcoidosis, etc.
