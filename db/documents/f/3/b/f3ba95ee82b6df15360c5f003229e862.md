The initial step in approaching a patient complaining of vertigo is to determine whether they are in fact experiencing primary vertigo and not another form of dizziness caused by a migraine, medication, or alcohol. Once a diagnosis of central vertigo has been established, treatment is aimed at the underlying cause. Imaging studies should be done as soon as possible with a patient complaining of vertigo, and the patient should not be left unattended until a thorough examination is complete and a diagnosis is made. Most of the time, the patient will need to be admitted to the hospital for the treatment of the underlying cause of vertigo.

Thrombolytic therapy should be considered if the patient is suffering from an acute posterior circulation ischemic stroke within 3 to 4.5 hours of onset, although it is critical to be aware of any contraindications (e.g., recent surgery, severe hypertension, evidence of acute hemorrhage or edema, or rapidly improving symptoms).

Patients with an altered level of consciousness warrant an ECG, pulse oximetry, and extremely close supervision. If a patient continues to deteriorate, emergent interventions may be required to decreased intracranial pressure (ICP) and minimize compression of the brainstem These interventions may include endotracheal intubation with or without hyperventilation, aggressive diuresis, and corticosteroids.

Finally, a neurologic consultation is warranted for a patient complaining of vertigo, and a neurosurgical consultation is necessary if an underlying hemorrhage, edema, or brainstem compression is discovered, as surgical decompression (e.g., ventriculostomy or craniectomy) may be required.

A course of an intravenous corticosteroid (such as IV methylprednisolone 1 gram a day for 3-5 days) is indicated if the cause is an acute demyelinating event of multiple sclerosis.
