Contraindications to performing a decortication procedure include the following:

- Underlying severely diseased lung: although, decortication is performed for a collapsed or a trapped lung, there are occasions when it may not re-expand. This includes a severely damaged/diseased lung. These patients fail to show an improvement in the postoperative period in terms of resolution of the symptoms. After a detailed evaluation, these patients might be offered a pneumonectomy at the same sitting or later during follow-up.

- Bronchial stenosis: This is also an absolute contraindication to performing a decortication procedure. These patients additionally require resection of the stenosed segment and bronchial anastomosis apart from decortication.

- Patients who have hemodynamic instability, coagulation disorders, multiorgan failure, and have poor general status will not withstand the morbidity of major surgery. Therefore, surgical decortication is generally contraindicated in these patients.
