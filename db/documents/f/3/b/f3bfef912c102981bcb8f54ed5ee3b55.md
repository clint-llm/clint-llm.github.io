Waddell signs include:

- **Superficial tenderness:**The patient’s skin over a wide area of the lumbar skin is tender to light touch or pinch.

- **Non-anatomical tenderness:**The patient experiences deep tenderness over a wide area that is not localized to one structure and crosses over non-anatomical boundaries.

- **Axial loading:**Downward pressure on the top of the patient’s head elicits lumbar pain.

- **Acetabular rotation:**Lumbar pain is elicited while the provider passively and simultaneously externally rotates the patient’s shoulder and pelvis together in the same plane as the patient stands. It is considered a positive test if pain occurs within the first 30 degrees of rotation.

- **Distracted straight leg raise discrepancy: **The patient complains of pain during a straight leg raise during formal testing, such as when supine, but does not on distraction when the examiner extends the knee with the patient in a seated position.

- **Regional sensory disturbance:**The patient experiences decreased sensation fitting a stocking-like distribution rather than a dermatomal pattern.

- **Regional weakness:**Weakness, cogwheeling, or the giving way of many muscle groups that are not explained on a neuroanatomical basis.

- **Overreaction: **A disproportionate and exaggerated painful response to a stimulus that is not reproduced when the same provocation is given later. These responses can include verbalization, facial expression, muscle tension, or tremor.
