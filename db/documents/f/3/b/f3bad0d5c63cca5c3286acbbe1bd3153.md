Retinitis due to CMV, toxoplasma, and viral etiology has to be differentiated from each other based on clinical features or, if needed, other ocular or systemic ancillary investigations.

The differential diagnosis for  Behcet disease includes a variety of infectious and noninfectious causes of acute nongranulomatous anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, occlusive retinal vasculitis, focal or multifocal retinitis, and necrotizing retinitis. Behçet uveitis typically has a sudden onset of symptoms with improvement followed by recurrence of inflammatory signs. Specifically, metastatic endophthalmitis must be ruled out in all cases of retinitis, especially bilateral ones.
