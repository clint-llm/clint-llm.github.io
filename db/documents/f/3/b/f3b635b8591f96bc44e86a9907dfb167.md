For patients who do survive the initial acute extracranial dissection, the prognosis is good with complete recovery in nearly 80-90% of patients. However, at least 10% will develop recurrent attacks, a major stroke, or death. Patients who have severe neurological deficits at the time of presentation usually do have a poor prognosis. Follow-up angiographic studies have revealed healing in about 60% of patients.

Patients who develop an intracranial dissection have a poor prognosis. Those who present with altered consciousness and neurological deficits do poorly. Intracranial vertebral dissections are often associated with brainstem infarctions, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and death.

Prognosis may be very different for young patients without comorbidities like hypertension, diabetes, and smoking compared to those who have them.
