Treatment using strain counterstrain will begin with the practitioner identifying the patient's tender point associated with dysfunction. Once identified, the tender-point will be monitored during and after SCS.

After identifying the TP, the practitioner moves the patient into a position of comfort in which the TP is at least 70% less tender.

Facilitated positional release differs from SCS because when the patient is placed in the position of comfort, the practitioner will apply a facilitating force of compression or distraction to the tissues in that position for an amount of time that is much less than 90-seconds, such as 5 seconds.
