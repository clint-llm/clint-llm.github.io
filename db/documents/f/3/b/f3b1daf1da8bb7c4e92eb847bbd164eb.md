Caffeine is a naturally occurring central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class and is the most widely taken psychoactive stimulant globally. This drug is most commonly sourced from the coffee bean but can also be found naturally occurring in certain types of tea and cacao beans, and it is also an additive to soda and energy drinks. The primary goal of caffeine consumption is to combat fatigue and drowsiness, but there are many additional uses. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of caffeine, pertinent for clinicians and other interprofessional team members where caffeine is already in use or might be necessary.

**Objectives:**
- Review the FDA-approved on-label indications of caffeine, as well as other non-FDA uses.
- Identify the proposed mechanism of action of caffeine.
- Summarize the contraindications and associated risks associated with caffeine use.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication when considering or using caffeine or controlling its use by patients to improve outcomes.
