According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, about 84 million American adults are currently facing prediabetes. This equals one in three adults in America. About 90% of these adults do not know that they are currently living with prediabetes and setting themselves up for all the implications this entails. The incidence of diabetes is evidently growing at rapid rates globally. In America alone, about 1.5 million Americans are being diagnosed with diabetes every year. These increases are parallel with the rapid increases in the prevalence of obesity. Annually, diabetes remains the seventh cause of death in the United States and is currently costs about $245 billion in the United States. Due to this, preventing this trending progression should be at the top of the list as a national health focus and strategy. The focus on management and diagnostic studies should come second given that this disease is preventable.
