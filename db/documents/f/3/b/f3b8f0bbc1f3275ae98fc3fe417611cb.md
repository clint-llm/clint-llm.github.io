SANE programs have extensive support across the United States andÂ show demonstrably improved outcomes for their patients. Outcomes such as psychological recovery from the trauma, providing acute medical treatment, enhanced evidence collection, improved prosecution of sexual assault cases.

However, there are issues with the accessibility and experience of SANEs across the United States, especially in rural communities. Rural communities have high rates of sexual assault (some as high as 30%) where most research on forensic examinations takes place in urban settings.

Another issue of concern with the forensic examination is the significance juries place on having DNA evidence. Since the arrival of crime scene investigation television shows, there has been this impression that collecting DNA evidence is easy and quick. This notion is wildly misleading; DNA evidence is usually challenging to obtain and takes an extensive amount of time to process. In a study on forensic evidence found in sexual assault cases, only about 55% of cases that reported penetration and ejaculation found spermatic material.

Pediatrics is another issue of concern since pediatric sexual assault is much less studied and cared for in the ED in comparison to adult sexual assault. Few SANE programs are designed with the pediatric patient in mind, and for this reason, some cases are not being cared for appropriately. Older children and young adults are more likely to receive appropriate STI and pregnancy screening and treatment than younger patients; this is likely due to the lack of protocol for treating pediatric patients in the forensic process. Also, due to a patient's age and developmental level, it may be difficult for a patient to consent and comply with a forensic exam.
