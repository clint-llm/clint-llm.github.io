In addition to a thorough history and physical, radiographic imaging is required. The recommend views include standing anteroposterior (AP), standing lateral in extension, and a skyline view of the patella. A standing 45-degree posteroanterior (PA) view of the knee may be obtained, which gives a better assessment of the weight-bearing surface of the knee. Occasionally, long leg standing films will be obtained to view the degree of deformity and overall alignment of the lower extremity. It is important to understand that radiographs of the knee must be obtained with the patient standing. This gives an accurate representation of the joint space narrowing present. Often, films will be taken with the patient supine, which gives a false sense of joint space and alignment and should not be used to evaluate suspected knee OA.

**Radiographic Findings of OA**

- Joint space narrowing

- Osteophyte formation

- Subchondral sclerosis

- Subchondral cysts
