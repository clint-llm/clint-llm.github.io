**Mechanism of Action of Monoclonal Antibodies Against SARS-CoV-2**

The pathophysiology of COVID-19 is described by the entry of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, into the hosts' cells by binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike or S protein (S1) to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors expressed abundantly on the respiratory epithelium, such as type II alveolar epithelial cells.

- **Sotrovimab****(VIR-7831)**is a potent anti-spike neutralizing monoclonal antibody that demonstratedin vitro activity against all the four VOCs Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P1), and Delta (B.1.617.2). Results from a preplanned interim analysis (not yet peer-reviewed) of the multicenter, double-blind placebo-controlled Phase 3, COMET-ICE trial by Gupta et al. that evaluated the clinical efficacy and safety of sotrovimab demonstrated that one dose of sotrovimab (500 mg) reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 85% in high-risk non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 compared with those receiving placebo.****Sotrovimab was granted emergency use authorization from FDA in May 2021 for clinical use in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness who are at increased risk for developing severe disease and/or hospitalization.

As per the Fact Sheets for Healthcare Providers provided by the US FDA on granting emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of sotrovimab, adult and pediatric patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness are considered to be at high risk if they meet at least one of the following criteria:

- ≥ 65 years of age

- Have chronic kidney disease (CKD)

- Pregnant women

- Have underlying diabetes mellitus (DM)

- Have underlying immunosuppressive disease

- Are currently on immunosuppressive therapy

- Have a body mass index (BMI) ≥ of 35 kg/m^2

- Cardiovascular disease or hypertension or****COPD/other chronic respiratory diseases

- Aged between 12 to 17 years and****have a BMI ≥ 85 percentile for that age and gender-based on CDC growth charts, OR

- Have sickle cell disease, or****

- Have congenital or acquired heart disease, or

- Have neurodevelopmental disorders, or****

- Have dependence on a medical-related technology device (e.g., tracheostomy, gastrostomy, or positive pressure ventilation unrelated to COVID-19, or

- Have underlying asthma, reactive airway, or chronic respiratory disease that requires daily medication for control.

The authorized dosage of under the FDA issued EUA is 500 mg of sotrovimab by IV infusion over 30 minutes in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kgs) who have a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and who had symptoms for ten days or less and are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 disease.
