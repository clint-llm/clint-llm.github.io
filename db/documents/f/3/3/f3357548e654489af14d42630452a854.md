The main focus of the treatment after identification of the etiology involves correction of the etiological factor resulting in the Trendelenburg gait and varies according to the pathology.

Trendelenburg gait by itself wears the hip joint, and appropriate treatment is essential.

Physical therapy is the mainstay treatment for gluteus medius and minimus weakness. Physical therapy involves strengthening the weakened hip abductor muscles. This involves lying on the unaffected side while abducting the affected leg up towards the ceiling. A theraband can be applied on the lower limb to increase the resistance during the exercise. Other modalities include lateral side steeping and balance exercises.

Patients who have abductor weakness after an arthroplasty require specific exercises which include:

- Non-weight bearing standing abduction

- Weight-bearing standing abduction

- Side-lying abduction

- Resisted side-stepping exercises

Weight-bearing exercises have been shown to have a better functional recovery than non-weight bearing exercises.

Alteration of the gait pattern after gait training can also compensate for the hip abductor weakness.

For gluteus medius tears, reports have shown that in patients with hip abduction manual muscle strength less than 4/5 along with the presence of gait dysfunction, surgical intervention is likely indicated.
