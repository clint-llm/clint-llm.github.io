The sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) can be used as an autograft to repair surgical defects.

A flap of the SCM can be used when resecting the parotid gland in the case of tumors. The muscle makes it simpler to obtain an adequate length and a rotation of the flap on the incision area during the intervention, decreases the depression of the parotidectomy area, and lowers the risk of necrosis thanks to the rich vascularization of SCM.

SCM is used for many other situations where it is necessary to repair or reconstruct the orofacial and pharyngeal area. Depending on the surgical objective, some muscular flaps or flaps with bony portions are used.

- Reconstruction of the tongue and buccal floor

- Oral cavity and oropharynx or laryngotracheal complex

- Portions of the head and neck

- The bone of the jaw and defects of the mastoid area

- Esophagopharyngeal complex

- Reconstruction of the cheek

SCM muscle flaps are also used in the surgical repair of congenital muscular torticollis (MT). When the SCM is shortened and fibrotic in muscular torticollis, it affects the head and shoulder position, with ipsilateral lateral flexion and a contralateral rotation of the child's face.

The surgical approach generally performed in children and adults is to remove part of the SCM.
