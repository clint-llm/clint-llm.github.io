Embryologic studies by Hockel identified the pelvic urinary, genital, and digestive tract components to have a common origin in the ‘morphogenetic unit.’ The 3 units separate with their associated vascular supply, mesenteries, and lymphatic drainage. The rectum, anus, and mesorectum originate from the hindgut. The Mullerian morphogenetic unit forms the Fallopian tubes, mesosalpinx, uterine corpus and cervix, mesometrium, proximal vagina, and mesocolpium. The distal ureters, urinary bladder, urethra, and distal vagina arise from the urogenital sinus and Wolf ducts. Initially, these separate units provide a natural barrier for the extension of a neoplasm to adjacent structures. Current oncologic surgical guidelines identify the importance of removing the entire unit, including the meso-viscera. Per Hockel’s studies, radical compartmentalized surgery requires an en bloc resection of the unit with affected viscera. Removal of two or more morphogenetic units represents an ultra-radical compartmentalized surgery or pelvic exenteration.

Current radical surgery expands the posterior compartment to include the sacrum with the rectum when necessary to achieve a complete (R0) resection. Likewise, an extension of an anterior compartment neoplasm might incorporate the pubic bone. The lateral extension of a pelvic neoplasm can require excision of the lateral compartment involving the vascular, neurologic, and muscular structures of the pelvic sidewall.
