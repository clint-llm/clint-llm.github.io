The forehead flap is used to repair more extensive defects on the nasal tip and ala (and occasionally nasal lining)Â when simpler techniques cannot provide adequate coverage. Deep wounds of the distal nose often consist of exposed cartilage that cannot well support the vascular requirements of a skin graft and even when there is a vascular base; a sustainable graft may not be sufficient to provide proper contour. Adjacent flaps can provide their vascular supply and thickness, but very large wounds can exceed the limits of mobility and size, especially on the nose. If structural stability is compromised in a wound, it is also possible to combine a cartilage graft with a forehead flap.
