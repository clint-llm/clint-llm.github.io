Hypoxia can occur without the subject being aware of its effects. Slow loss of cabin pressure or loss of the oxygen source during flight may lead to a gradual onset of the effects of hypoxia. This occurs occasionally and is a perilous situation for pilots as the early symptoms of hypoxia are mild but, if not corrected, they will become disabling. For some, early hypoxia leads to euphoria and an inability to recognize the hazard. For a pilot or other aircrew, if the symptoms of hypoxia are not recognized the problem may culminate in a crash.

Because of this potentially subtle problem, flight systems are designed to recognize hypoxia hazardous situations and alert pilots to the potential danger so they may take action and correct the situation. Additionally, military air forces require hypoxia training either through altitude exposure in low-pressure chambers or via normal pressure/reduced oxygen gas exposures. The FAA does not require hypoxia training in commercial aviation but it is highly encouraged, and many companies educate their aircrew through one of the hypoxia training systems mentioned above.

Sudden loss of pressure is not a subtle event when there is a significant pressure difference between the inside and the outside of an aircraft. Pilots are required to have "quick-don" masks readily available while piloting in these situations. While this is a dangerous situation overall, it does not pose the subtle threat of a slow loss of pressure.  However, with a sudden and dramatic reduction in oxygen, one may lose consciousness in a few minutes.  The time between sudden decompression and loss of the ability to perform a useful activity is called the "time of useful consciousness" or TUC.  Beyond this time period, one can no longer perform actions to save either themselves or others, i.e. they are unconscious.  Any action to correct the situation must occur before the TUC runs out.  Commercial airliners routinely fly in the above 10,000 meters.  At these altitudes, the TUC is less than one minute.  This is why pilots are required to have "quick don" masks which will greatly extend the TUC.

Sudden pressure changes also present challenges to the air-filled middle ear space and especially to the paranasal sinuses.  If the sinuses have adequate ventilation through their openings or ostia, typically the pressure changes are asymptomatic.  However if the ostia are blocked due to mucosal inflammation or other obstruction, there can be debilitating pain.  If this happens to a pilot, it can lead to dangerous or deadly situations.  As noted previously, gases of a fixed volume contract or expand when increasing or decreasing in altitude. Barotrauma to the sinuses, aka aerosinusitis, can occur in either ascent or descent.  On the descent, trapped air in the sinuses creates a relative negative pressure gradient which causes damage to the sinus mucosa resulting in edema, worsening obstruction of the sinus ostium, and worsening pain as the descent continues. This is termed sinus squeeze.  During the ascent, the expanding gas in the sinuses causes a build-up of pressure that causes worsening pain as ascension continues. This is termed reverse squeeze.

Regarding the middle ear space, analogous issues can occur which most commonly relate to eustachian tube dysfunction.  The eustachian tube's function is to equalize the pressure between the environment and the middle ear space.  Dysfunction can result in both acute and chronic issues including pain, dysequilibrium, and hearing loss.  It is usually the increase in negative pressure during decent that is the key issue, as the eustachian tube orifice has to open against a pressure gradient vs in ascent, the air more easily escapes from the middle airspace into the environment through the eustachian tube.  Mucosal damage can occur, however, in either situation, a condition referred to as middle ear barotrauma or aero-otitis.  Middle ear barotrauma can cause fluid to accumulate through extrusion from the mucosa and create a middle ear effusion which can cause hearing loss and occasionally vertigo.  These symptoms occurring at the wrong moments in the aircrew can be catastrophic.
