Managing lung isolation patients in the ICU setting requires multiple practitioners, including intensivists, nurses, and respiratory therapists.  Usually, when this is needed, a DLT is used to maintain lung isolation, and all members of the care team should be familiar with the device.  Because lung isolation in the ICU setting is relatively rare, members of the anesthesiology team should be prepared to provide education and support regarding using a DLT if necessary.  If both lungs are to be ventilated, but with different settings, the respiratory therapist will be responsible for providing and maintaining two separate ventilators for each side.  Aggressive pulmonary toilet practices, including frequent suctioning of both lumens and meticulous oral care, should be performed consistently by the nursing team.  If lung isolation has been implemented due to unilateral infection, care must be taken to avoid contaminating the healthy lung with the diseased lung, including using different suction tubing for each side.  Particular attention should be taken during patient transport, turning, or other activities when the DLT is at risk of being dislodged from its correct position.
