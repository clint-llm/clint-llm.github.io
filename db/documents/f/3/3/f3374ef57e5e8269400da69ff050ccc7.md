Elderly patients taking at least five medications are at increased risk of mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Polypharmacy and mild cognitive decline are associated with morbidity and high healthcare cost. Every attempt should be made to minimize polypharmacy in the elderly. This activity reviews the evaluation, risk factors and informs the interprofessional team of some strategies to mitigate the challenges of polypharmacy in the geriatric population.

**Objectives:**
-  Identify the role of polypharmacy in geriatric cognitive decline.
- Summarize the risks associated with polypharmacy in the elderly.
- Review patient populations who are at a greater risk of adverse health outcomes from polypharmacy.
- Describe the importance of the interprofessional team approach in the management of polypharmacy and geriatric cognitive decline.
