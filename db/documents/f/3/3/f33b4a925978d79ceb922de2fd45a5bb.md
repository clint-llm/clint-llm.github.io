Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor drug (NNRTI). It binds to a non-catalytic site of the HIV reverse transcription enzyme, thereby inhibiting its activity. This action consequently blocks DNA polymerase activities, including HIV replication. Though therapeutic drug concentration monitoring is not necessary for efavirenz, it is essential to achieve adequate serum concentrations. Low concentrations are associated with virologic failure, while higher concentrations are associated with increased adverse effects such as sleep disorders.

The administration of efavirenz with food has been shown to increase serum concentrations and the incidence of side effects. For this reason, patients should not take efavirenz with food.

It is available in combination with other antiviral medications.
