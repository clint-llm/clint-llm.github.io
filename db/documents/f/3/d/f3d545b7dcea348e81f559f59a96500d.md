Clinical pearls for consideration:

- A chest X-ray should be performed immediately for the internal jugular and subclavian lines to ensure proper placement and the absence ofÂ an iatrogenic pneumothorax.

- Be sure you withdraw venous blood before dilation and cannulation of the vessel.

- If the internal jugular CVL attempt is unsuccessful, move to the ipsilateral subclavian vein. Never attempt the opposite side without a chest X-ray or ultrasound first to avoid bilateral pneumothoraces.

- Never force the guidewire on insertion because it may cause damage to the vessel or surrounding structures. Forcing the wire could also cause it to kink, making removal difficult and causing damage to the vessel wall. It may also lead to an inaccurate position of the catheter.

- Always place your finger over the open hub of the needle to prevent an air embolism.

- Always confirm placement with ultrasound, looking for reverberation artifact of the needle and tenting of the vessel wall. Needles cannot be visualized on ultrasound. Wires can be visualized so the operator can also confirm at that step.

- A venous blood gas can be aspirated off a femoral line to ensure it is not arterial.
