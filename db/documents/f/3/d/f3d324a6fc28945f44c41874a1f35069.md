The evaluation and management of preeclampsia in a pregnant patient require collaboration and coordinated care between multiple medical specialties.  Technological advancements in intraocular imaging have allowed for a greater appreciation of retinal vascular changes in this condition. Although our understanding of these processes has improved considerably, there is a need for continued study of these patients to improve visual outcomes both during and after pregnancy. Health care providers should be alert to complaints of acute visual changes in pregnant patients as they can be a presenting sign of significant impending morbidity.
