**Infants**

Primitive reflexes are important in the newborn neurological examination. An absent or abnormal sucking reflex is an indirect indicator of neurological maturity in newborn infants. When an abnormal sucking reflex is associated with other signs of CNS involvement, it suggests basal ganglia or brainstem dysfunction. In a 2011 study, morbidity-related factors statistically correlated with the sucking and Babinski reflexes. Moro reflex is weak in preterm infants compared to full-term infants due to their poor muscle tone and resistance to passive movements.

**Adults**

Primitive reflexes, also known as frontal release signs, can be normal in the adult population. Multiple frontal release signs observed on neurological examination correlate with frontal lobe brain pathology, including Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, and schizophrenia.
