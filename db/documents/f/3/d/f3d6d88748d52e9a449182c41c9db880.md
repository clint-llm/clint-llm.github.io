The most common cause of trichuriasis is the ingestion of infected eggs that are found in soil.Â This is often due to poor sanitary conditions, including open defecation and using human feces as fertilizer. Some recent studies show that people with certain chromosome traits may be predisposed or have increased susceptibility to acquiring trichuriasis.
