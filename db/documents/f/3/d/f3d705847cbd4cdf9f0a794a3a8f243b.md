Arsenical keratosis is a cutaneous manifestation of 'arsenicosis,' defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a chronic health condition resulting from the ingestion of arsenic above the safe limit for a minimum duration of 6 months.

- Contaminated groundwater- Used for drinking, cooking, and irrigating crops.

- Food crops- Crops that are grown in contaminated soil or irrigated with contaminated water can be a source of arsenic.

- Medications- Fowler's solution (1% potassium arsenite) was used in the 20th century to treat various dermatoses and asthma.

- Occupational exposure- Arsenic is used in the manufacture of alloys and in the processing of pigments, textiles, glass, paper, hide (tanning process), wood preservatives, and ammunitions. Workers involved in smelting and mining of metals have greater exposure to arsenic than those involved in the manufacture of insecticides/ pesticides/ herbicides, pharmaceuticals, and poultry feeds. The population living close to these industries or mining activities is also at risk.

- Tobacco- Tobacco plants can take up arsenic naturally present in contaminated soil and insecticides. Cigarettes manufactured in the 1950s had high arsenic content, which has been gradually reduced to acceptable levels over the years. However, regulating the arsenic content in handmade cigarettes like bidis has not yet been possible.
