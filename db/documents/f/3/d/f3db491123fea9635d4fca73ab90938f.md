The initial signs and symptoms of C. psittaci, including fever, headache, and dry cough, can lead to a very broad differential diagnosis. Other culprits of atypical pneumonia, such as Chlamydia pneumoniae, mycoplasma infections, Legionnaires' disease, Q fever, and Tularemia, may be considered when presenting with C. psittacosis. Patients presenting only with fever have a broader differential that includes influenza, septicemia, endocarditis, other causes of pneumonia (bacterial and fungal), and other sources of infection. History of exposure to birds or bird droppings, as might be found under bridges, should raise psittacosis on the differential diagnosis.
