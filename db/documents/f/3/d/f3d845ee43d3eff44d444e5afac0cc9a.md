Osteoarthritis most commonly involves the hands, knees, feet, facet joints of the spine and hips, with the knee being the most common location. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) estimated the global prevalence of knee osteoarthritis to be 263 million, with an incidence of 13 million per year. Women are at higher risk of developing primary OA than men and suffering from more severe disease. In particular, postmenopausal women are affected by the involvement of the hands, feet, and knees.
