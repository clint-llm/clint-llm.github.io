Differential diagnosis:

- Livedo reticularis with ulceration: This active stage is mimicked by cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and often leads to a diagnostic dilemma. Cutaneous PAN is characterized by livedo racemosa, subcutaneous nodules, and starburst livedo. It is a medium vessel cutaneous vasculitis. Presence of subcutaneous nodules, occasional digital gangrene, and histopathology aid in its diagnosis.

- 2.Â  Atrophie blanche: Porcelain white scars are seen in sickle cell disease, hydroxyurea ulcers, malignant atrophic papulosis.

- Other close differentials are ANCA associated vasculitis, cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis, cryoglobulinemia, Sneddon syndrome (livedo racemosa with cerebrovascular stroke).
