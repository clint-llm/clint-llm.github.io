Treatment for the water hammer pulse is dependent on the etiology.

Chronic aortic regurgitation is one of the common causes of the water hammer pulse. Thus, knowing the most up-to-date recommendations on aortic valve repair or replacement will be crucial. The 2017 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease outline the indications for intervention in chronic aortic regurgitation. These guidelines depend on the size of the ascending aorta, the severity of the regurgitation, patient symptomology, and the left ventricular function. For patients with severe aortic regurgitation, surgery is indicated in certain patients of classes 1B and 1C. These class 1B patients include symptomatic patients and those with a resting left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 50%. Candidates from class 1C include patients undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft or surgery of the ascending aorta or another valve. In individuals who are asymptomatic with normal left ventricular function, regular evaluation of left ventricular function with serial echocardiograms and changes in patient exercise tolerance will be essential to identify the necessity for surgery.
