# Definition/Introduction

Organizational culture (OC) is composed of beliefs and expectations shared by members of an organization.

Culture can be framed through various lenses. For example, one framework is Hofstede’s cultural dimensions, which contends that culture is based on the dimensions of masculinity, power distance index, uncertainty avoidance, and pluralism.

The CVF is made of two axes or dimensions which serve as a foundation for four types of ideal culture.**Figure 1**and discussed below: clan, adhocracy, hierarchy, and market.

**Clan**

Clan culture, also referred to as group culture in some literature, is built on cooperation. It places a lot of emphasis on building and creating solid and stronger teams with high morale. It is committed to developing and mentoring people in the organization and listening to their input.

**Market**

The market culture emphasizes competition and is driven to achieve a market advantage. It prioritizes achieving goals of high productivity and profitability.

**Adhocracy**

In an adhocracy culture, creativity is a prime characteristic built on an entrepreneurial and innovative spirit. This culture thrives in an environment that is agile and transformative.

**Hierarchy**

A hierarchical culture’s focus is control, which is achieved by monitoring, structure, and organization. Repeatability, dependability, and standardization are the usual aims and descriptors associated with this culture.

The CVF can be very useful when applied to the organizational culture of a healthcare organization.  Every organization has elements of each ideal culture type. The CVF can be applied to assess the degree to which each ideal culture is represented in an organization relative to the other types - this can be valuable in the formulation of hypotheses regarding how organizational culture will influence factors like the successful implementation of quality improvement initiatives or achieving certain organizational outcomes.

**Organizational Culture Assessment Instrument**

The organizational culture assessment instrument (OCAI) is a commonly used tool and is related to the Competing Values Framework and attributed to Kim S. Cameron and Robert E. Quinn at the University of Michigan.

# Issues of Concern

While analysis of an organizational culture via CVF is often helpful and predictive, there are areas of concern. A study by Kava et al. found that organizational culture was not significantly associated with the adoption of an anti-smoking initiative.

# Clinical Significance

Organizational culture is a primary concern in the process of hospital accreditation, wherein the quality of a hospital’s patient care is systematically assessed against the standards of care in medical practice.

Organizational culture is not just relevant to the hospital setting alone. Clinic and office-specific cultural archetypes can be identified and then potentially modified as part of practice redesign to culture types more strongly associated with high provider satisfaction.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Analysis of organizational culture is extremely beneficial in identifying hurdles and possible interventions to strengthen nursing, allied health, and interprofessional teams. For example, in a survey by Poghosyan et al., nurse practitioners felt that in their organization, they get less organizational support and less access to organizational resources than physicians in similar situations.

When organizational culture is cohesive and unified, however, there can be many benefits to patient care.  Take interprofessional health care teams that conduct interdisciplinary ward rounds. An organizational culture strong in-group culture will allow all team members to collaborate on patient care that is holistic and patient-centered. This paradigm can be difficult to accomplish, however, as perceived challenges include health professionals’ limited time as well as coordination of different teams to allow involvement in rounds.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring

An examination of organizational culture can be used to monitor for success within interprofessional teams. As mentioned, Korner et al. demonstrated that job liking links with factors that include organizational culture and teamwork.
