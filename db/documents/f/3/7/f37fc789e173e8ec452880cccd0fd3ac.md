The outcomes for patients with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy depend on the cause. Cases associated with a malignancy usually have a poor outcome, despite treatment.Â With a specific curative treatment of the underlying cause, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy may remit completely with only symptomatic treatment. Similarly, recurrence of symptoms may herald a recurrence or exacerbation of the underlying condition.
