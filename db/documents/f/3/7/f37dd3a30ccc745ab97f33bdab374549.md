The paraxial mesoderm germ layer gives rise to the myotome from which all limb muscles arise. Nearby, the lateral plate mesoderm gives rise to the bones, connective tissue, and vasculature of the limbs. Neural structures are derived from neural crest cells. Limb buds typically appear at four weeks gestational age, and the bones and muscles are established by eight weeks.Â Following the 8-week mark, the muscles increase in size.
