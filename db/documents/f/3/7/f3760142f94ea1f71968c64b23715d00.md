Bladder diverticula seem to be either congenital or acquired. Their clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and imaging studies can differentiate those two different categories. The frequency of congenital bladder diverticula is estimated to be 1.7 percent and increases in children below ten.

In comparison to adults, among whom coexistent lower urinary tract neurogenic disorder or obstruction is almost always present, the predominant causation in the pediatric age group is usually considered to be a congenital weakness of the detrusor muscle, often at the point of the ureterovesical junction.

The acquired type often develops in males above the age of 60, and those diverticula are commonly found along the lateral wall of the bladder. Similar to the mechanism in infants with posterior urethral valves, it is assumed that the pressure within the bladder increases from other underlying conditions, such as prostatic disease or neurological disorders. An increase in the intravesical pressure leads the urinary bladder mucosa to insert itself between muscle bundles, creating a mucosal extravasation sac which further culminates in the formation of diverticula.
