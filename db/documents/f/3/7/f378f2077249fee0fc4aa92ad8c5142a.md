Culture and gram stain of purulent drainage of skin infections can help aid in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections, but this is not a requirement (level 2). Alternatively, it is not recommended to perform a swab, biopsy, or blood culture from a cellulitis infection (level 2). For abscesses, incision and drainage is the recommended treatment (level 1). For infections involved with penetrating trauma, as could be the case with a recent body piercing, treatment with antimicrobials directed against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus species are recommended (level 2). Recommended treatment duration is five days, but therapy extension is advisable if not improved during that treatment period (level 1).
