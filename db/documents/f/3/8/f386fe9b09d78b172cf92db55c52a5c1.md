Standard trauma labs should be obtained at the time of presentation.  Depending on the mechanism of injury and stability of the patient pertinent imaging should be obtained.

Frykberg et al. did an observational study (2,674 trauma Pt in 1 year;  of which 366 had PTE) to determine if the physical exam was an accurate and safe modality to be the sole method of evaluation for vascular injuries. For penetrating extremity trauma, the conclusion was that if hard signs are present, a patient requires operative intervention, because, in this study, all patients with hard signs were noted to have a major vascular injury at the time of operative intervention.  If there is a need to localize the vascular defect (multiple fracture or GSW), then an arteriogram (in an emergency room or operative suite) or duplex ultrasound can be attempted.

A normal pulse exam can be present in 5% to 15% of patients with vascular injuries.

Multiple studies within the literature have concluded that CT arteriography (CTA) has a high sensitivity and specificity in the evaluation of traumatic arterial injuries of the extremities. There are other advantages of CTA including non-invasive, rapid evaluation and readily available.  Disadvantages include poor arterial opacification, inability to intervene, streak artifacts, and increased need for larger IV contrast load.
