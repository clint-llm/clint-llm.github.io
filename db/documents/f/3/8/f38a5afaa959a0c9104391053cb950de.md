Although a majority of the tendinous extensions of the forearm musculature traverse the radiocarpal joint, only three muscles insert or originate on the bony surface of this joint. The pronator quadratus and the brachioradialis have a fascial connection and share a common insertion on the distal radius.

The scaphoid is the one bone of the radiocarpal joint that serves as a site of origin for the musculature of the forearm and hand. The abductor pollicis brevis, which causes abduction about the first metacarpophalangeal joint originates from the scaphoid tubercle and the trapezium and inserts at the base of the proximal phalanx of the first digit.

The majority of the muscles of both the flexor and extensor compartments of the forearm cross a portion of the radiocarpal joint and affect the motion and stability of the joint.  Some of the osteology of the radiocarpal joint have a profound effect on the function of those muscles. For example, Lister’s tubercle (bony prominence on the dorsal surface of the distal radius), acts as a pulley for the tendon of the extensor pollicis longus.
