Right aortic arch anomalies occur in approximately 0.01 to 0.1 percent of the general population. In general, these anomalies do not directly cause any cardiovascular problems. However, in some patients, right aortic arches can be associated with other congenital heart defects, vascular rings, and chromosomal abnormalities such as DiGeorge syndrome. Rarely, various anatomical issues can arise, leading to complications that can require surgical intervention. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of right aortic arches and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients and their families.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomy and features of right aortic arches.
- Explain when a right aortic arch is clinically important.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for clinically important right aortic arches.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients with right aortic arches and improve outcomes.
