Treatment of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia is a multistep approach with combination therapy with both lifestyle modifications and medical treatment. Lifestyle modifications are essential with reduced intake of fat and/or carbohydrate.

A low carbohydrate diet is also recommended as concomitant insulin resistance is common among individuals with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia and is associated with lower plasma lipid levels.

When dietary modifications are insufficient in optimizing lipid levels, statins with fibrates are the mainstay of therapy and demonstrated improvement in LDL levels. It is important to focus on non-HDL cholesterol as LDL-C is usually low.

There is a limited number of randomized controlled trials specific for familial dysbetalipoproteinemia patients evaluating the effect of lipid-lowering drugs. The trials that were completed did have indeterminate endpoints in termsÂ of on-target lipid levels. Overall trials did demonstrate a reduction in LDL and total cholesterol levels.
