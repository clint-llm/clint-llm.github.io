The American Urological Association (AUA) in collaboration with the Society for Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine, and Urogenital Reconstruction (SUFU) summarises the main indications for performing urodynamic studies into 5 categories

- Identifying LUT dysfunction

- Predicting the consequences of LUT dysfunction on the upper urinary tract

- Predicting outcomes of management

- Assessing the outcomes of an intervention

- Assessing treatment failure

Standard urodynamic testing is useful where there is an unclear diagnosis if surgical interventions are a consideration, in the presence of multiple coexisting pathologies and a decision is necessary regarding which symptoms to manage first, or in patients with complex urological/anatomical issues.
