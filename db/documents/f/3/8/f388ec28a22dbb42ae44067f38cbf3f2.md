The natural history of asymptomatic WPW patients has been speculated from the available data on symptomatic WPW patients and from those who have been incidentally discovered to have a WPW ECG pattern. In large-scale population-based studies involving pediatric and adult populations, the general prevalence of WPW has been estimated between 1 to 3 per 1000 individuals (0.1 to 0.3 %). Identification of the truly asymptomatic patients with WPW pattern is difficult, as these individuals by definition are those who have no clinical symptoms. A general estimate by experts suggests that about 65% of adolescents and 40% of individuals over 30 years with a WPW pattern on a resting ECG are asymptomatic. The incidence of patients with the WPW pattern progressing to arrhythmia is thought to be around 1% to 2% per year, and WPW syndrome prevalence peaks from age 20 to 24.

Familial studies have shown a slightly higher incidence of WPW, about 0.55% among first-degree relatives of an index patient with WPW. A familial form of WPW syndrome has been observed with a missense mutation in the PRAKAG2 gene leading to an increase in prevalence to 3.4% in first-degree relatives, and the condition is associated with congenital structural heart disease including Ebstein anomaly and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
