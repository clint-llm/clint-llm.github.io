The incidence of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is between 1 in 10000 to 1 in 86000 in men and women. Almost 66% of the cases are associated with Kallmann syndrome. This syndrome is more common in men. Kallmann syndrome is usually diagnosed in children who present with delayed puberty.

Stress-related hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is common in young women and accounts for 30% of cases of secondary amenorrhea in this age group.

Pituitary tumors are a rare cause and can occur at any age but are usually diagnosed late in adulthood. Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism can also occur at any age.
