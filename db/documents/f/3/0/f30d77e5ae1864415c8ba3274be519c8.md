The clinical significance of half-life tends to arise in situations involving drug toxicity. These incidences can result from patients who have overdosed or received an incorrect amount of a particular drug from medical staff, who have clinically significant renal or hepatic failure, or who have any other multitude of factors that increase drug plasma concentrations above a given toxic threshold. In the case of renal failure, drug excretion will be impaired, and consequently, the peak initial concentration and excretion rate of a given drug will increase.
