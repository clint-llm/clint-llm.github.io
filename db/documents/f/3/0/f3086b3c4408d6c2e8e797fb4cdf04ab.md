The management of adrenocortical carcinoma poses a unique challenge because of its multiple endocrine functions. Because of the rarity of adrenocortical carcinomas and the limited clinical series, no universal guidelines exist.

Current practice influence is by expert consensus opinion gathered from medical centers that specialize in the treatment of ACC.

Treatment of advanced ACC must be considered palliative. This treatment includes improving the quality of life (QOL) through necessary interventions (e.g., pain control, prevention of fractures caused by bony metastasis and adequate control of hormonal symptoms) as well as minimizing side effects from antineoplastic therapies.
