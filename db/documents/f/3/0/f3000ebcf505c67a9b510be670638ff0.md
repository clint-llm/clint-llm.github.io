The etiology of notalgia paresthetica has not been completely explained. Most authors agree notalgia paresthetica is a neuropathy, but whether it is radicular or peripheral is unknown.

Many reports state a thoracic polyradiculopathy of posterior rami of T2 to T6 as the primary cause due to suggestive radiographic findings in some patients with notalgia paresthetica. Numerous causes of unilateral thoracic nerve impingement have been reported, with the most common being degenerative vertebral changes and herniated intravertebral discs. Other causes include osteoarthritic lesions with resulting kyphosis and vertebral hyperostosis. Professionals who criticize the radiculopathy theory state that radiculopathy would result in symptoms with a dermatomal pattern not just in an isolated area, which is seen in notalgia paresthetica.

Peripheral etiologies of notalgia paresthetica are abundant and can be classified into physical, anatomical, genetic, metabolic, and infectious. Physical causes include muscle spasms that are thought to compress cutaneous and itch sensitive nerves resulting in aberrant firing. Some authors attribute the anatomical angle the peripheral histamine-sensitive nerves pierce the multifidus spinae muscles.
