**Supraspinatus**

- The neural supply of the supraspinatus is by the suprascapular nerve (C5, C6) from the upper trunk of the brachial plexus.

**Deltoid**

- The neural supply of the deltoid is via the axillary nerve (C5, C6) from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus.

**Trapezius**

- The neural supply of the trapezius is the spinal accessory nerve (C1-C5). C3 and C4 are responsible for proprioception of the trapezius.

**Serratus Anterior**

- The neural supply of the serratus anterior is the long thoracic nerve (C5-C7) which originates from the roots of the brachial plexus.
