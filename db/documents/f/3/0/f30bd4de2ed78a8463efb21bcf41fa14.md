**Histological Findings**

Most commonly, there is a diffuse arrangement of pale cells that is interrupted by fibrovascular septa containing lymphocytes. The tumor cells characteristically have pale to clear cytoplasm, with crisp cytoplasmic membranes and polygonal nuclei with finely granular chromatin and frequently flattened edges. One or more large, centrally located nucleoli are present. The abundant cytoplasm results in relatively evenly spaced, non-overlapping nuclei in most cases. The cytoplasmic clarity is attributable to abundant glycogen particles demonstrable with the periodic acid-Schiff stain. Less commonly, the cytoplasm is denser, and the nuclei more crowded. This may result in a plasmacytoid appearance. A variably prominent lymphocytic infiltrate occurs in almost every case and a granulomatous reaction in more than half. Approximately 10-20% of tumors contain admixed syncytiotrophoblast cells that vary in prominence from widely scattered to prominent aggregates.

**Immunohistochemical Findings**

Seminomas stain for antigens characteristic of immature, fetal-type germ cells (gonocytes), including placental alkaline phosphatase (86-95%; cytoplasmic membrane), KIT (90-100%; cytoplasmic membrane), OCT3/4 (100%; nuclear), SALL4 (100%; nuclear), and SOX17 (95%; nuclear). Podoplanin is also positive (100%; cytoplasmic membrane). Cytokeratin AE1/AE3 immunoreactivity varies (20-36%), but is often negative or stains the cytoplasm of only a minority of tumor cells, often in a para nuclear dot-like pattern. CD30 is characteristically negative, as is epithelial membrane antigen (2%). Stains for alpha-fetoprotein are always negative.
