There are two stages in the course of Type I hypersensitivity: immediate reaction and late-phase reaction. During the initial phase, there is a sudden response within minutes of exposure to the allergen. While the late-phase may develop 4 to 12 hours post early phase reaction and can last for up to 24 to 73 hours. Late-phase reaction, as mediated by eosinophils, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, can result in increased release of more mediators, which can lead to further tissue damage, swelling, increased erythema, cough, wheezing and secretions.
