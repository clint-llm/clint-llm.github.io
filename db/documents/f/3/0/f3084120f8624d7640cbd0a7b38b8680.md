The halo vest immobilizer (halo brace) device is the most rigid form of external immobilization of the upper cervical spine to date. Indications for its application include definite treatment of upper cervical spine trauma (most common), preoperative reduction of spinal deformities, and postoperative adjuvant stabilization. Application and follow-up management requires a team approach to help limit the number of complications, comorbidities, and mortality. This activity outlines and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who require and undergo a halo vest immobilizer procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Review patient risk factors that may increase morbidity and mortality following HVI application. 
- Describe the essential anatomy and how to obtain the essential anatomical measurements for proper HVI procedure and pin application. 
- Summarize complications that can occur from this procedure.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate candidates are selected for halo vest immobilization (halo brace) and the proper application method and post-procedure management is performed, reducing complications and producing successful treatments.
