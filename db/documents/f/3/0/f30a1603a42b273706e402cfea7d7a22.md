The production of cAMP is regulated by Adenylyl Cyclase and phosphodiesterase. The main purpose of cAMP’s is to activate a cAMP-dependent family of enzymes called protein kinase A. An activated PKA has the ability to phosphorylate serine and threonine residues on substrate proteins which then initiate a variety of responses within the cell.****For example, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is phosphorylated leading to the regulation of gene transcription in a cell.****

Once the signaling has occurred, cAMP is hydrolyzed to 5’-AMP. This enzymatic hydrolysis is carried out by cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) that cleaves the 3’,5’-phosphodiester bond in the cAMP, thus inhibiting the phosphorylating activity of PKA.****Since 5’-AMP is not an intracellular signaling molecule, removal of the extracellular ligand (hormone or neurotransmitter) results in rapid termination of the signaling cascade and hence the effect of that ligand. PDE is inhibited by caffeine and therefore inhibition of PDE can result in prolonged activation of a specific signaling pathway.****

In addition to PKA, cAMP influences cellular function via a newly discovered receptor group called exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) which cAMP-activated as two isoforms in mammals. Thus far, ex vivo cell culture model studies have demonstrated cAMP and EPAC work on cell adhesion function, cell-cell junction, exocytosis/secretion, cell differentiation and proliferation, gene expression, apoptosis, cardiac hypertrophy. Since cAMP interacts with both PKA and EPAC families within a cell, it is noted that the interactions may act synergistically or antagonistically, depending on the function. For example, in cell proliferation and differentiation, the PKA and EPAC produce counter effects, whereas an example of a synergistic effect would be in the regulation of the sodium-proton exchanger isoform.****
