Patients in the intensive care unit are the most difficult to treat as colonization is common and it is difficult to distinguish this from an infection. All patients who are noted to have colonization with Acinetobacter should be isolated from other patients to prevent further colonization.Once an infection is treated, the patient's clinical course must be followed rather than cultures, because colonization may offer a falsely positive diagnosis.

The prognosis of an isolated Acinetobacter infection is excellent in patients who are otherwise healthy. Patients who are immunosuppressed tend to have a poor outcome.
