In the human body, heme biosynthesis is mostly present in the bone marrow and liver tissue.

- Bone Marrow - due to the large requirement for heme to sustain the production of hemoglobin, the bone marrow accounts for the majority of daily heme synthesis (over 80%). In erythroblasts and reticulocytes, heme synthesis gets regulated by the presence of the erythroid-specific enzyme aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2), which catalyzes the first step in heme synthesis. The gene for this enzyme has a promoter region with several erythroid-specific elements that are acted upon by erythroid transcription factors. Also, the ALAS2 mRNA has an iron-responsive element IRE- that leads to the upregulation of enzyme expression in the presence of iron.

- Liver Tissue - in the liver, heme is utilized primarily as a prosthetic group for the various enzymes in the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) family; this accounts for the bulk of the remainder of heme synthesis in the human body. ALAS1 is the enzyme present in the liver that is responsible for the regulation of heme synthesis and operates with a feedback mechanism to maintain a relatively constant amount of heme for use.

Therefore an interruption in any of the steps in the production of heme could result in the buildup of specific toxic heme precursors leading to a group of diseases called the porphyrias, which may present differently depending on the metabolite that accumulates and site of accumulation (hepatic vs. erythropoietic).
