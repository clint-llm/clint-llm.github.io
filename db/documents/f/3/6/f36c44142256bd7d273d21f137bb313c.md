The differential diagnosis of cutaneous leiomyomas can be extensive given the non-specific appearance of solitary lesions. However, multiple cutaneous leiomyomas, specifically piloleiomyomas, tend to have a distinct clinical appearance. Should the patient voice concerns or pain or discomfort associated with the lesions, additional clinical entities that should be entertained include: blue rubber bleb nevus, angiolipomas, neuromas, glomus tumors, neurilemmoma, endometrioma, granular cell tumor, and eccrine spiradenomas which are part of the painful skin lesion differential. Dermatofibromas may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.
