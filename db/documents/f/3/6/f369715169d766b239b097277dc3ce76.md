There are several nursing diagnoses that can be used for tobacco cessation, such as:

Ineffective Therapeutic Regimen Management: Pattern of regulating and integrating into daily living a program for the treatment of illness and the sequelae of illness that is unsatisfactory for meeting specific health goals.  Tobacco use is an unsatisfactory daily activity that leads to negative health outcomes.

Anxiety: Vague uneasy feeling of discomfort or dread accompanied by an autonomic response. Withdrawal from nicotine, an addictive substance, can lead to anxiety.

Deficient Knowledge: Absence or deficiency of cognitive information related to specific topic.  Communities, families, and individuals require an understanding of the addictive nature of tobacco use and its accompanied negative health effects.

Impaired Gas Exchange: Excess or deficit in oxygenation and/or carbon dioxide elimination at the alveolar-capillary membrane. Tobacco use damages lung tissue and influences the ability to exchange oxygen at the cellular level in both smokers and in individuals exposed to second-hand smoke.

Ineffective Coping: Inability to form a valid appraisal of the stressors, inadequate choices of practiced responses, and/or inability to use available resources.  Nicotine initially provides a calming effect; thus is used as a stress reliever and taking a smoking break during activities can also be used as a coping mechanism; however, the long term use of a stress relief method such as tobacco leads to increased stressors associated with poor health.

Risk for Infection: At increased risk for being invaded by pathogen organisms. Exposure to tobacco products creates risk of respiratory infection for the smoker and those exposed to second-hand smoke; it is especially harmful to the immature respiratory systems in infants and children.

Short term outcomes should be for the individual to express a desire to quit using tobacco products; to refrain from smoking around others, especially infants and children; and to enroll in a cessation program.  Long term outcomes are to remain tobacco-free, thus eliminating exposure to the individual and others.
