The etiology of CD is complex and results from an interaction between multiple biological and psychosocial factors.

**Biological**

- Various studies indicate a moderate degree of heritability for antisocial behavior, impulsivity, temperament, aggression, and insensitivity to punishment.

- Evidence for low levels of plasma dopamine beta-hydroxylase supports the finding of decreased activity of the noradrenergic system in the CD.

- Low levels of 5-Hydroxy Indole acetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in CSF correlate with aggression and violence in adolescence.

- High testosterone levels are also associated with aggression

**Parental and Family**

- A home environment that lacks structure and adequate supervision with frequent marital conflicts between parents, inconsistent discipline leads to maladaptive behavior.

- Harsh parenting with verbal and physical aggression towards children

- Children exposed to frequent domestic violence

- The family history of criminality and disruptive behaviors in caregivers.

- Substance abuse, particularly alcohol dependence in parents

- Living in low social, economic conditions with overcrowding and unemployment leads to economic and social stress with lack of adequate parenting.

**Neurological**

- Â Some studies suggest a correlation between resting frontal brain electrical activity (EEG) and aggression in children.

- Neuropsychological insults to the brain in early life can cause deficits in language, memory, and executive functioning leading to poor judgment and inability to plan and problem solve in crisis situations.

- Developmental delays cause poor social skills, learning disability, below-average intellectual capacity, thus contributing to difficulties in learning, academic difficulties, low self-esteem, and the tendency for children to engage in disruptive behaviors.

- Any traumatic brain injury, seizures, and neurological damage can contribute to aggression.

**School**

- School environment with large classroom size increased ratio of children to teachers, lack of positive feedback from teachers.

- Lack of supportive staff and counseling to address socio-economic difficulties in children

- Exposure to increased gang violence in the community

**Protective**

- A positive role model in life

- Affectionate parenting

- Ability to regulate emotions with self-soothing

- Early intervention and adequate parenting

**Comorbid Conditions**

- Children with a difficult temperament that demonstrate poor adaptability and frequent negative emotions.

- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD): Almost one-third of children with ADHD have symptoms of conduct disorder and other central nervous system dysfunction or damage.

- Trauma-related disorders, particularly repeated physical and sexual abuse with maltreatment in children, can lead to a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders.

- Mood disorders that include depression and bipolar disorder

- Developmental disorders
