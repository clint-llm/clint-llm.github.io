One out of 200 individuals, have a non recurrent right inferior laryngeal nerve; instead of the typical course of the recurrent right inferior laryngeal nerve, the variant form branches off the vagus nerve around the level of the cricoid cartilage.

In about 80% of individuals, a connecting branch exists between the inferior laryngeal nerve, a branch of the recuurent laryngeal nerve and the internal laryngeal nerve which is a branch of the superior laryngeal nerve.  This is "anastmosis" (although it refers to nerves rather than vessels) is referred to as the anastomosis of Galen and is a very rare one anastomoses between the two nerves.
