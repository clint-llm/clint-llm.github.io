Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and management of trauma to the eye. In addition to computed tomography, which is the primary imaging modality used for orbital trauma, ultrasound and optical coherence tomography are less-invasive techniques to assess the structures of the eye. This activity reviews the imaging techniques used in the setting of trauma to the eye and orbit. It describes the key findings for various vision and life-threatening conditions, including orbital fractures, foreign bodies, open-globe injuries, retinal detachment, and anterior-segment injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the imaging techniques indicated for various settings of trauma to the eye and orbit.
- Review the anatomy of the eye and orbit, focusing on the most commonly implicated structures in orbital trauma.
- Summarize key findings that may be seen on imaging in patients with a history of orbital and ocular trauma.
- Explain the appropriateness of imaging techniques used by the interprofessional team in various situations, such as ocular foreign body and open-globe injuries.
