In the United States, tympanostomy tube (TT) insertion is the most common ambulatory surgery performed on children under 15, with nearly 667,000 cases performed in 2006.

The most common reason that TT insertions are performed includes otitis media resulting in persistent middle ear fluid (middle ear effusion) with hearing loss, recurrent acute otitis media, and persistent middle ear infections despite antibiotic therapy. Otitis media is the second most common illness diagnosed in children and is more common in children younger than seven due to their relatively undeveloped immune systems and poorer Eustachian tube function.
