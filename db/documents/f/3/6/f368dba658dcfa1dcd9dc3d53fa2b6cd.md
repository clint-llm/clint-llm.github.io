Point of care optic nerve sheath ultrasound (ONSUS) is a bedside practice that can be used to evaluate for increased intracranial pressure. Systematic review and meta-analysis have shown that ONSD of more than 5.00 to 5.70 mm has a concurrent ICP value above 20 mm Hg. Systematic review and meta-analysis showed a mean ONSD in the included studies of 5.82 mm. ONSD reacts to ICP in real-time. Within the effective range, the chances of plastic deformation and over-distention of the ONS are minimal. It is a very useful adjunct to other standard diagnostic modalities. This activity reviews indications and limitations and describes the procedure. It outlines applicable uses for unstable patients in the emergency room, intensive care unit, and remote environments.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the eye anatomy as it relates to increased intracranial pressure. 
- Summarize the ONSUS procedure, including its contraindications.
- Explain the measurements of the optic nerve and the associated clinical significance.
- Describe the clinical significance of optic nerve sheath ultrasound (ONSUS) in an austere environment and how it could provide better patient care by an interprofessional team.
