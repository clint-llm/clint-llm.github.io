Acromegaly is not a common disorder, but it is associated with very high morbidity and mortality rates when it presents. Because the presentation of acromegaly is systemic, an interprofessional team approach is necessary.

In particular, in addition to an endocrinologist, other specialists like a cardiologist, oncologist, neurologist, and pulmonologist should be involved as the disorder is associated with malignancies and adverse cardiac, neurologic, and pulmonary events.

The nurse practitioner should ensure that the patients are not showing signs of hypopituitarism after treatment and during follow-up appointments and report to the clinician as concerns arise. Levels of GH and IGF need to be monitored for life. Because of the cancer risk, these patients should promptly receive a referral to the appropriate specialist. Patients need to be educated about the importance of follow-up because the morbidity from cardiac and respiratory complications is very high. Nurses can help coordinate the activities of the various clinicians on the case, engage in patient counsel, and serve as case managers. Because of joint dysfunction, early physical therapy is recommended. Many of these individuals are not gainfully employed, and thus social workers should have involvement in managing their financial status. Due to the challenges of managing medical therapy, a pharmacist should perform medication reconciliation and evaluate for toxicity. Any concerns should be reported to the clinical team. [Level 5]

The mortality rates of acromegaly patients are three times the general population, with most dying from respiratory and cardiac complications. These patients also develop several types of tumors, including prostatic hypertrophy, uterine myomas, and skin tags. The overall outcome depends on whether the cause of acromegaly is treatable. Sometimes patients may need treatment due to residual disease even after surgical removal of pituitary tumors. The quality of life in these patients is poor.
