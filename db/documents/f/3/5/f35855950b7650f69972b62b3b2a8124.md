In the United States, approximately 20.4% of adults suffer from chronic pain, based on the 2016 National Health Interview Survey data.

There are three major divisions of cluneal nerves: superior, middle, and inferior. An often-overlooked potential cause of unilateral low back and buttock pain is entrapment of the superior cluneal nerves (SCN), resulting in cluneal neuralgia (CN). CN characteristically presents as pain and sensory abnormalities in the lumbar and gluteal region, and it is imperative to consider this pathology when evaluating patients with low back pain. The cluneal nerves are purely sensory nerves providing cutaneous innervation of the buttocks and posterior presacral region.
