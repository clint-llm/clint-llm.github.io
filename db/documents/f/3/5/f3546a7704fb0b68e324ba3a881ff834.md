A high index of clinical suspicion is crucial for the diagnosis of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). A firm diagnosis can be made pathologically by the demonstration of platelet thrombi on autopsy or surgical specimens. No laboratory tests exist to confirm the diagnosis of LS endocarditis. In patients suspected of LS endocarditis, a full assessment should be done with complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and blood cultures to differentiate from other etiologies such as infective endocarditis. A hypercoagulable workup is also necessary in each case suspected of LS endocarditis, including lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies. However, the primary evaluation for LSE is by echocardiography.least three sets of blood cultures should be taken before any potential empiric antibiotic therapy. The absence of the typical causative organisms for culture-positive endocarditis and atypical organisms that are etiological for culture-negative endocarditis can provide support for the diagnosis of NBTE.

Trans-esophageal echocardiography has greater sensitivity and specificity than trans-thoracic echocardiography. Irregular borders, heterogeneous echo density, and an absence of independent motion characterize the masses (i.e., verrucous vegetations) found on the cardiac valves and endocardium. These are usually small, sessile masses, but they can be as large as 10 mm. The basal and mid-portion of the mitral and aortic valves are involved most commonly. Diffuse or focal leaflet thickening of the mitral and aortic valves are observable. The involved valves may exhibit regurgitation. Coexisting cardiac complications of systemic lupus erythematosus may include effusion or thickening of the pericardium.

A workup for a hypercoagulable state (in particular testing for the presence of a lupus anticoagulant and elevated levels of antiphospholipid antibodies) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are a requirement in every case of suspected NBTE. Also, a search for malignancy and systemic lupus erythematosus with a thorough history, clinical examination, age-appropriate cancer screening, and lupus serology is prudent. The presence of any of these diagnoses is strongly supportive of NBTE.

Echocardiography — Patients with suspected NBTE should have an evaluation with two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for the presence of valvular vegetations.
