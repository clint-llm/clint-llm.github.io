The ethmoid bone is important in the structural formation of the skull and has a protective role in the human body. The cribriform plate allows the olfactory nerve to pass through from the nasal chamber into the skull. Pneumatized ethmoid air cells ensure structural stability, resist fractures within the medial wall of the orbit, and protect the eyeball during trauma.

Ethmoid fractures may result in delayed complications even years after trauma; however, such cases are relatively rare. These complications include meningitis, recurrence of cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, and delayed cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea onset. A previous study found that patients with these complications often have large ethmoid bone defects and often have normal radiological assessments after trauma. With successful surgical repair, these patients were well after follow-up.

Patients with inflammation of the ethmoid bone may have osteitis of the ethmoid bone and chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis occurs when the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa becomes inflamed for longer than three months without complete symptom resolution, and functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is the treatment for this condition.
