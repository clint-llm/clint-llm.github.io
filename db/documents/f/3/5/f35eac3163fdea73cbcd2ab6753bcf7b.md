Ineffective treatment of skin or pharyngeal infection with group A streptococcus leads to acute rheumatic fever. Prevention of recurrent episodes of ARF and the development of potential serious outcomes of rheumatic heart disease require secondarily prophylaxis of penicillin. Secondary prophylaxis is the most effective method of reducing the incidence of ARF and RHD. Nevertheless, primary prophylaxis is gaining popularity throughout the globe. Primary prevention comprises of prompt treatment of streptococcal throat or skin infection via a single injection of benzathine penicillin or oral penicillin for 10 days after confirmation of S. pyogenes infection. Not only does prompt antibiotic treatment reduce the burden of ARF, but it also reduces the incidence of suppurative complications like otitis media.
