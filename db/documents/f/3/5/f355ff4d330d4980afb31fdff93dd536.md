Among C. trachomatis infections, the only trachoma is diagnosable on clinical grounds. Other chlamydial infections are associated with specific clinical syndromes but require laboratory confirmation. The gold standard for the diagnosis of urogenital chlamydia infections is nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). This test is run on either the vaginal swabs for women or first-catch urine for men. Testing can also be performed on endocervical or urethral swabs. Swabs should have a wire or plastic shaft; the tip should be dacron or rayon or a cytobrush. Other materials may inhibit Chlamydia trachomatis. Alternative methods of testing include culture, rapid testing, serology, antigen detection, and genetic probes. If there is no testing available, treatment is recommended based on clinical presentation.

When a patient presents with suspected chlamydia infection, a workup for other STDs should be carried out. A complete blood count is essential if PID is suspected. One may consider testing for HIV, gonorrhea, and syphilis. The sexual partner must be tested for chlamydia. A pregnancy test should be done as it is a contraindication to doxycycline therapy.

Cytology is often used in patients with conjunctivitis and ocular trachoma. Cultures are usually not done for chlamydia as the organism is difficult to grow in the laboratory. However, in patients with anal and rectal involvement, cultures are ideal as other tests are difficult to interpret.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends regular screening for chlamydia in all sexually active women because if left untreated, the infection is associated with PID, infertility, and chronic pelvic pain. In males, the leucocyte esterase test in urine can be done and is diagnostic for gonorrhea or chlamydia in the absence of a UTI.
