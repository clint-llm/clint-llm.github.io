Tolerability of a portacaval shunt procedure, the patient depends upon liver function time of operation. A good rule of thumb is attempted to improve a patient's nutrition as well as hepatic state prior to surgery. This can include several weeks of medical management consisting of diet, activity, and diuretics. After a thorough history and physical examination, hepatic function studies, as well as hepatosplenic hemodynamic determinations, are then obtained. The selection of procedure is dependent upon the patency of the portal and splenic veins, the result of liver function lab work and studies, the amount of portal venous blood that is being shunted, and if the patient is bleeding acutely. Evaluation of liver function is performed, which includes a combination of clinical factors and laboratory studies.

Patient selection for portocaval shunting is based on clinical status, the result of liver function tests, and the interpretation of hepatic hemodynamics that are determined via radiological studies. Ideally, the patient's considered for shunting should be less than 60 years old, have no evidence of encephalopathy, ascites, jaundice, or muscle mass wasting. A patient who has a history of ascites or jaundice is at an increased surgical risk. Platelet counts, as well as PTT, should also be within normal limits. Any deviation from these values should be attempted to be corrected through parenteral administration of whole blood, fresh frozen plasma, or albumin as well as through vitamin K. In a patient who suffers from ascites, and diuretic therapy may be indicated. Electrolyte and acid-base imbalances should be controlled, especially if a patient has hypokalemic alkalosis. Any coagulation deficits other than those associated with prothrombin can be corrected with fresh frozen plasma and platelet concentrate. The patient should be typed and screened prior to their operation. At the time of surgical intervention, 10 to 12 units of whole blood should be readily available to the surgeon.

The serum albumin levels should be greater than 3 g/dL when assessing nutritional status. Prothrombin time should be less than 1.5 times normal. Sodium sulfobromophthalein, phenolphthalein used as a diagnostic aid to determine hepatic function, should be below 30% at 30 minutes time. Whilst deviation from these listed criteria is not absolute contraindications for surgery, and it does place the patient at surgical risk as these measurements are directly proportional to the degree of the patient's hepatic decompensation. A liver transplant can also be considered in these patients. If a shunting procedure is desired for portal hypertension, it can be divided into 3 types, which include portocaval, splenorenal, and mesocaval.

When evaluating the patient, esophagoscopy and gastroscopy should routinely be obtained as well as barium studies both the esophagus and stomach. Determination of hepato-splanchnic hemodynamics can be performed from an estimation of total hepatic blood flow, hepatic vein catheterization, splenoportography, indirect portography, liver scan, and visceral angiography. Radionucleotide scanning can be utilized to estimate the total hepatic blood flow. The degree of portal hypertension and the amount of hepato-pedal portal blood flow can be determined with the utilization of hepatic vein catheterization.

The typical single best source of estimating the portal hemodynamics is splenoportography. To undergo this study, prothrombin time must be less than 1.5 times the normal with an operating room readily available, should trouble from hemorrhage subsequently developed. splenoportography can reveal the patient's degree of portal hypertension and the degree of opacification of the portal vein. This provides pertinent information concerning the severity of compromise to portal blood flow to the liver. The information gathered from the listed hemodynamic studies can influence the choice of which shunt is to be performed.
