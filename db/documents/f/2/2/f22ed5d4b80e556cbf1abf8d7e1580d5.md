As the development of biosimilars agents has progressed over the years, awareness in subspecialty practices encountering high incidence and prevalence of inflammatory diseases such as rheumatology, dermatology, and gastroenterology is also expanding.

The American journal of managed care (AJMC) discussed insights on biologics and biosimilars for inflammatory diseases. In the United States (US), fewer than 1% of dispensed prescribed medications consist of biological agents; however, the biologic agents value over one-fourth of all prescription costs in the US. The knowledge and awareness of biosimilars in specialty practices such as rheumatology and gastroenterology have increased in recent years due to the advocacy from respective specialty associations.

Biosimilars have been prevalent in Europe, Japan, and South Korea for over a decade, but their availability in the US was delayed due to the necessity of regulations dictating their pathway to market. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act was implemented in 2009, and since the initial FDA approval was granted for biosimilar "filgrastim-sndz " in March 2015. To date, more biosimilars are being approved and marketed, with the latest approval coming on July 28, 2021, for biosimilar agent insulin glargine-yfgn. The proposed predictions for reducing costs vary from $54 billion to $250 billion within the midst of the 2020s onwards.

For the cost-saving potential and improved patient access to agents for treating inflammatory diseases, recognition of biosimilars as safe and efficacious agents by patients, primary care clinicians, specialists, and other healthcare professionals is warranted to achieve market share.

Several original biologics will be nearing closings of their patents, and prospective producers of biosimilars are anticipated and the importance of regulative criteria ensuring their safety and effectiveness in managing inflammatory diseases. More than 70% of biologic agents' costs were accumulated from biologics with lapsed patents, which would soon be off-patent.

When producing and developing biosimilars, their primary structure and sequence of amino acids are identical to their respective reference products.

Some patients may have a more silent disease course, while others may be in remission. Clinicians may feel more comfortable with the standard of care and prescribe a biological agent due to successful patient outcomes.

When treating inflammatory diseases, a patient-centered approach should be regarded when considering the use of biosimilars. Biosimilars are deemed to be more affordable when compared to original biologics improving access to treatment options. When prescribing biosimilars, cost efficiency for the patient should be considered as it may only be more economical to the provider and payer but not so much to the patient.

Patients may also feel comfortable continuing care with the original biologic initiated if they are already being treated compared to subjects with newly diagnosed inflammatory diseases, who may feel more open to a biosimilar.

Biosimilars ultimately demonstrate similarity to original biologics based on their characteristics of safety, efficacy, potency, tolerability but do not share similar cost considerations. Cost and prescribing considerations can ultimately make biosimilars the choice of biotherapeutics when prescribing biologics for inflammatory diseases.

Barriers that need to be considered when prescribing biosimilars are patients not responding to the switch in medications or receiving no cost benefits due to their managed care plans.

Challenges clinicians may face when discussing biosimilars with patients for inflammatory diseases are medication switches in subjects with disease states already in remission. Patients may not want to risk replacing an already established agent that has demonstrated desired patient outcomes and disease stability with another agent similar to the primary medication for cost benefits.

Clinician awareness for biosimilars use for inflammatory disease in clinical practice is gradually increasing through clinician programs through their respective specialty programs.

The future for biosimilars use in inflammatory disease in the US is gaining positive traction.

The EMA has served as a lead for setting regulatory pathways for biosimilars and their approvals as the first-ever biosimilar received approval in 2006 by the EMA.
