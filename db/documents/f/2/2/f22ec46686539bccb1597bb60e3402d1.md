Veins of the anterolateral wall can get dilated due to multiple causes. Obstruction of the superior vena cava or inferior vena cava (by a mass or thrombus) can present as dilated, tortuous veins over the abdomen. Urgent surgery may be required in such situations. Supra-umbilical median incisions through the linea alba have several advantages such as being bloodless as most vasculature courses lateral to the linea alba. Furthermore, these incisions are safe to muscles and nerves but tend toÂ leave a postoperative weakness through which a ventral hernia may form.
