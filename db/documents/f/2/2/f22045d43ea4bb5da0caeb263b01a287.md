**Intraocular irrigation solution:**Its physical characteristics like refractive index and density are similar to the aqueous humor. Thus, surgical maneuvers can be performed easily. The Balanced Salt Solution (BSS) contains sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride dihydrate, sodium citrate dihydrate, sodium acetate trihydrate, magnesium chloride hexahydrate, and sodium hydroxide. Its pH and osmolality are 7.5 and 300 mOsm, respectively. BSS PLUS contains additional dibasic sodium phosphate, sodium bicarbonate, dextrose, and glutathione disulfide. Its pH and osmolality are 7.4 and 305 mOsm, respectively. BSS and BSS-Plus are expensive but can better maintain the corneal endothelial function and corneal clarity.

**Gas:**The gas stays as a single large bubble as the interfacial tension between water and gas is high. The large gas bubble exerts an upward force to tamponade the retinal break against the retinal pigment epithelium. This force results from the counterplay between two forces., i.e., gravity exerts a downward force and buoyancy, which generates an upward force. The weight of 1 mL gas is 0.001 g, and its buoyancy is 1g. Hence, it can exert an upward force of 0.999g, which is much more than the upward force produced by a SO bubble and similar to the downward force produced by a PFCL bubble. The gas bubble assumes a flat bottom due to its large upward force. This reduces the volume wasted in making the lower meniscus and maximizes the volume that contributes to making contact with the retina. This contact with the retina prevents water from entering the subretinal space through the retinal break(s). Also, the intraocular currents are reduced due to the air bubble, thus reducing water from entering the subretinal space.

The pure expansile gases undergo three phases inside the eye, i.e., expansion, equilibration, and dissolution.

i) Initially, the gas bubble expands due to its lower water solubility than nitrogen. As a result, much more nitrogen diffuses inside the bubble than the gas dissolving outside the bubble into the surrounding fluid. This expansion is most rapid in the initial 6-8 hours. While the SF6 bubble expands two times its original volume in 1-2 days, the C3F8 bubble expands four times its original volume in 3-4 days. Air does not expand as the partial pressure of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide is similar in the air and the blood. As a result, air bubble directly enters the dissolution phase. The non-expansile concentrations of SF6 and C3F8 are 18% and 12-14%, respectively.

ii) The equilibration phase begins when the partial pressure of nitrogen in the gas bubble and the surrounding fluid become similar.

iii) The dissolution phase begins when the partial pressure of all the gases within the bubble becomes similar to the surrounding fluid. The air, SF6, and C3F8 bubbles last for 5 to 7 days, 1 to 2 weeks, and 6 to 8 weeks, respectively. The intraocular longevity of each gas depends on its water solubility, which further depends on the length of the carbon chain. However, the tamponade effect remains only until 50% of the initial bubble size and 25% of the bubble’s lifespan. The volume of a gas bubble can be calculated from the arc of contact. The 90 degree, 120 degree, 150 degree, and 180-degree arc of contact signifies that the gas volume is 0.28, 0.75, 1.49, and 2.40 mL, respectively.

**PFCL:**Similar to the gases, it is also a synthetic fluorinated hydrocarbon. While the compounds with ≤4 carbons exist in the gaseous form and those with ≥5 carbon exist in the liquid form at room temperature. The US FDA has approved perfluoro-n-octane (C8F18) for intraocular use.

i) Optical clarity: Various intra-operative manipulations under PFCL are possible.

ii) High density and specific gravity (C8F18= 1.76): The retina is immobilized, flattened, and unfolded as the subretinal fluid/ blood are pushed anteriorly.

iii) Different refractive index from saline (C8F18=1.28): The removal of PFCL becomes easier as a separate PFCL-fluid interface is visible.

iv) Higher boiling point than water and no interference with laser wavelengths makes endolaser is possible.

v) Low surface tension (C8F18=15 Dyn/cm at 25°C) and high interfacial tension reduce the chances of the large bubble breaking into small ones and migrating inside the subretinal space through the retinal break(s).

vi) Low viscosity (C8F18=0.8 centistokes at 25°C): Injection and removal are possible through small gauge instruments.

vii) Immiscibility with water provides a clear operating field despite intra-operative bleeding

viii) Immiscibility with silicone oil: A direct PFCL-SO exchange is possible, thus reducing the risk of slippage during vitrectomy for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment due to giant retinal tear or after large retinectomy.

**SO:**Chemically, it is made up of repeating units of siloxane, i.e., a silicone and an oxygen molecule (-Si-O-). It can be either lighter or heavier than water. Thelighter-than-water SO (conventional SO) is the most commonly used type of SO. Chemically, it is made up of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), i.e., siloxane attached to two methyl side chains. Its specific gravity is 0.97, and surface tension is 21 Dyn/cm. The heavier-than-water SOs can be used for providing inferior tamponade, especially in eyes with inferior PVR changes.
