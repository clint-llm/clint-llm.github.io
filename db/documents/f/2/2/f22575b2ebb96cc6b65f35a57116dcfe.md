Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis based on history, past medical history, lung exam, and other physical findings. Oxygen saturation plays an important role in judging the severity of the disease along with the pulse rate, temperature, and respiratory rate. No further workup is needed if vital signs are normal and there are no exam findings suggestive of pneumonia. An exception to this rule is elderly patients >75 years old. Also, further workup is needed when pneumonia is suspected, the clinical diagnosis is in question, or in cases of high suspicion for influenza orÂ pertussis.

Chest x-ray (CXR) findings are not specific and are typically normal. Occasionally, the chest x-ray demonstrates increased interstitial markings consistent with the thickening of bronchial walls. A chest x-ray differentiates pneumonia from acute bronchitis when infiltrates are seen. Evidence-based guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) recommend obtaining a CXR only when heart rate > 100/min, respiratory rate >24 breaths/min, oral body temperature > 38 degrees C, and chest examination findings of egophony or fremitus.

A complete blood count and chemistry may be ordered as a workup for fever. The white blood count might be mildly elevated in some cases of acute bronchitis. Blood chemistry can reflect dehydration changes.

Routine use of rapid microbiological testing is not cost-effective and would not change management except during influenza season and in cases with high suspicion of pertussis or other bacterial infection. Gram stain and bacterial sputum cultures are specifically discouraged as bacteria are rarely the causative agent.

Spirometry, when performed, demonstrates transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness in 40% of patients with acute bronchitis. Reversibility of FEV1 >15% is reported in 17% of patients.
