Autotransfusion is most commonly used in the emergency department in trauma patients with evidence of a significant hemothorax. If the patient’s signs and symptoms display evidence of hemothorax, the preparation of autotransfusion should begin immediately before chest tube placement. If a chest tube is placed without the autotransfusion collecting bag in place, much of the blood will be lost during chest tube placement and may no longer be a viable option.

Preparation for a chest tube is common in other literature, but it is vital to maintain a strict sterile technique, including sterile gloves, a face mask with an eye shield, and a cap. In addition, the area of the skin should undergo prepping with iodine or chlorhexidine solution, and a sterile drape should be in place. A sterile setup is an essential factor in avoiding complications of infection.

The first step should be attaching the autotransfusion bag to the chest drain. An anticoagulant solution should be used to prime the system, and a steady drip of the anticoagulant solution should be mixed with the collected blood. Two types of anticoagulation are options: heparin and citrate. Heparin requires mixing with normal saline before administration with blood, whereas citrate can be mixed directly with the collected blood. Heparin does have the added risk of causing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thus citrate is preferred over the use of heparin by many providers.

Heparin anticoagulation: A heparin anticoagulant solution can be formulated by mixing 30000 units of heparin with 1000 mL of normal saline.

Citrate anticoagulation: Citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD) can be added directly to the collected blood at a ratio of 1 mL of CPD to every 7 mL of blood. Another common method is to mix 60 mL of CPD into the autotransfusion bag prior to collecting the blood and then stop collection once the bag reaches 500 mL.

A microfilter should be attached to the tubing, and air must be removed from the autotransfusion bag.

**Patient Preparation**

Providers should ensure the patient (or their surrogate) understands the procedural education. In a non-urgent setting, all questions should be answered as they arise, and information should be reinforced as necessary.
