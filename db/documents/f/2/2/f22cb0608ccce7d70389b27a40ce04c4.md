Atropine does not carry an FDA Boxed Warning nor any absolute indications. Multiple conditions carry a cautionary status. However, relative contraindications are overridden by the clinical need, especially in unstable or poisoning patients.

Clinicians need to exerciseÂ caution in patients with coronary heart disease, acute myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, tachycardia, or hypertension as the increased cardiac demand and possible further worsening of tachycardia and hypertension can prove detrimental to patient outcomes.

Furthermore, caution is necessary for use with elderly patients, chronic lung disease patients, acute angle glaucoma, obstructive diseases (uropathy, toxic megacolon, paralytic ileus, pyloric stenosis, prostatic hypertrophy), myasthenia gravis, or in situations with environmental heat exposure.

Clinician understanding the adverse reactions makes the above cautionary situations easily recognizable by compounding effects on preexisting conditions.
