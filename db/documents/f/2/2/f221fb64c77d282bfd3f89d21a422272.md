Atheroembolic renal disease (AERD), also known as cholesterol atheroembolic renal disease, atheroembolism, cholesterol embolism, or cholesterol crystal embolization, is often regarded as an underdiagnosed clinical illness.

It is now excessively recognized that cholesterol emboli are an important cause of renal impairment. Irregularly shaped atheroemboli cause partial or complete obstruction of small renal vessels causing ischemia. A vasculitis-like picture is commonly seen with an inflammatory reaction and ultimately giant cell formation. The relation of these emboli may be temporally found with the use of anticoagulants, vascular manipulation, or thrombolytic drug use.

Atheroembolic renal disease is caused by the occlusion of small arteries in the kidneys by cholesterol crystal emboli from ulcerated atherosclerotic plaques and is a part of systemic atheroembolism disease.
