Pulp and periodontal outcomes are influenced by factors related to the injury and subsequent treatment. Favorable outcomes of TDIs in the primary teeth are the absence of symptoms and normal healing of the pulp and periodontal tissues.

Favorable outcomes of pulp healing include a normal color of the crown or transient red/grey or yellow discoloration and pulp canal obliteration. There will be no signs of pulp necrosis and infection, and in immature teeth, root development will continue. Additional favorable outcomes include undisturbed development and eruption of the permanent successor teeth.

Unfavorable outcomes following TDI to primary teeth include the development of symptoms, signs of pulp necrosis such as sinus tract, gingival swelling, abscess, or increased mobility. Persistent dark grey discoloration with an additional sign of infection is an unfavorable outcome.

Various studies have looked at the prognosis of traumatized primary teeth. A study by Soprowski found that 57% of luxated primary teeth showed no post-trauma sequelae, 25% became necrotic, 10% demonstrated calcific degeneration, and 8% became ankylosed.

The clinician should record all favorable and unfavorable outcomes at the initial appointment and subsequent follow-up appointments.
