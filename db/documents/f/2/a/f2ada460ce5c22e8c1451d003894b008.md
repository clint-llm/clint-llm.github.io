Higher degrees of AV block than those seen from increased vagal tone often suggest some underlying pathology. This is known as a pathophysiologic AV block. About half of such cases are a result of chronic idiopathic fibrosis and sclerosis of the conduction system as seen in Lenegre’s disease

Another common source is ischemic heart disease which is responsible for around 40 percent of cases of AV block

AV block is also associated with cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and infiltrative conditions such as sarcoidosis and amyloidosis. Infectious causes such as Lyme disease, rheumatic fever, endocarditis, viruses as well as autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus should also be explored

Other potential triggers include cardiac surgery, medications, and inherited conditions
