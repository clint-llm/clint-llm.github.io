Meperidine has the same mechanism of action as morphine, which is acting as an agonist to the mu-opioid receptor. The anti-shivering effect may involve the stimulation of k-opioid receptors.

Meperidine also has some local anesthetic effects because of interactions with sodium ion channels. Also, meperidine has stimulant effects by inhibition of the dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET).
