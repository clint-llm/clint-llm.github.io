There is no specific treatment available forÂ Kikuchi disease. It is typically a self-limiting disease, and spontaneous resolution occurs within one to four, or one to six months. Treatment includes supportive management with antipyretics and analgesics, although some patients with severe disease may require a prolonged corticosteroid taper, after infectious etiology is ruled out. Other treatments that have been successful in the past include hydroxychloroquine, minocycline, or intravenous immunoglobulin
