Management of patients presenting for eye surgery in the perioperative period needs an interprofessional team of healthcare providers who share the responsibility of providing a safe and successful perioperative experience. This experience includes the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative time until discharge from the recovery room.

The preoperative nurse plays a crucial role in preparing the patient for surgery and obtaining intravenous access for medication delivery. The preoperative nurses are also instrumental in preparing documents for consent to surgery and anesthesia, which improves communication for all team members involved. The intraoperative nurses and surgical technicians play an essential role in preparing the equipment that is needed in the operating room to perform the surgery. Recovery room nurses assess the patient as they recover from surgery. They share the responsibility of monitoring the patient and observing any changes in clinical status. This interprofessional, patient centered-care has the ability to improve outcomes and enhance team performance, resulting in better patient outcomes.
