Delayed radiation injuries (soft tissue and bony necrosis) is a CMS-approved diagnosis for hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Depending on the individual patient diagnosis and the proposed surgery, the patient may receive from 20 to 60 hyperbaric oxygen treatments to treat and mitigate the symptoms of LERT. An interprofessional team of specialty trained hyperbaric nurse and clinician should monitor the patient during treatment. [Level V]
