**Approach to Therapy**

All patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and their families should receive education regarding lifestyle management. This includes a healthy diet, quitting smoking, and physical therapy/activity. Dietitians or nutritionists should advise patients and family members to reduce the amount of food with high cholesterol and encourage them to lose weight.

**Drug Therapies**

Statins are the standard therapy for familial hypercholesterolemia. All guidelines recommend statins as first-line drugs for patients with FH, with a goal of reaching maximally tolerated doses.

**Treatment Guidelines for Homozygous FH**

European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines for the screening and treatment of homozygous FH are summarized as follows:

- Treatment of homozygous FH involves a combination of lifestyle changes, statin therapy (first approach), and lipoprotein apheresis for severe cases

- LDL apheresis should begin as early as age 5 years

- For homozygous FH patients, the LDL cholesterol targets are less than 100 mg/dL for adults, less than 70 mg/dL for adults with clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), and less than 135 mg/dL for children

- Other novel agents for LDL cholesterol lowering (eg, lomitapide with or without apheresis) can be considered as adjunctive treatments for patients who do not achieve the recommended LDL cholesterol targets and remain at high cardiovascular risk.

**Treatment Guidelines for Heterozygous FH**

In patients with heterozygous FH, lifestyle modification is unlikely to result in acceptable LDLc levels; therefore, cholesterol-lowering medication is necessary. EAS consensus statement for screening and treatment of heterozygous FH includes the following recommendations:

- An LDL target of less than 135 mg/dL for children with FH

- An LDL target of less than 100 mg/dL for adults with FH

- An LDL target of less than 70 mg/dL for adults with known CHD or diabetes

- Lifestyle modifications include a diet that severely limits saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol

- Desirable weight should be attained

- Significant weight loss should improve all lipid parameters (LDLc, HDLc, triglycerides)

- Aerobic and toning exercises improve blood lipid levels if performed for longer than 30 minutes, 4 or more days per week

**Familial Hypercholesterolemia and Pregnancy**

Women with familial hypercholesterolemia planning to conceive should discontinue all lipid-lowering agents, including statins, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors. Cardiovascular risk assessment is recommended before conception. Lipoprotein apheresis may be used if necessary.

**Surgical Care**

- Liver transplantation for homozygous FH because a new liver provides functional LDL receptors and causes dramatic decreases in LDLc levels

- Portacaval anastomosis for homozygous FHT
