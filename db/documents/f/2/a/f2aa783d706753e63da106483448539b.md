Several conditions can present with a brief apneic event, but would not be categorized as BRUE if they fit into another definable diagnosis. Both upper and lower respiratory infections (e.g. Bronchiolitis, pertussis, pneumonia) can cause apneic events. Other conditions to consider include sepsis, meningitis, gastroesophageal reflux, seizures, infant botulism, prolonged QT syndrome, metabolic disorders, and child abuse.
