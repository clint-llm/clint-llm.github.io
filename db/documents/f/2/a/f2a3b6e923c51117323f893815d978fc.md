Along with the complications that accompany any procedure (i.e., infection, bleeding, scarring), there are several severe complications related directly to orchiopexy. These include:

- Testicular atrophy - the most devastating complication that can occur and is generally due to over-skeletonization during dissection

- Damage to or ligationÂ of the vas deferens - the vas deferens can be devascularized during dissection, it can also be unintentionally ligated or transected.

- The ascent of the testis - this can occur if the testis has become fixed in the scrotum under excessive tension, usually due to not freeing up the connective tissue around the spermatic cord appropriately.

- Infection - risks of infection include infection of both testes with bilateral orchiopexy, resulting in loss of both testes; for this reason, if the patient has bilateral UDT, each procedure is performed separately and several months apart.
