Histological examination reveals a dermal proliferation of small, blue cells in sheets or a trabecular array. The cells contain scant cytoplasm and round nuclei containing finely granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli. Numerous mitotic figures are typically visible, and the tumor may demonstrate vascular invasion, perineural invasion, or cellular necrosis. Immunohistochemistry differentiates MCC from other dermal, blue cell tumors such as lymphoma, Ewing sarcoma, neuroblastoma, melanoma, and small cell lung cancer. An appropriate immunopanel should be performed and preferably include cytokeratin-20, a low-molecular-weight intermediate filament, and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). MCC staining demonstrates positivity for cytokeratin-20 in a paranuclear dot pattern and is considered highly sensitive. Cells also demonstrate positivity for neuron-specific enolase, epithelial membrane antigen, CAM 5.2, and neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin and chromogranin. Importantly, cells are negative for TTF-1, S-100, and leukocyte-common antigen, which can help to distinguish MCC from the above-mentioned tumors.
