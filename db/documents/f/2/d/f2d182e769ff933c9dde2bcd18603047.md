Among C. trachomatis infections, only trachoma is diagnosable on clinical grounds. Other chlamydial infections are associated with specific clinical syndromes but require laboratory confirmation. The gold standard for diagnosis of urogenital chlamydia infections is nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). This test is run on either the vaginal swabs for women or first-catch urine for men. Testing can also be performed on endocervical or urethral swabs. Alternative methods of testing include culture, rapid testing, serology, antigen detection and genetic probes. If there is no testing available, treatment is recommended based on clinical presentation.
