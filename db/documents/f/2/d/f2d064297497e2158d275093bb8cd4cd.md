Differential diagnosis is made based on the presenting signs and symptoms. Other conditions presenting as chest pain and mimicking CAD could be musculoskeletal pains, pleural inflammation, diaphragmatic symptoms, GERD, dysphagia, panic attacks, and neuralgia from neck and shoulder. A careful initial evaluation should be done with these differentials in mind as other non-cardiac causes, as mentioned above, could be the reason for the patientâ€™s presentation.
