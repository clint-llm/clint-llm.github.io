Here, we review the toxicities caused by CAR-T cell therapy and summarize the clinical findings, grades, and management of the most relevant adverse events associated with CAR-T cell therapy.

The toxicity of CAR-T remains challenging. However, numerous safety measures have been implemented in clinical trials.

Management of CRS and ICANS requires frequent assessment and grading several times a day in addition to monitoring inflammatory markers such as ferritin and CRP. Aggressive supportive care is the cornerstone of managing all patients experiencing CAR T-cell toxicities, with early intervention for hypotension and treatment of concurrent infections being essential. IL-6 receptor blockade with tocilizumab remains the mainstay pharmacologic therapy for CRS, though indications for administration vary among centers. For FDA-approved CAR-T cell products, REMS requires prompt availability of at least two doses of tocilizumab per patient that can be administered within two hours of CAR-T infusion.

Corticosteroids should only be reserved for neurologic toxicities and CRS not responsive to tocilizumab. Pharmacologic management is complicated by the risk of immunosuppressive therapy abrogating the activity of the CAR-T cells.

**Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)**

Grading and management of CRS are derived from the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) consensus guidelines for CRS grading.

Symtpoms require symptomatic treatment only

- Fever, nausea, fatigue, headache, myalgia, malaise, etc., but no hypotension or hypoxia.

Symptoms require and respond to moderate intervention

- Fever (temperature ≥38°C), and

- Hypotension that doesn’t require vasopressors and/or

- Hypoxia on low-flow oxygen (O2) <40% FiO2.

- Supportive measures, similar to grade 1 CRS, IV fluid boluses, supplemental oxygenation, and

- Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg once (maximum dose: 800 mg [based on CAR-T cell CRS dosing]). If there is no clinical improvement in the signs and symptoms of CRS after the first dose, repeat tocilizumab every 8 hours as needed. Limit to a maximum of 3 doses in a 24-hour period and a total of 4 doses.

- Corticosteroids (dexamethasone 10 gm every 6 hours or methylprednisolone equivalent, that is 1 mg/kg twice daily) if no improvement within 24 hours of starting tocilizumab.

Symptoms require and respond to aggressive intervention

- Fever, and

- Hypotension that requires one vasopressor and/or

- Hypoxia that necessitates high-flow O2 (high-flow nasal cannula, mask, non-invasive ventilation) ≥40% FiO2.

- Supportive management similar to CRS grade 1 and intensive care unit (ICU) management with vasopressor support and/or supplemental oxygen, and

- Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg once (maximum dose: 800 mg [based on CAR-T cell CRS dosing]), plus

- Dexamethasone 10-20 mg IV every 6 h or methylprednisolone equivalent.

Life-threatening symptoms

- Fever, and

- Hypotension that requires multiple vasopressors and/or

- Hypoxia requiring positive pressure (e.g., CPAP, BiPAP, intubation, mechanical ventilation).

- Supportive management similar to CRS grade 1, ICU admission, vasopressor support, and/or supplemental O2 via the positive pressure method, and

- Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg once (maximum dose: 800 mg [based on CAR-T cell CRS dosing]), and

- Methylprednisolone 1000 mg/day for three days.

**Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS)**

The grading and proposed management of ICANS are according to and adapted from the ASTCT consensus guidelines for ICANS grading.

- Immune effector cell-associated encephalopathy (ICE) score 7-9.

- Awakens spontaneously.

- No motor findings or seizure-like activity.

- No signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or CNS edema.

- ICE 3-6.

- Awakens to a voice.

- No motor findings or seizure-like activity.

- No signs of increased ICP or CNS edema.

- Supportive management similar to ICANS grade 1.

- Consider dexamethasone 10 mg every 6 hours or methylprednisolone equivalent.

- ICE 0-2.

- Awakens only to tactile stimuli.

- Usually presents with a seizure that resolves rapidly, with/without interventions.

- There is usually focal or local edema on imaging.

- Supportive management similar to ICANS grade 1; consider transfer to ICU and airway protection.

- Dexamethasone 10-20 mg IV every 6 hours or methylprednisolone equivalent. If deterioration, increase steroids to that in grade 4.

- Control seizures with antiepileptics and status with benzodiazepines.

- ICE 0.

- Unarousable, stuporous, or in a coma, or requires vigorous stimuli to wake.

- Usually presents with prolonged life-threatening seizures (>5 min) or repetitive clinical or electrical seizures without returning to baseline. Additionally may have deep focal weakness, i.e., hemiparesis or paraparesis.

- Imaging shows diffuse cerebral edema. On physical examination, usually papilledema, decerebrate/decorticate posture, cranial nerve VI palsy, or Cushing’s triad (bradycardia, hypertension, and abnormal breathing).

- Supportive management similar to ICANS grade 1, transfer to ICU, and airway protection, e.g., by intubation and mechanical ventilation.

- High-dose methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day).

- Control seizures with antiepileptics.

- Lower elevated ICP with hyperventilation, hyperosmolar therapy, and/or neurosurgical intervention.

- If refractory, discuss agents such as siltuximab or anakinra, as detailed below.

Immune effector cell-associated encephalopathy (ICE) assessment adapted from ASTCT grading consensus guidelines:

**ICE Parameter**

**Task**

**Scoring point**

**Orientation**

Orientation to the year, month, city, and hospital

**Naming**

**Follow Commands**

Ability to follow simple commands

**Writing Ability**

**CRS and ICANS Refractory to the Above Treatment**

If despite the use of tocilizumab and corticosteroids, patients with CRS and ICANS continue to worsen, siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody, binds to  IL-6, thus preventing it from binding to the IL-6 receptors.

**Cytopenias**

Mostly, cytopenias resolve over time. Bone marrow biopsy is recommended in patients with prolonged or delayed cytopenias to evaluate for secondary bone marrow malignancy.

**Tumor Lysis Syndrome**

Management involves frequent hydration and the use of uric acid-lowering agents (allopurinol, rasburicase, and febuxostat) as per the standard guidelines for chemotherapy.

**Hypogammaglobulinema Due to B-Cell Aplasia**

Long-term follow-up is essential to assess the need for IgG replacement.

**Infections**

Patients with fevers and neutropenia should have blood cultures drawn and broad-spectrum antibiotics initiated.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or alternative agents are recommended for pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) starting before conditioning chemotherapy and is usually continued until CD4 reaches more than 200/ml.

**Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis**

Treatment usually involves corticosteroids and tocilizumab if co-existent with CRS. In refractory cases or if independent of CRS, treatment with etoposide and intrathecal methotrexate or cytarabine has been suggested. Additionally, anakinra has also been proposed but needs further evaluation.
