There is currently no vaccine available for any of the Borrelia species associated with relapsing fever. Avoidance of louse and tick exposure through proper hygiene, environmental cleaning to remove rodent nesting material and insect repellant can decrease the risk of infection. As transmission is typically vector-borne, standard precautions are recommended, and isolation is not required other than the eradication of body lice.
