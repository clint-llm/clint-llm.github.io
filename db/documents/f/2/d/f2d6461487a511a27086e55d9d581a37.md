Primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that primarily involves the liver, as opposed to a predominant lymph nodal or splenic involvement in other subtypes of NHL. The liver is the major reticuloendothelial organ, and hepatic involvement secondary to systemic NHL is common, such that 40% of patients with NHL have liver involvement.

Primary hepatic lymphoma may often confound with other space-occupying liver lesions, namely hepatocellular carcinoma, hepatic adenoma, focal hyperplasia of the liver, and hepatic hemangioma. At times a hepatologist must address the rare possibility of PHL besides the common notably, hepatocellular carcinoma while approaching the space-occupying lesions of the liver.
