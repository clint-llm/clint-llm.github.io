The diagnosis of ureterolithiasis can usually be made by a thorough history and physical exam. Additional testing may be utilized to rule out serious complications of renal calculi such as an infected or obstructing stone, or pyelonephritis. Testing may be utilized to "rule out" ureterolithiasis mimics such as a renal abscess, mass, abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, the diagnosis may be aided by one or more of the following tests: complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), urinalysis, renal ultrasound, radiographs, and/or CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. On urinalysis, Â RBCs will often be present. However, when WBCs, leukocyte esterase, and/or bacteria are present, this may indicate a more serious condition specifically infected renal calculus. If possible, an evaluation of the stone composition may be performed in the outpatient or inpatient setting.

A 24-hour urine collection may be collected to evaluate urea, creatinine, uric acid, oxalate, citrate, calcium, phosphate, urine pH, urine volume, cultures. A comprehensive metabolic panel may be performed to check for renal function abnormalities, which may indicate an obstructing renal calculus. CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast imaging is the gold standard to diagnose ureterolithiasis and can characterize the size and location of the stone and thus its likelihood to pass on its own.
