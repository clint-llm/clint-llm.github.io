Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis is thought to be caused by an onconeural antibody to cancer that cross-reacts with self-antigen in the neurons and muscles. It is is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that affects the medial temporal lobe and may present with cognitive dysfunction, change in personality, seizure, irritability, hallucinations, disorientation, limbic paresis, and/ or disruption of consciousness and short-term memory loss. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.
- Review the management options available for paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and management of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis and improve patient outcomes.
