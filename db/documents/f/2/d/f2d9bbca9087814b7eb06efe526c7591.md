An interprofessional team approach between eye specialists, primary care clinicians, and endocrinologists, if thyroid-related, is essential in coordinating the best outcomes for patients with exophthalmos. Regular monitoring of visual function is necessary for prognosis. Shared decision-making in the management planning of a patient's care provides maximum benefit in line with the patient's ideas, concerns, and expectations. Synergistic collaboration with the patient on their health will lead to more favorable outcomes.
