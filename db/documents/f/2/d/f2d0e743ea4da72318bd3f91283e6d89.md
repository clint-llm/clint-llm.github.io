Patients presenting with a headache originating at the posterior skull base should be evaluated for ON. This condition typically presents as a paroxysmal, lancinating, or stabbing pain lasting from seconds to minutes, and therefore a continuous, aching pain likely indicates a different diagnosis. ICHD-3 criteria require that the patient also have tenderness, dysesthesia, or allodynia over the area affected. A positive Tinelâ€™s sign may be present over the nerve's distribution, especially where the GON emerges at the base of the skull over the greater occipital notch. Pain may be unilateral or bilateral but almost always begins unilaterally and may extend into a bilateral distribution over time. Bilateral symptoms are present in one-third of cases.
