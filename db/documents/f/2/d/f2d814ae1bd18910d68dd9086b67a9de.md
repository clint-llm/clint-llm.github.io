The blood supply to the gluteus minimus is supplied by the superior gluteal artery, which arises from the posterior division of the internal iliac artery. As the superiorÂ gluteal artery leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen above the piriformis, it passes posteriorly between the S1 nerve and lumbosacral trunk, dividing into the superficial and deep branches. The deep branch of the superior gluteal artery supplies the gluteus minimus. Following the superior gluteal artery to its most distal point, it then anastomoses with the medial circumflex femoral arteries.
