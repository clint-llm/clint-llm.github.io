There is evidence that severe RSV infection and hospitalization for RSV early in life raise the risk for the development of recurrent wheezing, childhood asthma, and allergic sensitization. Moreover, there is someÂ evidence that palivizumab prophylaxis may decrease the incidence of later recurrent wheezing in treated subjects. However, the extent, duration, and mechanism of a link between RSV and asthma has not been fully elucidated and remains a subject of vigorous research.
