Before diagnosingÂ tyrosine kinase inhibitor keratitis, other etiologies of keratitis should be taken into consideration. Microbiological tests such as a Gram stain and a Giemsa stain are routinely used to confirm the presence of either a bacterial or fungal organism in patients found to have a break in the epithelium. Viral keratitis is diagnosed clinically, but a PCR can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Infectious keratitis will commonly present with decreased vision, redness, pain, watering, and photophobia.

Bacterial keratitis (BK) has a strong association with contact lens wear. It is the most common etiology of infectious keratitis. Patients may have stromal melting, ground glass appearance infiltrates with well-defined borders and hypopyon. Patients with BK have ulcerations that progress rapidly compared to fungal or viral keratitis. This infectious etiology can be diagnosed clinically in 69% of cases, with gram staining often being done to confirm the diagnosis.

Fungal keratitis (FK) incidence rates differ depending on geographical location. In temperate climates, FK makes up a marginal percentage of infectious keratitis cases. However, in tropical areas, FK consists of more than 50% of confirmed infectious keratitis cases.

The most common type of viral keratitis (VK) is herpetic keratitis (HK). It can be recurrent and chronic. About half a million people in the U.S and 1.5 million around the world are diagnosed with HK.
