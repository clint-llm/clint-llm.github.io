Patients may exhibit non-dose dependent or dose-dependent side effects while undergoing treatment with mercaptopurine. Allergic reactions such as nausea, fever, rash, flu-like symptoms, and arthralgias are considered non-dose-dependent symptoms that may require changing the timing of dosing to night-time administration or discontinuation of therapy.

These symptoms may also reoccur in patients reintroduced to azathioprine or mercaptopurine after an initial adverse reaction.

Dose-dependent adverse reactions that are potentially observable with 6MP are

- Jaundice

- Pancreatitis (3.3%)

- Myelosuppression (2 to 15%)

- Elevation of transaminases (30%)

- Drug hepatitis (0.3%)

- Hepatotoxicity

- Nodular regenerative hyperplasia and veno-occlusive disease

- Leukopenia

- Myelosuppression with high levels of 6TGN (2 to 15%)

- EB virus-positive lymphoma

- Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL)

There are various forms of hepatotoxicity resulting from both acute and chronic mercaptopurine intake. Acute liver injury is usually observed as elevated liver enzymes with fatigue and jaundice within one to six months after starting therapy. The liver biopsy depicts mixed hepatocellular-cholestatic injury with cholestasis, focal hepatocellular necrosis, bile duct injury, and variable inflammation.

In chronic therapy, nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) and symptomatic portal hypertension with ascites and varices were observed from six months to several years after starting therapy. This condition physically presented itself in patients as ascites, varices, mild liver enzyme abnormalities, and jaundice. It is a cause of concern because it can progress to hepatic failure if 6MP therapy is not discontinued.

Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) is a rare complication with a high mortality rate reported in men with inflammatory bowel disease who have been immunosuppressed long term with thiopurines such as mercaptopurine with or without anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy. They present with fatigue, fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. Diagnosis is from either bone marrow or liver biopsy showing marked infiltration with malignant T cells.

Also, NUDT15 correlates with thiopurine-induced myelosuppression.

It is important to note that switching from 6MP to AZA does not reduce the risk of side effects.
