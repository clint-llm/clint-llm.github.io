Indocyanine green angiography is an important invasive imaging modality among many diagnostic imaging modalities used in retinochoroidal diseases. It helps to study the anatomy, physiology, and pathology of choroidal and retinal circulation. It has an important role in the diagnosis of various ocular pathologies. This activity describes the anatomy of choroidal circulation and reviews the techniques and interpretation of indocyanine green angiography. It also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in monitoring the patient and managing adverse events during the procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy and physiology of choroidal circulation.
- Review the personnel, equipment, preparation, and technique of indocyanine green angiography.
- Outline the characteristics of various retinal and choroidal diseases on an indocyanine green angiogram.
- Explain the importance of the availability of an interprofessional team for monitoring the patient and managing complications during indocyanine green angiography.
