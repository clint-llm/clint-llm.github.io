Care must be taken during anesthesia, particularly with depolarizing muscle relaxants, which are associated with adverse events in MC patients such a profound muscle spasm and difficulties in secondary ventilation.

- Suxamethonium- may produce a profound muscle spasm and ventilation difficulties.

- Adrenaline and beta-agonists-can cause aggravation of symptoms

- Beta antagonist-can potentially increase the severity of symptoms.

- Colchicine- can trigger myopathy, especially in individuals with renal insufficiency.

Pregnancy has been associated with the worsening of MC; therefore,Â an interprofessional team is essential throughout gestation, birth, and the postpartum period.
