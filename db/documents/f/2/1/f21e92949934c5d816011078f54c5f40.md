The prognosis of PH is highly variable and depends upon the etiology and severity of PH.

- Etiology of PH: In general, in the absence of therapy, those with group 1 PAH have worse survival than groups 2 through 5. However, with therapy, patients with chronic thromboembolic PH (CTEPH; group 4), particularly surgically correctable CTEPH tend to have the best survival. Compared with those who had PAH, those with chronic lung disease associated PH (group 3) had worse survival at one year (80% versus 88%), 3 years (52% versus 72%), and 5 years (38% versus 59%). Patients with group 2 PH had similar survival rates to those with PAH.

- The severity of PH: In general, severe PH (e.g., mean pulmonary arterial pressure 35 mm Hg or greater), and/ or evidence of right heart failure have a poor prognosis.

While the clinical setting, particularly concomitant cardiovascular disease, influences survival in patients with TR, severe TR is an independent predictor of mortality.
