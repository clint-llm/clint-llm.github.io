A PR interval of greater than 0.20 seconds on a surface ECG, without associated disruption of atrial to ventricular conduction, is diagnostic of first-degree AV block. When the clinician identifies this on ECG, they should query patients about the presence ofÂ pre-existing heart disease (acquired or congenital) and family history of heart disease. Patients with heart disease or with a family history of heart disease warrant investigation for organic causes of the PR interval prolongation.
