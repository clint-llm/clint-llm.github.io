An issue of concern that should be addressed when discussing the concept of fever is understanding that the site of measurement influences body temperature readings. The average axillary temperature reading is 35.97 degrees C (96.75 degrees F), oral is 36.57 degrees C (97.83 degrees F), urine is 36.61 degrees C (97.90 degrees C), tympanic is 36.64 degrees C (97.95 degrees F), and rectal is 37.04 degrees C (98.67 degrees F).

It is also important to consider the patient's normal baseline body temperature. If a patient typically runs "cold" or "hot," then their baseline body temperature may be decreased or elevated above what is considered "normal" and does not necessarily indicate a fever or febrile illness.

A final issue of concern is that, while patients can state they have a fever because they "feel warm," it is noted that the diagnosis of fever based on palpation is unreliable and inaccurate in up to 40% of individuals. If a fever is suspected, an official reading should be obtained.
