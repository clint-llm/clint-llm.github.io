There are several over-the-counter devices to remove cerumen that patients should be advised not to purchase. Cotton swabs are commonly used but should be avoided, as they may worsen the impaction or cause a perforation of the tympanic membrane. Another common home remedy is ear candling. This involves a hollow tube coated in beeswax; one end is inserted into the ear canal, and the other is ignited. It is falsely claimed to have a "chimney effect," created by theÂ pull of air from the ignited candle. The United States Food and Drug Administration strongly recommends against using this device because it has not been shown to be effective in scientific studies but does carry the potential for injury.
