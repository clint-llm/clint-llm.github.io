Several conditions have been mistaken for this disease, and an extensive workup and a vigilant clinician are required for correct diagnosis. Due to the rarity of this condition and the absence of highly sensitive/specific diagnostic tools, endocardial fibroelastosis is a diagnosis of exclusion. The following conditions have been reported in the literature so far and should be ruled out in suspected cases of EFE.

- Cardiomyopathies: Dilated, hypertrophic (Noonan syndrome), restrictive, Barth syndrome

- Congenital malformations: Aortic stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, ALCAPA, hypoplastic left heart syndrome

- Viral myocarditis:****Mumps, coxsackie, adenovirus

- Lysosomal storage diseases: Pompe, Hurler, Niemann-Pick

- Other: Systemic carnitine deficiency, myocardial infarction

Rare disorders like fibroplastic parietal endocarditis, cardiovascular collagenosis, and endomyocardial fibrosis should also be included in differential diagnoses.
