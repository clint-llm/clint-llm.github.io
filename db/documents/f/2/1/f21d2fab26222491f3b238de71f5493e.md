Intoxication degree is of utmost importance for understanding lithium toxicity diagnosis and management.

The severity of lithium toxicity is often divided into the following three grades: mild, moderate, and severe.

- **Mild symptoms**: nausea, vomiting, lethargy, tremor, and fatigue (Serum lithium concentration between 1.5-2.5 mEq/L)

- **Moderate intoxication:**confusion, agitation, delirium, tachycardia, and hypertonia (serum lithium concentration between 2.5-3.5 mEq/L)

- **Severe intoxication**: Coma, seizures, hyperthermia, and hypotension (serum lithium concentration (more than 3.5 mEq/L)
