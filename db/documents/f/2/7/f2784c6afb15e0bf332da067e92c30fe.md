**In renal Insufficiency**

- Specific drugs are notably useful

- Any medication can be administered to any patient since the clinician can adjust the dose, considering the appropriate pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.

On the other hand, some medications apply their effects independently. Without deteriorating renal function, so it is often appropriate for physicians to find and administer those drugs when necessary.

Factors and conditions that may worsen the renal injury and thus should be either avoided or resolved are:

- Nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, iodinated contrast)

- Uncontrolled diabetes

- Systemic hypertension

- Proteinuria

- Dehydration

- Smoking

- Hyperlipidemia

- Hyperphosphatemia
