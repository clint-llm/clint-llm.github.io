The etiology of ischemic stroke is due to either a thrombotic or embolic event that causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain. In a thrombotic event, the blood flow to the brain is obstructed within the blood vessel due to dysfunction within the vessel itself, usually secondary to atherosclerotic disease, arterial dissection, fibromuscular dysplasia, or inflammatory condition. In an embolic event, debris from elsewhere in the body blocks blood flow through the affected vessel. The etiology of stroke affects both prognosis and outcomes.
