General surgical complications such as recurrent volvulus, early postoperative small bowel obstruction from adhesive bands, wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, and aspiration pneumonia due to nasogastric tube placement for bowel decompression.

Additional complications of bowel loss resulting in short bowel syndrome and vitamin deficiencies due to bowel loss.

Short bowel syndrome is treated with anti-diarrheal agents, nutritional therapy, which includes small, high protein diets, additional hydration, vitamins, and minerals replacement in addition to possible parenteral nutrition if the length of the bowel is too short or is undergoing rehabilitation. Autologous bowel reconstruction and small bowel transplantation are considered as a last resort option.
