Complications of any shoulder dislocation include fracture and neurovascular injury. However, in contrast to anterior dislocations, neurovascular injuries are less common due to the anterior location of the neurovascular structures and the posterior location of the humeral head in this type of dislocation. Soft tissue injuries such as rotator cuff tears are also common, especially in the elderly. Reverse Hill-Sachs deformities, reverse Bankart lesions, and glenoid rim fractures are associated with an increased incidence of recurrence and prolonged recovery. Proper referral to an orthopedist or specialist in shoulder injury should be ensured to avoid the long-term complications that can be associated with posterior shoulder dislocations.
