Low back pain (LBP) is a very common and disabling disorder. Many causes of low back pain differ depending on the patient population; mechanical conditions are the most common ones, including facet joint disease, discogenic pain, spinal stenosis, disc herniations, and spondylolysis.Â  Discogenic pain accounts for 30 to 40% of patients with LBP, and multiple interventional therapies have been developed to treat this condition.

Intradiscal electrothermal therapy (IDET) is a minimally invasive surgical (MIS) procedure for the treatment of discogenic chronic low back pain. The technique involves applying heat to the annulus fibrosus through a catheter with a temperature-controlled thermal resistive heating coil. The goal of thermal disc treatment is to damage the nerve fibers, shrink collagen, and stiffen the disc tissue; this might seal any small tears and limit the expression of matrix components.
