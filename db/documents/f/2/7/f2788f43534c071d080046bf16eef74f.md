The hallmark of this syndrome is a pain, which can be described as sharp, shooting, stabbing, boring, severe, and intense. Pain is usually located in the periorbital region but can often be retro-orbital, with extension into the frontal and temporal areas. Pain tends to be the presenting symptom and can precede ophthalmoplegia by up to 30 days. Tolosa Hunt syndrome tends to have a relapsing and remitting course, with attacks recurring every few months or years. Other associated features include involvement of all three ocular motor nerves (which include oculomotor, trochlear, abducens nerves) in different combinations, leading to ophthalmoplegia. Ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve is commonly affected. The oculomotor nerve is most commonly involved (approximately 80%), followed by abducens nerve (approximately 70%), an ophthalmic branch of trigeminal nerve (approximately 30%), and trochlear nerve (approximately 29%).

Tolosa Hunt syndrome usually does not have any other neurological or systemic involvement.
