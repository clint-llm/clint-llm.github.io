Hand splints are used to treat many disorders and can be effective for symptom relief. However, all healthcare workers including therapists and nurses who apply hand splints should ensure that the patient has close followu up. Hand splints can be associated with many complications, which if neglected can lead to malpractice litigation. At discharge the patient should be provided with thorough instructions on follow up, symptoms to observe and when to retrun to the emergency department.
