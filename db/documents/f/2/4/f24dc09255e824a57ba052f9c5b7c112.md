Klippel Trenaunay syndrome primarily involves the capillary, venous and lymphatic systems to varying degrees with tissue and bone hypertrophy. This condition predominantly affects the lower limbs and unilaterally affects the right and left sides equally. In rare cases, upper extremity, head and neck area, and bilateral involvement may be seen.

Venous malformations are seen in 70 to 100% of patients and consist of varicosities in the superficial and deep venous systems, persistent embryonic veins, and aplasia/hypoplasia with valvular incompetence. The embryonic veins, which usually regress prior to birth, are persistent and are functionally incompetent leading to venous stasis and chronic thrombosis. Venous malformations can occur in the GI tract, especially in the colon, and can present with GI bleeds. On exam, dilated tortuous veins can be seen in the affected limb with swelling and discoloration. Patients can also present with recurrent deep vein thrombosis, leading to pulmonary embolism.

Lymphatic malformations are seen in 15 to 50% of cases and consist of lymphedema and cystic lymphatic collections.
