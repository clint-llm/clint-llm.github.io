**Monitoring for Adverse Reaction**

Patients should be assessed at the infusion center before the infusion. The high-risk category patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 disease are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 illness and may not qualify for the infusion.

Those who meet the criteria for infusion should be observed for any hypersensitivity reaction or infusion-related reaction mentioned above during the infusion time and at least 1-hour post-infusion. Patients should also be advised to watch out for any symptoms for at least seven days post-infusion.

As bamlanivimab is not metabolized by cytochrome 450 enzymes or renally excreted, concomitant drug interactions are very unlikely.

**Monitoring for Drug Resistance**

There is a potential risk for treatment failure due to emerging variants that are resistant to the combination drug. The combination drug does notÂ have activity against the Omicron variant. Updates regarding the resistance trends and authorized use of combination therapy can be accessed via the U.S department of health and human services website and the CDC website.
