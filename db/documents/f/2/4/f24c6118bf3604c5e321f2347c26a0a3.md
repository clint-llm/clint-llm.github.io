Measles has been and is currently responsible for a large number of deaths worldwide, mainly in children under five years of age in countries that do not apply the measles vaccine. Therefore, the best way to prevent measles and ultimately achieve its worldwide eradication is through vaccination.

The diagnosis and management of measles require an interprofessional approach to avoid complications from underrecognition of measles and avoiding the person-to-person spread of this virus. This requires collaboration with bedside nursing, infection control, and infectious disease specialists to initiate and maintain airborne precautions.
