Equipment used to optimize exposure is key to achieving an oncologic resection.

- Adequate lighting is important in the oral cavity. A headlight is recommended to allow additional light into the oral cavity.

- Mouth gags, bite blocks, and lip retractors are essential to free the hands of the surgeon and assistants.

- Mouth gags can be used in conjunction with a bite block or cheek/lip retractor.

- Traction sutures (e.g., 2.0 or 3.0 silk) or locking fine-tipped forceps can help deliver the tongue out of the mouth for additional exposure.

For mucosal and muscle cuts, electrocautery can provide hemostasis. However, excessive cautery can affect margin interpretation. Cold dissection can be done with bipolar cautery for hemostasis. The CO2 laser offers the advantage over cautery of limiting collateral tissue damage and preserving margin interpretation but offers limited hemostasis by itself.

If mandibulotomy or mandibulectomy is planned, bone cutting instruments will be needed, as well as a mandibular plating set to reconstruct the jaw after the glossectomy is completed.
