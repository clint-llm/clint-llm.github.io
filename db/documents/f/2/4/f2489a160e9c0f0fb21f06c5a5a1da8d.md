Parinaud syndrome is classically described by the triad of upgaze palsy, convergence retraction nystagmus, and pupillary hyporeflexia.

The signs of Parinaud syndrome include:

- Paralysis of vertical gaze, especially conjugate upgaze palsy. Sometimes there may be combined upgaze and downgaze palsy, and rarely there could be only downgaze palsy. The vestibule-ocular reflex is classically spared

- Convergence retraction nystagmus, which is best elicited using a downwardly moving optokinetic nystagmus drum.

- Loss of pupillary light reflexes (Light Near-dissociation)

- Loss of convergence is seen in less than a quarter of patients

- Upper eyelid retraction (Collier's "tucked lid" sign) seen in approximately 40% of patients

- There could be a conjugate downgaze in the primary position, called the "setting sun" sign
