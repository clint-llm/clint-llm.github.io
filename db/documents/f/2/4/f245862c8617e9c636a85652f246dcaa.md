Familiarity with the various effects of phthalate toxicity is an essential component of patient education. As new evidence for the specific pathological effects of phthalates arises, it will become increasingly important for healthcare teams to stay up to date and educate patients and colleagues about the impact and potential exposure media leading to phthalate toxicity. This is especially important in the healthcare setting, as many medical devices directly related to patient care contain phthalates as plasticizing agents, as mentioned above. This evidence may be used to elicit future changes in medical device usage in the interest of patient care, especially regarding exposure in pregnancy, based on the evidence available for developmental consequences to the fetus.

All members of the interprofessional healthcare team should have some familiarity with phthalate toxicity signs and symptoms and immediately alert the appropriate clinical resources and public health officials to address the situation.

Public awareness of the dangers associated with phthalate exposure will also necessitate the development of industry alternatives used as plasticizing agents. Public education and awareness will hopefully give rise to regulations and other legislative changes regarding the use and production of various phthalates that have been shown to have consequential effects on both human physiology and the environment.
