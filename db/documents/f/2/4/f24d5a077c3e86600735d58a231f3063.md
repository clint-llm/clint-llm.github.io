Biliary obstruction encompasses many separate conditions that result in a typical clinical finding of elevated bilirubin. Patients may first present to their primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, or an emergency department for treatment. A prompt initial diagnosis helps drive therapy and improve outcomes in most patients. Special attention is necessary for timely diagnosis of infection of the bile ducts where patients present with fever, sepsis, and biliary obstruction findings, which can lead to poor prognosis.  Initial laboratory and radiographic assessment will determine the proper specialty needed to treat the obstruction, whether general surgery, gastroenterology, oncology, or interventional radiology.

Management of biliary obstruction requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team comprised of clinicians (including PAs and NPs), specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating and communicating across disciplinary boundaries to achieve improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
