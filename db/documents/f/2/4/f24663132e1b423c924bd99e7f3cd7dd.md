Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used for the removal of a diseased gallbladder. Since the early 1990s, this technique has largely replaced the open technique for cholecystectomies. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is currently indicated for the treatment of acute or chronic cholecystitis, symptomatic cholelithiasis, biliary dyskinesia, acalculous cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, and gallbladder masses or polyps. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and potential complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with gall bladder disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
- Review the technique for performing a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
- Summarize the complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
- Explain why careful planning and discussion amongst the interprofessional team members involved in the management of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy will improve outcomes.
