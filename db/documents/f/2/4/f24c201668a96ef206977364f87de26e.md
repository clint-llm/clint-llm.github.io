In the last two decades, children with X-linked agammaglobulinemia from developed countries have shown significant improvement in their overall prognosis and survival rate. This can be attributed to early diagnosis, prompt and judicious use of antibiotics, along with regular administration of immunoglobulins. With these modalities, patients with XLA are now surviving beyond adolescence into adulthood. The adults and children with XLA mostly live productive and fulfilling lives, despite the fact that they have more absences from school/work and are hospitalized more often than males in the general population.

Despite the monthly immunoglobulin replacement, approximately 10% of patients with XLA suffer from severe infections or chronic lung disease. The bronchiectasis is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity.

Unfortunately, in developing countries, the fate of patients with XLA is still poor. A significant percentage of children die before the diagnosis has been established while the remainder has permanent lung damage at the time of diagnosis.
