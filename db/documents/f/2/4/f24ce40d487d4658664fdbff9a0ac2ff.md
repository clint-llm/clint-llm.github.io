Due to the risks ofÂ short bowel syndrome from multiple abdominal surgeries and removal of strictured bowel and its associated nutritional deficiencies, this has led to increased use of bowel sparing techniques such as stricturoplasty. Not all patients are candidates for stricturoplasty. Originally, stricturoplasty could only be performed in short length stricture; however, recently, this idea has been challenged. Now the length of the stricture is not the primary variable when planning stricturoplasty except when determining which type of operative approach to proceed with.

The following is a list of indications for stricturoplasty:

- Multiple strictures over the large length of bowel

- Previous significant small bowel resection

- Patient with short bowel syndrome

- Stricture without associated phlegmon or fistula

- Crohn disease recurrence with obstructive symptoms

- Stricture without sepsis
