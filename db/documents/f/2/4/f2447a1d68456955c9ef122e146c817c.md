Protein C deficiency is a rare disorder, characterized by a reduction in the activity of protein C, a plasma serine protease involved in the regulation of blood coagulation. The active form of protein C, activated protein C (APC), exerts potent anticoagulant activity.Â A deficiency in protein C is characterized by the inability to control coagulation, resulting in the excessive formation of blood clots (thrombophilia).
