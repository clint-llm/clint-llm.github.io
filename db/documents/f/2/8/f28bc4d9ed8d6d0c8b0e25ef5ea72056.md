Patients taking candesartan should have their blood pressure routinely measured to assess for adequate blood pressure response to the medication. Additionally, clinicians should monitor patients for adverse effects of symptomatic hypotension, including dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, syncope, and fatigue.

Hyperkalemia and impaired renal function can occur with candesartan use. Therefore, serum potassium and renal function should receive periodic monitoring.
