Hypoaldosteronism is a clinical condition characterized by a deficiency of aldosterone or its impaired action at the tissue level. The disorder may result from disturbances in renal renin production and secretion, conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, adrenal aldosterone synthesis and secretion, or from abnormal responsiveness of the target tissues to aldosterone. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of hypoaldosteronism and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hypoaldosteronism in both children and adults. 
- Describe the pathophysiology of hypoaldosteronism in various age groups.
- Summarize the management of hypoaldosteronism in infants, children, and older adults.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate testing and treatment strategies for hypoaldosteronism to improve patient outcomes.
