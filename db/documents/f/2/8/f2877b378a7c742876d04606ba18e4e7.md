Treatment for acute IgE mediated reaction to penicillin depends on severity. Patients presenting in acute anaphylaxis need to have immediate treatment with IM epinephrine (1 mg/ml) 0.3 mg to 0.5 mg every 5 to 15 minutes until resolution of symptoms. Adjunctive therapies include H1 and H2 antihistamines including diphenhydramine 25 mg to 50 mg intravenously (IV) and ranitidine 50 mg IV, respectively. Glucocorticoids should also be administered such as 125 mg methylprednisone. Patients with refractory symptoms should be treated with an infusion of epinephrine at 0.1 mcg/kg/minute. All patients presenting with acute anaphylaxis should be immediately placed on telemetry monitoring with large-bore IV for IVF resuscitation at 1 L to 2 L NS bolus. If patients are experiencing bronchospasm, albuterol 2.5 mg to 5 mg can also be considered. These patients require admission to the hospital. Patients with a resolution of symptoms after a period of observation are safe for discharge.

For those patients presenting with mild reactions and have cutaneous findings only, treatment with an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine is adequate.

For patients with a true Type 1 IgE mediated penicillin allergy, another antibiotic should be used for treatment. If there is not another equally as efficacious antibiotic, patient's should undergo drug desensitization. The process of desensitization involves subcutaneous, intravenous, or oral administration of incrementally higher doses of the drug every 15 to 30 minutes until the patient tolerates the entire dose. For patients with histories of severe IgE mediated reactions, initial doses should be between 1/1,000,000 and 1/10,000 of the full therapeutic dose. Success rates for desensitization can reach up to 100%. Drug desensitization is again contraindicated in patients with severe non-IgE-mediated reactions such as SJS or TEN.
