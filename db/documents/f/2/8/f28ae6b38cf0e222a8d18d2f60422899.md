Currently, there is no standard treatment for Wernicke’s aphasia. Speech and language therapy is the mainstay of care for patients with aphasia. Because comprehension is impaired, patients may lack insight into their deficit. This makes remediation efforts very challenging. A care plan developed with a speech therapist, neuropsychologist, and neurologist would be the best way to try to optimize patient outcome. The treatment plan aims to allow the patient to better use remaining language function, improve language skill, and communicate in alternative ways so that their wants and needs can be addressed. Group therapy can give patients a chance to practice their communication skills and may lead to decreased feels of social isolation. Many commercial software vendors claim that their products will improve language function. However, these products, for the most part, have not been thoroughly vetted with rigorous clinical trials.

Researchers are currently studying medical treatment of aphasia in randomized clinical trials. They are also developing pharmacological treatments that include drugs that affect the catecholaminergic system (bromocriptine, levodopa, amantadine, dexamphetamine), nootropic drugs such as piracetam, and medications used to treat Alzheimer Disease such as donepezil and memantine. Non-pharmacological approaches include transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct stimulation. Trials to date have been small with mixed results. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of these approaches.

When the cause of Wernicke’s aphasia is a stroke, recovery of language function peaks within two to six months, after which time further progress is limited. However, efforts should be made to try to improve communication, since an improvement in aphasia has been documented long after a stroke. Family support and social support are essential to a good outcome. Treatment of post-stroke depression and post-stroke cognitive issues, as well as remediation of other neurological disorders such as neglect, agnosia, and hemiparesis, should be addressed during rehabilitation to optimize patient outcome.
