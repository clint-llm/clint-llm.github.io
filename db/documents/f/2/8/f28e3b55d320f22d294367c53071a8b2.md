Because of the comprehensive nature of this procedure and the fact that facelifting is often accompanied by other cosmetic surgical procedures, such as blepharoplasty, liposuction, skin resurfacing, and/or brow lifting, general anesthesia or at least deep sedation is preferred. In addition to the anesthesia provider, an operating room nurse and a surgical technician are required, and a first assistant will make the surgeon's job much easier. Postoperatively, outpatient nursing staff will be critical for wound care, suture removal, and patient support, without which the outcomes will be suboptimal.
