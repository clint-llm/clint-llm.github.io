Treatment of Raynaud phenomenon aims at decreasing the frequency and severity of the attacks with prevention of tissue ischemia. Treatment response is measured by the Raynaud Condition Score (RCS). This scoring system looks at the quality of life, frequency and severity of attacks, and the effect of Raynaud phenomenon on an individual.

Conservative medical management to prevent Raynaud phenomenon attacks is a lifestyle change. This includes avoiding exposure to cold, staying warm, avoiding stimulants, avoiding anxiety or emotional stress, and smoking cessation.

If the patient fails to respond to only conservative therapy, then pharmacologic therapy with a vasodilating mechanism of action is used. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (DHP CCBs) are the first-line pharmacologic treatment for Raynaud phenomenon. DHP CCBs include amlodipine and nifedipine. When starting CCBs, the medication is started at the lowest dose and gradually titrated every 4 weeks depending on the patient's response. Monitoring blood pressure response is important, particularly if the patient has baseline blood pressures that are low.

1. Amlodipine dosage: Minimum 5 mg to maximum 20 mg daily

2. Nifedipine dosage: Minimum 30 mg to maximum 180 mg daily

The medication may be administered as either slow-release form, rapid or short-acting form, or long-acting form. Typically, the slow-release or long-acting forms of CCBs are used. An urgent situation prompts the use of a rapid, short-acting form of CCB, which is used more frequently in patients with severe form of Raynaud phenomenon.

Adverse effects of DHP CCB includes dose-related peripheral edema, palpitations, reflex tachycardia, dose-related dizziness, and headaches.

Contraindications to DHP CCB are hypotension, peripheral edema, angina, myocardial infarction. It should also be avoided in patients with severe aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and severe pulmonary hypertension.

CCBs should be avoided in pregnancy unless digit ischemia is present.

If the patient fails to respond to DHP CCB therapy, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor. It can be added to the current CCB therapy if partial treatment response is noted to the CCB. If there is no treatment response to the CCB, then the PDE inhibitor can be used as monotherapy. Sildenafil is started at a low dose, 20 mg daily, and then titrated depending on response over a period of 4 to 6 weeks with a maximum dose of 20 mg 3 times a day.

Alternative therapy to treatment failure using CCB and PDE inhibitor is topical nitrates, such as nitroglycerin, which is a direct vasodilator. Typically, 2% nitroglycerin ointment is used and applied to affected Raynaud phenomenon areas. Topical nitrates are absorbed systemically and may result in adverse systemic effects, such as hypotension, dizziness, and headache.

Other options, if the patient does not respond to the above therapies, include the following: losartan, fluoxetine, and prazosin.

If tissue ischemia is present in the digits and symptoms are severe, then intravenous infusion of prostaglandin is used. Different intravenous prostaglandins include iloprost, epoprostenol, treprostinil, and alprostadil. Prostaglandin functions as a strong vasodilator and also prevents platelet cell aggregation.

Bosentan blocks endothelin-1 vasoconstrictive effect. This is used in recurrent digit ulceration in CTD, such as systemic sclerosis. Surgery to remove the particular sympathetic nerves that cause vasoconstriction, also known as sympathectomy, can be used in severe, refractory cases.

In the setting of secondary Raynaud phenomenon and history of ischemic ulceration, low dose aspirin 81 mg should be used daily. If there is aspirin intolerance or contraindication, clopidogrel, or dipyridamole can be used instead.
