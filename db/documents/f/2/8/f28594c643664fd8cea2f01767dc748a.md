The sacrum serves as the attachment point for numerous muscles. These muscles can group into those that attach to the anterior sacrum, and those that attach to the posterior sacrum.

- The anterior surface

- Piriformis - originates from sacral segments 2 through 4
- Coccygeus - inserts on the border of lower sacrum and coccyx
- Iliacus - some fibers originate from the ala of the sacrum

- The posterior surface

- Gluteus maximus 
- Multifidus lumborum
- Erector spinae
