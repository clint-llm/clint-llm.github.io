Nintedanib is a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that binds to a family of growth factor receptors and prevents the proliferation of fibroblasts. It reduces the ongoing fibrotic process and delays the progression to long-lasting damage. Nintedanib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat and manage idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease, and interstitial lung disease with progressive phenotype. This activity outlines the indications, contraindications, adverse events, and other key elements of nintedanib therapy in the clinical setting and highlights the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with progressive interstitial lung disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for nintedanib therapy.
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with nintedanib therapy.
- Describe the mechanism of action of nintedanib.
- Explain the importance of monitoring patients on nintedanib therapy.
