AÂ recent meta-analysis of 47 studies of breast cancer patients who were given intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates included 23 randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with the total number of patients included being 20,607. Influenza-like illness was shown to be the most common side effect of bisphosphonate use, with no observable difference between the sexes.

Other side effects were fatigue, fever, dyspepsia, and anorexia. The overall incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) was 2% compared to that for patients taking oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis, where it ranges from about 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000 patient-years
