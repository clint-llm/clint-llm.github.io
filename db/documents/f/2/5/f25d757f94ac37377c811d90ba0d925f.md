The prevalence of keloids, which occur in anywhere from 30% to 90% of patients, varies depending on region and race but tends to be higher in darker skinned race individuals (non-albino African-Americans, Hispanics, and Asians) and those with a family history of keloids. Age wise, patients 10 to 30 years of age are at the highest risk, through periods of hormonal changes (puberty, pregnancy) also increase risk. Additional risk factors include having blood type A or hyper-IgE syndrome.
