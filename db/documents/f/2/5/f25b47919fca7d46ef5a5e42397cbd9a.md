Studies indicate decreased localized cerebral blood flow in the frontal and parietal areas of patients that sleepwalk as compared to controls. Moreover, restricted perfusion in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and insula is found to be congruous with the clinical signs of somnambulistic episodes. Changes in regional cerebral blood flow patterns occurring during the resting-state wakefulness of patients that sleepwalk may be related to functional problems observed in these patients, during the daytime.
