The diagnostic workup is largely negative. However, in cases of pulmonary edema, this can be seen on an X-ray of the chest or on a bedside ultrasound. Elevated lactate is another finding. However, this should be considered in conjunction with the history and clinical examination findings as elevated lactate has numerous causes. Arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis or venous blood gas (VBG) analysis shows metabolic acidosis secondary to lactate. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained to assess for myocardial ischemia or infarction.
