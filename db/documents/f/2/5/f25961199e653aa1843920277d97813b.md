For the midline forehead flap, the supratrochlear artery and its branches play a critical role along with the supraorbital artery. The supratrochlear artery forms anastomoses with the contralateral supratrochlear artery, the supraorbital artery, and the superficial temporal artery. Because of the rich vascularization, the skin supplied by the supratrochlear artery is often used as a skin graft/pedicle to repair the defect at the bridge of the nose or upper facial defect also.

Fracture of the roof of the orbit may lead to injury of the trochlea, which complicates as a compromised action of the superior oblique muscle; in severe injury, the position of the eyeball is also affected, leading to exophthalmos or enophthalmos.

The supratrochlear nerve block is performed in combination with a supraorbital nerve block as regional anesthesia, local infiltration, or field anesthesia for procedures such as repairing of scalp lacerations, craniotomies, andÂ scalp lesion excision.
