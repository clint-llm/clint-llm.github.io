The fascial continuity that is part of the biotensegrity model prevents any muscle from acting alone—every muscle action results from the cooperation of all the neighboring muscles. Every muscle knows the muscular tension of the neighboring districts.

The deep muscles such as the rectus capitis anterior and lateralis, the cervical and brachial plexus innervate the capitis and longus colli muscles. It is extremely difficult not to meet a scalene problem without dysfunction of other deep muscles of the neck; the inability to extend the head is synonymous with a general dysfunction of these muscles and scalene muscles.
