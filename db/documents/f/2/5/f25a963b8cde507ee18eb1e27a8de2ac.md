Esophageal varices are dilated submucosal distal esophageal veins connecting the portal and systemic circulations. They form due to portal hypertension, which commonly is a result of cirrhosis, resistance to portal blood flow, and increased portal venous blood inflow. Variceal rupture is the most common fatal complication of cirrhosis. the severity of liver disease correlates with the presence of varices and risk of bleeding. This activity reviews the evaluation of esophageal varices and the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain when an evaluation for esophageal varices is warranted.
- Contrast the acute and chronic management strategies for esophageal varices.
- Explain whether lifestyle changes can lead to improvements in esophageal varices.
- Explore strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by esophageal varices.
