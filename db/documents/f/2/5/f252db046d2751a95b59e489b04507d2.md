Taste is sensed by chemosensory receptors known as taste buds. Taste buds themselves consist of columnar cells arranged circumferentially to form a single “taste pore” between them and microvilli extending from the columnar cells arranged around this pore. These microvilli are the location of the actual taste receptors, which are coupled to ion channels in the apical membrane and are responsible for sensing taste stimulus. Nerve fibers are associated with the basolateral surface of these cells and are responsible for conducting impulses to the central nervous system.
