Indications are usually secondary where the patient has already suffered and survived cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia, or primary when the patient is at high risk of sudden cardiac death due to VF/ VT but has never had any such event.

Secondary prophylaxis usually involves the event of cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) or hemodynamically unstable, also known as pulseless, ventricular tachycardia (VT). Adequate workup and exclusion of reversible causes should be done first before deciding to put the device in, as is endorsed by the guidelines laid down by Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) and American College of Cardiology (ACC).

Primary prophylaxis, as described above, involves implanting the device in patients who have not had sudden cardiac death due to VF or pulseless VT but are at high risk of having such an event. These have become the most common reasons for device implantation in recent times.

Class (I) recommendations for ICD implantation include

- LV dysfunction with ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% and NYHA II/III symptoms

- LV dysfunction with ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% due to previous Myocardial Infarction (MI) or at least 40 days post-MI and NYHA II/III symptoms

- LV dysfunction with ejection fraction less than or equal to 30% due to previous Myocardial Infarction (MI) or at least 40 days post-MI

- LV dysfunction with ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% due to previous Myocardial Infarction (MI) or at least 40 days post-MI and inducible VT/VF on EP study (EPS)

- Syncope of unknown etiology and inducible VT/ VF on EPS

- Sustained VT in the presence of structural heart disease
