Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU), inflammation of the urethra, is the most common sexually transmitted illness in men. Urethritis can be infectious or non-infectious. Infectious causes almost always sexually transmitted. Sexually transmitted urethritis is traditionally divided into 2 categories: gonococcal urethritis and non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU).
