Diagnosis of acquired perforating dermatosis relies on the patientâ€™s history, the clinical presentation of the lesions, and especially histopathology with recognition of classic histological features. Dermatoscopic findings during APD show bright white clouds and structureless grey areas which may be useful to distinguish APD from prurigo nodularis.

Estimation of blood glucose level, hepatic and renal function are highly recommended to identify the underlying disease.
