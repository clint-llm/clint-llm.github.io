There are a variety of perioperative AKI syndromes that must be considered, including hemodynamic, nephrotoxic, damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)-induced inflammation, and obstruction. If oliguria develops as the presenting symptom of AKI, mechanical obstruction of the urinary tract must be considered. Obstruction is especially common in colorectal, urological, and gynecological surgical procedures. Additionally, drug-induced urinary retention should also be excluded. If a Foley catheter is in place, it should be inspected to ensure that it is not obstructed or kinked. Increased release of antidiuretic hormoneÂ secondary to pain, nausea, surgery, and other non-renal stimulation should be considered, as should increased aldosterone secretion.
