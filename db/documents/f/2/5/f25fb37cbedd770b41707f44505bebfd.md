In healthy individuals, vitamin D toxicity can result from taking excessive vitamin D supplementation, knowingly or accidentally.

Fortification of foods or supplements with higher than intended amounts of vitamin D has led to toxicity. In 2015, the FDA announced a voluntary recall of multivitamins by Glades Drugs due to excessive amounts of vitamin D. In 2016, the Danish health authority issued a recall for a supplement that had vitamin D levels 75 times higher than recommended. At least 20 children developed toxicity after taking this supplement.

Vitamin D is present in fish, meat, and dairy products, and the dose is rarely enough to cause toxicity.

Excessive sun exposure does not cause vitamin D toxicity due to the regulation and conversion of Vitamin D to its inactive metabolites.

Although mainly reported in animals, exposure to rodenticides containing cholecalciferol can also lead to vitamin D toxicity.
