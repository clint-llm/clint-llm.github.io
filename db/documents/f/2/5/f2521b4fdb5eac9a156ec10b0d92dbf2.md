Abnormal imaging findings vary depending upon the type of imaging study utilized in the evaluation of coronary artery disease. For example, regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography, CCTA or MRI, and/or perfusion defects on myocardial perfusion imaging are indicative of ischemia or infarction. Furthermore, a global reduction in wall motion, ventricular dilatation, and lack of improvement in post-stress ejection fraction on SPECT imaging may portend a poor prognosis.

Abnormal enhancement noted on cardiac magnetic resonance helps to identify inflammatory and infiltrative processes affecting myocardium and pericardium in addition to ischemic or infarcted regions. CT angiography can detect anomalous vessels and luminal stenosis of the coronary vasculature. Furthermore, interventional techniques such as measuring fractional flow reserve can further characterize areas of critical stenosis that may benefit from therapeutic intervention.
