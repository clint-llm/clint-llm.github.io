Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine cancer. They are histologically classified as papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), follicular thyroid cancer (FTC), Hurthle cell carcinoma (HTC), medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC).

Sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) on the differentiated thyroid cancer cell absorbs radioactive iodine that destroys the cancer cells. The need and dose of RAI vary on an individual basis depending on the risk factors.
