Fine motor disability is an inability or impairment of an individual to perform tasks that require a degree of manual dexterity.

Additionally, injuries to musculoskeletal components may also affect fine motor abilities. Fine motor ability is usually synonymous within the literature concerning the ability of an individual to make precise, voluntary, and coordinated movements with their hands. However, foot dexterity is also described concerning athletic ability and the precise lower limb coordination required to perform subtle movements required in sport.

Despite these examples, the manual dexterity of the hand plays a much larger role in evaluating a fine motor disability. For example, all fine motor development milestones in children relate to the ability of a child to use their hands in more and more refined and purposeful movements.

The selection pressure of our evolutionary ancestors regarding hand morphology, joint flexibility, and survival advantage in utilizing and fashioning tools created a strong symbiosis between the hands and brain's combined ability to survive and thrive in the environment.

Fine motor disability can affect anyone at any age but is especially important during a childâ€™s development with fine motor ability closely monitored by clinicians as significant delays in recognized milestones can indicate a range of underlying neurological disorders.
