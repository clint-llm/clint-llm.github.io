The ST segment on an electrocardiogram (ECG) normally represents an electrically neutral area of the complex between ventricular depolarization (QRS complex) and repolarization (T wave). However, it can take on various waveform morphologies that may indicate benign or clinically significant injury or insult to the myocardium. Understanding the differential diagnosis for variations in the ST segment is critical for clinical management as it can influence treatment. This article summarizes ST segment, including how it is defined, measured, and how it varies. This articleÂ also examines and summarizes ST-segment morphologies unique to various conditions that present with ST elevation or depression.
