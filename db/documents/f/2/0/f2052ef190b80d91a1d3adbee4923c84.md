Uveitis is the inflammation of the uveal tract that may be classified according to the predominant site of inflammation into anterior, intermediate, posterior, or panuveitis (standardization of uveitis: SUN classification).

Uveitic macular edema (UME) is defined as the accumulation of fluid within the retinal layers as cystoid spaces or diffuse retinal thickening or in the subretinal space between the neurosensory retina and retinal pigment epithelium. This results mostly from the breakdown of the blood-retina barrier subsequent to inflammation. UME can be associated with any of the uveitic entities and is the most common cause of diminution in vision in cases with posterior uveitis (around one-third of cases).

Thus early diagnosis and management can be instrumentalÂ in preventing long-term ocular morbidity. Uveitis is the cause of legal blindness in around 20% of cases in developed countries.
