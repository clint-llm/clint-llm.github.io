All burn resuscitation formulas are intendedÂ to serve as a guide for fluid resuscitation.

In 2021, Daniels et al sought to determine if the Parkland formula is still the best method for determining adult fluid resuscitation. A retrospective study evaluated 500 patients with more than 20 percent TBSA treated in German burn centers, dividing the patients into groups according to the amount of fluid resuscitation. These authors found that patients who received volume according to the Parkland formula had significant mortality in the first week. Patients who received more fluid had more operations than those with lower administered volumes, and those with lower administered volumes had an increased mortality rate and risk of acute kidney injury. Patients with lower administered volumes were also more likely to be obese.

Mitchell et al also demonstrated that patients with higher resuscitative volumes in the first 24 hours also received more fluids in the following 24 hours with higher mortality rates.

An inaccurate assessment of burn size and depth may result in inadequate fluid resuscitation.
