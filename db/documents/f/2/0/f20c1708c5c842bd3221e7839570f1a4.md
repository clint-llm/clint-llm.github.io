Public health control of gonorrhea depends upon suitable antimicrobial therapy in tandem with generalized and targeted prevention interventions, accurate diagnostic assays, partner notification procedures, and epidemiological surveillance. Antibiotic administration should resolve individual cases to decrease the risk of complications and avert further transmission of the infection.

Patients should abstain from sexual activity for at least one week following the initiation of antibiotic therapy. Patients should be counseled regarding the necessity toÂ microbiologically confirm a cure of N. gonorrhoeae if they are treated with alternative therapy if significant comorbidities are present, including HIV, or if symptoms persist. Retesting can provide antibiotic susceptibilities that can avoid further treatment failure. Infected patients with gonorrhea are also at increased risk of contracting other STIs, including HIV. Up to 27% of patients diagnosed with HIV have a diagnosis of gonorrhea within 12 months of HIV diagnosis.
