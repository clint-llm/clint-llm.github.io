Chikungunya fever usually presents with the non-specific findings of high-grade fever and myalgia, following a 3 to 7 day incubation period, and lasting around 3 to 5 days. Bilateral symmetrical polyarthralgia ensues 2 to 5 days after the onset of fevers and preferentially involves distal over proximal joints.

Manifestations such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and generalized lymphadenopathy may also be found. Although it is not considered to be a neurotropic virus, it has long been associated with neurologic symptoms, with encephalitis among newborns infected through mother-to-child transmission being the most common.
