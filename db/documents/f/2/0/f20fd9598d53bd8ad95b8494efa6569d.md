The American Association of Blood Banks recommends repeat antibody screening prior to administration of Rh-D immunoprophylaxis (Rh-D IgG) at 28 weeks of gestation, postpartum, and in FMH events.

The standard dose of anti-RhD administered in the second and third trimesters and postpartum, if needed, is 300mcg. If needed in the first trimester, the recommended dose is 150 mcg. A one-time dose of 300 mcg anti-RhD should prevent isoimmunization when 15mL or less of fetal RBCs (or 30mL of whole blood) enters maternal circulation. A rosette test is a qualitative test to assess potential FMH. If positive, the rosette test should be followed by the Kleihauer-Betke test to quantify the amount of fetomaternal blood mixing to then determine if additional doses of Rh-D immunoprophylaxis are needed.
