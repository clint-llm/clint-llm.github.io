**Mechanism of Action**

Circulating catecholamines activate adrenergic receptors as part of our functional autonomic system to produce parasympathetic and sympathetic physiological responses. Mimicking catecholamines, beta-2 agonists act as ligands to adrenergic receptors with increased selectivity towards beta-2 adrenergic receptors. The activation of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor initiates a transmembrane signal cascade, which involves the heterotrimeric G protein, Gs, and the effector, adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase then increases intracellular cAMP via the hydrolysis of ATP. The elevated cAMP concentration serves to activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). PKA can phosphorylate intracellular substrates, which modulate various effects within the cell. Specifically, in airway smooth muscle, PKA acts to phosphorylate Gq-coupled receptors leading to a cascade of intracellular signals, which have been proposed to reduce intracellular Ca2+ or decrease the sensitivity of Ca2+.

**Classification**

Their onset of action and duration determines the classification of beta-2 agonists. The classes separate into short-acting beta-agonists (SABAs), long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs), and, most recently, ultra-long-acting beta-agonists (ultra-LABAs). As the names suggest, SABAs have the shortest half-life and are for immediate symptomatic relief. LABAs, along with ultra-LABAs, provide prolonged, sustained treatment due to their increased half-life. The different properties between these classes occur through modifications of the molecular structure of the drugs. For example, the prolonged duration is achievable by decreasing the susceptibility of the beta-2 agonists to catechol O-methyl transferase (COMT) and monoxidase enzymes that induce oxidative deamination and methylation, thereby inactivating the beta-2 agonist.

**SABAs**

SABAs are the first-line medications for acute treatment in asthma symptoms and exacerbations. They are also commonly used in conjunction with LABAs, inhaled corticosteroids, or long-acting muscarinic agonists in treatment for COPD. Typical administration of these agents is inhalation via metered dosing or dry powder inhalation. Compared to the alternative oral administration, inhalation has an increase in therapeutic value and a decrease in systemic side effects.

**Common SABAs**

- Salbutamol (albuterol)

- Terbutaline

- Levalbuterol

- Pirbuterol

**LABAs**

LABAs are used in treatment for patients with asthma and COPD, often in conjunction with inhaled corticosteroids. There is evidence of greater efficacy with dual therapy versus monotherapy LABA.

**Common LABAs**

- Salmeterol

- Formoterol

**Ultra-LABAs**

Ultra-LABAs have the greatest duration of effect, up to 24 hours, and they have the additional benefit of being a once-a-day treatment dosage. Indacaterol has been FDA approved as a maintenance treatment for patients with COPD in combination with other bronchodilators. Indacaterol administration is as a dry powder with an onset of action of around 5 minutes. Many other ultra-LABAs are currently undergoing research, with the potential to improve compliance and convenience compared to the current options of asthma and COPD treatments.

**Common Ultra-LABAS**

- Indacaterol

- Olodaerol

- Vilanterol

- Formoterol

**Administration**

The major routes of administration for beta-2 agonists include metered dosed-inhalers, nebulizers, dry powder inhalers, orally, subcutaneously, or intravenously. The preferred route of administration for beta-2 agonists in the treatment of asthma and COPD is through inhalation. Inhalation localizes the drug to the lung tissue, concentrating the therapeutic effect on the airway smooth muscles while minimizing the distribution of the drug to the systemic circulation. There has been no correlation between the therapeutic effect of inhaled beta-2 agonists and the peak plasma levels of the beta-2 agonist.
