The pathophysiology of dysphonia is characterized by irregularities in vocal fold oscillations related to muscle tone irregularity, which may be due to hypertonicity, incomplete closure of the glottis during phonation, a change in vocal fold bulk, or a vocal fold lesion or tumor.

The main risk factor for premalignant and malignant laryngeal cancer is smoking, with squamous cell carcinoma cited as the most common vocal fold malignancy, comprising 85-95% of vocal fold cancers.
