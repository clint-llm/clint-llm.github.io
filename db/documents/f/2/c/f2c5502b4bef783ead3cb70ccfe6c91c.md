Once a thorough history has been taken and a physical examination performed, followed by photo- and video documentation, additional studies may be performed, if necessary. In cases of traumatic facial paralysis, the most common additional tests include non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scanning for temporal bone fractures and electrodiagnostic studies to determine the severity of nerve injury. When other injuries accompany the facial paralysis, further workup may be prudent, such as β-2 transferrin testing of clear rhinorrhea or otorrhea to rule out a cerebrospinal fluid leak, a neck film to determine whether or not there is cervical spine fracture, and an audiogram to evaluate for hearing loss.

**Electrodiagnostic Studies**

Electroneuronography (ENoG) is an evoked form of electromyography in which the facial nerve is stimulated where it exits the temporal bone at the stylomastoid foramen using a transcutaneous electrical signal. The resulting compound action potentials of the facial muscles, usually the orbicularis oris and orbicularis oculi, are then measured via surface electrodes.

Patients who meet decompression criteria essentially have the equivalent of a Sunderland class V injury; if they do not undergo decompression, they are likely to experience worse outcomes than those who do not meet decompression criteria.

Voluntary electromyography (EMG) is another form of electrodiagnostic testing that is often employed later in the course of facial paralysis. It is used to assess the status of the muscles and determine whether they are denervated but viable, in the process of recovering their innervation or are no longer capable of receiving a neural input. Multiple waveforms may be visible on EMG, including fibrillation, positive sharp waves, polyphasic potentials, flat lines, and normal voluntary motor unit potentials. Muscles that are denervated but viable, i.e., targets for reinnervation via either facial nerve repair or nerve transfer, will generally demonstrate fibrillation and positive sharp waves with insertional activity during recording electrode needle placement. Muscles whose innervation is returning but may not yet have contraction visible on physical examination or detectable on ENoG will demonstrate polyphasic potentials. Muscles that are no longer viable due to prolonged denervation (12 to 24 months), atrophy, and fibrosis, will show a flat line with no electrical activity on EMG, while muscles with normal stimulability will have visible voluntary motor unit potentials. These potentials may still be visible even if the ENoG demonstrates >90% action potential amplitude loss; in that case, facial nerve decompression or repair may not be necessary.
