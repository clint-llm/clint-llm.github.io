The diagnosis of postoperative ileus is clinical. Postoperative ileus causes delayed bowel movement or flatus with abdominal distention and possible nausea or vomiting. It is crucial to differentiate ileus from other causes of the above clinical picture, especially mechanical bowel obstruction. There are some differences that can assist clinicians in distinguishing between the two entities. Postoperative ileus is more insidious in nature. In mechanical obstruction, symptoms are usually more acute and severe. Radiologically (X-rays and computed tomography scans), ileus shows diffuse air-fluid levels and bowel distention, while mechanical bowel obstruction demonstrates a transition point with dilated proximal and collapsed distal small bowel.

The evaluation of ileus focuses on looking for other treatable similar conditions and identifying the predisposing factors. Some factors, like peritonitis or intra-abdominal bleeding, necessitate urgent active treatment of the primary causes. In addition to the clinical assessment, biochemical profile assessment, medications review, pain and analgesics review, patient's ambulation assessment, and co-existing constipation should be considered.
