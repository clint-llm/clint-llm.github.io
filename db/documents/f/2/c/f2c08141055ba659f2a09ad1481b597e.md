For patients with true vertigo, otolaryngologists and neurologists are the consultants of choice, with audiologists and radiologists playing important roles in diagnosis. Neurosurgeons may be required as well if CNS lesions are involved. For patients with lightheadedness in the absence of true vertigo, primary care providers will serve as the starting point for diagnostic evaluation.
