The tibial nerve is one of the two terminal branches of the sciatic nerve, the largest nerve in the human body. The tibial nerve originates from the L4-S3 spinal nerve roots and provides motor and sensory innervation to most of the posterior leg and foot. In addition to its motor branches, the branches of the tibial nerve include the medial sural cutaneous nerve, medial calcaneal nerve, and the medial and lateral plantar nerves.
