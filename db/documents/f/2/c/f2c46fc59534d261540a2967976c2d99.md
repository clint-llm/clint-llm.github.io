Brachial artery pseudoaneurysmsÂ are a pulsatile hematoma caused by hemorrhage on soft tissues. They are more common after interventional procedures than after diagnostic procedures, although brachial artery pseudoaneurysms are rare. Complications of pseudoaneurysms can cause a serious threat to the afflicted limb and the patient's life.
