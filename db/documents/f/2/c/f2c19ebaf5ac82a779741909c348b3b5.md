**Tendinopathy**: The most characteristic adverse effect of ofloxacin treatment and other fluoroquinolone treatments is tendinopathy, typically presenting as pain or swelling along a tendon’s path. Such injury has been observed both during drug administration and several months after. In addition, there is a particularly high risk of tendon rupture in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy or engaging in strenuous physical activity with concurrent ofloxacin administration. This injury primarily affects the Achilles tendon and necessitates surgical repair.

**Central Nervous System ADRs**: It is also possible for ofloxacin treatment to cause increased intracranial pressure and psychosis.

**Hypersensitivity reactions**: Hypersensitivity reactions are another adverse effect occasionally observed with ofloxacin treatment, most frequently following the initial dose. This Type I hypersensitivity reaction results from some patients performing serum IgE against ofloxacin. Reported signs of a hypersensitivity reaction include seizure, cardiovascular collapse, shock, loss of consciousness, airway obstruction, dyspnea, tingling, angioedema, urticaria, itching, and other allergic skin manifestations.

On a rare occasion and following multiple doses, other serious and sometimes fatal hypersensitivity-associated events have been observed, involving fever, rash, severe dermatologic reactions, vasculitis, serum sickness, arthralgia, myalgia, allergic pneumonitis, interstitial nephritis, acute renal insufficiency or failure, acute hepatic necrosis or failure, hepatitis, jaundice, hemolytic or aplastic anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, agranulocytosis, pancytopenia, and other hematologic disorders. As with other hypersensitivity reactions, the earliest indication of these clinical manifestations calls for immediate treatment discontinuation.

**Peripheral Neuropathy**: Though uncommon, ofloxacin treatment has also led to reports of peripheral neuropathy, as manifested by pain, burning, tingling, numbness, weakness, and altered sensation. Exacerbation of muscle weakness in a patient with myasthenia gravis is a dangerous possibility. The earliest indication of these clinical manifestations calls for immediate discontinuation of treatment.

**Hepatotoxicity:**The severity of the ofloxacin-induced liver injury ranges from mild and transient serum enzyme elevations to self-limited jaundice to acute liver failure. Recovery is usually rapid (2 to 8 weeks) after stopping the medication. Cross-reactivity between different fluoroquinolones has not been well defined but is presumed based on the similarity of injury and clinical patterns. Thus, patients should avoid further exposure to fluoroquinolones, particularly levofloxacin, the isomer of ofloxacin.

**Dysglycemia**: Fluoroquinolones have been associated with symptomatic hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, usually in diabetic patients getting concomitant treatment with an oral hypoglycemic agent or with insulin. In these patients, meticulous monitoring of blood glucose is recommended.

**Aortic Aneurysm:**Other rare and serious adverse effects include prolonging the QTc interval and aortic aneurysms.
