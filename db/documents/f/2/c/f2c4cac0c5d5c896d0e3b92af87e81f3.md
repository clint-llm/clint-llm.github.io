The most common cause of buphthalmos is primary congenital glaucoma (onset at birth) or primary infantile glaucoma (onset after birth to 3 years). Buphthalmos is usually not seen in glaucoma with onset after the age of 3 years. That is why juvenile-onset (3 years to teenage years) glaucoma is not associated with buphthalmos.

The classical symptoms of congenital and infantile glaucomas include tearing, photophobia, and irritability. The parents may notice a hazy cornea or an increase in the size of the cornea. On examination, clinicians notice that there is increased corneal diameter, a deep anterior chamber, and an increase in the size of the globe. Corneal examination reveals the presence ofÂ corneal edema, with ruptures of Descemet's membrane known as Haab's striae. The intraocular pressure is elevated, and there may be optic disc cupping.

Other conditions causing buphthalmos:

- Aniridia: Characterized by complete or partial iris hypoplasia. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. Angle-closure is thought to be the cause of the glaucoma

- Neurofibromatosis type 1: Characterized by multiple neurofibromas, cafe au lait spots, iris Lisch nodules, and axillary/inguinal freckling. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. Glaucoma is thought to be due to developmental anomalies of the anterior chamber angle.

- Sturge-Weber syndrome: Characterized by nevus flammeus of the face and meningeal angiomas. Glaucoma and associated angle anomalies are seen in 60% of cases. Angle developmental anomalies and raised episcleral venous pressure are the proposed causes of glaucoma.
