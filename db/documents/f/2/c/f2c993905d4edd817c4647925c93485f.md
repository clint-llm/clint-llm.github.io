The primary test outcome is the final distance walked (6MWD).

Factors associated with variability in test performance among healthy subjects include weight and age.

The 6MWT has limitations as a measure of exercise capacity that needs to be considered. Due to its nature, the study cannot identify the cause of dyspnea, or hypoxemia, or the mechanisms underlying a particular patient's exercise intolerance. Additionally, it cannot determine peak oxygen uptake, though it correlates with this cardiopulmonary exercise test measurement in select patients.

In the absence of specific clinical clues or an established diagnosis, a low 6MWD is a non-specific finding. In such situations, the cause of the abnormal finding should be investigated, with attention to the cardiac, pulmonary, or musculoskeletal systems, as guided by the patient's medical history.

The 6MWD has been established as a significant marker of disease severity for COPD patients since it directly correlates with lower quality of life indices, respiratory and functional impairment, and survival. It also reflects the clinical response to treatments such as lung volume reduction surgery. However, it does not have the same role for pharmacological interventions.

Other measures such as the body weight-walking distance product (D x W) have been proposed as alternative estimates of functional capacity in COPD patients. The DxW product correlates better with a patient's actual work of walking, as well as maximal oxygen uptake and anaerobic threshold, compared to walking distance alone.

In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the 6MWD is also an independent predictor of mortality. A baseline 6MWD under 250 meters, and a subsequent decline greater than 50 meters in 24 weeks, are associated with a two- and three-fold increase in mortality, respectively.

As noted, the 6MWT has also been validated for use in cardiovascular diseases. In heart failure, a condition associated with functional disability and exercise intolerance, both in a sense analogous to the impairment of daily activity observed among COPD patients; the 6MWT can provide reliable data about physiological reserve and prognosis. In general, there is an inverse relation between NYHA class and 6MWD, with mean values of approximately 400, 320, and 225 meters for classes II, III, and IV, respectively. Decreased 6MWT performance is also associated with an increased risk of hospitalization and mortality.

The 6MWT also correlates with actual physical activity levels in patients with peripheral arterial disease, and it appears to be more so than treadmill testing.

In general terms, the minimal clinically important 6MWD change for patients with either cardiac or pulmonary disease is in the range of 14.0 to 30.5 meters.

While not affecting the organ systems involved in exercise directly, other conditions independently associated with a negative 6MWT performance in relation to the stage of the disease include chronic liver diseaseÂ and renal failure.
