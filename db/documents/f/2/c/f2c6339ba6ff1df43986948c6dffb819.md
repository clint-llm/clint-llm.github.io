Approximately 5% of patients with impetigo will develop an associated glomerulonephritis.  There is inconclusive evidence about whether or not antibiotics help reduce the incidence of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.  Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis typically occurs one to two weeks after a streptococcal infection. Patients may experience fever, hypertension, edema and hematuria.
