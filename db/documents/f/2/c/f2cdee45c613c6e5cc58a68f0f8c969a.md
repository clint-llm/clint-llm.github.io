Clinical presentation varies based on the severity of the right ventricular outflow tract obstruction, more commonly presenting as neonates with a certain degree of cyanosis. In some patients, cyanosis presents months later in life, when the rate of obstructions worsens. On auscultation, patients have a normal first heart sound with a single second heart sound that is loud. The greater the degree of obstruction, the more prominent the murmur, usually described as crescendo-decrescendo with a harsh systolic ejection quality and best heard at the left mid to upper sternal border with posterior radiation. Sometimes the murmur can have a regurgitant quality, and an early systolic click may be auscultated along the left sternal border. A prominent ventricular impulse and a systolic thrill may be appreciable, hepatomegaly is uncommon, and if there are prominent pulses present, it may be an indirect indication of a patent ductus arteriosus or aorticopulmonary collaterals. Other common associated cardiac abnormalities found are right aortic arch (25%), abnormal coronary arteries, significant aorticopulmonary collaterals, patent ductus arteriosus, multiple septal defects, and occasionally, aortic valve regurgitation.

“Tet spells” or hypercyanotic episodes present during infancy or toddler age and decrease after 4 to 5 years of age. Dehydration or agitation commonly precipitate tet spells, and if patients do not receive prompt and adequate treatment, they can develop severe cyanosis and hypoxia that, subsequently, can cause syncope and even death. Rarely, patients present with clubbing; this is usually seen in those with severe, longstanding cyanosis.
