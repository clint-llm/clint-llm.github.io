Inferior parathyroid adenomas are hypervascular and receive most of their blood supply from inferior thyroidal artery branches, while superior parathyroid adenomas receive their blood supply from the superior or inferior thyroidal artery branches. The ectopic parathyroid glands located in the mediastinum receive their vascular supply from the internal thoracic artery, specifically the thymic branch.
