V. cholerae is a comma-shaped, gram-negative rod with a single polar flagellum that is highly motile. It exists in aquatic environments, infects the small intestine, and produces cholera toxins. These bacteria have specialized adherence factors that allow them to attach to the hostile microvilli surface. Once attached, Vibrio export 1 of 2 antigenically related but distinct forms of cholera enterotoxin (CT-1 or CT-2) into the intestinal epithelial cell. The cholera toxin causes adenylate cyclase to be locked on the “on mode,” leading to an excess in cAMP and subsequent hypersecretion of chloride and bicarbonate followed by water.
