Therapeutic interventions for patients with pelvic floor dysfunction should be tailored to their specific needs. A multidisciplinary approach is often necessary. Patients with a history of sexual, physical, or emotional abuse should have the information relayed to the entire treatment team to facilitate modifications of therapy to accommodate the patientâ€™s needs.

**Lifestyle Modifications**

- Diet: avoidance of alcohol, caffeine (cola, tea, and coffee), acidic foods/beverages, including citrus and tomatoes, concentrated sugar, artificial sweeteners, including aspartame, spicy foods, and cigarettes for urinary frequency and incontinence.

- Weight loss: a 3% to 5% weight reduction can decrease urinary incontinence episodes by about 50%.

- Pelvic floor exercises (Kegel): to strengthen the pelvic floor.

- Core exercises: to strengthen the pelvic floor and support.

**Medications**

- Topical vaginal estrogen for overactive bladder, vaginal thinning, and dyspareunia.

- Anticholinergics (fesoterodine, tolterodine) for overactive bladder.

- Beta3 agonists (mirabegron) for overactive bladder.

**Manipulation**

- Patient splinting: digital support of the posterior vagina, anterior vagina, or perineum to facilitate voiding or defecation.

- Pessary: stress urinary incontinence and POP via the vagina.

- Physical therapy

- trigger point massage, myofascial release, strain-counterstain, joint mobilization.
- management of dyspareunia related to pelvic floor hypertonicity.
- expert training of pelvic floor exercises.

- Biofeedback: a neuromuscular technique for training appropriate pelvic floor contraction and relaxation. Intra-anal, intra-vaginal, or surface electrodes are incorporated with strengthening and relaxation exercises to provide patients with visual and/or auditory responses to their efforts. Biofeedback is a mainstay for managing patients with PFD. Physical therapy and biofeedback require specifically trained therapists with interest in Pelvic Floor Disorders.

- Improve continence urine/stool.
- Improve relaxation for evacuation- urine/stool.
- Improve symptoms of POP.

**Invasive Procedures**

- Cystoscopic intravesical injection of botulinum toxin A for overactive bladder.

- Sacral nerve stimulation/modulation-urine/fecal incontinence. It is the placement of electrical stimulation that leads to one of the S3 foramina for the management of urinary and fecal incontinence.

- Pain management with trigger point injections or acupuncture.

**Surgery**

Surgical procedures are indicated for anatomic prolapse concerns that do not have satisfactory symptom relief with non-operative measures.

- Urinary incontinence: mid-urethral sling.

- Cystocele: colposuspension (anterior repair).

- Uterine prolapse: hysterectomy and uterosacral suspension.

- Vaginal prolapse: sacrocolpopexy.

- Enterocele: repair of the rectovaginal fascia and obliteration of the cul-de-sac.

- Rectocele: posterior colporrhaphy or transrectal repair.

- Rectal prolapse: rectopexy (posterior or anterior) or perineal resection (Altemeier).
