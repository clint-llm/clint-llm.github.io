The most commonly cited risk factors for Salzmann nodular degeneration (SND) are ocular surface inflammatory conditions such as dry eye, chronic blepharitis, long term contact lens (CL) wear, phlyctenular keratoconjunctivitis, pterygium, trauma, and vernal keratoconjunctivitis.

CL-wear appears to be a risk factor for SND, accounting for 34.2% of 152 eyes in one study.

Surgical wounds to the cornea, such as from cataract extraction, radial keratotomy, penetrating keratoplasty, or laser in situ keratomileuses (LASIK), may increase the risk for developing SND.

Although no specific gene abnormalities associated with SND have been identified, several cases report SND occurrence in consecutive generations,Â  with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern in two cases.
