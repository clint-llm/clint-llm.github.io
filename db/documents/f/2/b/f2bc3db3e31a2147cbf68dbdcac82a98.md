Nausea and vomiting can occur due to gastric irritation. Patients can experience metallic taste and complications of sialadenitis that may rarely progress to xerostomia. A high RAI dose can cause transient bone marrow suppression, particularly with widespread bone metastases or altered renal function, or low baseline blood counts.

Transient infertility and dry eye are yet other complications. Although rare, long-term side effects can occur, especially with a very high therapeutic dose. Pulmonary fibrosis may occur in patients with lung metastases treated with multiple high doses (cumulative dose of 600 mCi). A small risk of leukemia, other secondary cancers, and permanent marrow suppression is reported in patients receiving a very high cumulative dose of RAI.
