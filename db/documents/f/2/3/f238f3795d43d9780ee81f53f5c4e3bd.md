Damage to the mammillary bodies can occur through trauma, stroke, tumors, or environmental factors (e.g., thiamine deficiency or chronic alcoholism). Thiamine deficiency commonly causes Korsakoff's syndrome. This syndrome can occur with Wernicke encephalopathy, caused by chronic alcoholism because alcoholism can induce a thiamine deficiency.
