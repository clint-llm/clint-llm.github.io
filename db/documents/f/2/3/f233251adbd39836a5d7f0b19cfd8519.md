Pediatricians and primary care providers that work with newborns and infants will frequently encounter congenital dermal melanocytosis in their practice. While congenital dermal melanocytosis is a benign condition that commonly self-resolves within the first decade of life, it is important for the health care providers to be able to recognize lesions that are atypical of congenital dermal melanocytosis as these could be signs of physical abuse or other pathology that warrants further evaluation. Parents and caretakers should be educated by clinicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and pharmacists on the benign nature of this skin condition that requires no further treatment or evaluation. This should alleviate any worries or concerns of the patient’s caretakers.
