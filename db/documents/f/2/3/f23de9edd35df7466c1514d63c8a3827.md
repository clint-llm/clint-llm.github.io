Identification of an AV nodal pathology is crucial to the diagnosis and management of potentially fatal syndrome from nonspecific symptoms. Often the presentation of these potentially fatal syndromes is with apparently benign symptoms such as palpitations. In some cases, patients may present with syncope as well. However, upon evaluation, the EKG may only have subtle signs of disease which require astute observation and a high index of suspicion. Thus,Â an interprofessional team, including physicians, electrophysiological, and telemetry trained nurses, are required in the care of these patients. Each member of the interprofessional team plays an important role in diagnosing these patients in a timely manner. When clinical suspicion is high, cardiac specialists should be consulted for evaluation and consideration of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. A collaborative interprofessional team can greatly improve outcomes in patients with AV nodal disease and arrhythmias.
