Overdosing of bisacodyl can induce diarrhea, leading to electrolyte disturbances, including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis, or alkalosis, which may also produce vomiting and muscle weakness. Short-term use (3 days) of the recommended dose does not show any effect on serum electrolytes.
