**CBC**

**Serum Inflammatory Markers**

**X-Ray/Ultrasound:**Performed for the detection of the spread of the lesion and soft tissue involvement.

**MRI:**Radiologic evaluation involves plain radiographs in two-thirds of the views assessing for deformity**.**If there is suspicion of osteomyelitis, tendonitis, or joint inflammation MRI imaging should be performed.

**Probe-to-bone Test**

**Monofilament Test**

**Bone Scan:**Can identify the involvement of deep wounds.

**Biopsy and Culture:**Specimen of bone and other tissue involved and histopathological examination is performed with the culture. This can also guide antibiotic treatment in case of a bacterial infection.
