The physiologic effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in anemic patients are short-lived; the elevated tissue partial pressures of oxygen last only minutes to hours after each hyperbaric exposure.

Treatments can be administered in a monoplace (holding a single person) or multiplace (accommodating multiple people) hyperbaric chamber.  Treatment depths depend on the individual hyperbaric unit’s clinical procedures.  Still, increased treatment depths will result in higher partial pressures of oxygen and likely increase relief of the symptoms of oxygen debt.  Other modalities which can reduce oxygen consumption, including sedation, neuromuscular paralysis, and cooling, can also be utilized as adjunctive therapy.
