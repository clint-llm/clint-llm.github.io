Due to the environmental stressors of aviation and the increased burden of lives at stake, as a physician, it is imperative to ensure that trained pilots and pilot candidates meet the necessary physical and mental requirements during each flight physical.  Additionally, approved medications and substances for use during flight duties are heavily monitored to mitigate any undesirable side effects that may physically and mentally blunt pilot’s flying ability and decision-making capacity.  Multiple military, civil, and international regulations have been put into place to decrease the incidence of errors secondary to human factors such as fatigue and reduced situational awareness.  Additional measures such as universally utilized checklists and processes such as crew resource management have improved overall crew communication and standardized procedures to decrease the margin for error and aviation mishaps. The medical professional’s role in reducing errors secondary to human factors includes thorough screening for disqualifying medical and mental conditions with annual check-ups and medical record review, optimizing pharmacological prescribing to decrease potential side effect risks, substance misuse screening, and counseling on major human performance threats seen in aviation (ie. fatigue mitigation with sleep hygiene techniques, mental and physical countermeasures to stress, etc).
