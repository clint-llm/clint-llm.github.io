Otitis media is one of the most common causes of fever as a presentation in the pediatric population. Chronic suppurative otitis media, also known as chronic otitis media, is a stage of ear disease in which there is an on-going chronic infection of the middle ear without an intact tympanic membrane. This disease is a chronic inflammation of the middle ear and mastoid cavity. The characteristic presentation is chronic or persistent otorrhoea over 2 to 6 weeks through a perforated tympanic membrane.
