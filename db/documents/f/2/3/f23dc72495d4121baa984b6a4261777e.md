# Continuing Education Activity

Malignant Pleural effusions (MPE), with an incidence of 150,000 new cases a year, have long been recognized as a cause of significant morbidity in advanced cancer patients. More recently, the presence of a loculated pleural effusion has been identified as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis. A variety of therapeutic options exist for the management of MPE. Spengler, in 1901 was the first to perform chemical pleurodesis with the use of hypertonic glucose. Since then, there has been controversy over the ideal agent for performing chemical pleurodesis. However, Talc has been recognized as the most widely used and studied agent. This activity provides a conceptual understanding of the interprofessional team's etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of MPE.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of malignant pleural effusion.
- Review the clinical findings of malignant pleural effusion.
- Outline Investigations strategies involved in the management of malignant pleural effusion.
- Review the associated complications of the various therapeutic procedures utilized for the management of malignant pleural effusion.

# Introduction

Malignant pleural effusion is characterized by the presence of malignant cells in the pleural fluid.

The pathophysiology is attributed to a disturbance of the Starling forces that govern and dictate fluid biomechanics within the pleural space.

Lung cancer, breast cancer, and hematological malignancies are the major malignancies associated with direct, contiguous, or hematogenous pleural involvement. From 50 to 55 percent of patients with pleural involvement develop effusion.

Malignant pleural effusions must be differentiated from paramalignant pleural effusions, which are not caused by direct pleural involvement by the tumor.

The treatment of recurrent malignant pleural effusions represents a significant financial burden.

Therapeutic approaches vary widely given the broad range of treatment options. However, there has been a concerted effort in recent times to move towards patient-related outcomes compared to successful pleurodesis as markers of successful palliation.

# Etiology

**Anatomical factors**- Normal pleural space lies between the parietal and the visceral pleura. While the parietal pleura lines the inner thoracic wall, including the bilateral medial mediastinum, subcostal right and left diaphragmatic leaflets, inner ribs, and associated musculature, the visceral pleura lies in close approximation with the lung parenchyma. The visceral and parietal pleurae join at the hilum.

The normal fluid volume in the pleural space measures ten ml/0.13 (0.26 +/- 0.1) ml/kg body weight.

**Physiological factors**- Both increased production and decreased reabsorption have been associated with the development of MPE.

**Molecular factors**- Molecules predisposing to the development of pleural vessels' hyperpermeability, which leads to overproduction of pleural fluid, comprise three different classes of chemical mediators.

**Genetic factors**- Mutations in KRAS, EGFR, MET, BRAF, PIK3CA, and RET, have been identified to be associated with the development of MPE.

**Impact on Respiratory Physiology**- The development of pleural effusion has been associated with hypoxemia and a reduction in the partial pressure of oxygen. The occurrence of a mild intrapulmonary shunt also predisposes to the development of reduced arterial oxygenation. A dramatic relief in the sensation of breathlessness following a successful thoracentesis procedure has also led to an added emphasis on the impact of pleural fluid accumulation on respiratory dynamics. Activation of mechanoreceptors in response to pleural fluid accumulation, in response to stretch, cough, and altered lung volumes have been shown to underlie the pathophysiology of dyspnea in MPE. Both alterations in hemi-diaphragmatic movement and paradoxical movement of the diaphragm have been identified. Shifts in inspiratory muscle pressure-volume curves predisposing to an unfavorable pressure-volume interdependence between increased thoracic volume and pressure have resulted in the accumulation of pleural fluid. Alterations in the length-tension relationship have also been shown to predispose to dyspnea.

# Epidemiology

Malignant pleural effusion is seen in up to 15 percent of all cancer patients.

Ipsilateral pleural involvement is seen in 90 percent of cases of lung cancer.

Pleural effusion in ovarian cancer may represent a comparatively better prognosis when compared to other tumors. Fifteen percent of patients may present with the wet pleural disease as the first sign of cancer.

While 20 percent of patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma may present with MPE at the time of diagnosis, effusions may represent a disease progression in around 60 percent of patients. It is associated with a poor prognosis and may represent chemotherapy-resistant disease.

Both infiltrations of the pleural space and tumor-immune cell interactions in the pleural microenvironment represent underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.

# History and Physical

A succinct clinical history is useful in identifying the various etiologies of malignant pleural effusions. Identifying various comorbidities (pulmonary, renal, cardiac, and hepatic) is useful in determining the patient's physiological reserve and may have management implications.

**Symptoms**- Clinical presentation depends upon the extent of effusion, rapidity of development, and physiological reserves of the patient.

**Dyspnea**- Dyspnea is the most common presenting complaint in a patient with an underlying pleural effusion, seen in more than 50 percent of all cases. Mechanical factors such as a decrease in chest wall compliance, altered biomechanics resulting from a contralateral shift of the mediastinum, decrease in ipsilateral lung volume, activation of compensatory reflex phenomenon (from chest wall receptors), and caudal displacement of the diaphragm have been identified as contributory factors.

Assessment of dyspnea in cancer can be performed using the unidimensional and multidimensional scale (which factor in functional impairment).

Other tools used in assessing dyspnea include dyspnea interview schedule, pulmonary functional status scale, and baseline dyspnea index.

**Pain**- Chest wall pain signifies the presence of underlying chest wall involvement or malignant pleural mesothelioma.

**Cough**- May be productive and associated with hemoptysis. Denotes underlying pleural inflammation, which may accompany tumor involvement of the pleura or bronchial involvement by the tumor. Constitutional symptoms such as loss of appetite, loss of weight, easy fatiguability, and lethargy might indicate the advanced stage of the disease.

**Symptomatology related to paraneoplastic manifestations**- Muscle weakness - Lambert Eaton Myasthenic syndrome (small-cell lung cancer).

Headache, engorged veins in the anterior chest wall, dyspnea, altered voice, confusion, obtundation, swelling of face, swelling of the arm - superior vena cava obstruction (small cell lung cancer).****Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy - most commonly associated with non-small cell lung cancer.

**Occupational history**- History of occupational asbestos exposure should be sought.

**Family history**- A family history of malignancy may offer a clue to the diagnosis of an underlying malignancy.

**Past medical history**- A review of medications should also be performed as medications such as amiodarone, nitrofurantoin, and methotrexate can be associated with the development of exudative effusions.

**Clubbing -**Presence of Lovibond sign, Schamroth sign, and Distal phalangeal (DPD) to interphalangeal depth (IPD) ratio of more than 1 are physical signs required for establishing a diagnosis.

**Physical Examination**

**Inspection**- Asymmetrical chest wall expansion, tracheal shift, intercostal fullness, Trail's sign, scars of previously performed thoracocentesis or biopsies, a predominance of abdominal breathing.

**Evaluation**(**General Physical Examination) -**Poor performance status may signal an urgent need for imminent palliation. Prognostication may be performed using a palliative prognostic scale which is a component of the palliative prognostic index (PPI). A score more than 4.5 on the PPI may signal a survival lesser than six weeks.

**Percussion**- Dullness is usually observed on percussion. The percussion note has been traditionally described as being woody dull.

Joseph Leopold Auenbrugger is regarded as the inventor of direct percussion, which has been replaced mainly by the digitodigital method of percussion. Percussion is preferentially performed with the patient sitting up. Topographic comparative percussion is performed in the apical regions, fourth and fifth intercostal spaces (right middle lobe and lingular lobe), and basal areas of the lung.

**Cardinal Rules of Percussion**

The pleximeter finger (middle finger of the left hand) should be in firm apposition to the chest wall, while the remaining fingers should be kept off the chest wall. The tip of the middle finger of the right hand or the plessor should strike the middle phalanx of the pleximeter finger swiftly at a right angle. Percussion must be performed in the intercostal spaces. Percussion may be performed directly over the clavicle. Percuss should proceed from a more resonant to a less resonant area. Percussion from a resonant towards a flat area is also considered acceptable. This ensures that a difference between the two areas is felt (if present). While performing the percussion act, the plessor finger should strike the middle phalanx of the pleximeter finger at a right angle. The sudden movement of the plessor finger should originate at the relaxed wrist. It is advised to keep the long axis of the pleximeter finger parallel to the border of the organ being percussed. The note should be compared in similar areas between both sides.

The force of the stroke of the plessor finger depends upon patient factors (age, sex, and built), tissue type, differential diagnoses being considered, the area being examined, and thickness of the chest wall. Damping of the percussion stroke can be avoided by withdrawing the plessor finger immediately after striking the middle phalanx. Both the sound and the feeling of the percussion note are considered crucial to formulating a differential diagnosis. Heavy percussion causes large areas of the lung to resonate (as a result of which it is possible to miss small areas of impaired note) and should be avoided.

**Auscultation**- Diminished or absent breath sounds are present on auscultation. A pleural rub is usually heard in dry pleurisy.

**Egophony**(E to A change) - Change in the timber of voice from E to A (but not pitch or volume). They are usually heard as a high-pitched nasal sound and described by Laennec as the bleating of a goat. It is characterized by the intensity and suddenness with which it appears—usually confined over a small area on one side of the chest. An absence of similar change in sound over the contralateral side should be used before making a definitive diagnosis. Underlying mechanism - accumulation of fluid enhances the transmission of high-frequency sounds while filtering out low-frequency sounds.

**Whispering pectoriloquy**- Pectoriloquy is defined as the increased resonance of voice while passing through the lung structures. Whispered sound is heard clearly after placing a stethoscope over the patient's chest. Both whispered pectoriloquy, as well as egophony, are heard at the upper border of the pleural effusion.

**Summary**- Physical findings of dullness to percussion and decreased vocal fremitus have been used clinically to diagnose pleural effusion. The presence of dullness on percussion makes the diagnosis likely. A chest radiograph is required to confirm the diagnosis. In the presence of a low clinical suspicion of a diagnosis, the absence of a reduced vocal fremitus decreases the likelihood of diagnosis. A chest radiograph is usually not advised without a finding of reduced vocal fremitus on physical examination.

According to Auenbrugger and Forbes, dullness is a prerequisite for diagnosing pleural effusion, although this particular physical finding might be challenging to discern in bilateral pleural effusion. Percussive sounds have been shown to penetrate up to a maximum depth of 6 cm (2 cms of chest wall and 4 cm of fluid). At least 500 ml of fluid should be present in the pleural cavity to yield positive findings on physical examination. The finding of significant tachypnea, significantly decreased chest expansion, absent tactile fremitus, absent breath sounds, contralateral tracheal or mediastinal shift (presence of Trail's sign, tracheal deviation), bulging intercostal spaces, and presence of egophony has been shown to correlate with accumulation of more than 1500 ml of fluid in the pleural space.

# Evaluation

**Imaging**

**Chest radiograph**- A posteroanterior chest radiograph is considered a first-line investigation for the initial evaluation of a patient with signs and symptoms of pleural effusion in the setting of cancer.

Blunting of costophrenic angle, mediastinal shift, Crowding of the ribs, elevation of the hemidiaphragm may be radiographic findings that point towards a diagnosis.

**Thoracic Ultrasound**- Thoracic Ultrasonography has a higher sensitivity than chest radiography.

The shred sign can be used to diagnose pulmonary non-translobar consolidation with a sensitivity of 90 percent and specificity of 98 percent.

Evidence supports the use of pre-procedural ultrasonography in identifying the optimal site for thoracentesis.  A grading system proposed by Smargiassi et al. uses the description of anatomical extent, visible radiological landmarks, and a number of intercostal spaces involved to stratify the extent of pleural effusion. A large pleural effusion is classified as one where the upper lung lobe is partially displaced, includes atelectasis of the lower lobe or partial atelectasis of the upper lobe, and involves three to four intercostal spaces. A massive pleural effusion is characterized by the full collapse of the lung, atelectasis of the whole lung with hilum visible, and involvement of four or more intercostal spaces.

**Contrast-Enhanced Chest Computed Tomography**- Mediastinal lymph node involvement and associated parenchymal disease may be better visualized on computed tomography, considered the gold standard screening in those with underlying pleural malignancy.

A CT scan scoring system proposed by Pocel et al. for differentiation between malignant and benign conditions includes the following parameters – the presence of pleural lesions measuring more than 1 cm, hepatic metastasis, pulmonary mass or nodule measuring more than 1 cm, pericardial effusion, absence of loculations and absence of cardiac silhouette enlargement. A score of more than 7 out of 10 can be used to detect malignancy with a sensitivity and specificity of 88 and 94 percent, respectively.

Dual-energy spectral CT imaging, which can generate material decomposition images, monochromatic image sets with fast kilovoltage switching, has been shown to have added utility in distinguishing benign from malignant pleural lesions. A combination of patient age, clinical history, and information on CT value measurement (at both high and low energy levels), and the effective atomic number obtained in a single spectral scan have been found to be useful in identifying malignant pleura disease.

**Positron Emission Tomography/Dynamic Imaging**- While early or indolent disease may give rise to false negatives, inflammatory pleural involvement, rheumatoid disease, pleurodesis procedure performed may be associated with false-positive results.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging**- MRI offers better soft tissue resolution as compared to Computed tomographic scanning. MR Imaging possesses a higher sensitivity in detecting chest wall and diaphragmatic involvement.

**Histopathological Diagnosis**

**Diagnostic Thoracentesis**- The standard panel of tests that needs to be performed on a pleural fluid sample includes PF protein, glucose, pH, lactate dehydrogenase, cytology, and microbiology.

**Pleural Fluid Analysis**- Normal physicochemical characteristics include pH between 7.60 and 7.64, protein levels of less than 2 percent (2 gm/dl), less than 100 WBC’s per cubic millimeter, Glucose content similar to that of plasma, LDH level less than half of that present within the plasma. The following parameters can be used in making a diagnosis of malignant etiology underlying the accumulation of pleural fluid – pH less than 7.30, LDH levels greater than 1000 U/l, reduced pleural fluid glucose concentration (30 to 50 mg/dl), lymphocyte values greater than 50 to 70%.

Pleural fluid tumor marker levels have been used in the diagnosis of MPE. Carcinoembryonic Antigen, mucin, and Leu 1 have been shown to be elevated in effusions with an underlying malignant etiology.

An issue that continues to remain a deterrent in diagnosing malignant effusion by the use of conventional cytology remains the differentiation of malignant cells from reactive mesothelial cells.

**Pleural Fluid Cell Block**- Cell-block technique for processing fluids was first introduced in 1896.

**Pleural Biopsy**- Given the low diagnostic yield of conventional cytology and the lack of standard protocols which advocate the use of the cell block technique, a pleural biopsy may be considered in patients with cytology negative effusions.

**Image-Guided Biopsies**- Both ultrasound-guided and CT-guided biopsies have been used in obtaining representative pleural samples for diagnostic purposes.

**Thoracoscopy**- Medical thoracoscopy is recommended when the thickness of effusion is less than 10 mm on a CT scan.

**Pleural Manometry**- German physician Heinrich Quincke was the first to pioneer pleural manometry to measure the pressure within the pleural space in 1878. Techniques used to measure pleural pressures include a hemodynamic electronic transducer, electronic manometer, and U tube water manometer. Hemodynamic electronic transducers provide the most reliable and accurate measures of intrapleural pressures. The thickness of the normal pleural space is 20 micrometers, and 50 ml of fluid in the pleural space is required to ensure that the effect of local deformation forces on the measurement of pleural pressures can be nullified. Pressure within the pleural space is influenced by elastic forces of the chest wall, lung, and effusion volume. Gravity, ventilatory pressures, forces produced due to cardiac contraction and associated with lymphatic drainage play a role in generating pleural pressures. Lan et al. were the first to describe the utility of manometry in optimizing pleurodesis in those with malignant pleural effusion. Although real-time manometry has been proposed as a means of identifying an un-expandable lung following thoracentesis. However, there has been a lack of consensus on specific pressure cut-offs that can be used to distinguish between normal and unexpanded lung.

# Treatment / Management

A definitive procedure is defined as one aimed at providing long-term relief from symptoms associated with pleural effusion.

**Thoracentesis**

Incidence of recurrence after a single procedure has been identified as 4.2 days, with a rate of recurrence approaching 98 percent 30 days within the period of completion of the procedure. A thoracentesis does not aim to prevent fluid re-accumulation or allow continued drainage. Thoracentesis confirms the presence of fluid, but can also be used to confirm lung re-expansion following pleural fluid drainage.

Tension pneumothorax which may also be associated with hemodynamic compromise, may also be seen with the performance of thoracentesis in those receiving positive pressure ventilation.

**Anatomical Localization**

The normal site for the aspiration of pleural fluid is the seventh intercostal space in the posterior axillary line (near the tip of the scapula).

**Procedure**

While adults may undergo the procedure in the upright, seated, or lateral position, pediatric patients may be held in the burping position by an assistant.

The depth of insertion where access to the fluid is first obtained should be noted, and an over-the-needle catheter is inserted for atraumatic removal of the fluid. Attachment of a three-way stopcock along with tubing may facilitate the drainage of large volumes of fluid.

Large volume thoracentesis has been defined as the removal of more than one liter of pleural fluid.

Repeat thoracentesis has been advocated in patients with a slower accumulation of fluid, expected to have resolution with systemic therapies, advanced disease, poor performance status, and limited life expectancy. Patients undergoing systemic treatment for the underlying malignancy, which might be thought to prevent the re-accumulation of fluid (such as those with small cell lung cancer, lymphoma, or EGFR mutated adenocarcinoma), may also be potential candidates for undergoing repeated thoracentesis.

A delay in performing pleurodesis may also be associated with extensive disease (signifying an increased pleural tumor burden), which might decrease the effectiveness of pleurodesis, and development of a trapped lung, which might act as a contraindication to pleurodesis.

While there is consensus that volumes in excess of 1.5 liters are associated with the development of re-expansion pulmonary edema, some groups advocate the removal of 1200 to 1800 ml of pleural fluid safely within a single setting.

**Complications**

While pneumothorax remains a real concern, the development of pain, shortness of breath, and vasovagal syncope have also been noted

**Re-expansion Pulmonary Edema**

Pinault, in 1853, was the first to describe the occurrence of edema following thoracentesis.

Among measures that have been shown to prevent the development of this phenomenon, avoidance of the application of negative intrapleural pressures and prevention of lung collapse for prolonged periods has been afforded foremost importance.

Untreated pulmonary edema may be associated with a poorer outcome and has been estimated to be potentially lethal in 20 percent of cases.

Patchy ground-glass opacities, consolidation, interlobar septal thickening, and intralobular interstitial thickening have been described on high-resolution computed tomography of the chest.

**Chemical Pleurodesis**

Lucius Splengler, in 1901 was the first to perform chemical pleurodesis, which involves obliteration of the pleural space with the creation of an artificial symphysis between the visceral and parietal pleura. Inflammatory reaction within the pleural space leads to the activation of the coagulation cascade with the formation of fibrogenic cytokines that promotes the development of pleurodesis by the formation of collagen.

Active pleurodesis can be achieved with the creation of a direct injury to the pleura with mechanical or physical methods such as mechanical injury or abrasion to the pleura during video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or the formation of intrapleural adhesions with the use of chemical agents such as talc, bleomycin, povidone-iodine, and Corynebacterium parvum. Antibiotics (Tetracycline, doxycycline, erythromycin, minocycline) as well as antiseptics (silver nitrate, iodopovidine), chemotherapeutic agents (mitomycin, bleomycin, cytarabine, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone), microorganisms (Corynebacterium parvum, Streptococcus pyogenes (OK432), and autologous blood have been used for performing chemical pleurodesis. Both pleural catheters, as well as medical thoracoscopy, have been used to introduce sclerosing agents into the pleural cavity. Life expectancy and patient factors play a crucial role in determining acceptability to the procedure.

Two major contraindications to pleurodesis include the presence of a non-re-expanded or trapped lung and loculated pleural effusion. The type of cancer, the extent of pleural involvement, and the type of sclerosant used for pleurodesis determine the degree of effectiveness of pleurodesis.

**Procedure Details**

Pleurodesis can be performed through a 28-32 French gauge chest tube or a pigtail catheter in a premedicated patient (provided adequate analgesia).

Specific risks of bleeding, pain, procedure failure rates (approaching 20 percent) should be explained to the patient.

Flushing of the catheter with normal saline should be performed after the installation of the slurry.

Respiratory rate, temperature, pain intensity, pulse rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and characteristics of the fluid drained should be monitored. A post-procedure chest radiograph should be performed to rule out pneumothorax and confirm the eradication of pleural fluid. Drain or catheter may be removed after 24 to 48 hours of sclerosant administration and following confirmation of a normal chest radiograph, decrease in the amount of pleural fluid drainage to less than 100 ml, and absence of air leak.

Patients in the recently concluded TAPPS trial were discharged following a pleurodesis procedure (talc slurry or thoracoscopic talc insufflation) when the total pleural fluid drain output was lesser than 250 ml per day.

Efficacy of pleurodesis has been defined as complete response with an absence of pleural fluid re-accumulation, partial with residual pleural fluid or fluid re-accumulation which remained asymptomatic and did not require a repeat drainage procedure, and failure where additional procedures have been required, up to six months (follow up period depends upon the patient's survival).

Contraindications to the performance of talc pleurodesis in recurrent pleural effusion may include pregnancy, previous intrapleural procedures or history of irradiation to the hemithorax, changes in systemic therapy in the previous two months, chylous or bilateral pleural effusions.

Medical grade talc has been shown to activate pleural mesothelial cells to produce significantly higher levels of basic fibroblast growth factor.

Risk factors for a failed pleurodesis include a history of prior irradiation and a chest tube in place for more than ten days.

No differences between the two procedures of talc installation (thoracoscopy guided Tac insufflation and bedside chest drain associated Talc slurry) with respect to the primary outcome indicator of Pleurodesis failure post 90 days of randomization have been reported in the recently concluded TAPPS trial.

**Indwelling Pleural Catheter**

Placement of indwelling pleural catheters is considered a safe and efficient method for drainage of pleural effusions in those with smaller or loculated recurrent pleural collections.

Bertolaccini et al. point out the lower rate of complications and advocate early implantation of indwelling pleural catheters to repeated needle thoracentesis.

**Comparison of Various Modalities of Treatment**

According to the results of a meta-analysis performed by Sivakumar et al., comparing patient-related outcomes with thoracoscopic talc insufflation, talc slurry, and indwelling pleural catheters, all procedures were shown to have a comparable effect upon the improvement in health-related quality of life parameters over the course of 12 weeks.

Successful outpatient rapid pleurodesis has been demonstrated using thoracoscopy and talc slurry with the insertion of a tunneled pleural catheter in the same setting.et al. was also able to demonstrate the efficacy of the indwelling pleural catheter as a cost-effective treatment method.et al.

The results of the ongoing SWIFT trial are expected to provide further insight into the efficacy and safety profile of drug-eluting pleural catheters. The sclerosant used in these trials consists of a slow-release coating of silver nitrate.

This network meta-analysis supports the use of Bedside graded talc as the sclerosant of choice, given the years of experience with the use of this modality.

**Special Scenarios**

**Trapped Lung**

Trapped lung is used to describe an advanced state of lung pathology in a patient with a history of malignant pleural effusion, which is characterized by the absence of the lung to fully expand, the failure of the visceral pleura to appose to the parietal pleura with the persistence of a residual hollow cavity.

Trapped lung may result from pleural thickening, which limits the movement of the visceral pleura, which may precede the development of a fibrinous exudate around the lung.

The radiological finding of pneumothorax ex vacuo, which has been characterized by the failure of the lung to expand after drainage of pleural fluid, might represent a manifestation of trapped lung. Thoracic ultrasonography might be useful in differentiating between pleural thickening, pleural fluid, and consolidation.

All cases of non-expandable lung do not meet the criteria for a trapped lung.

Pleural fluid elastance is measured by the decrease in pleural fluid pressures in cm of water after removing 500 ml of fluid by thoracentesis.

**Persistent Air Leaks**

The possibility of developing pneumothorax after ultrasound-guided thoracentesis is small (3 to 4 percent) but significant.

Wait and watch/ expectant management - The American College of Chest Physicians has advised a period of conservative management for four days, during which the fistulous communication is expected to close on its own.

**Septated Pleural Effusion**

Fibrin-rich effusion fluids can lead to the development of pockets within the effusion.et al.

There is a need to differentiate septations from vascularized adhesions which might develop when fibrinous septations become infiltrated with fibroblasts and undergo organization with the laying down of collagen fibrils.

Significant adhesions may represent a potential cause of failure to drain an effusion effectively.

TIME 3 trial demonstrated no clinically significant improvement in dyspnea or time to pleurodesis failure rates over one year with intrapleural streptokinase instillation in non-draining malignant septated pleural effusions.

Another concern with the use of fibrinolytics remains the possibility of hemorrhage into the pleural fluid, which has been attributed to the presence of friable vessels within the hemorrhagic fluid due to neo-angiogenesis.

**Malignant Eosinophilic Pleural Effusion**

MEPE has been defined by the presence of more than 10 percent of eosinophils in the differential white blood cell count in the first thoracentesis, and the presence of exudative effusion along with histological confirmation of malignancy.

The formation of MEPE involves two steps, accumulation and migration.

Though cancer-directed therapies have been shown to control pleural fluid formation in Small cell lung cancer, strategies that positively impact survival are yet to be developed.

**Hemorrhagic Malignant Pleural Effusion**

This occurs with a frequency of 47 to 50 percent. HMPE is usually characterized by the presence of a pronounced degree of dyspnea, higher incidence of chest pain, deterioration in general physical condition, co-occurrence with large effusion, and thickening with parietal pleural effusion.

**Palliative Symptom Directed Management of Dyspnea in Advanced Cancer**

Dyspnea has been defined as a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity.

The feeling of breathlessness in advanced cancer has been explained by a mismatch between afferent sensory information sent by the afferent receptors and the Respiratory motor command from the cortex and brainstem.

Patient-reported outcomes are considered the gold standard in the assessment of breathlessness.

Management of chronic breathlessness syndrome usually requires specialist palliative medicine input. Palliative interventions, which may include pharmacological and non-pharmacological management, are provided through a series of visits across many settings.

Supplemental oxygen (Palliative oxygen therapy) is indicated in patients with chronic severe hypoxemia (partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) less than 7.3kPa, corresponding to a SpO2 >88%).

The use of non-invasive ventilation may improve both oxygenation and hypoventilation and support chest wall muscles.

**Caregiver Distress**

A substantial body of data demonstrates that carers of someone suffering from chronic breathlessness experience profound anxiety, isolation, exhaustion, and poor sleep.

The phenomenon of compassion fatigue (Burnout and secondary traumatic stress) in healthcare professionals involved in caring for patients with terminal life-limiting illnesses also needs to be recognized.

# Differential Diagnosis

**Clinical differential diagnoses**- Raised hemidiaphragm (phrenic nerve palsy, liver enlargement), pleural thickening (secondary to previous tuberculosis, empyema), plaques, consolidation, and lobar collapse,

**Radiological differential diagnoses**- The differential includes pleural thickening, plaques (benign and malignant), pseudo-plaques, and inferior pulmonary ligament. Pseudo-plaques are defined as plaque-like lung opacities formed by small nodules and contiguous with the visceral pleura. These are formed by small coalescent nodules, commonly seen in sarcoidosis, coal workers pneumoconiosis, and silicosis.

**Histopathological differential diagnoses**- Non-specific pleuritis - cytology negative exudative pleural effusion without a definable etiology after histopathological analysis.

# Prognosis

LENT, modified LENT, and the PROMISE scores have been developed to predict patients with MPE

The LENT score consists of the following four parameters - pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and Ttmor type

The SELECT score uses the following markers for predicting the 90-day survival in these patients - Sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, Leucocyte count, EGFR status, chemotherapy, and primary tumor type.

It has also been suggested that prognostication in this domain needs to be individualized, emphasizing developing systems that include patient preferences, newer targeted therapy, immunotherapy approaches, and symptom burden within their purview.

Patients with an actionable mutation with non-small cell lung cancer and malignant pleural effusion have been associated with a similar risk of recurrence when compared to those without an actionable mutation.

# Complications

Trapped lung, persistent air leaks after chest tube insertion (for iatrogenic pneumothorax), and septated effusion are all potential complications. Complications of treatment have been mentioned in the article elsewhere. These include complications associated with procedures used for draining pleural fluid (thoracoscopic talc poudrage, talc slurry, tunneled catheter insertion, and pleurodesis). MPE does not have a cure, and the goals of treatment include palliation of symptoms. The financial difficulty related to repeated procedures in families strained by the economic hardships brought on by cancer treatment also needs to be recognized.

# Pearls and Other Issues

**Paramalignant pleural effusion**- needs to be distinguished from malignant pleural effusion due to different prognostic implications. Pathophysiological processes underlying the development of para-malignant pleural effusions may include tumor-associated obstruction, chylous effusion associated with obstruction of the thoracic duct, pulmonary embolism-related effusion, effusion secondary to hypoalbuminemia (driven by a low colloidal osmotic pressure). Superior vena caval obstruction may be seen, both as a late adverse effect of radiotherapy to the mediastinum and increased systemic venous pressures due to local effects of the tumor.

**Treatment-related effusions**- Radiotherapy, conventional chemotherapy (bleomycin, procarbazine, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate), targeted therapy (dasatinib), and immunotherapy.

**Other causes of pleural fluid accumulation**- Congestive heart failure, hepatic decompensation, and renal failure.

Tumor clonal evolution owing to pharmacological pressure to anticancer treatment has been shown to underlie the differences in mutations in the primary tumor and the pleural metastases. Personalized MPE therapy based upon the actionable mutation discovered in the malignant pleural cells might represent the future of definitive treatment

The utility of intrapleural immune stimulants is also being explored as both a potential anti-tumor and sclerosant treatment. Ren et al. have demonstrated increased survival in patients undergoing pleurodesis with Staphylococcus aureus bioproduct mixture due to its immune-stimulating effect on T cells, which might predispose to tumor cell apoptosis in malignant mesothelioma.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Interdisciplinary management of malignant pleural effusion is an essential component of the comprehensive management of advanced cancer patients. Management of medical issues in advanced cancer may play an important role in improving the patient's survival along with a significant impact on quality of life. Dyspnea is one of the key symptoms that have been shown to have a substantial impact on the advanced cancer patient's quality of life.

It is pertinent to treat correctable causes of breathlessness before proceeding to pharmacological measures that function by decreasing the patient's perception of discomfort (due to breathlessness). The degree of aggressiveness of treatment is a contentious but important region that requires family participation. Therapeutic interventions for the management of malignant pleural effusion may be delivered by Medical oncologists, Respiratory medicine physicians, Surgical oncologists, and Palliative medicine experts.

Management of Pleural effusion in the advanced cancer patient at the end of life is a challenge that demands a relook a the conventional role of a palliative medicine consult. The advanced cancer patient with a unique set of physical (medical and surgical), psychological, social, and spiritual issues presents a unique challenge for inpatient admission in the palliative medicine ward. The European Society of Medical Oncology has proposed using the term patient-centered care to encompass both palliative and supportive care provision. Their definition of the patient-centered approach includes Assessment, monitoring, and interventions, management of cancer-related symptoms, along with management of anti-cancer treatment-related complications. These guidelines remain the only official set of guidelines that acknowledge the role of the supportive and palliative medicine expert in the management of this medical condition directly.
