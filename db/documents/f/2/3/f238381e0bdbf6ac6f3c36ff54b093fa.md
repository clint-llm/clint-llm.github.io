A videofluoroscopic swallow study is most often used to evaluate:

- Potential aspiration

- Oropharyngeal dysphagia

- Odynophagia or globus sensation

Evaluations for dysphagia or aspiration are often performed:

- Post cerebral infarct

- Patient with a history of neuromuscular disease

- FollowingÂ head and neck surgery

- After radiation to the head or neck

There are few absolute contraindications. If the patient is grossly aspirating on an exam, then the exam can be performed quickly and carefully to gather limited information on why the aspiration is occurring and which structures are involved, but this must always be balanced against the risk of large volume aspiration of barium contrast medium, which can markedly impair respiratory function.

The patient usually must be able to sit or stand, and the exam is only rarely performed in a supine position. The patient must be coherent and able to follow instructions to participate in the examination.
