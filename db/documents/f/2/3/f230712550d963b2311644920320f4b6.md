Serotonin is a compound thatÂ functions in both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. It acts in the form of the hormone, neurotransmitter, and mitogen in our body.

Later, researchers identified that serotonin is also released as a neurotransmitter in the human brain. These excretory clusters of neurons became known as the serotonergic system. The various functions of serotonin in the CNS are comprehensive and relate to the action of the serotonergic system on the forebrain, brainstem, and cerebellum.

At the most simple level, serotonin functions by meditating an animal's perception of its own bodily resources. When the levels of basic resources such as food, water, and sleep are sufficient, the animal shows higher levels of serotonin, correlating to an increased perception of happiness.
