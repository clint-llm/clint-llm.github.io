Thyroid adenomas are benign lesions of the thyroid gland. These lesions may be inactive or active in producing thyroid hormones. In the case of being active, they may be referred to as toxic thyroid adenomas. There are two types of thyroid adenomas, follicular and papillary. Most thyroid adenomas do not cause any symptoms and are usually diagnosed incidentally by ultrasound of the thyroid gland. Thyroid adenoma usually presents as a solitary thyroid nodule. It is important to exclude malignancies from the differential diagnosis because thyroid carcinoma mimics adenoma. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of thyroid adenoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of thyroid adenoma.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of thyroid adenoma.
- Outline the management options available for thyroid adenoma.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve the outcomes of patients with a thyroid adenoma.
