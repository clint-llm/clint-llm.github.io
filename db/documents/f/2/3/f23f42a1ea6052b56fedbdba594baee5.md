Recovery following direct brow lift surgery may vary due to the individual patient's functional and nutritional status. Judicious local wound care is important to ensure a healthy and clean surgical environment. Suction drains are rarely ever necessary. Blood thinners may be restarted the following day after surgery. The patient should be counseled to avoid heavy lifting or straining until seen in follow-up to allow for appropriate wound healing. When the proper sterile technique is employed, post-operative antibiotics are not necessary. Permanent sutures for skin closure, if utilized, should be removed within 5 to 7 days, depending on the amount of wound tension present. Following surgery, the patient is typically followed regularly until proper healing is ensured.
