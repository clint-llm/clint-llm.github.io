Medical treatment for the dissolution of existing uric acid stones is very effective. Prognosis of uric acid nephrolithiasis is usually good if proper treatment is followed consistently. Recurrent uric acid nephrolithiasis can be prevented by adopting good dietary habits, avoiding dehydration, treating hyperuricosuria and/or hyperuricosuria, and proper usage of alkalinizing agents. Almost 2/3rd of uric acid stones can be dissolved by adopting the following measures:

- Treating aciduria by maintaining urine pH at 6.5 - 7. If this is not feasible or possible, try to get the urine pH at least up to 6.

- Maintaining adequate hydration and urine volume.

- Reduction of hyperuricosuria to less than 600 mg/day with the use of allopurinol or febuxostat.

- Treatment of hyperuricemia to less than 6 mg/dL by using allopurinol or febuxostat.
