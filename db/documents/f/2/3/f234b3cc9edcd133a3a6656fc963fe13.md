Effusive constrictive pericarditis is best managed by an interprofessional team that also includes cardiac nurse practitioners. While aspiration may temporarily relieve symptoms, the definitive treatment is pericardiectomy. However, before surgery is undertaken, the patient's medical condition must be optimized. Following pericardiectomy, most patients are relieved of symptoms.
