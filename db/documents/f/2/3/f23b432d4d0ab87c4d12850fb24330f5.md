Cannabinoids have served numerous roles in medicine, culture, and recreation for almost as long as recorded human history. With pharmaceutical and illicit forms available to patients, healthcare providers and other interprofessional healthcare team members must be equipped with the knowledge to identify symptoms of cannabinoid abuse and toxicity and take steps to mitigate adverse outcomes. However, medical professionals must also understand medical conditions that may respond to treatment with appropriately dosed and administered cannabinoids.

Cannabinoids can be recommended or prescribed by clinicians (physicians such as MDs and DOs, and mid-level providers like NPs and PAs) in accordance with the current evidence-based information. Nursing staff can also play a role in counseling patients and answering questions. As with any medication, the pharmacist should verify dosing, check for any potential drug-drug interactions, perform complete medication reconciliation, and provide any additional counseling the patient may need regarding dosing, administration, monitoring for adverse events, and answer any questions the patient may have. This approach demonstrates how all members of today's integrated, interprofessional health team must demonstrate full engagement regarding the entire spectrum of cannabinoids' ability to help and harm patients so that they can achieve an optimal balance.
