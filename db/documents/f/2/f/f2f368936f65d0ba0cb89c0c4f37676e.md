Complications related specifically to the TTMPB occur quite rarely. In general, classic complications observed during or following regional anesthetic blocks include excessive bleeding at the puncture site, development of infection at the site of the block, neurovascular damage, and LAST.

The TTMPB poses specific complication risks, given the surrounding anatomy. Given the proximity of the transversus thoracis muscle to the pleura, puncture of the pleural layer from an errant needle tip may lead to pneumothorax development. Similarly, the internal thoracic artery and pericardium are nearby structures that may also be damaged from poor needle placement and can lead to complications such as hemothorax and hemopericardium.
