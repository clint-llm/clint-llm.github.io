The cause of PCV is considered to result from inner choroidal vessel abnormalities. These vessels have multiple, small, polyp-shaped aneurysms that form as a result of a defective vascular lining. These vessels have thinned out endothelial cells and reduced pericytes compared to normal vasculature.

One suggested mechanism for developing these polypoidal lesions is that venules form polypoidal protrusions when compressed by a sclerosed arteriole at an arterio-venous crossing site. The resulting venous stasis leads to the degeneration of tissue and fragility.
