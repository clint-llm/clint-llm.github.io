The frequency of Ehrlichia diagnoses is increasing, which may be due to an increase in recognition and diagnostic availability as well as the expansion of the regions in which the most common tick vector, the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum) resides. Most Ehrlichia infections in the United States are due to Ehrlichia chaffeesis, with Ehrlichia ewingii reported less frequently. Ehrlichia infections occur predominantly in areas in which the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum) is prevalent, such as the South Central United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, over 30% of reported Ehrlichia infections in the United States were from the states of Oklahoma, Missouri, and Arkansas. Infections are reported most commonly during the summer months, coincident with the adult and nymphal stages of the tick life cycle in which ticks are most likely to bite humans. Infections are also reported most commonly in the elderly. However, children are known to experience milder or subclinical infections, and thus, reports may underrepresent this population.
