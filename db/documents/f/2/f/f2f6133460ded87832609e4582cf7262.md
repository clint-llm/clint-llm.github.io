Prognosis is generally good since it is a benign disease that does not pose any increased risk of malignancy. Although the severity of the disease is variable, the cure can occur spontaneously with no specific treatment; at other extreme, patients with a severe course of the disease may require medical or surgical therapies. Survival is not affected and remains similar to a healthy same age population.
