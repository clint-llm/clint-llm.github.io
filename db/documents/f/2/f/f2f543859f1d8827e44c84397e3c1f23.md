Atopic individuals have a lifelong tendency for the development of allergic reactions as it is incurable. Nevertheless, the manifestations of atopy often change over some time. Atopic dermatitis has a better prognosis and is treatable with some success with immunotherapy. Allergic asthma has a prognosis that varies according to the persistence of the causative environmental allergen, the IgE levels in blood or tissues, and the genetic makeup.

Systemic anaphylaxis is the occurrence of an immunoglobulin E mediated reaction simultaneously in multiple tissues. The causative allergen is an insect venom, food or drug. The reaction is potentially fatal and can be evoked by a tiny quantity of allergen. The prognosis of anaphylaxis is very poorly and requires immediate medical care.
