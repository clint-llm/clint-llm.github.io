Spontaneous muscular hematomas are classically associated with anticoagulation treatment and typically occur in three anatomic regions:

**Anterior AbdominalÂ Musculature**

The anterior abdominal wall consists of the rectus abdominis, the external oblique, the internal oblique, and the transverse abdominis. These muscles obtain their vascular supply from the inferior epigastric arteries and the circumflex iliac arteries.

**Posterior Abdominal Musculature**

The posterior abdominal muscles consist of the iliacus, the psoas, and the erector spinae muscles, each of which receives their vascular supply from the posterior gluteal trunk via the lumbar and iliolumbar arteries.

**Muscles of the Buttocks**

The muscles of the buttocks are the gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus, as well as the piriformis and the short external rotators. The internal iliac artery supplies this complex of muscles via the superior and inferior gluteal muscles.
