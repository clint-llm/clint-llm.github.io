# Introduction

The lower leg divides into three fascial compartments:

- Anterior

- Lateral

- Posterior

These compartments are formed and separated via divisions by the anterior and posterior intermuscular septa, and the interosseous membrane.

- The anterior compartment musculature functions to primarily dorsiflex the foot and ankle

- The lateral compartment musculature functions to plantar flex and evert the foot

- The posterior compartment musculature functions to plantarflex and invert the foot

The posterior compartment of the leg (often referred to as the "calf") further divides into distinct superficial and deep compartments by the transverse intermuscular septum.  The larger, superficial compartment of the lower leg contains the gastrocnemius, soleus (GS) and plantaris muscles.

The deep layer of the leg's posterior compartment contains the popliteus, flexor digitorum longus, flexor hallucis longus, and tibialis posterior muscles. The various muscles of the posterior compartment primarily originate at the two bones of the leg, the tibia, and the fibula. The tibia is a large weight-bearing bone, often referred to as the "shin bone," and articulates with the femoral condyles superiorly and the talus inferiorly.

# Structure and Function

The divisions of the lower leg are made up by intermuscular septa that are extensions of the overlying fascia. Within the posterior compartment of the leg, an additional septum further separates the compartment into two additional layers; superficial and deep. It was traditionally felt that the fascia overlying specialized organs and tissues within the body are irrelevant and only served to hold in place a particular tissue type.

The three muscles within the superficial posterior compartment include the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles. Together these three muscles form the triceps surae.

Gait is most commonly subdivided into a stance phase and a swing phase (although additional phases can exist depending on clinical scenario).

# Embryology

Limb development in the human embryo originates from mesenchymal tissue, derived from the lateral plate of the mesoderm, encased within ectoderm.

# Blood Supply and Lymphatics

The posterior compartment of the leg receives vascular supply from the posterior tibial artery.

# Nerves

The tibial nerve provides innervation of the posterior leg compartment.

# Muscles

Muscles of the posterior compartment are in two subdivisions: a superficial and deep layer.

**Superficial Posterior Muscles**

The gastrocnemius muscle is made up of separate lateral and medial heads.

A deep calcaneal bursa between the tendon and bone facilitates frictionless gliding of the tendon over the bone.  The soleus muscle originates on the posterior surface of the fibula as well as the soleal line on the tibia.  As a unit, the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles form the triceps surae.

Deep to the triceps surae lies the plantaris muscle. This muscle originates on the lateral supracondylar line of the femur and inserts onto the tuberosity of the calcaneus adjacent to the AT. The plantaris muscle is commonly a source for grafting material. The triceps surae muscles provide for plantar flexion of the foot. However, the gastrocnemius muscle itself can also facilitate flexion of the knee. The plantaris muscle allows minor plantar flexion as well.

**Deep Posterior Muscle**

The most superior muscle of the deep posterior compartment of the lower leg is the popliteus muscle.

The flexor hallucis longus (FHL) originates from the posterior surface of the fibula and inserts into the base of the great toe's distal phalanx. The FHL tendon travels below the sustentaculum tali and is held in place by the annular ligament. The FHL muscle plantarflexes the talocrural joint and the metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the great toe.

The flexor digitorum longus (FDL) muscles originate from the posterior surface of the tibia and inserts onto the distal phalanges of the 2nd to 5ith digits in the foot. The FDL muscle crosses both the talocrural joint and metatarsophalangeal joints, serving as an active plantar flexor of both joints.  The FDL also plantarflexes the metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints of the 2nd through 5th toes.

An accessory FDL muscle is said to be present in 15% of the population.

# Surgical Considerations

**Acute Compartment Syndrome (ACS)**

Compartment syndrome develops when pressures within a closed compartment (i.e., the lower leg) exceeds the perfusion pressure of the vessel, leading to tissue ischemia, nerve compression, and subsequent pain out of proportion on exam.

ACS commonly presents in patients sustaining blunt trauma from motor vehicle accidents. Young patients suffering from tibial fractures of the diaphysis are at higher risk for developing compartment syndrome and must be monitored accordingly.

**Four Compartment Fasciotomy**

Current management of compartment syndrome involves releasing all four lower leg compartments.

- Neurovascular injury

- Soft tissue injury

**Pediatric Considerations**

Tibial fractures are among the most common fractures sustained by the pediatric population.

Indications for lower extremity amputations include the presence of lower extremity ischemia from arterial occlusion (including critical limb ischemia), distal extremity infection, or presence of a malignant tumor.

**Achilles Tendon Rupture**

The Achilles tendon is the strongest tendon, and susceptible to injury and rupture.

Treatment

- Rest/activity modification

- NSAIDs

- Physical therapy (e.g., eccentric exercises)

Though tendinopathy management is generally with nonoperative treatment modalities, acute AT ruptures may require surgical intervention.  A common repair technique for tears located near the musculotendinous junction includes a direct end-to-end repair (open versus percutaneous techniques).  Direct repairs are most amenable to healing within six weeks out from the injury date.  The data remains controversial regarding the outcome following surgery compared to nonoperative management (i.e., functional bracing/rehab protocols).

**Gastrocnemius Tears**

Tearing of the gastrocnemius muscle is a common injury in patients over the age of 40 years, and is often referred to as tennis leg, because of its prevalence within the sport.

# Clinical Significance

Accessory muscles of the posterior leg compartment may be present in patients and lead to potential sequelae. Reported accessory muscles have included an additional muscular tissue connecting the lower flexor hallucis longus and the tibialis posterior muscle. There are cases where this muscle crosses the posterior tibial artery and may be a source of entrapment. Additional accessory muscles have been said to originate in the interosseous membrane, near the tibia,  and insert into connective tissue surrounding the posterior tibial vessels. These situations also serve as a potential source of compression for the vasculature.

Aside from anatomical compressions of neurovascular bundles, injury may also take place iatrogenically. For example, fibular graft harvests, tibial osteotomies, and fasciotomy are all procedures in which there is an increased risk of tibial nerve injury. Knowledge of the branching points of the tibial nerve into the specific muscles of the posterior leg is essential to avoid such injuries and subsequent motor loss.

Focal myositis is a rare inflammatory pseudotumor that may present in the posterior leg compartment. Diagnosis is difficult as clinicians may often misinterpret the tumor for other neoplastic processes and inflammatory myopathies. However specific histopathological changes that should be noted include B cell and dendritic plasmacytoid cell lesions, without any viral or molecular infectious source. Additionally, the presence of IgG4 and fibrosis has also been associated with focal myositis.

Physiologically, the pressure of surface veins in the leg decreases when a person is ambulatory.

Restless leg syndrome is characterized by spontaneous, nocturnal leg movements and has a prevalence of about 2-9% in elderly patients.

Leg cramps are characterized by involuntarily, episodic, skeletal muscle contractions of the calf muscles, associated with pain, and typically occurring at night.
