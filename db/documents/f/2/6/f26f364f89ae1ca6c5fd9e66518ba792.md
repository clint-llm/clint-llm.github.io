Testing for an intact motor cortical pathway can involve deep tendon reflex testing. The biceps (C5, C6), brachioradialis (C6), triceps (C7), patellar (L4), and Achilles tendon (S1) can be tested to assess intact nerve roots. When stretched, the muscle spindle sends a signal down the 1 alpha nerve fiber. The fiber enters the spinal column via the dorsal root and synapses onto a lower motor neuron and interneuron. The lower motor neuron will cause the agonist muscle to contract while the interneuron will cause the antagonist muscle to relax.
