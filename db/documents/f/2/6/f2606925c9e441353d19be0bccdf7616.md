Retained dental roots may present with one or many indications for removal. Some of the most common indications for the extraction of root fragments are:

- The presence of acute or chronic infection

- Partial or complete fracture of the crown

- Future dental implant placement

- Pain

- Vertical root fractures

- Periodontal disease

- Caries

- Presence of pathology

- Future prosthetic restoration of the site with a fixed or removable prosthesis

- Preservation of vital adjacent teeth and structures

- Patient esthetic concerns

Sometimes retained roots are removed prophylactically, even in the asymptomatic patient. A patient may require prophylactic root removal when their future access to care is known to be limited or non-existent (e.g., patients deploying in the military).

Another example of when prophylactic extraction may be necessary is in patients planning to undergo radiation therapy to the head and neck for cancer treatment or in patients requiring medications known to contribute to osteonecrosis of the jaw.Â It is the surgeon's responsibility to discuss all applicable indications, risks, and benefits for root removal for the patient to provide informed consent for surgery.
