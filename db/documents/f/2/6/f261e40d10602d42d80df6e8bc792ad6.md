The most important factor in determining patient education would be targeting patients who have modifiable risk factors. Patients who are at increased risk of thrombus formation are those who are obese, use oral contraceptive pills and have a smoking history.  Education and prevention of these modifiable risk factors will make the most significant difference. For those patients who have a hereditary disorder such as Factor V Leiden, the importance of long-term anticoagulation must be discussed to prevent thrombus formation.
