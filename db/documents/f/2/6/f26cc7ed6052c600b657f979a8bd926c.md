There may be a history of worsening headaches with vision changes such as blurred vision or “spots.” Hypertension and proteinuria may be present or absent. Impending eclampsia may have clonus. Eclampsia is a clinical diagnosis described by the occurrence of new-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizures in a woman with preeclampsia; however, on occasion, it may be the first presentation of preeclampsia. Clinical findings may include posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (due to vasogenic edema predominantly localized in the posterior cerebral hemispheres), including headaches, confusion, visual symptoms, and seizure.
