Alongside educating patients about the importance of making healthy lifestyle choices, it is also imperative that the physicians, nurses, and other allied health professionals work together as an interprofessional team inÂ diligently monitoring patients while admitted. Patients on clozapine need to have their WBC measured regularly as they are at risk of agranulocytosis, while a risk assessment should be carried out on all new patients to evaluate their risk of harm to self or others. Outside of the hospital setting, community psychiatric nurses and family physicians can also educate the patient and provide further information while also monitoring for early signs of relapse.
