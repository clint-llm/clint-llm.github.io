The fecal occult blood test (FOBT) can be performed in the inpatient or outpatient setting. In the inpatient setting, the stool may be obtained manually during a digital rectal examination and placed onto heme occult testing cards. In the outpatient setting, the patient typically obtains a stool sample at home and then submits it to a laboratory.

Feces should ideally be sampled before they come into contact with the toilet water since hemoglobin will leach out of the sample, and toilet sanitizers may affect the results. Because blood may not be uniformly distributed within the stools, and bleeding may be intermittent, it is important to collect samples from more than one area; collection should be repeated on three different days.

It is best not to expose the sample to extreme heat or humidity; dried samples can be stored at room temperature for 14 days.

In some immunological methods, collection devices with liquid preservatives are used, and samples from patients can be collected by smearing the stools onto the card provided.
