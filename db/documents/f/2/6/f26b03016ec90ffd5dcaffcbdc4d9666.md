**Staging**

The classification applies only to carcinomas of the major salivary glands. Tumors arising in minor salivary glands are not included in this classification. The staging of metastatic neck nodes for salivary gland cancer is similar to that for other metastatic diseases. T-stage, according to the 8th edition of the UICC/AJCC staging manual (2016) is as follows:

- T1: Tumor 2 cm or less in greatest dimension without extra-parenchymal extension*

- T2: Tumor more than 2 cm but not more than 4 cm in greatest dimension without extra-parenchymal extension*

- T3: Tumor more than 4 cm and/or tumor with extra-parenchymal extension*

- T4a: Tumor invades skin, mandible, ear canal, and/or facial nerve

- T4b: Tumor invades base of the skull, and/or pterygoid plates, and/or encases carotid artery

* Extraparenchymal extension is clinical or macroscopic evidence of invasion of soft tissues or nerve, except those listed under T4a and 4b. Microscopic evidence alone does not constitute extra-parenchymal extension for classification purposes.
