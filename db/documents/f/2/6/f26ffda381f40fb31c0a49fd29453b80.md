The incidence of SIADH increases with age but, recently, a higher incidence of SIADH has been reported in children. Children and older adults are more hyponatremic,Â particularly when hospitalized for respiratory and CNS infections like pneumonia or meningitis. SIADH is also more prevalent in hospitalized, post-operative patients due to the administration of hypotonic fluids, drugs, and the body's response to stress.
