The differential diagnosis of Mondor disease varies depending upon the location of symptoms. In general, such conditions as thrombophlebitis migrans, infectious mastitis, Buerger disease, Behçet disease, and polyarteritis nodosa should be entertained and ruled out. Other breast pathology, including mastitis and breast abscesses, will be accompanied by a patient complaining of significant pain with palpable fluctuance in the case of an abscess. Inflammatory breast cancer is known for its quickly progressive skin changes and ability to mimic worsening mastitis; as such, it must be considered in the evaluation of patients presenting with any breast complaint. Patients with inflammatory breast cancer will have progressive, worsening symptoms with skin changes, including erythema, breast enlargement, and pain.
