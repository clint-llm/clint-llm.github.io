TTM provides guidelines for "changers" and assists various health care professionals when helping individuals who are considering a change. Team members must be mindful that the majority of "changers" are not in the action stage. As such, it is reasonable to expect low registration rates and/or high dropout rates when creating and implementing an action-based treatment plan for the collective of "changers."

Therefore, treating every "changer" as if they are in the action stage does not adequately serve those contemplating change and ultimately leads to premature relapse. Once the client's stage of change is determined, health care professionals can better assist with change behavior. The type, duration, and intensity of therapy should be geared towards which stage the individual finds themselves in at the time.

Studies show that moving from one stage to the next within one month will double one's chances of acting on changing behavior in the next six months of treatment.

In summary, processes of change, when paired with their appropriate stages of change (TTM) counterparts, provide the best support for change.
