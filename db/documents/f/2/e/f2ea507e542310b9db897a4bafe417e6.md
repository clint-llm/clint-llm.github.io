As a pathophysiologic mechanism of arrhythmias, the incidence and prevalence depend on the arrhythmia ranging from highly prevalent diseases like atrial fibrillation to rare diseases like Wolff-Parkinson-White atrioventricular reentry tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation occurs inÂ 10% of the over 60-years old. In patients undergoing surgery for mitral valve disease, it can be found in 60% of the cases. Atrial fibrillation is associated with increased mortality due to three problems: thromboembolism causing stroke, decreased cardiac output due to atrioventricular synchrony, and irregular heartbeat.

Regarding the epidemiology of SVT, the AHA/ACC/HRS guideline from 2015 reports a prevalence of 2.29 per 1000 persons, an incidence of 36 per 100.000 persons per year and approximately 89.000 new cases per year and 570.000 people living with SVT. AVNRT is more common in middle-aged or older person, whereas AVRT is more prevalent in adolescents. ECG changes due to WPW syndrome can be found in 0.1 to 0.3% of the population.
