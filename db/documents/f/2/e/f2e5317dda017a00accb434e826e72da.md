After providing proper preparation and anesthesia, visualization via nasal endoscopy begins. Under direct endoscopic visualization, the guide catheter is inserted into the nasal cavity and visually guided into the opening of the intended ostia. The guidewire then gets extended into the appropriate sinus ostia. Either fluoroscopy or, more commonly, external transillumination through the sinus cavity confirms the guidewire placement. Upon confirmation of guidewire placement in the correct anatomical location, the balloon isÂ advanced over the guidewire to completely penetrate the ostia. The balloon is then inflated to 8 to 2 atmospheres of pressure based on physician preference, deflated, and then reinflated a second time. Upon removal of the deflated balloon, the sinus may be rinsed with normal saline via a lavage tube in an operating room setting. Normal saline rinses are rarely used during an in-office setting due to the lack of a protected airway.

Postprocedure management of BSP does vary from provider to provider, but some general recommendations include:

- Vision assessment and mental status exam performed by the physician

- Saline nasal spray with a short course of nasal steroids

- Follow up office visits with nasal endoscopy at one week, three months, and one year from the date of surgery

- Follow up CT scan of the sinuses at three months to compare Lund-McKay scores

- Postoperative quality of life scores at 3, 6, and 12 months compared with their respective preoperative quality of life scoring. These can include the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-20), the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scale, or Rhinosinusitis Symptom Inventory, among others.
