All healthcare workers, including physicians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners who prescribe inhalers, should educate the patients on how to use these medications. It is essential to use a face mask in children under the age of 4. Caution is necessary when treating patients with cardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease, as albuterol may exacerbate heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. It is also essential to monitor patients closely with diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, hypokalemia, or glaucoma.

While the clinician will initiate albuterol therapy, the nurse and pharmacist will play significant roles in contributing to the interprofessional team management of treatment. Nursing can provide education on administration and dosing, and monitor therapy at subsequent visits while also assessing patient adherence. The pharmacist can assist in this area, demonstrating proper inhaler use, how to use a spacer, and how to operate and load the nebulizer. Both nurses and pharmacists need an open line of communication with the prescribing clinician to report any concerns. Albuterol management with an interprofessional team will best drive positive patient outcomes.
