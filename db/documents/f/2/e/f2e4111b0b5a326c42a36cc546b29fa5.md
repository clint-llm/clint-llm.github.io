Voclosporin is an oral CNI that binds cyclophilin A in T-cells.

Inhibition of this critical metabolic step precludes NFAT from activating the translation and transcription of various cytokines produced by T-helper-1 cells, including interleukin-2 (IL-2). IL-2 is a T-cell growth factor vital for the proliferation of T cells and for the generation of effector and memory cells.

Activated calcineurin dephosphorylates synaptopodin which is then metabolized by a lysosomal protease.

The modification of amino acid-1 changes the primary site of metabolism to the amino acid-9 position. The modification results in a lower degree of competitive inhibition and a low metabolite load.

**Pharmacokinetics**

The major circulating component is voclosporin. A major metabolite of voclosporin with approximately 8-fold less potency than the parent molecule represented about 16.7% of total exposure in whole human blood.

After six days of twice daily dosing, voclosporin can achieve steady-state concentrations.

When administered with low- or high-fat meals in healthy adults, Cmax decreases by 29% to 53%.
