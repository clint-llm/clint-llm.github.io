Over time, many striae improve. The best time to perform a treatment (with proper photographs as discussed) is once the striae have stabilized. Many creams for striae are promoted on the internet with little evidence of the efficacy. The public should be made aware that the efficacy is very limited Newer lasers and radiofrequency treatments hold promise as they do try to modify the vascularity and the collagen and perhaps the elastin. Again, there is no clear leader among the many lasers that are promoted. The needle radiofrequency seems to show promise as, in theory, the deeper deliver of the energy may allow "shrinkage" of the striae in all directions, thereby improving the overall appearance. (Level V).
