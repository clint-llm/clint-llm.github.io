The ileocolic artery is the most inferior branch of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), supplying blood to the distal ileum, ileocecal valve, cecum, vermiform appendix, and the proximal ascending colon. The ileocolic artery and its branches are of major surgical and clinical significance for the following reasons:

- Ligation and complete hemostasis of the ileocolic artery or its branches must occur during appendectomy or Meckel diverticulectomy.

- Ischemia with possible necrosis of the viscus organs supplied by the ileocolic artery may occur in the setting of intussusception.

- Ischemia in the ileocolic distribution may occur with superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism.

- Special attention must be paid in the setting of colon cancer resection to sites of vessel anastomoses, to include the right colic to ileocolic arteries for purposes of hemostasis.

- Lymphatic drainage mirrors vascular supply; therefore, understanding of anatomy and anatomic variation is essential for successful oncologic surgery.

- Understanding of the vascular anatomy of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of GI bleeds.
