The treatment of paradoxical embolism is based on both medical and surgical approaches.Â  The treatment pathways are divided into three general approaches:

- Elimination of the pathway allowing embolization (through surgical or percutaneous approach)

- Medical treatment to prevent recurrent episodes of venous thrombosis.

- Combination of medical and surgical approaches

The choice of either and its specific plan is dependent on the risk of stroke recurrence, the lifelong benefit/risk ratio between antithrombotic therapy and surgery, as well as the cost of each intervention. The surgical approach includes occlusion of intracardiac shunts and PAVMs. Medical therapy is comprised of antithrombotic therapy, which includes aspirin, or clopidogrel as monotherapy or taken in combination with warfarin for the prevention of thrombotic events.

The initial treatment is always anticoagulation. If the patient has an intracardiac communication, it may be closed percutaneously or with open-heart surgery. Today, many types of devices are available to close cardiac shunts percutaneously with minimal morbidity.

Thrombolysis is often used in acute cases where the patient is hemodynamically unstable. Both DVT and pulmonary embolus need long term anticoagulation treatment. Some patients may need to be on antiplatelet therapy for life.
