Vision changes in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia are most commonly due to ocular and/or brain pathology but can occasionally be caused by medical therapy. It is important to be evaluated by both obstetric and ophthalmologic professionals to determine the cause. The development of preeclampsia during pregnancy can increase the risk for other eye and brain diseases post-partum.
