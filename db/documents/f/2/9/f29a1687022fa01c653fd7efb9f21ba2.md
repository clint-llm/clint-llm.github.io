Laboratory evidence of high serum viscosity establishes the diagnosis. There is controversy over whether whole blood viscosity versus serum viscosity is superior, but most clinical laboratories measure the viscosity of the serum component of blood. Viscosity is measured in the unit of centipoise (cp). The viscosity of water is 1 cp. Normal serum viscosity relative to water is 1.4 to 1.8 cp. Symptoms of hyperviscosity can appear with a serum viscosity as low as 3 cp, but usually, arise when it exceeds 4Â to 5 cp.

Further testing should include a complete blood count (CBC), full serum chemistries, coagulation profile, and urinalysis. An elevated albumin-protein gap along with significant proteinuria on routine urinalysis suggest an underlying gammopathy. Rouleaux formation on a peripheral blood smear is highly suggestive of serum stasis. Serum stasis can also lead to the malfunction of laboratory testing equipment in which lab samples cannot be analyzed. This should raise suspicion for an underlying increase in serum viscosity. Measuring quantitative immunoglobulins is not necessary to establish a diagnosis of HVS, but can help guide long-term treatment if measured before and after the intervention.
