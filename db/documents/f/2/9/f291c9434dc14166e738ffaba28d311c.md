Management of tarsal tunnel syndrome remains challenging due to diagnostic uncertainty and lack of clarity over which patients would benefit from conservative versus surgical management. Hence, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a podiatrist, orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic nurse, and physical therapist.

Conservative treatment may help some patients but the key is physical therapy, change in shoes, and modification of activity. For those with a compressive lesion, surgery may be beneficial. Regardless of the treatment path chosen, the orthopedic nurse should monitor the results and report back to the clinician regarding progress or lack thereof, so therapy can change if needed.

The overall prognosis for patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome is guarded. Relapse and remissions are common and some patients never achieve complete relief from symptoms. [Level 5]
