The styloid process serves an important function as an anatomical divider of the parapharyngel space (PPS). The division into distinct compartments is provided by the tensor-vascular-styloid fascia.tensor veli palatini muscle. The PPS is divided into the prestyloid (anterolateral) and retrostyloid (posteromedial) compartments to facilitate the differential diagnoses of PPS lesions. The prestyloid compartment contains fat, a portion of the retromandibular parotid gland, and lymph nodes. The retrostyloid region contains the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, CN IX-XII, a segment of the sympathetic chain, and lymph nodes.
