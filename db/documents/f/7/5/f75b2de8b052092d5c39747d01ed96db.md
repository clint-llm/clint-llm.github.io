The diagnosis of MND hinges upon critical clinical observation.

**Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS):**

While a majority of ALS patients present with limb onset disease (60-80 percent), about one third to a fifth present with bulbar involvement in the form of dysarthria and dysphagia (along with emotional lability). A small minority of patients present with signs of respiratory muscle weakness. Patients may present with predominantly upper motor neuron (UMN) symptoms (hyperreflexia and spastic weakness) with the lower motor neuron (LMN) signs becoming commoner with the progression of the disease.

The initial symptom usually involves the distal muscles asymmetrically manifestation, such as difficulty in turning doorknobs, writing, turning keys in locks, picking up objects from overhead shelves along with impairment of gait, imbalance, and frequent falls which might manifest as functional disability and impairment of activities of daily living.

Respiratory insufficiency may present with breathlessness along with symptoms of carbon dioxide retention (headache) and hypoxia (confusion). Complications arising as a result of respiratory impairment (Respiratory failure and pneumonia) are the leading cause of death.

Behavioral traits such as apathy, changes in personality and mood, disinhibition, and obsessive behavior are also being recognized increasingly in this subset of patients.

A degree of severe autonomic impairment with the potential to impact the quality of life is usually not seen in patients with ALS. Upper motor neuron involvement has been associated with more severe autonomic deficits.

**Progressive muscular atrophy (PMA):**

Also known as the LMN phenotype, and represents 5 percent of the MND cases. It presents with progressively worsening LMN signs. The upper motor neuron signs are known to develop in 20-30 percent of the cases, usually within 5 to 10 years of the onset of the disease. Patients present with typical LMN symptoms of progressive flaccid paralysis, muscle atrophy, hyporeflexia/areflexia, and fasciculations.

Asymmetric weakness and atrophy in the distal limbs are seen at presentation. It is associated with a relatively better prognosis and characterized by a slower rate of progression. The asymmetrical proximal muscle weakness pattern is seen in a fifth of the patients. Bulbar involvement portends a poorer prognosis.

Flail arm and flail leg variants are other lower motor neuron variants of MND.

Family history of a similar neurological illness, personal account of smoking, exposure to toxins (cyanotoxins) assumes importance, occupational history of military service and past history of repetitive head trauma (as in pugilists) also needs to be ruled out in patients suspected to have a working diagnosis of ALS.

**Physical examination:**

An examination may reveal a constellation of upper motor neuron and lower motor neuron signs. Upper motor neuron signs range from hyperreflexia, spastic weakness, and exaggerated jaw jerk to clonus. In contrast, lower motor neuron involvement is characterized by areflexia or hyporeflexia, flaccid weakness, wasting, and fasciculations.

Bulbar involvement is characterized by dysarthria and dyspnoea, which might also be accompanied by emotional liability.

Identification of specific patterns of limb weakness may provide an aid to the physical diagnosis of ALS. In this split hand pattern, there is a preferential involvement of the first dorsal interossei and the thenar muscles with sparing of hypothenar muscles. In contrast, the split leg pattern is characterized by preferential ankle plantar flexion involvement with the sparing of the dorsiflexors.

**Physical signs in ALS:**

- Fasciculations, if generalized (can be easily missed over the shoulders)

- Bilateral wasting of the tongues – lateral borders, particularly when there are also fasciculations with a brisk jaw jerk and orbicularis oculi reflexes

- The “split hand”- preferential wasting of the lateral border of the hand, first dorsal interosseous and abductor policies Brevis, though to reflect the cortical organization

- Head drop due to weakness of neck extensors, may consider an alternative diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Care should be exercised to not attribute this sign to degenerative cervical sign

- Emotionality – exaggerated response to emotional stimuli, usually crying, bulbar weakness may be present. An abnormal response to the glabellar tap may be seen

- Cognitive or behavioral disorders – Frontotemporal dementia overlap features
