Infant colic is estimated to affect 20% of all infants. Despite its prevalence, a clear cause for infantile colic remains elusive. There have been many theories regarding the etiology, but a lack of uniformity in study definitions for colic has made it challenging to identify a common cause. Colic typically presents in the second or third week of life, peaks around 6 weeks, and usually resolves by the age of 12 weeks. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of colic and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the potential etiology of infantile colic.
- Describe the presentation of an infant with colic.
- Summarize the treatment and management of infantile colic, including parental counseling points.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes in patients with colic.
