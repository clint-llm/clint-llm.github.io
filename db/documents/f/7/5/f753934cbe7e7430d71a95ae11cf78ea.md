First described in 1884, purpura fulminans remains a relatively rare disease, and thus, most of the articles written about it are case reports and case series. Each form of purpura fulminans has a different prevalence. The hereditary neonatal form with severe protein C deficiency occurs in about 1:1,000,000 live births. Meningococcus and Streptococcus pneumoniaeÂ were identified as the most common bacterial triggers, and varicella was the most common viral trigger. Acute infectious purpura fulminans has been found to be more common in patients who are physically or functionally asplenic. The idiopathic post-infectious form is very rare with only a few hundred cases reported.
