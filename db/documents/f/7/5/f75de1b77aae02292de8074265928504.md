Urethral injury is a relatively rare medical condition accounting for less than 1% of all emergency department visits in the United States.

Clinicians classically use several anatomical landmarks in the evaluation, classification, and management of urethral injuries, which is particularly important among male patients. The male urethra subdivides into anterior and posterior divisions delineated by the urogenital diaphragm. The anterior segment consists of the penile and bulbar urethra while the posterior urethra consists of the membranous and prostatic portions.
