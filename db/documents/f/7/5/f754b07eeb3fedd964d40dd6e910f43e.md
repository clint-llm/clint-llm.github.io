Postpartum and acute endometritis/PID are both primarily clinical diagnoses based on the history, physical exam, and presence of risk factors, while chronic endometritis typically relies on histologic examination and/or findings on hysteroscopy.

**Postpartum Endometritis**

Postpartum endometritis is primarily a clinical diagnosis, made based on history, physical exam findings, and the presence of risk factors.

Leukocytosis is a common finding immediately postpartum (especially in those who underwent cesarean delivery).

Cervical and endometrial cultures are generally not indicated, as they are often contaminated and rarely change management. They may be helpful, however, if group A streptococcus or an STI is suspected.

Imaging is rarely helpful unless an alternative diagnosis such as retained products of conception or septic pelvic thrombophlebitis is suspected. Imaging findings in postpartum endometritis are generally nonspecific, and there is a significant overlap with normal postpartum findings.

**Acute Endometritis/PID**

PID is typically diagnosed clinically, based on the presence of history, physical exam findings, and the presence of risk factors. A pregnancy test should always be ordered to rule out ectopic pregnancy.

Work-up should include testing for STIs and BV. The presence of Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and/or Mycoplasma genitalium are best assessed with nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) run on endocervical, vaginal, or urine specimens, while Trichomas vaginalis and BV can be diagnosed on microscopic evaluation of vaginal discharge using a wet prep.

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are often elevated but are nonspecific findings. Additionally, leukocytosis is common, but white blood cell count is frequently normal in milder cases.

Imaging with transvaginal ultrasonography is indicated in cases of diagnostic uncertainty and when patients fail to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy or have moderate-to-severe disease in order to rule out a pelvic abscess. CT and/or MRI may help rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms in complex cases.

**Chronic Endometritis**

Chronic endometritis is frequently asymptomatic or has nonspecific clinical findings, so typically requires histologic and/or hysteroscopic diagnosis. An endometrial biopsy sample can be obtained and assessed for the presence of multiple ESPCs, either by traditional tissue staining techniques or using immunohistochemistry marker CD138.

Hysteroscopic findings associated with chronic endometritis include endometrial micropolyposis (1-2 mm protrusions from the endometrial surface) and strawberry aspects (hyperemic areas of endometrium with a central white point, found in about 65% of women with confirmed chronic endometritis).
