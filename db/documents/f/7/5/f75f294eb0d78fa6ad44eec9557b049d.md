The nurse has an integral role in the management of patients who encounter postoperative pain. Educating patients about their pain and administering their medications appropriately, with the correct timing and dosage, is a core competency that all nurses should practice carefully. The nurse should assist the provider in titrating doses of pain medications, according to the dynamic changes of the patient's pain scores. The nurse should alert the provider whenever there are any untoward changes in the vital signs of the patient.
