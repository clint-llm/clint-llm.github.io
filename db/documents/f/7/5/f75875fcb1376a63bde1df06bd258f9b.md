Repetitive strain from vigorous physical activity and compression of the subclavian vein from adjacent anatomic structures leads to venous injury and subsequent thrombosis. This impedes the venous return from the affected extremity leading to edema. Over time, the body forms collaterals to bypass the venous obstruction. In the chronic phase, the vein becomes fibrotic. Surrounding inflammatory changes from the thrombosis lead to scar tissue formation.
