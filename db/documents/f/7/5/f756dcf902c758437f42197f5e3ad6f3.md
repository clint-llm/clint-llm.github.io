Corneal topography is an integral diagnostic tool in the armamentarium of the cornea, cataract, and refractive surgeons. This activity highlights the evolution of corneal topographic mapping and the methods of evaluating the anterior and posterior surfaces of the cornea. The radius of curvature of the central part of the anterior surface of the cornea is measured by the size of the reflection of an image projected by the keratometer. The differences between topography and tomography, the indications, techniques, and topography machines are described. The roles of topography in the diagnosis, as well as the progression of corneal ectasias and pre and post-operative evaluation in refractive procedures, are summarized.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different techniques of corneal topography, including Placido disc, slit scanning, and Schiempflug imaging.
- Review the indications and the importance of corneal topography in pre-refractive surgery screening.
- Summarize the clinical significance of corneal topography in diagnosing various corneal disorders.
- Outline the role of corneal topography in clinical practice and discuss the role of interprofessional collaboration in delivering optimal care to patients to improve visual outcomes.
