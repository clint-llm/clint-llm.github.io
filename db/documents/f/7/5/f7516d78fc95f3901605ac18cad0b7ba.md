Basic operating room equipment is usually all that is required to perform a breast augmentation. Some surgeons prefer a lighted retractor to visualize inside the breast pocket created for the implant while some prefer using a headlight instead. If the umbilical or axillary approaches are used, then an endoscope or other specialized equipment may be needed. Some surgeons also recommend using a special implant sleeve to insert the implant. This may make the implant insertion easier and is part of the no-touch technique where minimal touching of the implant is allowed. This may decrease the risk of implant trauma and bacterial contamination.
