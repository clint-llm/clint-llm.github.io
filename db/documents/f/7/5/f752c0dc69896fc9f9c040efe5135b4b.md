The common side effects that culminate from dexrazoxane use include dose-limiting myelotoxicity (neutropenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia), which is very similar to the side-effect profile of anthracyclines. It is, therefore, challenging to distinguish the adverse effects seen with dexrazoxane use from those of anthracycline chemotherapy. Other adverse effects include nausea/vomiting, increased renal excretion of iron and zinc, hair loss, mucositis, inconsistent increases in liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase), reactions at the injection site such as pain, superficial phlebitis, which led to the recommendation that dexrazoxane should be administered via a large vein.

Recently, there have been concerns about the risk, particularly in pediatric patients, with long-term effects of dexrazoxane, who continuously received doses to inhibit cardiotoxicity. Although very sporadic, the incidence of other primary malignancies (myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia) in the patient group treated with dexrazoxane manifested a threefold increase compared with controls, which researchers documented in two randomized studies.
