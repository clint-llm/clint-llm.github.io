Ghrelin levels in the body are regulated primarily by the intake of food; its secretion becomes activated when the stomach is empty (during fasting) and inhibited when it is stretched (after a meal).

Once secreted, ghrelin exerts its orexigenic effects by binding to the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R1-alpha).

These neurons respond to ghrelin with a variety of functions including increased appetite/food intake, increased fat storage, and sleep-wake cycle regulation; these effects contribute to ghrelinâ€™s role in energy homeostasis
