Skin hydration is the primary treatment for asteatotic eczema. Patients should use lotions with high oil content. High water lotions can worsen the drying of the skin. Emollients should be applied twice a day and immediately after bathing to maintain hydration.

Topical steroid use should be in conjunction with emollients. Low potency steroids are useful for mild disease. Low potency steroids include desonide and hydrocortisone. Patients with moderate disease should receive medium or high potency corticosteroids. These include fluocinolone, triamcinolone, and betamethasone. Emollients should continue to be used with corticosteroids if corticosteroids are required. It does not affect response whether corticosteroids or emollients are applied first.

Other agents have been shown to be effective as well. Pimecrolimus cream 1% is effective in patients with asteatotic eczema and helps control pruritis.

Patients can take other steps as well to prevent drying of the skin, including decreasing the frequencies or bathing, minimizing the use of soap, and using a humidifier in dry environments.

N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) and N-acetylethanolamine (AEA) are phospholipids that belong to the endocannabinoid system. One study showed that emollients containing PEA and AEA improved skin barrier function and reduced itching; this is a possible future treatment option; however, more studies are necessary.
