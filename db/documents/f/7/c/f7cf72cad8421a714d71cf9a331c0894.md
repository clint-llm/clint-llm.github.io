Ingestion is the main source of carotenoids in the human body. Excessive ingestion (greater than 30 mg aÂ day) for a prolonged period could lead to carotenemia.

Diet-associated carotenemia is observed most commonly in infants and young children.

Diseases, including hypothyroidism, hepatic disorders, diabetes mellitus, anorexia nervosa, and renal diseases, could also lead to carotenemia.
