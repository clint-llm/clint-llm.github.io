The initial goal in diagnosis is determining whether or not the patient is truly experiencing vertigo, as most patients will report dizziness as a chief complaint. To elicit true vertigo symptoms, a provider may ask, "Does it feel like the room is spinning around you?".

Once a time course has been established, it is important to assess for associated symptoms as this can further help differentiate a central from a peripheral etiology. Nausea and vomiting are typical with acute episodes of vertigo and are not specific for any particular etiology. Since it is important to rule out central causes that may be progressive or life-threatening, such as a vertebrobasilar stroke or multiple sclerosis, providers must ask about any focal neurologic deficits such as diplopia, dysarthria, dysphagia, and numbness or weakness.

When combined with a complete history, a focused physical exam can help further elicit a peripheral from a central cause of vertigo. Assessing for nystagmus is a key portion of the physical exam when a patient presents with vertiginous symptoms.

Other physical exam techniques may be used to diagnose and treat vertigo including the Dix-Hallpike maneuver.

Gait and balance testing can further aid in localization. Patients with unilateral peripheral disorders often lean or fall toward the side of the lesion; whereas, patients with cerebellar lesions are often unable to walk without assistance, and the direction of falling with Romberg testing is variable.

A significant percentage of primary care and specialist physicians neglect the basics of history and physical leading to unnecessary imaging and medications.

The otoscopic exam should be completed to rule out an obvious infection such as acute otitis media, and bedside tests of hearing can be useful in differentiating other causes of vertigo. Weber and Rinne tests are performed at the bedside to detect conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.
