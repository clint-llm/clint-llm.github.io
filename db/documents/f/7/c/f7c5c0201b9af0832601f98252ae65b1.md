No special equipment is needed to perform a sural nerve biopsy. Standard instrumentation such as a scalpel, retractors, forceps, and suture material may be used during the biopsy. Microsurgical loupes may assist the surgeon during the procedure. A tourniquet is typically not used, but a bipolar cautery is an option for hemostasis.  The laboratory receiving the specimen should be contacted before procurement as each facility may differ in their requirements for analysis.
