The timing of hypnic headache and the concomitant diabetes insipidus with a feeling of intense thirst that has been reported by few studies favor the involvement of hypothalamic structures.

It has also been reported that sleep-disordered breathing has not been reported to be of high prevalence in patients diagnosed with HH. Continuous positive airway pressure and nocturnal oxygen supplementation did not improve symptoms in patients with HH.

The onset of HH attacks is associated with rapid eye movement sleep, and this association could connect HH to arterial hypertension and low oxygenation that occur during REM sleep.

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) remains a possible region involved in the origin of HH. As the body ages, the cell numbers in the suprachiasmatic nucleus decrease significantly, which leads to a decrease in melatonin. The release of melatonin will be affected by the reduced SCN cells. The SCN projects to and receives afferents from brainstem periaqueductal gray, which means a pain modulating link is possible.
