Following an episode of ischemia that has been treated with revascularization; the patient should be placed under strict observation. All baseline investigations such as complete blood count showing increased white blood cell count decreased platelets, renal function tests showing elevation in urea and creatinine levels, and liver function tests especially post-liver transplant or resection; all give clues towards a diagnosis of reperfusion injury. Coagulation profiles, electrolyte levels, and strict fluid input and output monitoring should be done to assess renal function.

Post myocardial infarction, repeat ECGs, and echo-cardiograph should be done to assess the myocardial function and for any possible arrhythmias. Any worsening seen in baseline and relevant investigation post-ischemic episode is usually warranted to reperfusion injury.
