A modified radical mastectomy is the primary treatment for women with locally advanced breast cancer. Additionally, some women with early-stage breast cancer may elect to undergo a mastectomy for cosmetic reasons, to potentially avoid radiation, or due to a genetic mutation that portends a higher risk for subsequent breast cancer. A mastectomy involves removal of the whole breast and often is paired with some degree of axillary lymph node sampling (either sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary node dissection of levels 1 and 2). Post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) is recommended for patients with more advanced disease and/or with certain high-risk pathologic features. In select patients, post-mastectomy radiation therapy has been shown to improve local control and overall survival. PMRT is directed at the chest wall and often includes the regional lymph nodes that drain the breast. This article will focus on the key aspects of post-mastectomy radiation therapy.
