PDS represents the initial phase and most important risk factor (ranging from 35 to 50%)Â in the development of PG. The diagnosis of PG occurs more frequently in male Caucasians with myopia aged 20-50 years. Unlike most diseases, PG prognosis tends to get better with aging, in which a burn-out phase causes a reduction of pigment dispersion, clearance of pigmentation in the angle structures, increased facility of outflow, and normalization of IOP requiring less anti-glaucoma medication.

The reversal of pigmentary clinical signs and normal levels of IOP in older patients can lead to the misdiagnosis of POAG or normal-tension glaucoma.
