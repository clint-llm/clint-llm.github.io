During the proliferative phase of OH development, the vessels are small, disorganized, and contain tiny lumens, which can be difficult to visualize on microscopic examination. In contrast, the endothelial cells are wide and contain prominent basement membranes composed of alpha-smooth muscle actin.

In the rapid growth stage, the endothelial cells enlarge, their basement membranes become less prominent, and the number of cells stabilizes. As the vessels mature and enter the spontaneous involution phase, the endothelial cells lose their contents and become flattened, with certain cells undergoing apoptosis to be replaced by fat, fibroblasts, and connective tissue.

While endothelial cells during any phase of OH growth will demonstrate CD31, von Willebrand factor, and urokinase, cells during the involution phase uniquely demonstrate Fc gamma receptors (FcII), Lewis Y antigen (LeY), and merosin. Immunohistochemistry can be used to distinguish not only the growth phase but the type of lesion, as infantile hemangiomas will exhibit positivity for glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), which is not present in congenital hemangiomas or vascular malformations.
