The extensor pollicis longus gets innervated by a motor branch of the posterior interosseous nerve, which belongs to the deep group of branches from the posterior interosseous nerve. The posterior interosseous nerve originates from the radial nerve. The radial nerve origin is from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus, from C5-T1. The radial nerve splits into the posterior interosseous nerve and the superficial radial nerve by the lateral epicondyle. The posterior interosseous nerve supplies the extensor carpi radialis brevis and supinator muscle, then travels through the supinator muscle for an average length of 4.45 cm and then divides into superficial and deep groups of branches. The superficial group of branches innervates the extensor digitorum communis, extensor digiti minimi, and extensor carpi ulnaris. The deep group of branches innervates the abductor pollicis longus, extensor pollicis brevis, EPL, and extensor indices.
