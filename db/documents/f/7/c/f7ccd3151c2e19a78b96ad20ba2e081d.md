Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is a potentially life-threatening complication of ovarian stimulation. In mild cases, women experience abdominal distension, nausea, and vomiting. In more severe cases, ascites develop with severe abdominal pain and possible pleural effusion, which may lead to decreased pulmonary function and hypoxia. Patients may show signs of hypovolemia, oliguria, elevated creatinine, increased liver transaminases, leukocytosis, and electrolyte abnormalities. Hemoconcentration will increase the risk of thromboembolism. In critical cases, acute renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation may result in death. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the incidence of severe OHSS to be 0.2 to 1% of all stimulation cycles.

The frequency of twins has risen from 1980 to 2015, and it is estimated that 19% of all twins and 25% of all triplets are due to IVF.

Similarly, there does not appear to be a significant difference in the rate of preterm birth between IVF twin vs. naturally conceived twin pregnancies, likely due to the higher risk of both hypertension and preterm birth in twin pregnancies in general.
