An umbilical hernia presents as a bulge at the site of the umbilicus; it is a common finding during routine well-baby visits for the first few months of life. New parents who are not very familiar with this anomaly might verbalize great concerns during these visits because they tend to become very worried when they see the bulge in their infant's belly button. In addition, parents might be concerned with the idea that their child will suffer serious complications from an umbilical hernia, and they wonder if there are any measures that they should take to avoid complications. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of umbilical hernias and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of infants with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pediatric umbilical hernias.
- Describe the presentation of an infant with an umbilical hernia.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for umbilical hernias.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by umbilical hernias.
