Detailed past medical and surgical histories are required to prepare the patient and medical team for urinary diversion surgery. Prior abdominal surgeries and radiation history, with attention to radiation fields, which may include bowel or bladder, are important for surgical decision making. A history of inflammatory bowel disease may limit the use of the colon in diversions. Colonoscopy should be performed prior to using the colon in continent cutaneous urinary diversions to rule out malignancy or evidence of chronic inflammatory bowel disease.

Thorough counseling regarding cystectomy and diversion types is associated with less regret concerning the type of diversion performed and better quality of life postoperatively.

As a preoperative nutritional status, as measured by albumin levels, has been shown to relate to perioperative outcomes following cystectomy with urinary diversion, nutritional consultations preoperatively should be considered.

Patients undergoing small bowel diversions such as ileal conduit or orthotopic neobladder do not, as a matter of routine, undergo bowel preparation. When the colon is used for a conduit or continent cutaneous urinary diversion, many institutions continue to recommend standard mechanical bowel preparation.
