The primary mechanisms of traumatic chest injuries can be broken down into penetrating (i.e., gunshots, lacerations, punctures) or blunt (i.e., motor vehicle accidents, falls, crush injury, blasts, burns). The list of potential sequelae of penetrating or blunt trauma is extensive, including tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, hemothorax, flail chest, pericardial effusion, cardiac tamponade, aortic rupture, tracheal or bronchial tree injury, myocardial contusion, pulmonary contusion, diaphragmatic rupture, esophageal rupture, and more.
