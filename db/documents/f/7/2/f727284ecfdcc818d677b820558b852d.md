Laugier-Hunziker syndrome, also known as Laugier-Gerbig-Hunziker syndrome or Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome or idiopathic lenticular mucocutaneous pigmentation, is a hereditary pigmentary disorder characterized by a unique expression of pigmentation over the mucosal, nail, and acral sites.

The condition is known to be benign; nevertheless, a few associations with esophageal melanocytosis, actinic lichen planus, hypocellular bone marrow, and thrombocytopenia have been reported.

Due to its close semblance to more serious conditions such as Addison disease, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, Cronkhite-Canada syndrome, and lentiginosis profusa, this is usually classed as a diagnosis of exclusion.
