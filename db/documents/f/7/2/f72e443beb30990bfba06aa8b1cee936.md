Evaluation involves urinalysis and renal biopsy. The urinalysis demonstrates hematuria, dysmorphic red blood cells, and proteinuria. Renal biopsy and immunohistologic examination confirm the diagnosis. Light microscopy can show focal or diffuse mesangial proliferation and increased mesangial matrix and cellularity. In advanced disease, interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy can be found. Electron microscopy shows the electron-dense deposits of IgA in the mesangium. Immunofluorescence microscopy shows the types of immunoglobulins deposits (mainly IgA, but also IgG and IgM) in the mesangium and capillary walls. C3  and C4 are commonly detected with C4d, indicating a poor prognosis with progression to end-stage renal disease. The Serum IgA level is of no clinical utility.
