Prognosis depends on the severity of the damage to the visual cortex. Extensive bilateral occipital lesions have a worse prognosis than transient ischemic attacks. Sometimes with extensive training and tasks, patients can achieve some aspects of visual performance matching the intact hemifield vision, but full recovery of vision in all aspects doesn't occur after damage to the V1 area.
