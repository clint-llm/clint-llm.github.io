The HER2 receptor (previously called HER2/Neu) is a transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine kinase activity. It belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor family (EGFR/ErbB). These receptors are essential in controlling epithelial cell growth and differentiation.

The importance of these receptors is that the aberrant HER2 protein overexpression has associations with some adenocarcinomas, including breast, ovary, endometrium, cervix as well as lung, esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, gastric, and bladder cancers. The protein is strongly associated with increased disease recurrence and is a poor prognostic factor for survival. For this reason, HER2 is an important prognostic target for the therapy of various types of cancer.

HER2 amplification or overexpression occurs in approximately 20 to 30% of human breast cancers.
