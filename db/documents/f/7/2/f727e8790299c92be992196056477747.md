The first branchial arch gives rise to Meckel's cartilage. On the lateral aspect of Meckel’s cartilage, the mandible starts as two halves, with each half developing an ossification center in the sixth to seventh week of intrauterine development. The ossification centers develop into what will eventually be the symphysis, body, angle, and ramus of the mandible. Separately, cartilage clusters form within the connective tissue, eventually ossify into coronoid and condylar processes.

The two ossified right and left halves of the mandible remain separated by connective tissue until closer to birth when small mental bone(s) (1 or 2) ossify. These mental bones ultimately fuse with the mandible creating a mental protuberance and the unified mandibular bone.

Mesenchymal cells from the first branchial arch give rise to the muscles of mastication.

Odontogenesis is the formation of teeth. The deciduous or baby teeth develop at 6 to 8 weeks gestation, whereas succedaneous teeth develop at 20 weeks. The ectoderm forms the dental enamel, while the ectomesenchyme (neural crest-derived) forms the dentin, cementum, periodontal ligament, and pulp. Placodes represent invaginations of primary dental lamina within the mandibular and maxillary arches beginning the process of tooth formation. Tooth buds form from the placodes, and the tooth buds develop into teeth.
