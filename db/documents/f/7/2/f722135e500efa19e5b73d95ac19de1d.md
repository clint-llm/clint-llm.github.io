**5. Pulmonary hypertension with unclear multifactorial mechanisms**

5.a Systemic disorders: sarcoidosis, pulmonary histiocytosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis 5.b Hematologic disorders: chronic hemolytic anemia, myeloproliferative disorders, splenectomy 5.c Metabolic disorders: glycogen storage disease, Gaucher disease, thyroid disorders 5.d Others: tumoral obstruction, fibrosing mediastinitis, chronic renal failure, segmental

BMPR (bone morphogenic protein receptor type II); CAV1 (caveolin-1); ENG (endoglin); HIV (human immunodeficiency virus); PAH (pulmonary arterial hypertension)

**Table 1B. Updated Clinical Classification of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) Associated with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD)**

**Left-to-right shunts
**

- Correctable

- Non-correctable

Includes moderate to large defects; pulmonary vascular resistance is increased, systemic-to-pulmonary shunting is prevalent, cyanosis is not a feature.

**Eisenmenger syndrome**

- Includes extra- and intra-cardiac defects usually begins as systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and progress with time to a severe elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance and reversal (pulmonary-to-systemic) or bidirectional shunting; cyanosis, secondary erythrocytosis (due to hypoxia) and multi-organ involvement are present.

**Post-operative Pulmonary arterial hypertension
**

- CHD is repaired, but pulmonary arterial hypertension can persist immediately after surgery or recur after surgery in the absence of significant postoperative hemodynamic lesions

**Pulmonary arterial hypertension with coincidental CHD
**

- Marked increase in pulmonary vascular resistance in the presence of cardiac defects.
