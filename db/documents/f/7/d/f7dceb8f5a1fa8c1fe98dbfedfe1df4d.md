MAC is acquired by inhalation and can also be ingested into the gastrointestinal tract, where it adheres to the mucosal epithelial cells and infects the macrophages. From the submucosal tissues and lymph nodes, the organism is then carried by lymphatics to the rest of the body. In most people, disseminated MAC infection will occur when the CD4 count is less than 50 cell per microliter. In patients who do not have HIV, the most important risk factor for MAC infection is underlying lung disease. MAC has also been associated with bronchiectasis and a hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like reaction.
