The initial recommended dose of dupilumab comprises two subcutaneous injections at different injection sites, followed by one injection at different injection sites every two weeks or every four weeks, depending on the patient’s age and weight.

In most clinical trials, the steady-state concentrations were reached by week 16 following the administration of 600 mg starting dose and 300 mg dose every other week.

More recently, two large phase 3 trials - including adults with symptoms inadequately suppressed by topical medications commonly used to manage atopic dermatitis - demonstrated the role of dupilumab in treating the condition. Patients were treated with either placebo or 300 mg dupilumab administered every week or every two weeks over a span of 16 weeks. A significant reduction of 75% in eczema area and severity index (EASI) was observed in patients on dupilumab in both weekly and 2-weekly interval dosing regimens.
