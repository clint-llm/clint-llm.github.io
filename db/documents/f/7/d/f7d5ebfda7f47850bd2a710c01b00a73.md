Scuba diving is considered to be a safe sport when an individual is properly trained and takes appropriate precautions. However, there can be disastrous complications if circumstances are unfavorable or appropriate precautions are not taken. One such potential complication is immersion pulmonary edema. Immersion pulmonary edema (IPE) is used by many as an umbrella term for scuba divers’ pulmonary edema (SDPE) and swimming-induced pulmonary edema (SIPE). Patients with IPE are best managed with an interprofessional team approach. The majority of patients with IPE present to the emergency department (ED) and thus healthcare professionals in the ED must be aware of this syndrome and its management. Patient education is vital before they undertake diving, snorkeling, or energetic swimming. If individuals continue to dive and snorkel, there should also be an emphasis on limiting contributing factors by using thermal protection, not overhydrating, ensuring minimal equipment resistance, avoiding excessive exertion, avoiding beta-blockers, or sympathomimetics, using companion divers, and always having emergency oxygen and medivac capability. Any patient with a prior IPE event should be referred to a cardiologist before undertaking any water-related sporting activity.
