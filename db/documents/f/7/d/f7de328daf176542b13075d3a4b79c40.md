**Simple Allergic Conjunctivitis:**It is difficult to estimate how many patients are affected as the symptoms are often under-appreciated, and many patients go without seeking medical care. Simple ocular allergy likely affects between 10% to 30% of the general population. In most cases, onset occurs in patients younger than 20 years old, decreasing prevalence in older populations. Allergic conjunctivitis can be seen as an isolated finding but is often associated with allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and/or asthma.

**Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis:**More commonly seen in males (ratio between 2 to 1 and 3 to 1) in dry, warm climates. Most cases occur in patients younger than ten who often have a history of atopy or asthma. Many patients have complete resolution without the return of symptoms after adolescence.

**Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis:**Not usually seen before adolescence and peaks from 30 to 50 years of age. Most cases are seen in patients with atopic dermatitis. Like vernal keratoconjunctivitis, there is a male to female predominance (between 2 to 1 and 3 to 1)

**Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis:**Seen most commonly in teens and young adults, most likely because of a temporal relationship with contact lens use. It is most commonly seen in conjunction with soft contact lens use and is present in approximately 5% of that population. The average onset is one to two years after starting soft contact lenses but varies widely with other ocular foreign bodies.
