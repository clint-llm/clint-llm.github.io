Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as lumbar spinal pain of unknown origin either persisting despite surgical intervention or appearing after surgical intervention for spinal pain originally in the same topographical location. The pain may originate after surgery, or the surgery may exacerbate or insufficiently ameliorate existing pain. This activity describes the cause and presentation of failed back surgery and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of failed back surgery.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with failed back surgery.
- Summarize the treatment for failed back surgery.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by failed back surgery.
