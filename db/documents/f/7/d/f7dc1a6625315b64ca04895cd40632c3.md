Scarpa’s fascia is a dense collagenous connective tissue layer of the anterior abdominal wall. It is considerably thinner than Camper’s fascia.  It contains a large number of orange elastic fibers and loose connective tissue. Scarpa’s fascia serves an essential role in separating the overlying Camper’s fascia (fatty layer) from the muscle's underneath. It also allows Campers' fascia to slide freely over the underlying layer of the abdominal wall (external oblique fascia or rectus sheath) that reduces the friction of muscular force and aids in abdominal muscle flexion, extension, and rotation. Due to the parallel orientation of collagenous fibers to the direction of force, Scarpa’s fascia can withstand immense unidirectional tension forces. This feature allows the fascia to provide a supportive yet pliable case for the nerves and blood vessels transiting through and between the muscles. As part of the abdominal wall, Scarpa’s fascia also protects the organs lying within the abdominal cavity.
