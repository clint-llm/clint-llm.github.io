No standardized pharmacological or psychological treatment has been established for persons with narcissistic personality disorder.

Kohut and Kernberg have focused on long-term therapy and exploring the relationship between a therapist and patient, which continues to be an established treatment for persons with a narcissistic personality disorder.

Transference-focused therapy is structured twice a week psychoanalytic therapy that focuses on personal expression of emotions toward a therapist. Given that persons with NPD can often be provoked by their perception of being treated by another, their own emotions towards other people are essential.

Schema-focused therapy is relatively new and focuses on alternate forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy, including activating emotional senses.

There are no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of NPD, but many patients may benefit from the treatment of symptoms, including anxiety, depression, mood lability, transient psychosis, and impulse control issues. Antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, have been used. Risperidone, an antipsychotic, has shown benefit in some patients. Some patients are given mood stabilizers like lamotrigine.
