Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI), also called e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI), is an acute or subacute respiratory illness characterized by a spectrum of clinicopathologic findings mimicking various pulmonary diseases. There is an ongoing epidemic of EVALI across the United States, and the CDC recommends reporting all cases of EVALI to the concerned state or local health department. Although the etiology remains unclear, several causes are under investigation. Of these, vitamin E acetate is the most recognized agent associated with an e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI). This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of vaping-associated pulmonary injury and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with vaping-associated pulmonary injury.
- Describe the typical radiographic findings in patients with vaping-associated pulmonary injury.
- Review the management strategy for patients with vaping-associated pulmonary injury.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with vaping-associated pulmonary injury.
