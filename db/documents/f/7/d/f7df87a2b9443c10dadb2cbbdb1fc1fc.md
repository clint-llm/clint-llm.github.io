Gait and posture are extremely important for the quality of life of a patient. A normal gait leads a patient to functional independence. Patient education is a vital part of identifying gait disturbances; early detection can lead to better outcomes and prevent complications. CorrectiveÂ rehabilitation, gait training, use of assistive devices, and fall prevention measures should be implemented.
