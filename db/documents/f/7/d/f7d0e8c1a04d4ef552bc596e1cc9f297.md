The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a laboratory nucleic acid amplification technique used to denature and renature short segments of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequences using DNA polymerase I enzyme, an isolate from Thermus aquaticus, known as Taq DNA.

PCR is a procedure that selectively focuses on a minuscule segment of DNA in a test tube.
