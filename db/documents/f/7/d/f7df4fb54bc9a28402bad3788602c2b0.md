Transcranial doppler is utilized to investigate the intracranial vasculature for various purposes. It offers a non-invasive, radiation-free way to monitor for sequelae from subarachnoid hemorrhage or to help determine stroke risk in sickle cell patients. This activity reviews a few examples of transcranial Doppler exam indications, basic techniques, and the importance these findings have in clinical care by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify common indications for transcranial Doppler examination.
- Describe transcranial Doppler findings associated with vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage patients.
- Summarize the basic technique of transcranial Doppler examination.
- Outline the importance of TCD exam in the screening of pediatric sickle cell disease patients.
