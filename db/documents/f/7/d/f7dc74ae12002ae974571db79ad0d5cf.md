The nasolacrimal duct forms from a cord of ectodermal cells beginning at the seventh week of development. The surface ectodermal cord joins with a growing cord of epithelial cells extending from the nasal cavity. The cord bifurcates in the canthal area, formingÂ early canaliculi. These projections reach the lid margins at 12 weeks.
