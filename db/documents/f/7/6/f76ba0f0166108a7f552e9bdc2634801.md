The vertebrobasilar system is comprised of bilateral vertebral arteries (VA) and an unpaired basilar artery (BA). The vertebral artery divides into four segments along its course.transverse foramen (also known as the foramina transversarium, TF) of the sixth cervical vertebrae (C6),

The basilar artery serves as the primary source of arterial supply to the brainstem and posterior cerebral hemispheres. The BA courses anterosuperiorly within the basilar sulcus of the pons, giving off bilateral anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, multiple paramedian perforating pontine arteries, and the paired superior cerebellar arteries. As the BA approaches the base of the pituitary gland, it divides to give rise to the bilateral posterior cerebral arteries and posterior communicating arteries to complete the circle of Willis. The connection of the BA to the circle of Willis allows for the collateral pathway of the BA to supply anterior brain structures if flow through one of the internal carotid arteries (ICA) is compromised.
