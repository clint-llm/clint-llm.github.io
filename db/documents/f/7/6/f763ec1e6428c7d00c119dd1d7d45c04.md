Deep brain stimulation (DBS) was first approved in the 1990s for the treatment of movement disorders. DBS has the potential to offer symptom resolution for a variety of disease processes. DBS involves the placement of electrodes adjacent to deep structures in the brain. These electrodes are then connected, by a wire, to a pulse generator which is subcutaneously implanted into the chest wall. The pulse generator is controlled by a computer, which ultimately gives instructions to the electrodes to fire. This activity explains the application of DBS and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients undergoing deep brain stimulation.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for deep brain stimulation.
- Summarize the risks associated with deep brain stimulation.
- Outline the targeted structures for various deep brain stimulation indications.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for deep brain stimulation and to enhance postoperative management.
