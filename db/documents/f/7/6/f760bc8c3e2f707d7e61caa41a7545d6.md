Cor pulmonale is a Latin word that means "pulmonary heart," its definition varies, and presently, there is no consensual definition.

Cor pulmonale can be defined as an alteration in the structure (e.g., hypertrophy or dilatation) and function of the right ventricle (RV) of the heart caused by a primary disorder of the respiratory system resulting in pulmonary hypertension.

Right-sided heart failure secondary to left-sided heart failure, or congenital heart disease is not considered cor pulmonale.
