The thoracodorsal nerve is also referred to as the middle or long subscapular nerve. It arises from the C6 to C8 roots of the brachial plexus. The thoracodorsal nerve exits the posterior cord at the apex of the axilla. It runs posteriorly to the axillary vein in its descent through the axilla and joins the vascular pedicle of the latissimus dorsi muscle. Identification of the thoracodorsal nerve is crucial during surgical procedures of the axilla. Surgeons use the thoracodorsal nerve as a nerve graft in various surgeries. Its primary function is motor innervation of the latissimus dorsi muscle.
