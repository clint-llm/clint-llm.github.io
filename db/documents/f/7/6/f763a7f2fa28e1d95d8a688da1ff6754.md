Macrocephaly is the condition in which the head circumference of an infant is above 2 standard deviations, which is above the 97th percentile. It can be due to benign conditions or can be due to underlying causes that lead to serious sequelae like neurological deficits and developmental delays. It is, therefore, imperative to understand the different etiologies of macrocephaly and to be able to refer infants who require further investigations and close monitoring. This activity outlines and describes the etiology, evaluation, and management of macrocephaly and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating infants and children with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the different etiologies of macrocephaly.
- Explain the importance of monitoring with head circumference during routine well-child visits.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with hydrocephalus and raised intracranial pressure.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with macrocephaly.
