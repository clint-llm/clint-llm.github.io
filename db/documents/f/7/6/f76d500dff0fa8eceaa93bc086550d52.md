Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia can be idiopathic or associated with connective tissue disease, HIV infection, toxins, or numerous other causes. Secondary causes of nonspecific interstitial pneumonia NSIP include:

- Connective tissue disease (CTD): NSIP is a common pattern due to underlying connective tissue disease which includes systemic sclerosis, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Sjogren syndrome.

- Drug-induced: Amiodarone, methotrexate, nitrofurantoin, chemotherapeutic agents, and statin therapy have been associated with an NSIP pattern.

- HIV infection: Less common now after the widespread use of the antiretroviral therapy.

- Interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features: those patients have NSIP on lung biopsy, and features of autoimmune disease that don’t match specific connective tissue disease.

- Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: In some patients, the lung biopsy lacks granuloma, and multinucleated giant cells through the histopathology have an appearance of NSIP.

- Others: Such as an IgG4-related systemic disease, familial interstitial pneumonia, and graft versus host disease
