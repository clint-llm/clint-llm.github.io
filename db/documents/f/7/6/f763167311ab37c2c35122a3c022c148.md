If tailbone pain is severe or persists for more than one month, the patient should see a clinician with experience in the evaluation and treatment of this condition. If the first clinician a patient sees for coccyx pain is not familiar with this condition or does not take the patient's symptoms seriously, the patient should seek further medical care elsewhere.

Many patients have difficulty finding a radiology center that is familiar with performing the sitting-versus-standing X-rays of the coccyx, which are done to view the coccyx during the time when it is most painful (which is typical while sitting). Continuing to search for such a center is important, as these radiographs can often reveal an abnormality (diagnosis) that non-seated X-rays fail to show.
