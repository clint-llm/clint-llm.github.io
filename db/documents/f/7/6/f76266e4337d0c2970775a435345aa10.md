When evaluating for osteomalacia, a clinical history should include an understanding of a patient's family and surgical (i.e., bypass) history. Other pertinent questions should focus on activity level, hobbies, diet (i.e., vegetarian), and assessment of socioeconomic status.

Symptoms of osteomalacia are non-specific, but may include

- Proximal muscle weakness and wasting

- Myalgias and arthralgias

- Muscle spasms

- Altered or "waddling" gait

- Spinal, limb, or pelvicÂ deformities (long-term osteomalacia)

- Aching bone pain (lower spine, pelvis, or lower extremities)

- Aggravated by activity and weight-bearing

- Increased falls

- Hypocalcemic seizures or tetany
