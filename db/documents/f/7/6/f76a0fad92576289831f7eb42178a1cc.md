Diagnosis is made via clinical setting and with radiographic findings. However, differential diagnoses should include other possibilities such as cholelithiasis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, gastric dysmotility, hepatic abscess, hemangioma, and/or hamartoma. These conditions may elicit similar symptoms as compared to symptomatic hepatic cysts such as abdominal pain. Imaging modalities used to diagnose hepatic cysts can help to exclude some of these conditions. If inconclusive, esophagogastroduodenoscopy may be performed to assess the possibility of gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic ulcer disease. Motility and transit studies can rule out gastric dysmotility.
