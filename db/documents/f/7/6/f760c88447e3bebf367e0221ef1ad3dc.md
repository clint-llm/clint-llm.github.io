Umbilical arterial catheterization provides direct access to the arterial system, thus enabling arterial blood sampling and the measurement of the systemic arterial blood pressure. It is one of the commonly performed procedures in extremely premature neonates. The procedure is relatively easy to perform but requires practice. This activity reviews the indications, technique of catheterizing the umbilical artery, potential complications associated with its presence, and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in managing neonates who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures of the umbilical cord pertinent to umbilical arterial catheterization.
- Describe the preparation and technique in regards to performing an umbilical arterial catheterization.
- Explain the potential complications of umbilical arterial catheterization.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of a critically ill newborn and improve outcomes.
