The health care professionals should obtain a detailed history to cover the following:

- The history of any hand penetrating injury to the volar aspects of the digits should be identified. The mechanism of injury may guide the identification of the causative organism of the infection. Penetrating hand injury is usually preceding the PFT presentation by 2 to 5 days.

- The duration between symptom onset and the patient presentation should be precisely identified. Treatment options can be guided by the duration and severity of the PFT symptoms. Delayed patient presentation and treatment after PFT is associated with poor outcomes and increased finger amputation risk.

- The social history obtained should cover the patient's occupation and the dominant hand, and this information will guide the rehabilitation requirements and postoperative support.

- Medical comorbidities should be recognized and optimized before the surgical intervention as appropriate. Also, it has been reported that patients who develop PFT and have a medical history of diabetes mellites, renal failure, and or peripheral vascular disease are at higher risk of poor outcomes.
