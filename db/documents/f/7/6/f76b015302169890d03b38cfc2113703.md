The most common adverse effect found in patients using insulin lispro is hypoglycemia. For this reason, the recommendation is to perform close glucose monitoring for all patients with diabetes, and any changes made to the dosing should be done so under medical supervision. In particular, care is a must with the administration of this drug for patients who are fasting or made to have nothing by mouth for medical reasons. Hypokalemia is another adverse effect to pay close attention to, especially with patients who are using potassium-lowering drugs or taking drugs sensitive to serum potassium level. Other adverse effects include hypertrophy at the injection site, injection site reaction, and lipodystrophy at the injection site.
