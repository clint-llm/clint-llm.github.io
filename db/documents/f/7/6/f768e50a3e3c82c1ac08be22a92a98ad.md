Before administrating luspatercept, assess and review hemoglobin results before each administration. Luspatercept is recommended at 1 mg/kg once every three weeks by subcutaneous injection into the upper arm, thigh, or abdomen for patients with beta-thalassemia.

If the patient's RBC transfusion reduction burden is not met with the two consecutive doses of luspatercept injection at the 1 mg/kg starting dose, increasing the dose to 1.25 mg/kg may be more therapeutic. However, luspatercept dosing should remain below the dose of 1.25 mg/kg in beta-thalassemia treatment and below 1.75 mg/kg in lower-risk MDS treatment. A patient who is not receiving transfusion therapy and demonstrates more than 2 g/dl of hemoglobin levels within three weeks should reduce the dose of luspatercept.
