Gliptins are associated with a low incidence of adverse events, including hypoglycemia, and have weight-neutral effects. However, the risk of hypoglycemia increases when used in conjunction with sulfonylureas.

The most common side effects noticed with the DPP-4 inhibitors sitagliptin and saxagliptin are upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, headache, urinary tract infection, arthralgia.

DPP-4 inhibitors (alogliptin, sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin) did not show an increased risk of cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke when compared to placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes,Â although saxagliptin had an association with an increased rate of hospitalization for heart failure.
