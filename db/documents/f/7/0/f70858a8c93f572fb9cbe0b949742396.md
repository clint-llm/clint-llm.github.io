Systemically, calcitriol binds to vitamin-D receptors in the kidneys, parathyroid glands, intestines, and bones to increase serum blood calcium levels by promoting absorption in the intestines, renal tubular reabsorption in the kidneys, and release from bone. Calcitriol serves as a transcription factor to encode a calcium-binding protein, which simultaneously transports calcium and phosphate ions across intestinal epithelial cells.
