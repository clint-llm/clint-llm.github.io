**Antibiotic Therapy**

- The treatment depends on the administration of systemic anti-microbial therapy with anti-pseudomonal activity, typically a fluoroquinolone in cases caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, with the widespread use of ciprofloxacin in upper respiratory tract infections, many resistant cases have been reported in the literature.

- Although most cases are caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other organisms have been identified as a cause of MOE, and therefore the antibiotic management should be according to the isolated organism.

- The duration of treatment depends on the response to therapy, which is evaluated using a gallium citrate Ga 67 scan every 4 to 6 weeks during treatment.

- The treatment should be stopped one week after a normalÂ gallium citrate Ga 67 scan.

**Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy**

- Although it has been widely used in the treatment of MOE, many studies showed no added benefit for using it as an adjuvant for medical or/and surgical therapy.

**Surgical Therapy**

- Surgical management is reserved for the patients in whom medical therapy has failed to cure the disease. Surgical therapy includes local debridement, removal of bony sequestrum, and abscess drainage. However, there is no indication for facial nerve decompression in patients with facial nerve involvement; finally, the surgery did not show any prognostic benefits.
