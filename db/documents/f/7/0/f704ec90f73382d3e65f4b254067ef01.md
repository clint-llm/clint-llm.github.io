5-HT3 receptor antagonists are FDA pregnancy category B. Available human studies examining early pregnancy conclude there is not a high risk of congenital malformations. There is a small increased risk of septal defects and cleft palate. Animal studies show no increased risk during early pregnancy. It is not known if 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are present in breast milk.
