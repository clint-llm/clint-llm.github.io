BP is thought to result from compression of the seventh cranial nerve at the geniculate ganglion. The first portion of the facial canal, the labyrinthine segment, is the narrowest and it is here that most cases of compression occur. Due to the narrow opening of the facial canal, inflammation causes compression and ischemia of the nerve. The most common finding is a unilateral facial weakness that includes the muscles of the forehead.
