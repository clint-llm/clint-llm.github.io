- Early recognition of infectious tenosynovitis by history and physical with prompt therapy, including empiric antibiotic therapy and possible surgery, is critical in preventing serious complications.

- Ultrasound is a valuable imaging tool when radiographs are unhelpful. Further characterization with MRI is preferable to CT.

- Conservative therapy with NSAIDs and splinting is the first line for non-infectious tenosynovitis and is often highly effective. Further treatment with steroid injections, DMARDs, and surgery may be warranted.

- Non-infectious tenosynovitis has many causes which may necessitate different treatment modalities. A detailed history and physical in conjunction with patient-directed laboratory and imaging studies can impact management dramatically.
