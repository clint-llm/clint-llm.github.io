Peyton’s four-step model is an effective tool in non-technical skills development as well as the transference of technical skills; it comprises of four steps: demonstration, deconstruction, comprehension, and performance.

Simulation can also be carried out in a team setting to evaluate and improve communication skills, for example, urgent assessment of a patient who has potentially developed acute compartment syndrome may be ‘played out’ in a simulated setting without the need for any advanced technology, and the scenario would include the orthopedic registrar, ward nurse, patient actor and Orthopaedic consultant who the registrar may need to contact. Through observing, conceptualizing, practicing, and performing learned material, trainees are more likely to gain meaning from the learning experience resulting in an increased likelihood of knowledge retention.
