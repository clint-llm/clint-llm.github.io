While most patients do improve with therapy, a few patients may develop renal failure. This is more likely if the infection is due to streptococcus. The renal dysfunction appears 7-14 days after the infection. The transient hematuria and proteinuria may last a few weeks or months. Other complications include septic arthritis, scarlet fever, sepsis, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.
