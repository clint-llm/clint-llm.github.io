Patients with DWM may present different degrees of hydrocephalus, which if untreated may lead to severe neurological deficits and death. Fifty percent of children with untreated hydrocephalus die before age 3, and only around 20 to 23% will reach adult life. From the patients with untreated hydrocephalus who reach adult life, most will have motor, visual and auditory deficits.

The diameter of the fetal lateral ventricle through obstetric ultrasound may have substantial prognostic value. As described in a previous study, lateral ventricles measuring between 11 to 15 mm correlate with a 21% risk of developmental delay. If the diameter measures more than 15 mm, the risk of developmental delay is above 50%.

Most case series of patients with non-tumoral hydrocephalus, present an overall risk for epilepsy of approximately 30%.

Functional outcome is subject to several factors, which include other structural brain abnormalities, extra-CNS manifestations, epilepsy, motor, visual or hearing impairment, and other congenital abnormalities.
