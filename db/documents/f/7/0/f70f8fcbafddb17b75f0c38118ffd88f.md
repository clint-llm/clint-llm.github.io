The enteropathogen, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, requires a large inoculum to produce the disease. The primary virulence factor is a plasmid-encoded protein that causes increased invasiveness. Yersinia pseudotuberculosis survives intracellularly.

Yersinia pseudotuberculosis inhabits and grows in the gastrointestinal tract, initially in the Peyer's patches, and then spreading to the liver and the spleen through the mesenteric lymph nodes or directly.

Yersinia pseudotuberculosis has a siderophore-mediated iron scavenging system that contributes to its virulence.
