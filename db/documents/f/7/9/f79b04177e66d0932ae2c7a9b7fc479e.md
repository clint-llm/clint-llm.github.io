Complications with intubation involve failure to secure the airway, esophageal intubation, hypoxic or hypercapnic respiratory failure leading to arrest,Â  injury to oropharyngeal or laryngeal airway including bleeding, soft tissue swelling, injury to vocal cords.

When intubating a patient who suffered injuries to the chest, pay attention to the complications that could arise after the intubation, like tension pneumothorax or air leak from a bronchial injury. Patients with pneumothorax should have a chest tube before the intubation. In cases of bronchial injury, intubation can precipitate a massive air leak. Sometimes the physicians occlude a segment of the damaged lung with a bronchial blocker to avoid air escape.
