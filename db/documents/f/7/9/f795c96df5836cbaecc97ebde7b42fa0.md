Systemic Inflammatory response syndrome, being a highly sensitive definition, with the need to satisfy only two out of four criteria, comes with the invariable loss of specificity. A combination of two SIRS criteria can reflect a host of clinical presentations in an acute setting, which may not reflect an underlying inflammatory state that SIRS signifies. Some common ones include:

**Tachypnea and Tachycardia**

- Acute status asthmaticus with frequent administration of beta-agonists

- Acute salicylate toxicity

- Acute alcohol intoxication

- Acute ketoacidosis (diabetic, starvation, dehydration)

- Panic attack

**Tachycardia with Hyperthermia**

- Thyrotoxic crisis

- Acute intoxication with substance abuse (hallucinogens, psychotropic stimulants)

- Serotonin syndrome

- Malignant hyperthermia

- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

**Hyperthermia and Leucocytosis**

- Neurogenic emergency with acute hemorrhagic stroke (pontine).

The sustained presence of clinical criteria over time with repeated interval assessment, as well as corroboration with laboratory indices help distinguish them from an inflammatory milieu.
