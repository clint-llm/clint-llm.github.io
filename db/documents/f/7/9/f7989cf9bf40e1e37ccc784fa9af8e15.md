The kidney receives about 25% of the body's cardiac output. Therefore are quite sensitive to any decrease in perfusion and oxygenation. In the setting of severe/prolonged decreased blood flow or hypoxia to these organs, it impairs cellular integrity and metabolism and ultimately vascular, glomerular, and tubular dysfunction. The damage is reflected by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which falls in the setting of injury. However, the GFR is not always correlated to the underlying condition, demonstrating the complexity of vascular and tubular processes in renal dysfunction.

Some of the most common findings in AKI include ischemia, apoptosis, tubular necrosis, the detachment of renal epithelial cells from the basement membranes, effacement of the brush border in proximal tubules, tubular casts from sloughing of cells, interstitial edema, and even peritubular capillary congestion.
