Symptoms of an acute wrist sprain include but are not limited to pain, swelling, bruising, and difficulty with wrist movements, typically after an acute injury such as a fall on an outstretched hand.

A TFCC injury typically presents with ulnar-sided wrist pain and a positive ulnar fovea sign. The fovea sign is positive when pain is reproducible with palpation of the ulnar fovea, which lies between the ulnar styloid and the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon that inserts on the palmar aspect of the hand into the hamate and 5th metacarpal. The fovea sign has been shown to have a sensitivity of 95.2% and a specificity of 86.5%.

A Scapholunate ligament injury commonly presents following a fall onto aÂ dorsally extended and ulnar deviated hand. Wrist pain is usually dorsal-radial and accompanied by an inability to bear weight with the wrist extended, such as in a push-up position. The physical exam may show tenderness over the location of the scapholunate ligament, which is palpable on the dorsum of the wrist, immediately distal to the head of the radius. A scaphoid shift test can be performed as part of the physical exam to aid in the diagnosis with a positive likelihood ratio of 2.76 and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.25.
