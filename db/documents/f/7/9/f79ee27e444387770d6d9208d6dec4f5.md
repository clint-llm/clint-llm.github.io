The prognosis of hypospadias has improved significantly over the past 3 decades. Earlier treatments were fraught with poor technical skills, limited appreciation of the anatomy and poor surgical timing. Studies from the past 20 years indicate that the short term results are good but the long term results are guarded. Many adults continue to have some type of psychological issue with the cosmesis and others continue to have unsatisfactory sex lives.

Newer techniques to repair hypospadias continue to evolve; the availability of tissue glues and laser devices has led to better and faster wound healing.Â  But is should not be forgotten that this condition does have a significant psychological impact on the person and long term followup is essential.
