Exophthalmos typically arises from an increase in orbital contents within the bony orbit, leading to forward displacement of the globe. The origin of the increased orbital content depends on the underlying cause. In Graves ophthalmopathy, enlargement of the extraocular muscles and expansion of the orbital adipose tissues occurs due to abnormal hyaluronic acid accumulation and edema collection into the retro-orbital space.
