"Pilon," the French word for pestle, was first used by Etienne Destot in 1911 as an analogy for the mechanical function of the distal tibia on the talus. Fractures of the distal tibial plafond are also termed pilon fractures to describe the high energy axial compression force of the tibia as it acts as a pestle, driving vertically into the talus. These fractures account for approximately 1% to 10% of the lower leg or tibial fractures and are often associated with severe bone comminution and soft tissue compromise. Pilon fractures may also involve metaphyseal extension and can have associated fibular fractures. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of pilon fractures of the tibia and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the most frequent mechanisms of injury resulting in a pilon fracture.
- Review the diagnostic approach for an evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with a potential pilon fracture, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Outline the treatment options for pilon fractures, depending on patient population and fracture severity grading.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes with the treatment of pilon tibial fractures.
