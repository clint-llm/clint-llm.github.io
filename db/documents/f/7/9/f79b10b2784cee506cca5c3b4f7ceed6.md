Fosphenytoin is a water-soluble prodrug formulation of phenytoin. It received FDA approval in 1996 for use in epilepsy.

As an AED in the place of phenytoin, clinicians can also use it to prevent generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus. Its water solubility and decreased risk of adverse effects also make it a better choice of medication when compared to phenytoin. ItÂ has also been used off-label in traumatic brain injury to prevent early posttraumatic seizures.
