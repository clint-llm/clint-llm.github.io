The latency of the onset of this condition varies from a few hours to a few days after removal of the causative drug.

The basis of diagnosis is mainly on the highly characteristic and stereotypic appearance of the rash. The involvement of the gluteal and intertriginous areas and symmetry of lesions are key diagnostic features.

The diagnostic criteria for symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema are exposure to a systemically administered drug with the exclusion of contact allergens; characteristic well-demarcated erythema involving the gluteal, perianal, inguinal, or perigenital area; involvement of at least one intertriginous area; symmetry of the affected areas; and the absence of systemic symptoms.

In the literature, skin lesions are often reported as maculopapular erythema or as plaques. Atypical disease courses with pustules, papules, blisters, and there are descriptions of purpuric lesions also exist in rare cases.

SDRIFE typically does not present with mucosal involvement, and involvement of the face and palmoplantar surfaces is very uncommon.
