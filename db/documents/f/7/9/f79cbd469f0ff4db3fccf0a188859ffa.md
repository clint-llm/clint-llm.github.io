Before beginning the procedure, the physician should determine how many attempts will be made (usually only one or two) and, if planning more than one attempt, what technique should be used for the subsequent attempt. If unsuccessful after one or two attempts, further attempts should be aborted, and the patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist. Consider examining the contralateral ear and nose for other foreign bodies as well, particularly in children.

**Specific Techniques**

**Manual Instrumentation (e.g., forceps, curettes, angle hook)**

These instruments are typically used in conjunction with the operating head of an otoscope but can also be used with the diagnostic head. Binocular microscopy is ideal, though it may not be available in all settings; likewise, otologic endoscopes can be very helpful in trained hands.

**Irrigation**

This can be performed with either an angiocatheter or a section of tubing from a butterfly catheter. Using body temperature water, retract the pinna, and squirt water superiorly in the external auditory canal, behind the foreign body, which will then be washed out of the canal.

**Suction**

This should be performed with a suction-tipped catheter with a thumb-controlled release valve, such as a Frazier suction tip or a Schuknecht foreign body suction tip. Insert the suction tip against the foreign body under direct visualization, occlude the thumb hole, remove the object, and maintain suction until the foreign body is completely out of the EAC.

**Cyanoacrylate**

Apply a small amount of cyanoacrylate or skin glue to the cotton end of a cotton-tipped applicator; it may help to remove some of the cotton in order to diminish the size of the tip and improve visualization prior to application of the adhesive and insertion into the EAC. Once the glue is tacky, insert the applicator into the EAC and place the sticky end against the foreign body under direct visualization, holding it in place until the glue dries. Once the object is secured onto the applicator, it can be removed together with the applicator.

**Arthropod Removal**

The first step is to kill the arthropod, often a cockroach or a tick, allowing the patient to feel more comfortable and permit easier removal of the animal; multiple agents will accomplish this. Studies indicate that mineral oil is the most effective, followed by lidocaine.
