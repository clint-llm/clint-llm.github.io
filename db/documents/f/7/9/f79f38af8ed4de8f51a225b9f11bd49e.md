The peripheral nervous system derives from neural crest cells. The neural crest is divided axially into the cranial, vagal, truncal, and lumbosacral neural crest cells. Truncal neural crest cells contribute to the dorsal root of the spinal cord and the sympathetic ganglia. The parasympathetic innervation of the heart forms from the vagal neural crest.

The ENS originates from the vagal neural crest with cells that migrate in a rostral-to-caudal pattern through the intestinal wall, forming a network of glia and neurons of various subtypes.
