When acquiring a history, it is important to identify if an acute stressor is the culprit of injury. For example, if the patient recently changed their workout routine or has any new occupational responsibilities that increase mechanical stress on the injured tendon. It is also important to ask the patient about the impact the injury has on their activities of daily living (ADLs) and if the patient is on any new medications (including antibiotics), as these answers will help guide treatment. A physical exam should include a basic musculoskeletal evaluation in addition to palpation of the involved tendon. Depending on the tendon involved, special tests can be used to evaluate further. Tendinosis is often diagnosed after the history has been gathered, and a physical exam is performed. Depending on the clinical scenario, further testing can be obtained to characterize the injury better.
