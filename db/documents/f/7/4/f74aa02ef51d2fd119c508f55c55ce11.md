Anatomical variants are important to identify to promptly and correctly diagnose nerve dysfunction to prevent delay of treatment. Two nerve variations include Martin-Gruber and Riche-Cannieu anastomoses.

Martin-Gruber anastomosis is a communication between the median and ulnar nerve in the forearm anywhere distal to the medial epicondyle. With this anatomical variant, the motor nerves innervating the intrinsic ulnar muscles are carried by the anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve. In the middle forearm, these fibers leave the anterior interosseous nerve to join the ulnar nerve. Therefore, with this variant, patients can present with functional intrinsic hand muscles despite dysfunction of the ulnar nerve.

Riche-Cannieu anastomosis occurs when the median and ulnar nerves connect in the palm. This variant displays as motor fibers that are typically carried by the median nerve, now carried by the ulnar nerve to the hand and then cross over in the palm. This is clinically significant in the setting of carpal tunnel syndrome. Patients with advanced median nerve pathology could have normal function of the standard median nerve distribution.
