CHIKV is known to transmit in 2 cycles: urban and sylvatic. Urban transmission is from human to mosquito to human and is the main source of the current Western Hemisphere epidemic. Sylvatic transmission can be found in Africa and is based on animal to mosquito to human.Ae. aegypti, but incorporation of Ae. albopictus through a mutation in the E1 envelope protein not only increased the fitness of the virus in this species but improved transmissibility to vertebrates.

The route of infection used by CHIKV starts after inoculation and infection of human epithelial and endothelial cells, primary fibroblasts, and monocyte-derived macrophages.
