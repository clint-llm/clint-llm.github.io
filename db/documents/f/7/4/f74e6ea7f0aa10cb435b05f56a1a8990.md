Even though the exact etiology of spontaneous intestinal perforation is speculative, prematurity is the significant risk factor for developing this condition. Several other antenatal and postnatal risk factors have been described as follows:

**Antenatal**

Severe maternal chorioamnionitis with collective evidence of fetal vascular response is reported to be a risk factor for the development of spontaneous intestinal perforation. Antenatal medications such as glucocorticoids, indomethacin, and magnesium sulfate have been linked to spontaneous intestinal perforation in extremely low birth weight infants but remain a topic of debate.

Additional risk factors include perinatal conditions associated with fetal hypoxia, such as maternal preeclampsia, oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, low activity (tone), pulse, grimace, appearance, and respiration (APGAR) scores.

**Postnatal**

Early postnatal glucocorticoids have been associated with an increased incidence of spontaneous intestinal perforation. This was first described by a randomized controlled trial for early postnatal hydrocortisone for chronic lung disease, which showed improvement in respiratory outcomes but with an increased risk of spontaneous intestinal perforation.Â There is some recent evidence for using a lower dose of hydrocortisone to improve respiratory outcomes without increasing the risk of spontaneous intestinal perforation.

Early indomethacin was associated with spontaneous intestinal perforation if combined with dexamethasone.

Candida and coagulase-negative staphylococcus epidermidis have been isolated from the peritoneal cultures in cases of spontaneous intestinal perforation. It is unclear whether these infections were a cause of spontaneous intestinal perforation or post-perforation infections since these are the normal gastrointestinal colonizers in extremely low birth weight infants.

Early enteral feeding in extremely low birth weight infants is associated with decreased incidence of spontaneous intestinal perforation.
