Treatment of the primary condition is the most crucial aspect of management. For example, treating the lesion responsible for PAH, such as mitral valve regurgitation/stenosis, often improves PR.

Symptomatic patients who are not surgical candidates receive management with heart failure therapy, especially diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and digoxin.

Patients with iatrogenic PR caused by the surgical correction of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) might benefit from a treatment specifically directed at the pulmonary valve. In such conditions, valve replacement may be necessary, preferably with a porcine bioprosthesis or a pulmonary allograft. With recent advances, transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement is being implemented with great success in native pulmonic valve disease and PR following surgical correction of congenital heart defects.

The following are the indications for surgery:

1. Severe symptomatic PR

2. Asymptomatic severe PR with two out of four of the following conditions

- Elevated right ventricular volume (end-diastolic vol. index more than 160 mL/m^2 or end-systolic volume index of 80 ml/m2)

- Elevated right ventricular pressure.

- Reduced exercise tolerance

- Mild to moderate systolic dysfunction of either right or left ventricle

A bioprosthetic valve is preferable to a mechanical valve as long-term anticoagulation is not required and has better longevity (up to 15 years).

Percutaneous pulmonary valve implantation is indicated in patients with dysfunctional conduit in the right ventricular outflow tract with a regurgitant prosthetic valve. This procedure involves artificial valve placement through central venous access. The success rate of this procedure is about 94% to 98%. Procedural complication rates are between 3% to 6%, among which coronary artery compression is the most important one. Another advantage of this procedure is very little hospitalization time (4 to 5 days), and patients will be able to go back to their work immediately post-discharge. Infective endocarditis forms the most important delayed complication.
