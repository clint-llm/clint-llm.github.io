Dermoscopy is noninvasive and allows visualization of the skin structures in the epidermis, dermo-epidermal junction, and superficial dermis.

A biopsy is essential in cases in which the clinical setting is overlapping with different entities having distinctive histopathologic findings. For an ideal full-thickness biopsy, it is important to include the hypodermis. This can be performed with a simple 3 mm punch that minimizes scarring in the affected area. Any smaller size is at risk of being non-diagnostic.

Patch tests can be useful for identifying the causative allergen if an allergic dermatitis is suspected. Clinical clues are the presence of persistent, pruritic, eczematous eruptions in which any other identifiable cause has been excluded. If the patient tests positive, they should be encouraged to avoid the specific allergen. A follow-up after a few weeks of allergen avoidance is strongly recommended.
