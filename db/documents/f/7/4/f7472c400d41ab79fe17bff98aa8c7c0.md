No specific treatment is necessary for patients with incidentally discovered mega cisterna magna. Medications may treat associated signs/symptoms that may or may not be directly related to the mega cisterna magna, including headache, seizure, or psychiatric illness.

There is a limited role in surgical intervention, which may include CSF diversion for the treatment of hydrocephalus. However, if hydrocephalus is present, the diagnosis of mega cisterna magna should be questioned. Other surgical interventions include suboccipital craniectomy, with the surgical exploration of 2 patients in an early study without relief of patient symptoms.

There is no clear established follow-up timeline for patients with mega cisterna magna. It is probably reasonable to follow patients into adolescence and early adulthood as manifestations, if present, may not initially present in early childhood. There are no clear follow-up guidelines for adults with incidentally discovered mega cisterna magna.

It is likely reasonable in an asymptomatic adult with an incidentally discovered cisterna magna on a high-resolution image, such as an MRI of the brain, to follow up on an as-needed basis with repeat imaging obtained if new symptoms were to develop.
