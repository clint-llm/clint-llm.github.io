Contraindications to ipratropium inhaler use include patients that are hypersensitive to atropine; this is secondary to the similarity in structure to atropine.

Ipratropium aerosols can cause bronchospasms (paradoxical), which usually happens upon the initial use of this medication. Patients should understand this possibility. If this adverse reaction occurs, then this medication should be immediately discontinued.

Previous severe allergic reaction symptoms upon using ipratropium or atropine and its other derivatives, such as angioedema, urticaria, severe shortness of breath, oropharyngeal edema, and ultimately anaphylaxis is a contraindication to ipratropium use.

Caution is necessary for the use of intranasal/inhaled ipratropium in patients with hypertrophic prostate.

Exercise caution with the use of intranasal/inhaled ipratropium in patients with obstruction of the bladder neck.

Caution is recommended in the use of intranasal/inhaled ipratropium in patients with closed-angle glaucoma.

Ipratropium is labeled as category B regarding pregnancy since there are no reports of teratogenesis in animals or humans with ipratropium use (aerosols or nasal spray), but studies in humans are limited. Ipratropium should only be used during pregnancy if the mother's benefits outweigh possible fetus risks.
