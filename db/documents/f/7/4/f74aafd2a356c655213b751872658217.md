The white matter of the frontal lobes and, less often, of the temporal lobes, is affected by extensive demyelination, which sometimes evolves into real cavity lesions. In the subsequent stages, the pathological process can involve all the white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brainstem with dilation of the ventricular cavities.

From the histological point of view, in the areas affected by the disease process, it is shown widespread vacuolation due to the degeneration of the myelin sheaths. This degeneration is characterized by the finding, in subpial, subependymal, and perivascular sites, of eosinophilic fibers with radial arrangement with respect to adjacent surfaces, called Rosenthal fibers that increase in number and volume over the course of the disease. These fibers, composed of fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, αβ-crystallin, and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), are contained exclusively in the soma and the astrocytic axons, and they were initially thought to be pathognomonic of Alexander disease. Subsequently, however, they have been found in numerous other pathological processes such as central pontine myelinolysis and multiple sclerosis as well as no-neurodegenerative diseases such as cancer disease, respiratory and heart failure, and diabetes mellitus.

The relief of Rosenthal fibers remains, however, a differential diagnostic criterion between Alexander disease and the other leukodystrophies.
