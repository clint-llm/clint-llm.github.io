Simethicone is a frequently prescribed drug by primary care providers, internists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and gastroenterologists to treat flatulence and bloating. A knowledgeable provider can utilize simethicone to improve the patient's symptoms. In the hospital setting, simethicone can be ordered before meals and at bedtime, scheduled four times a day as needed. Hospital workflow and patient cognition is a consideration in inpatient settings. It can be more beneficial to order simethicone as a scheduled regimen, so the patient receives multiple doses consistently. Simethicone is highly cost-effective in treating bloating and flatulence. It is an OTC product purchased without a prescription. Pharmacists can assist with proper dosing and administration. Nursing can help to improve patient's utilization of simethicone. A dietician can assist a patient in enhancing their eating habits to avoid carbonated beverages and foods that increase gastrointestinal gas formation. The interprofessional team approach is the best means by which optimal patient outcomes can be achieved when using simethicone therapeutically. Thus, simethicone can help to treat flatulence and bloating safely. [Level 2]
