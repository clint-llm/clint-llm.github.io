Cleft lip and palate (CL/P) is one of the most common congenital craniofacial abnormalities. It is characterized by failure of normal fusion of the palate and lip at the midline during development resulting in a clinically obvious deformity of the newborn. Cleft lip and palate (CL/P) and cleft palate alone (CPO) are not only cosmetic deformities but have significant functional morbidity for the newborn without adequate management. CL/P impacts the newbornâ€™s ability to feed in multiple ways, including increased nasal reflux, inability to form an adequate latch, and increased work of feeding leading to fatigue. Further, while isolated CL/P and CPO are not uncommon, these defects are often part of congenital syndromes that must be recognized and can benefit from early characterization and management. CL/P and CPO are, therefore, paradigm situations for the involvement of an interprofessional social and medical healthcare team.
