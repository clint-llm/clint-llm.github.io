The six-minute walk test is a simple cardiopulmonary functional testing modality. Its straightforward nature allows for a non-specific, integrated assessment of the many systems involved during physical activity. Specifically, its results can assist in ascertaining the degree of functional impairment and potentially lead to modifications in therapy for some cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions. This activity reviews the six-minute walking test, its physiological basis, uses in practice, and outlines the role of the healthcare team in its performance.
