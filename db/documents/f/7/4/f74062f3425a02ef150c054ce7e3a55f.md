An interprofessional approach is crucial for the patients' proper diagnosis, management, and follow-up. The team should include the primary care clinician or pediatrician, the specialized orthopedic team (pediatric orthopedic specialist, pediatric orthopedic nurse, cast technician, pediatric anesthesiologist, pediatric orthopedic scrub nurse), pediatric psychologist, play therapists, physiotherapists, and orthotic providers. The patients may need weekly changes and application of casts and may also need individualized postoperative care. Precise and careful collaboration between all involved members of the interprofessional team is essential for the optimal outcome of every pediatric patient. [LevelÂ 5]
