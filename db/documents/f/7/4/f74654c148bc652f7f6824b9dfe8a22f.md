Scheduled follow-up appointments in the aging population with their primary care physician should focus on fall prevention and promotion of bone health through exercise and medication. An emphasis on bony surveillance aims to avoid the dreaded complications of a fragility fracture. If a patient suffers a fragility fracture, they should be referred to a primary care or rheumatology physician to manage their bone health and develop a program to decrease the risk of future fractures.
