The commonly encountered neural tube defects categorized according to their embryological timeframe are as follows

- Defects of neural folding and neuropore closure—myelomeningocele, anencephaly, encephalocele

- Incomplete dysjunction—dermal sinus, dermoids, and epidermoids

- Premature dysjunction—cord lipomas

- Defective gastrulation—split cord malformation, neurenteric cysts

- Disordered secondary neurulation—thickened filum terminale, myelocystocele

- Failure of caudal neuraxial development—sacral agenesis
