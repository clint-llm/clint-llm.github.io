FED inheritance is in an autosomal dominant manner with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance**.**

There are several factors that correlate with FED which contribute to its complex pathophysiology. Early-onset FED has heavy influence of genetic factors and is often a familial autosomal dominant disease.

The SLC4A11 gene encodes the ion channel that facilitates water resorption through the endothelium layer and is an important mediator of deturgescence of the cornea. Mutations in this gene can lead to corneal edema and have correlated with FED. Similarly, mutations in the ZEB1 gene, which encodes the transcription factor Zinc finger E-Box binding homeodomain 1, have been associated with late-onset FED and posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy. The AGBL1 gene encodes the deglutamylase enzyme ATP/GTP binding protein-like 1, and mutations in the gene are associated with FED. Missense mutations in the LOXHD1 gene are associated with progressive hearing loss and corneal endothelial cell dysfunction in FED.
