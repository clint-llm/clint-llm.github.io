Patients with coronary artery calcifications are usually asymptomatic or may complain of exertional symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea. Past history should focus on the presence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors like hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking. Patients with valvular calcifications may present with exertion chest pain, dyspnea or syncope/near syncope depending on the severity of valve calcification and stenosis. Physical examination may reveal a murmur depending on the valve involved. Patients with pericardial calcifications may present with symptoms of right-sided heart failure, including ascites and pedal edema. They usually have a previous history of infection or radiation exposure. The examination is significant for a raised jugular venous pulse and positive Kussmaul's sign, fluid shift, and dullness to percussion in the abdomen. In patients with myocardial calcification, a history of preceding global or focal myocardial injury is usually present. A previous history of severe sepsis or septic shock may also be present in such patients.
