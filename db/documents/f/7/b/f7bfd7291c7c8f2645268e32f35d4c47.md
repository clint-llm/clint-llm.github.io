Diagnosis of Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is made mainly by genetic mutations analysis of the involved gene by doing Sanger sequencing of the PCR products.

These increased urinary basic fibroblast growth factor levels coincide with the pre-osseous angiogenic phase of early fibroproliferative lesions. Another important diagnostic tool is Imaging analysis. Plain X-rays can reveal abnormal osteogenesis after heterotopic ossification manifests. CT scan can also show lesions with typical heterotopic ossifications.
