The clinical significance of electrodiagnostic studies is primarily diagnostic and prognostic in nature. These studies are used by physicians to confirm, localize, prognosticate, age, and grade the severity of neurological injuries and/or diseases. Often times neurological diseases manifest with nebulous presentations. Electrodiagnosis is one tool physicians may use to differentiate between diseases that may have similar or subtle presentations. In brachial plexopathies specifically, nerve conduction and EMG studies help to localize lesions and provide one further diagnostic test to either support or refute a suspected lesion. These studies can also be completed in series in order to track the recovery process after an injury and may be used in concert with imaging studies to guide decision-making processes regarding interventional management such as surgical decompression, or reimplantation procedures. In this way, electrodiagnosis can be used by physicians to guide the management of the patient.
