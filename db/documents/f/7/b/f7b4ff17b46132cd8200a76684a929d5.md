These patients present to the hospital with agitation, chest pain, anxiety, psychosis, and blunt and penetrating traumatic injuries. They are frequently hypertensive and tachycardic. They may be unwilling to disclose their cocaine use, and clinicians must consider a wide spectrum of diagnoses during the initial evaluation, such as withdrawal syndromes, thyrotoxicosis, acute psychosis, sepsis, pheochromocytoma, anticholinergic toxicity, serotonin and neuroleptic malignant syndromes, and intracranial hemorrhage.

A thorough history of drug abuse should be sought, including past admissions.

Patients suspected of cocaine toxicity may have the following features:

- Hypertension

- Altered mental status

- Seizure

- Chest pain, dyspnea

- Epistaxis

- Headache

- Paranoia

- Neurological deficits

- Hyperthermia

- Vascular spasm and loss of distal pulses

- Extreme diaphoresis

- Severe agitation, restlessness, confusion

- Pruritus

- Blurring of vision

- Corneal ulceration, vision loss

- Diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain (think mesenteric ischemia)

- Excited delirium

**Stages of Acute Cocaine Toxicity**

Three stages of acute cocaine toxicity have been described and include the following:

**Stage 1**

- CNS: Headache, nausea, mydriasis, vertigo, twitching, pseudohallucinations, and preconvulsive movements

- Vascular: Increased BP, ectopic beats

- Pulmonary: Tachypnea

- Skin: Hyperthermia

- Psychiatric: Paranoia, euphoria, confusion, aggression, agitation, emotional lability, restlessness

**Stage 2**

- CNS: Encephalopathy, seizures, increased deep tendon reflexes, incontinence

- Cardiac: Hypertension, arrhythmias,Â  peripheral cyanosis

- Pulmonary: Tachypnea, gasping, apnea, irregular breathing

- Skin: Hyperthermia

**Stage 3**

- CNS, Areflexia, coma, fixed and dilated pupils, loss of vital functions

- Cardiac: Hypotension, ventricular fibrillation, cardiac arrest

- Pulmonary: Apnea, respiratory failure, cyanosis, agonal breathing
