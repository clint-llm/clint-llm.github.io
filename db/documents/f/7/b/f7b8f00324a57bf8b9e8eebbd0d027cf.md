It is unclear why GERD leads to neck and back dystonia, some authors have postulated the movements and abnormal postures are a learned behavior to relieve abdominal discomfort and improve esophageal motility. In 1964 Dr. Kinsbourne published a series of five cases of patients with muscle dystonia and hiatal hernia; in three of them, head positioning was able to relieve abdominal discomfort. However, central neurological pathways could be involved; further investigation is necessary in this area.
