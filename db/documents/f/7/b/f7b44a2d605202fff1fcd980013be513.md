Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory disorder that presents as well-defined, scaly, erythematous plaques, and occasionally, sterile pustules. Several clinical variants of psoriasis exist including plaque psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, and pustular variants. Psoriasis frequently involves the joints, leading to psoriatic arthritis. Nail involvement is found in 10-80% of patients with psoriasis.

Guttate psoriasis is a distinct variant of psoriasis that is classically triggered by streptococcal infection (pharyngitis or perianal) and is more common in children and adolescents than adults. Patients present with several, small “drop-like” lesions that respond well to topical and phototherapies.
