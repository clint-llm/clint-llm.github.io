The primary histochemistry markers for T cells are their various surface receptors and signaling molecules. These markers have previously been discussed in the other sections. All T lymphocytes have the TCR and the pan-T cell co-receptor CD3. CD4+ T cells have CD4, whereas CD8+ T cells have CD8 as an added co-receptor. T regulatory cells have CD4, and CD25 added as co-receptors for their TCRs. Various chemokine receptors can also serve as T-cell markers, based on their respective functions. The CCR5 and CXCR4 (found mostly on CD4+ T cells) chemokine receptors are of particular importance because they are the targets of HIV.
