Cardiovascular management: Maintenance of intravascular volume and systemic perfusion is essential. Urine output, central venous pressure, body weight, and physical signs of perfusion were used to assess the volume status. Inotropic support such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or dopamine or adding peripheral impella or percutaneous atrial septostomy should be considered to sustain a good cardiac output. Echocardiography should be performed to monitor the heart’s condition, rule out thrombosis, or check upon any change in ECMO flow or in case of worsening of patient’s hemodynamics.

Pulmonary management: Patients on ECMO should have daily radiographs, endotracheal suctioning every 4 to 6 hours depending on the secretions, frequent posture changes, and flexible bronchoscopy when required.

**Renal System Management**

- Oliguric phase: for initial 24 to 48 hours of ECMO trigger of acute inflammation reaction leads to capillary leak and intravascular volume depletion. As a result, oliguria and acute tubular necrosis follow.

- Diuretic phase: after 48 hours diuretic phase begins that is the earliest sign of recovery. Diuretics are required if oliguria persists for more than 48 to 72 hours.

If renal failure does not improve, continuous renal replacement therapy can be added. Kielstein et al. reported requirement for CRRT in ECMO is around 60%, three months survival after CRRT for AKI is 17% vs. 53% without CRRT. To conclude, CRRT in AKI on ECMO increases mortality.

Central nervous system management: Regular neurological examination, preventing paralysis, and using a sedation vacation are encouraged. We should have a low threshold to follow the imaging studies in case of suspicion, and aggressive management for seizures is recommended.

Infection control: Strict monitoring for infection or sepsis development is advised. Pan cultures once a week or upon infection suspicion is recommended.

Hematologic considerations: Hemoglobin >8 g/dL is recommended for patients on ECMO. Platelet transfusion is encouraged to maintain a platelet count above 100,000/mcL. Activated clotting time (ACT) should be maintained between 180 to 240 seconds to avoid bleeding complications.

Nutrition, fluid, and electrolytes: Nutrition requirements should be maintained using hyperalimentation techniques. Total parenteral nutrition delivers fluids, electrolytes, vitamins, minerals, glucose, proteins (amino acids), and often lipids (fat) into the vein. Close monitoring of fluids and electrolytes (potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, and ionized calcium) is advised. For the first three days on ECMO due to fluid resuscitation, fluid retention, and oliguria, the patient’s weight is expected to increase.
