Occipital nerve stimulation (ONS) is a neuromodulation technique aimed at the treatment of different types of neuralgia. This minimally invasive adjustable, and reversible approach provides an implantable device composed of a subcutaneous regional electrode and a pulse generator. It was first described by Picaza et al., in 1977, and thus performed on 13 patients by Weiner and Reed in 1999 for the “control of intractable occipital neuralgia.”
