The most common complications associated with lymphangioma circumscriptum include cellulitis and lymphatic fluid leakage. Rare cases of squamous cell carcinoma, verruciform xanthoma, and lymphangiosarcoma arising within lymphangioma have been reported. Large cystic hygromas of the neck can cause infection, as well more serious issues including dysphagia and respiratory problems.

Acquired lymphangiomas are not believed to have malignant potential; however, associated chronic lymphedema places the patient at risk for lymphangiosarcoma, which is an aggressive tumor with a dismal prognosis. Cutaneous angiosarcoma has also been reported in massive localized lymphedema in morbidly obese patients.

Acquired lymphangiectasia can be painful, and poor lymphatic drainage may lead to bacterial infection.
