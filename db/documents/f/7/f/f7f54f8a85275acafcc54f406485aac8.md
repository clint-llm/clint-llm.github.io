Clomipramine is a tertiary amine belonging to the class of medications known as tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). It is a dibenzazepine TCA. Clomipramine is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (S-RI) with a stronger affinity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) than other TCAs and S-RIs.

Metabolism of clomipramine is primarily through the liver via oxidation by CYP450 2D6. The half-life of clomipramine is 17 to 28 hours. Clomipramine is then metabolized to the steady-state active metabolite desmethyl clomipramine by CYP450 1A2.
