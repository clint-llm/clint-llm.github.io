Dysdiadochokinesia is one of the features of cerebellar dysfunction, but other clinical findings associated with cerebellar dysfunction can help you localize and narrow the differential diagnosis of the patient.

**Clinical Symptoms**

Typically affects the coordination of alternating movements and ambulation of the proximal and distal upper and lower extremity.

**Physical Exam**

It is relevant to include in the neurological exam other areas to increase the degree of certainty of the clinical findings and help with the diagnosis, which includes:

- Cognition- impairments in executive functions, visual-spatial procedural memory, language, and mood regulation

- Language- impairments in articulation and speech planning, verbal fluency, semantic word retrieval, syntax, reading, and writing

- Oculomotor deficits- impaired ocular stability-misalignment, horizontal or vertical nystagmus, saccades smooth pursuit, and vestibulo-ocular reflex

- Dysarthria- ataxic speech (impairments in saying “papa”, “kaka”,  "tata", “lala”)

- Dysdiadochokinesia-slowed or clumsy alternating supination/pronation of upper extremities, turning a doorknob, changing lightbulb movements, foot-tapping, and abdomen tapping

- Dysmetria-inaccurate finger to nose and heel to shin testing

- Tone- decreased

- Tremors-including intention or kinetic tremors in finger to nose testing, difficulties grabbing objects, and impaired kinetic proprioception

- Gait ataxia-wide based, impaired heel walk, tandem and Romberg test
