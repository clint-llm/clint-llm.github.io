Facial fractures in children are often only produced by dramatic impacts and are therefore highly associated with severe concomitant traumatic injuries. Of primary concern are airway consequences from severe facial trauma and neurological damage from head injuries.

**Causes of injury must always be considered, including:**

- Non-accidental trauma (such as child abuse or neglect)

- Intimate partner violence

- Physical or sexual assault

- Risk-taking behaviors

- Lack of protective equipment use or availability

- Suicide attempt or other self-injurious behavior

**In addition to specific bony facial fractures, the following must also be considered:**

**Bony Injuries**

- Mandible dislocation

- Sinus involvement in fractures

- Skull or cervical spine fractures

- Cartilage injuries (including nose and ear)

- Tooth avulsions or fractures

**Soft Tissue Wounds and Injuries**

- Lacerations and contusions

- Penetrating wounds and retained foreign bodies

- Septal or auricular hematomas

- Eye injuries (including globe rupture, retrobulbar hematoma, corneal damage)

- Ductal and glandular injuries

- Neurovascular damage
