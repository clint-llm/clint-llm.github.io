Pulse oximeters are very well tolerated and are used in all age groups ranging from neonates to geriatric populations. Energy transfer to patients is low and, while heat blisters with prolonged use of certain sensors are possible, most of the complaints come from an allergic reaction to the adhesives or the mechanical adhesive properties of the single-use sensors. Pressure points from clip sensors are possible, but also rare and can be minimized by using adhesive probes.
