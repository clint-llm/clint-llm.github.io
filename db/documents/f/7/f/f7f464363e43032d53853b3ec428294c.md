Orbital hypertelorism is defined as an increased distance between the orbits, with true lateral displacement of the orbits. Anthropometric measurements will yield increased inner canthal distance (ICD), increased outer canthal distance (OCD), and increased interpupillary distance (IPD). Increases in all three measurements above the 95th percentile on normative anthropometric values are observed in true orbital hypertelorism. Increased inner canthal distance alone is more properly described at telecanthus. For the sake of this article, hypertelorism will be used interchangeably with orbital hypertelorism. Additionally, this article will discuss true orbital hypertelorism, with a review of telecanthus in the section on differential diagnosis.
