Osteoarthritis is a common condition involving articular surfaces that can develop gradually over time into a debilitating condition, which causes pain and restriction of motion. An estimated 80% of Americans have an episode of low back pain during their lifetime.

Low back pain and spine arthritis are among the leading health-related causes of disability and reduction in patient quality of life. The number of back pain cases continues to increase with the current obesity epidemic and increased life expectancy. Furthermore, low back pain accounts for an estimated 149 million lost workdays each year in the United States. These lost wages substantially affect Americaâ€™s gross domestic product.

Arthritis can affect any articular surface; it is more likely to affect weight-bearing joints, including the joints of the spinal column.
