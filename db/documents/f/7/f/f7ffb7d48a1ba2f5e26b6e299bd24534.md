Plain film X-ray is the most common initial imaging modality to evaluate hand injuries and associated fractures and MCP joint instabilities.  UCL distal end injury is suspected if an avulsed bony fragment in the proximal phalanx is present.  A displacement greater than 1 mm indicates a displaced UCL tear.

Magnetic resonance ( MR ) arthrography is considered the gold standard when evaluating for UCL injuries.

Recent literature has highlighted the growing advantage of ultrasound (US).  In addition to being non-invasive, cost-effective, and less time consuming, ultrasound has been shown to have 100% sensitivity and specificity in discerning between non-displaced and displaced tears.

The real-time capability of the ultrasound can easily show the anatomic relationship of the UCL as it pertains to adductor aponeurosis.

The appearance of a Stener lesion on the ultrasound has been called the “tadpole sign” or “yo-yo on a string sign.”  Ridley et al. note “The head of the tadpole is formed by the retracted proximal fragment of the UCL which displaces to be adjacent to the head of the metacarpal. The tail of the tadpole is formed by the adductor aponeurosis which is often thickened and lies deep to the retracted UCL fibers.”
