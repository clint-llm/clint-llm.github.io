HUS and TTP are subsets within the general category of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MHA).E. Coli 0157H7. The patient, usually a child, presents with colitis manifesting bloody diarrhea. The toxin binds to the endothelial walls of blood vessels leading to uncontrolled complement activation, vessel damage, and thrombosis with fibrosis. Blood cells are fractionated as they travel through these vessels leading to their formation as schistocytes. Treatment is supportive, with volume expansion as the mainstay of successful intervention. Antibiotics are of little help.

A difficult situation occurs where the patient presentation may initially overlap between TTP and HUS to such an extent that the clinician may be unclear as to the true problem. In this circumstance, since TTP carries the more immediate and higher mortality, it is better to place the patient initially on plasma exchange (PEX). If the patient has TTP, this would be most beneficial. PEX has been known to provide at least a modicum of relief in HUS, but if a response is not forthcoming, then the administration of eculizumab is recommended. This drug is a monoclonal antibody against the C5 of the C5-9 complement complex. It thereby obstructs complement-mediated MHA, and it can improve renal function.
