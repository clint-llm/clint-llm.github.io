Orthostasis is a relatively common problem in clinical medicine and is best managed by an interprofessional team because of the numerous causes. The key is to improve the quality of life with proper treatment.  First, eliminate predisposing factors, especially medications, and exclude hypovolemic status. Then, start stepwise with non-pharmacological maneuvers, followed by pharmacologic interventions. Symptoms must be assessed in every consult to monitor progress. Initially the treatment is non-pharmacological but for those who fail to respond, pharmacological therapy is the next step. The outlook for those who remain compliant with therapt are excellent.
