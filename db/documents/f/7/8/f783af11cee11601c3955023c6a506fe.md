Internal osteocytic histochemical design is still under active research; scientists generated a few hypotheses. The first theory suggests that osteocytic enzymatic reactions occur due to the artifactual diffusion of TRAPâ€™s (Type 5 tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) histochemical reaction yields from the actual reaction site (bone-resorbing surface). A second theory suggests that the enzyme reactions are not histochemical diffusion artifacts but true reactions that display TRAP proteins in osteocytes; by this hypothesis, the scientists proposed that the proteins diffuse from the bone-resorbing surface via the bone canaliculi under physiological treatments in vivo.

A final hypothesis indicates that osteocytic enzymatic reactions directly show the TRAP enzyme proteins produced by the respective osteocytes. While all of the proposed hypotheses are under study, one investigation strongly suggests that osteocytes in proximal areas to bone resorption surface create TRAP proteins and display histochemical TRAP reactions taking place within cytoplasmic granular structures. The probable TRAP protein diffusion deriving from osteoclasts via bone canaliculi to the TRAP-positive osteocytes is significant.
