Gastritis is characterized by inflammation, mucosal edema, vascular dilation, smooth muscle proliferation in the lamina propria, and vascular congestion. The glands in the gastric mucosa may appear tortuous or take on a corkscrew appearance. There is neutrophilic infiltration and active granulation with mononuclear infiltration within mucosal layers. Fibrinoid necrosis may also be found. In chronic forms, lymphocytes, monocytes, and plasma cells infiltrate the mucosa and submucosa.
