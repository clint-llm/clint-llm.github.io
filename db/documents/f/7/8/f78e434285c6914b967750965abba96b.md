Eccrine glands are derived from embryonic ectoderm. These glands form on the palmoplantar skin around the fourth month of gestation and develop across the remainder of the body about one month later. Eccrine glands are completely formed by the time of birth.

Apocrine glands are derived from the differential of a hair follicle. Hair follicles typically begin to develop in the head of an embryo at about 9 weeks and continue to develop caudally. These follicles are made up of cells that eventually differentiate into the follicle, infundibulum, sebaceous, and apocrine units. At about 4 months of gestation, the apocrine gland arises from the infundibulum, the epithelial structure below the hair follicle, and is continuous with the skin epidermis.
