Various conditions result in the inflammation of the SI joint, leading to significant pain. Osteoarthritis can cause degeneration of the joint resulting in pathologic articulation and motion leading to this condition. Spondyloarthropathies themselves can cause significant inflammation of the joint itself. Pregnancy is another cause of the inflammation due to the hormone relaxin leading to the relaxation, stretching, and possible widening of the SI joint(s). The increased weight of pregnancy also causes extra mechanical stress on the joint, leading to further wear and tear. Trauma can cause direct or indirect stress and damage to the SI joint. Pyogenic sacroiliitis is the most frequently reported cause of acute sacroiliitis. Pain can originate from the synovial joint but can also originate from the posterior sacral ligaments.
