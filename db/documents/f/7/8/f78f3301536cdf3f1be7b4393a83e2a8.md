Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute-onset illness characterized by fever, hypotension, sunburn-like rash, and end-organ damage. TSS was classically associated with high absorbency tampon use in menstruating women until eventually, these were taken off the market. Since that time, it has become important also to consider non-menstrual cases. The incidence of TSS is estimated to be around 0.8 to 3.4 per 100,000 in the United States.
