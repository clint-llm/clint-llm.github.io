Undiagnosed or poorly managed PTX keratoconjunctivitis can lead to permanent visual defects, including corneal perforation and limbal stem cell failure. These complications result mainly from the extent of the initial exposure and delay in diagnosis (as noted above), where most cases present as mild exposure with no permanent defects.
