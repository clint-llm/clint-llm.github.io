There is no standardized laboratory monitoring established for terbinafine. In light of reports of both mild and severe liver injuries, clinicians often perform liver enzyme testing. The FDA recommends measuring serum transaminases before drug initiation. Although no established monitoring guidelines exist, the average time to drug-induced liver injury is nearly 30 days and usually within three months. Therefore, monitoring for idiosyncratic liver injury during this period may be reasonable.
