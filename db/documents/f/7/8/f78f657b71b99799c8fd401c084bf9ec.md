Fibrates such as fenofibrate activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha (PPAR-alpha), which upregulate lipoprotein lipase, induce high-density lipoprotein (HDL) synthesis, and decrease liver production of apolipoprotein C. Fibrates ultimately enhance the clearance of triglyceride-rich particles and plasma catabolism. Fibrates also enhance fatty acid oxidation via acyl CoA synthetase and other enzymes, further reducing triglycerides' synthesis. The end result is an overall reduction of plasma triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels. The decrease in VLDL can cause plasma triglyceride levels to decrease by 30% to 60%. In addition, fenofibrate may facilitate an increase in uric acid excretion and reduction of fibrinogen, which may help patients with gout and thrombosis.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Fenofibrate is well-absorbed (approximately 60%) after oral administration with a time of peak plasma concentration reaching 4 to 8 hours. It is a highly protein-bound drug (99%), and its steady-state concentration is reached within five days of administration. It is hydrolyzed into a primary metabolite, fenofibric acid, which is further conjugated with glucuronic acid. Fenofibrate has a terminal half-life of 20 to 23 hours. About 60% of the dose is excreted in the urine, and about 25% is excreted in the feces.
