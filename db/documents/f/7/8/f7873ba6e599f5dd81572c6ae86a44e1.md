Prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment can be complex and is often controversial. an interprofessional team of specialty-trained nurses, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, primary care providers, oncologists, radiation therapists, genetic counselors, and urologists must work together to manage:

- Unrealistic patient expectations

- New diagnostic aids and treatments are becoming available at a rapid rate.

- Conflicting recommendations and guidelines from the USPSTF and other professional organizations like the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, and the American Urological Association

- Recommendations and guidelines seem to be changing almost daily

- Decreased PSA screenings following the USPSTF report of 2012, a drop of 30%

- The entire PSA testing controversy

- Confusion about how best to use the newly available genomic tests and which ones are optimal at each stage of evaluation

- The need to better define the role and improve the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of prostatic MRI

- Fully implementing MRI image-directed biopsy technology such as MRI-TRUS fusion guidance

- Adopting advances in radiation therapy, including stereotactic ablative therapy (SABR)

- Clarifying the proper use of active surveillance; finding and using acceptable alternatives to mandatory repeat prostatic biopsies such as MRIs or PET scans

- The lack of good, minimally invasive curative therapies for a localized disease that are less expensive and better tolerated than definitive radiation therapy or radical surgery

- No clear protocol for the best timing or sequence for radium Ra 223 dichloride, docetaxel, and sipuleucel-T treatments

- Fully implementing baseline and follow-up DEXA scans every two years for patients expected to be on long-term hormone suppression

- Starting all long-term hormonal therapy patients on prophylactic therapy for osteoporosis to minimize skeletal fractures

- Ordering germline testing appropriately and learning how best to use the information learned from it to optimally benefit and counsel patients and their families

- Incorporating PET scans for initial staging and to identify early recurrences

- The need for better implementation of the various specialties involved in prostate cancer patient care, including primary care, urology, radiation therapy, palliative care, genetic counseling, and medical oncology, through improved communications and cooperation

These and many more issues continue to challenge clinicians who deal with prostate cancer patients and men at risk for this common, potentially lethal male malignancy.

The interprofessional team can optimize the treatment of these patients through communication and coordination of care. Primary care providers, urologists, oncologists, radiation oncologists, and nurse practitioners provide diagnoses and care plans. Specialty care urologic nurses should work with the team to coordinate care and be involved in patient education and monitoring compliance. The interprofessional team can thus improve outcomes for patients with prostate cancer. [Level 5]
