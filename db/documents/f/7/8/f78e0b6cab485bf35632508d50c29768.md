An interscalene nerve block anesthetizes most of the territory innervated by the brachial plexus, sparing the inferior trunk. This block is generally performed on patients undergoing shoulder, upper arm or elbow surgery. It is not recommended for hand surgery as the inferior trunk may be spared. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing an interscalene nerve block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the parts of the upper extremity that are anesthetized during interscalene nerve blocks.
- Outline the steps involved in performing an interscalene nerve block.
- Identify risks associated with interscalene nerve blocks.
- Explain a structured, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing interscalene nerve blocks.
