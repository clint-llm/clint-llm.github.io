Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common cancer occupying second place in cancer deaths worldwide. The majority of Hepatocellular carcinoma cases are due to chronic viral B and C hepatitis infections. In the United States, the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Database reported an increased incidence rate of 3.1% per year. Men have an incidence of 11.5 per 100,000 compared to 3.9 in women. Hepatocellular carcinoma death rates have also increased by 2.8% for males and 3.4% for females, per year. Hepatocellular carcinoma commonly presents in the older population after longstanding chronic liver disease. Regional and race/ethnical variations of hepatocellular carcinoma are dependent on the exposure risk factor. HBV is more prevalent worldwide, and HCV accounts for 30% of cases in the United States. HCV has a five-fold increased prevalence among individuals born in the United States between 1945 and 1965, raising their liver cancer-related mortality.
