Most patients undergoing any form of inguinal hernia repair generally have a good prognosis, as hernia repair surgery is both safe and effective. Following open surgery, the patient can usually resume their normal activities within a week or two. After any hernia surgery, the patient should avoid heavy lifting for six to eight weeks to permit full healing of all muscles and other tissues.
