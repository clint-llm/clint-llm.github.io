Histopathology typically shows irregular, asymmetric sebaceous lobules within the dermis. Malignant cells show significant amounts of pleomorphism, hyperchromatism, mitotic activity, and nuclear atypia. Lesions may be classified as poorly, moderately, or well-differentiated. Sebaceous carcinomas fall into four histopathologic categories: papillary, lobular, comedocarcinoma, and mixed.
