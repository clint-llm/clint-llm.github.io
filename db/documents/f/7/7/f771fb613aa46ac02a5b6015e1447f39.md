ACIP reviewed studies that showed childrenÂ developed a significant antibody response and antitoxin levels of the diseases after three to four doses of either Infanrix or Daptacel. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) surveyed any adverse events with the acellular pertussis vaccine in the United States. Overall, the studies support the safety of DTaP.

Clinicians should defer any vaccines with pertussis components in infants or children with suspected or evolving neurological disease, including seizures. Vaccination with pertussis components can begin or resume upon establishing a treatment regimen or the condition has stabilized.

An Arthus reaction (type III hypersensitivity reaction) can occur after administering vaccines with diphtheria toxoids or tetanus toxoids.
