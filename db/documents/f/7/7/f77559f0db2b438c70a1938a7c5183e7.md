The designation of brain death will often involve an interprofessional team. Nurses, physicians, social workers, and clergy will play a vital role in working with families during the evaluation and once the diagnosis is made. Subspecialists, such as neurology, neurosurgery, and radiology, may be required to interpret ancillary testing if the clinical diagnosis is inadequate. WhileÂ the diagnosis is considered, an interprofessional team specially trained in organ procurement should be involved; these specialty teams should handle all aspects of care only once the diagnosis of brain death has been made to ensure adequate protection for the team that cared for the patient until death.
