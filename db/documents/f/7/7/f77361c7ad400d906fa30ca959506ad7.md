Three basic pathologic occurrences lead to atrioventricular dissociation in a patient. These include:

- **AV Dissociation by Default**: This occurs due to the slowing of the dominant pacemaker, such as the SA node, leading to the dominance of an independent ventricular pacemaker. Demonstrated by junctional and escape rhythms. Often seen due to normal causality.

- **AV Dissociation by Usurpation**: Acceleration of latent pacemakers in the ventricles, whose rates exceed the intrinsic atrial rates. Retrograde atrial capture will not be witnessed here. Often pathological as opposed to AV dissociation by default.

- **Complete Heart Block**: Conduction between the SA node and the ventricles is prevented due to a pathological blockade, leading to independent rhythms.
