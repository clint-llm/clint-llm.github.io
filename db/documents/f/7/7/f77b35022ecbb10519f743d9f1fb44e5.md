Distal humerus fractures in the adult population represent about 2% of all fractures and 33% of all humerus fractures. They typically present in a bimodal distribution as either younger males or elderly females. They are usually the result of high-energy trauma in the young population and low-energy falls in the more elderly patient. These fractures can be very challenging to manage, as they often can involve an articular as well as a diaphyseal component. This activity reviews the causes, presentation, and management of distal humerus fractures by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of distal humerus fractures.
- Outline the presentation of a patient with a distal humerus fracture.
- Summarize the treatment options for distal humerus fracture.
-  Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by distal humerus fracture
