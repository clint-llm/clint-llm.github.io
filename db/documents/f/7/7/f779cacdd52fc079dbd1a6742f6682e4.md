**Combined Oral Contraceptive**

**Choice of COC:**Usually, Ethinyl estradiol dose is less than 50 mcg in this combination of pills. The pills can be either monophasic (same dose of both components in the active pills) or multiphasic (varying doses weekly of both or either component in the active pills). Depending on withdrawal bleeding desired by the patient and clinically recommended, it can be prescribed as a cyclic (monthly bleeding), extended cyclic (every three months bleeding), or continuous dosing(no bleeding).

- **Cyclic formulations:**The cyclic formulations have active hormone pills for 21-24 days, followed by 7-4 days of hormone-free pills.

- **Extended cycle formulations:**extended cycle formulations have active hormone pills every day for three months, followed by a placebo week.

- **Continous use formulation:**can be manipulated by using the only active pills from monthly formulations for one year period, which will functionally stop all menstrual bleeding. The most common complication from the extended cycle is break-through bleeding. Any formulation of a combined oral contraceptive pill can be used in this manner, but typically the monophasic pills are the easiest to manipulate.

**Initiation:**Combined oral contraceptive pills are to be taken daily at approximately the same time each day. Avoid taking them greater than 24 hours apart as this could affect efficacy. There are two methods of initiating COC for women per their priority as follow:

- **First-day start**: Pills are started on the first day of menses, and this is considered the best strategy as it attains contraceptive efficacy faster than other methods.

- **Quick start:**Pills are started on any day medicine is given to women. When patients initiate this method, they are not protected from pregnancy in the first seven days, and an additional form of birth control is recommended.

- **Sunday start:**Pills are started on the first sunday after the period begins. When patients initiate the contraceptive pills on the sunday start method, they are not protected from pregnancy in the first seven days. An additional way of birth control is recommended during this period.

- **Abortion/lost pregnancy:**After abortion or losing a pregnancy in the first two trimesters, start OC pills within the first seven days if contraception is desired.

- **Postpartum:**Avoid COC for the first 21 days following postpartum, as this group has a higher risk of venous thromboembolism. Postpartum women with a higher risk of VTE should not be started on COC for the first 42 days following delivery, irrespective of breastfeeding. Women age 35 years and above, BMI 30 kg/m, smoking, preeclampsia, immobility, thrombophilia, transfusion at delivery, peripartum cardiomyopathy, history of VTE, postpartum hemorrhage, or postcesarean delivery are at risk of VTE.

- **Breastfeeding women:**Avoid COC for the first 42 days following postpartum if a woman is breastfeeding as hormones impact lactation.

**Missed doses:**If a patient misses a tablet, take the missed tablet as soon as they remember and the next tablet at the usual time (taking two pills in 1 day). If the patient misses two tablets in a row in the first or second week, take two tablets the day the patient remembers and two pills the next day, then resume 1 per day. Use additional forms of contraception until the patient begins a new cycle.

**Emergency Contraception:**It****is recommended in the first week of the cycle if unprotected intercourse occurs and if two or more COC pills are missed (exception ulipristal acetate).****

**Progesterone Only Pill (POP)**

**Choice of POP:**CDC has provided guidelines for users of POPs who have other medical conditions. POP can be used by most women, and it appears to be chosen for women who have contraindications to COC or want to avoid the estrogen component in the contraceptive pill.

- Norethindrone is commercially available as 0.35 mg tablets, and the dose is lower than the dose used in COC pills. It comes in a packet of 28 hormone pills, which should be taken continuously, and there are no hormone-free pills in the pack.

- Drospirenone is commercially available as 4 mg drospirenone, and the package contains 24 hormone tablets with four hormone-free pills.

**Initiation:**The pill must be taken at the same time each day to maximize contraceptive efficacy. Use backup contraception if the patient starts POPs more than five days from the onset of menses. It can be started on any day of the menstrual cycle, but recommendations exist to begin on the first day of menses. Use a backup contraceptive (e.g., condoms) method for the first 48 hours following initiation if POP is started within the first five days of menses.

**Missed dose:**Women who miss taking a norethindrone POP dose by more than three hours or had vomiting or severe diarrhea within three hours of taking a POP are advised to take the missed pill as soon as they remember and the next tablet at the scheduled time. Use of additional contraception (e.g., condoms) for 48 hours after the late dose is also recommended.

**Emergency contraception:**It can be offered (except ulipristal acetate) to women who have unprotected intercourse within 48 hours of initiating POP or missed pill where backup contraception or abstinence was advised.
