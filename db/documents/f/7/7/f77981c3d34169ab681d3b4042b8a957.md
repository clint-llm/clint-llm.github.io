Radiation and chemotherapy are effective in improving survival in higher-stage Wilms tumor patients, but they may also be responsible for an increased risk of secondary malignancies years later.

It is well established that radiation therapy will increase the risk for bone, breast, colon, and thyroid cancers later on in life.  It will also increase the risk of osteoporosis.

Chemotherapy with dactinomycin, doxorubicin, and vincristine contributes to a higher risk of secondary malignancies as well as specific toxicities such as hearing (carboplatin), cardiac function (adriamycin), and peripheral neuropathy (vincristine).

About 5% to 10% of Wilms patients will present with Von Willebrand's disease, which can complicate treatment.  Initial therapy for this should be DDAVP. If not successful, cryoprecipitate (concentrated Von Willebrand Factor) can be used.
