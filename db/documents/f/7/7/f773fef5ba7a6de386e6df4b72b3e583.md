The prognosis of ovarian cancer is directly dependent on the disease stage at the time of diagnosis. It is also significantly associated with baseline performance status, FIGO stage, and volume of residual disease post-primary cytoreductive surgery. The median survival of ovarian cancer is approximately around 40% to 50% at 10 years, with stage-related survival for stage I between 70% to 92% compared to stage IV being less than 6%.

In women with a disease that spread to adjacent tissues, 5-year survival rates drop down to 80% and 25% for the ones with metastatic disease.

Most of these patients with ovarian cancer develop malignant bowel obstruction in the late-stage, which is quite difficult to manage. Palliative symptom management is the mainstay in such patients. Debulking surgery is the strongest predictor of prognosis, where the volume of residual disease post-surgery is directly correlated to overall survival and PFS.
