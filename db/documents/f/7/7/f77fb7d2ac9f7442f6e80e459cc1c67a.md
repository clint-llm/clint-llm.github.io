In the normal variant of human anatomy, the subclavian vein occurs bilaterally and is a continuation of the axillary vein (a continuation of the brachial vein) from either upper extremity. At the lateral border of the first rib, the axillary vein becomes the subclavian vein where it passes over the rib in the groove of the subclavian vein. Just posterior to the subclavian vein in this area is the axillary artery which becomes the subclavian artery at the lateral border of the first rib and lies in the groove of the subclavian artery. The subclavian vein continues beneath the clavicle heading towards the sternal notch until at the medial border of the anterior scalene muscle it joins the internal jugular vein and becomes the brachiocephalic vein, also called the innominate vein. Also important to note is the pleural apex of the lung which lies inferior to the medial aspect of the subclavian vein. The left side pleural apex often projects more superiorly than the right leading to an increased risk of pneumothorax with left-sided access. The thoracic duct also terminates at the junction of the left subclavian vein and internal jugular vein. This is importantly related to subclavian venous access because it represents another area of potential injury. A potential advantage of left-sided access is the easier sweeping curve of the left innominate vein that leads to the superior vena cava located in the right mediastinum.
