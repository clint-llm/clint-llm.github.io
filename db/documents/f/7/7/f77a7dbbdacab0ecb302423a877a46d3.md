Treatment will depend on the etiology of monoarticular arthritis. Empiric antibiotics are necessary for septic arthritis based on likely etiology, which will later be tailored based on synovial fluid cultures. Provide analgesia for gout and pseudogout within 24 hours of symptom onset for best results.Â Corticosteroids, non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and colchicine are equally effective in treating acute flares of gout and pseudogout with NSAIDs being the first line treatment.

Colchicine is another treatment option but does not provide analgesia and is less effective if given beyond 72 to 96 hours after symptoms begin. It should be used with caution in patients with hepatic or renal impairment, and side effects include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
