The laboratory's reference range for transferrin is 204-360 mg/dL. Transferrin can be used to assess the iron level in the body along with other markers in the body. Transferrin level testing is used to determine the cause of anemia, examine iron metabolism and determine the iron-carrying capacity of the blood. Transferrin saturation levels cannot be interpreted alone. They are used in conjunction with other laboratory tests, such as serum ferritin and TIBC. Ferritin is the first marker to become low, therefore, more sensitive than transferrin in diagnosing Iron deficiency anemia
