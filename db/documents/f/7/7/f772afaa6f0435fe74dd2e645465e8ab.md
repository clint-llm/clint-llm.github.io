The prognosis for compartment syndrome depends on the etiology, diagnosis, and time from injury to intervention. If acute compartment syndrome is treated with fasciotomy within 6 hours, complete recovery of limb function is anticipated. After 6 hours of ischemia, necrosis occurs, and thus, 6 hours is the accepted upper limit of tissue viability. Fasciotomies of the anterior compartment tend to do better than those of the posterior compartment.

Late diagnosis of compartment syndrome leads to irreversible necrosis and subsequently permanent muscle and nerve damage. Patients may develop chronic pain and in the anterior compartment, deep peroneal nerve palsy, and foot drop. Volkmannâ€™s contracture occurs with myonecrosis and the formation of new fibrous tissue leading to myotendinous adhesions. This results in a residual deformity and loss of function and can occur in up to 10% of patients with compartment syndrome. Calcific myonecrosis can occur.

In chronic exertional compartment syndrome, fasciotomy is associated with high levels of pain relief and patient satisfaction with successful outcomes reported between 80% and 100%.
