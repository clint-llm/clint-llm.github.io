Peritonsillar abscess is usually managed by a team of healthcare professionals which include an ENT surgeon, primary care physician, emergency department physician, nurse, and pharmacist. Following treatment, followup is necessary to ensure recovery and the ability to consume an oral diet. The peritonsillar area must be examined at the clinic visit to ensure that there is no more abscess or reaccumulation of an abscess. In addition, the head and neck should be examined to ensure that the cervical adenopathy is resolving. Any patient with signs of recurrence should be referred back to the ENT surgeon for a formal tonsillectomy.

**Outcomes**

The majority of patients with peritonsillar abscess who undergo prompt drainage and are treated with antibiotics recover within 4-7 days. About 1-5% of patients may develop a recurrent abscess and require a formal tonsillectomy. The risk of recurrence is highest in young people who have experienced five or more episodes of tonsillitis. After treatment, there is usually no residual sequelae. Complications like bleeding have been reported in less than 0.1% of patients.
