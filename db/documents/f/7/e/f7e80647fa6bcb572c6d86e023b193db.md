It is essential to look at the recommended weight bearing status for the injury. Patients treated non operatively, in an external fixator, or with comminuted fracture patterns will often have weight-bearing limitations while more simple fracture patterns fixed with intramedullary fixation can be weight bearing as tolerated. Physical and occupational therapy should work with patients to help with recovery.

Patients that are treated non operatively in a cast should be followed closely in the office to monitor for loss of reduction. If loss of reduction presents during follow-up, modifications of the cast may be necessary, or the fracture can undergo reduction under anesthesia.
