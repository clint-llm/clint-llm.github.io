Symptoms may arise from either compression and dysfunction of the neural elements or from local tumor effects causing ischemic and metabolic disorganization within the neurons. Tumors may lead to a combination of upper and lower motor neuron findings and bowel/bladder incontinence.  Back pain is the most common complaint. This can be mechanical pain related to a pathologic fracture or instability or biological primary pain related to local tumor factors on the nerve roots or secondary to involvement of the lumbar vertebrae. Intradural tumors may compress the cauda equina causing radiculopathy or potentially grow large enough to compress the conus medullaris thus leading to myelopathy. The lesion may compress the vasculature and possibly causing venous hypertension or arterial ischemia thus leading to spinal cord edema and neuronal dysfunction. Intrinsic lesions of the conus medullaris cause compression of the spinal cord as they grow. Conus medullaris metastases release local tumor factors that cause spinal cord edema and metabolic disarray.
