Prolonged and severe deficiency of zinc can lead to many complications, such as:

- Growth failure - Untreated zinc deficiency is often linked with permanently stunted growth and development.

- Hypogonadism

- Recurrent infections - Zinc deficiency can aggravate both acute and chronic infections and these infections, in turn, can exacerbate zinc deficiency themselves. It is established to give zinc in diarrhoeal illness; however, there is limited but growing evidence of its role in other infections, such as malaria and pneumonia.

- Diarrhea

- Skin manifestations - Skin conditions associated with zinc deficiency include acrodermatitis enteropathica, cheilitis, and dermatitis.

- Zinc deficiency is also considered a risk factor for diabetes mellitus and obesity. However, the causative role of zinc deficiency in these endocrine disorders is still a subject of early research.

- Delayed wound healing

- Low bone mineral density - The effect of the deficiency of zinc on bone density is not well understood. There is limited evidence adding calcium to zinc supplementation is more beneficial than giving calcium alone.
