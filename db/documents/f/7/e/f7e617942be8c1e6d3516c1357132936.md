Nerve ablation is a minimally invasive, relatively low-risk procedure. There is a limited side effect profile to ablative nerve blocks.

Complications are most common after intracranial ablation of the trigeminal ganglion, which may manifest as facial numbness, dysesthesia, anesthesia dolorosa, corneal anesthesia, keratitis, and trigeminal motor dysfunction.

Adverse events from ablation of lumbar medial branches are far and few between, with transient postoperative pain dominating as the premier adverse event.

As with any invasive technique, the risk of allergy to materials or anesthetic, hematoma formation, and infection must be considered.
