Nuclear medicine procedures are generally considered safe. The most common risk factors include an allergic reaction to the radiotracer or an injection site reaction.

Complications could include

- Incomplete administration of the radiotracer. Either from not injecting, eating, or inhaling enough of the radiotracer.

- Diabetic hyperglycemia over 250 mg/dL. This can cause incomplete results for studies requiring ingestion of the radiotracer.

- Glove phenomenon- Contrast for a bone-imaging agent, is injected into the radial artery, and the bones take up more radiotracer in the palm and thumb due to blood flow.

- Urinary tract infection after performing a retrograde radionuclide cystography.

Side effects of nuclear medicine studies include

- An allergic reaction to the food when eating a meal containing the radiotracer, such as egg whites.

- It is rare to have an adverse reaction to radiotracers. If a reaction does occur, it is most commonly a mild rash. A study found that an adverse reaction to radiotracers during 783,525 administrations only occurred in 0.0023% of participants.
