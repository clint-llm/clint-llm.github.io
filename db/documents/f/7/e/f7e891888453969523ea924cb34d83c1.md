There are limited studies on pediculosis and further epidemiological research is needed. This is especially true in world regions with significant poverty and low health standards.Pediculus humanus capitis affects 6 to 12 million people in the United States every year, but exact numbers are unknown as it is not a reportable disease. Outbreaks of head lice more commonly affect children 3 to 12 years old, with girls being affected more commonly than boys.
