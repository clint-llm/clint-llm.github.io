In certain conditions and contexts, PSA is not appropriate.

- Operator skillset (training). If the person performing the sedation lacks the skillset to secure an unstable airway, from intubation to cricothyrotomy, PSA is not an option.

- Appropriate monitoring and resuscitation equipment are not available.

- Patient needs. If the patient requires any more than a brief painful procedure (e.g., surgery,) general anesthesia in an operating theater may be more appropriate.

- Patient conditions. Patients with a high ASA risk score may be safer with the services of a qualified anesthetist. In particular, PSA is contraindicated in patients with an ASA classification of unstable class II or class IV and above (unless requiring immediate intervention such as for ventricular tachycardia conversion).

- Patient allergies or hypersensitivity to medications used for PSA purposes

- High risk of aspiration (e.g., acute alcohol intoxication). Note: concerning fasting times before procedural sedation, it is possible to refer to guidelines used for general anesthesia that recommend the timing of 2 hours for clear fluids (these liquids must not include alcohol) and 6 hours for everything else. Infants may ingest breast milk for up to 4 hours before the procedure. Additional fasting time (8 or more hours) may be necessary in cases of patient intake of fried foods, fatty foods, or meat.
