Conventional X-ray production involves the excitation of tungsten metal to release photons.

Alternatively, photons can be completely absorbed into the tissue.

X-ray image production procedures focus on optimizing settings to produce the appropriate contrast among the anatomy of interest while limiting noise and artifacts that may detract from the evaluation of the image.
