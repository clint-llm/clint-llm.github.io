At the cellular level, Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is produced in the peripheral tissues as a byproduct of aerobic glycolysis to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which serves as energy for the cells. The CO2 is then transported to the lungs via the blood both bound to red blood cells as bicarbonate (HCO3-) and as a dissolved gas. Once the venous blood reaches the lungs, HCO3- is then converted back to CO2 by carbonic anhydrase (CO2 + H2O <--> H2CO3 <--> H+ + HCO3-) in the alveolar capillaries to be excreted by the lungs. When CO2 levels are high, the equation shifts to the right causing an increase in hydrogen ions (H+) which translates to a decreased blood pH. When blood pH falls, this drives both peripheral and central chemoreceptors to increase respiratory drive through bronchodilation and hypoxic vasoconstriction to increase CO2 clearance and improve ventilation and perfusion (V/Q) matching. Peripheral chemoreceptors, located within the carotid and aortic bodies, are able to act immediately within seconds of CO2 rise and central chemoreceptors are able to act within minutes. As CO2 clearance occurs, the equation shifts again to the right, therefore, decreasing H+ and again restoring homeostasis.
