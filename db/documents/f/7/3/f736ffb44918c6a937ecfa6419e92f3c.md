Glucagon plays a role in hepatic glucose production after blocking endogenous insulin production.

Acinar cells of the pancreas are responsible for the exocrine function.

The incretin hormone GLP-1 also inhibits glucagon secretion. Gluconeogenic amino acids such as alanine stimulate glucagon secretion. Although it remains unknown whether glucagon feedback to alpha cells is in an autocrine manner, according to recent studies, alpha cells do not express glucagon receptor (GCGR), and it may thus regulate its own secretion by activating insulin.
