On presentation, consideration must be given to almost all acute cardiothoracic emergencies for differential diagnosis of IHE, but the classic clinical differential diagnosis includes Mallory Weiss (mucosal tear) and Boerhaave syndrome (transmural perforation) as IHE is an intermediate stage of these two conditions. History usually includes preceding severe vomiting in Mallory Weiss and Boerhaave syndrome; however not a reliable factor to exclude two conditions. A chest x-ray may show pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, and pleural effusion in case of later. Acute retrosternal chest pain is a common symptom in acute myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism and should be ruled out with careful history, physical examination, and appropriate diagnostic tests as these conditions are more common compared to IHE. The presence of hematemesis and dysphagia or odynophagia in IHE can be useful in differentiating from other critical diseases in conjunction with other diagnostic modalities.
