The prognosis of tuberculosis is better if the disease can diagnose and promptly treat with the antimicrobials. Leprosy can also be a curable disease, but it depends on the stage of this disease and patient compliance with multidrug therapy (MDT). Some skin lesions may persist after treatment. Schistosomiasis is associated with high morbidity both as acute and chronic illness. The prognosis of sarcoidosis is guarded, and the overall death rate is less than 7%. Some patients may require treatment if a complication such as pneumonia and nephropathy develops. Crohn disease has a reserved prognosis; it cannot be cured.
