The workup considered should include the following:

- Dextromethorphan level - not available at many hospitals

- Fingerstick blood glucose - helpful in all patients with altered mental status

- Complete blood count â€“ leukocytosis can be seen

- Basic metabolic panel- identify electrolyte abnormalities, evaluation of kidney function as dextromethorphan predominantly undergoes renal excretion.

- Liver function tests - acetaminophen can be toxic to the liver and is often combined with dextromethorphan in many medications.

- Creatine kinase - evaluation for rhabdomyolysis

- Acetaminophen level - acetaminophen is often combined with dextromethorphan in many medications.

- Salicylate level - helpful in evaluating patients with acid-base disturbances, altered mental status

- Ethanol level is useful in evaluating patients with altered mental status and is often a coingestant with dextromethorphan toxicity.

- EKG - evaluation tachycardia

- Imaging studies - should be performed when there is a concern for trauma or aspiration secondary to dextromethorphan toxicity.

- Urine drug screen- can be helpful to identify potential substance coingestion
