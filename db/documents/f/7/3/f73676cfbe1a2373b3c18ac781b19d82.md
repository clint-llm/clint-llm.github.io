Diagnosis of lens-induced uveitis is primarily clinical. A hypermature cataract may leak proteins through an intact lens capsule. This leads to lens proteins inciting an inflammatory response causing phacogenic uveitis and secondary glaucoma. In traumatic cataracts after a penetrating injury, the anterior and sometimes even the posterior capsule may be compromised, leading to exposure of cortical material, which may incite an inflammatory response. After cataract surgery, retained lens material (nucleus fragments or cortex) can cause inflammation for days, months, or even years after surgery.

It is important to elicit a proper history, do a thorough slit lamp evaluation, measure intraocular pressure, perform a gonioscopy and do an ultrasound B scan to obtain the correct diagnosis. Management involves controlling the inflammation with topical and, if necessary, systemic steroids, control of IOP and cataract surgery, or removal of retained lens material. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment can save the eye and restore vision. During the height of the COVID pandemic, many patients had delayed seeking medical help and care. Cataract surgery is an elective procedure and has been postponed by many patients leading to an increase in the maturity of the lens and an increased incidence of lens-induced inflammations.
