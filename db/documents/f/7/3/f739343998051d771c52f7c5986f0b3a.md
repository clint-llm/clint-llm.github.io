There are two main causes responsible for Rh Hemolytic disease. The first is the exposure of an Rh-negative pregnant mother to Rh-positive fetal erythrocytes due to fetomaternal hemorrhage during pregnancy secondary to normal delivery, spontaneous or induced abortion, ectopic pregnancy, placenta previa, lack of prenatal care, invasive obstetric procedures (cordocentesis, chorionic villous sampling, amniocentesis), external cephalic version, c-section or trauma.

After the sensitization of the mother due to the formation of anti-D IgG immunoglobulins, future pregnancies are at risk for the development of the hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) due to Rh incompatibility if the fetus is Rh-positive.
