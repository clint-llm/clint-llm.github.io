The human tongue is an organ that aids the process of digestion by facilitating the manipulation and movement of food particles during mastication and swallowing. The tongue is also vital in the production of speech and essential for employing the sense of taste.

The styloglossus muscle is a paired extrinsic muscle of the tongue. It coordinates with the other extrinsic muscles of the tongue, including the hyoglossus muscle, the genioglossus muscle, and the palatoglossus muscle, to produce the various movements of the tongue. The styloglossus muscle causes the lateral margins of the tongue to curve upwards, forming a furrow to permit swallowing following mastication of food particles. The paired styloglossus muscles also act to retract and elevate the tongue in a posterior and superior direction.
