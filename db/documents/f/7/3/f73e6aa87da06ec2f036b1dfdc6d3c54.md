As mentioned earlier, Loeffler endocarditis is a rare manifestation of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), which is divided into idiopathic, primary, and secondary types based on the underlying etiology. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is a rare entity with no obvious cause of elevated eosinophil count and is the most common cause of Loeffler endocarditis.
