The low flow LVD (2.5 L/min)  is a 12Fr pump mounted on a 9Fr catheter shaft and advanced via femoral artery access and positioned across the aortic valve into the LV under fluoroscopic guidance. The high flow LVD  (5.0 L/min) also mounts on the same 9Fr catheter shaft, and the pump is 21Fr in diameter. Due to its size, the high flow LVD requires a surgical cutdown via the axillary or femoral artery.

The 9Fr catheter includes the purge and the pressure lumens, and the proximal end of the 9Fr catheter consists of a hub for console cable attachment and side arms for purge solution and pressure monitoring tubing.

The console allows the pump speed management (9 levels of performance) and displays the pressure difference between the inflow and the outflow.

Intravenous heparin is recommended during the device deployment to achieve activated clotting time between 250 to 500 seconds and activated clotting time between 160 to 180 seconds after the placement to prevent clots formation.
