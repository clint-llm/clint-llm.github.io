The nasal bones are the most commonly fractured in the human body. In most uncomplicated cases, closed reduction under local and topical anesthesia or general anesthesia will produce a satisfactory return to pre-traumatic nasal function and appearance. Timing is a critical consideration when addressing these fractures due to the tendency of the bone fragments to fixate in their posttraumatic locations if left in place for more than 10 to 14 days and because of the difficulty associated with closed reduction in the edematous nose if attempted before 3-5 days have passed since the injury. Open septorhinoplasty may be required to alleviate a persistent nasal deformity or nasal obstruction in the event of a failure of closed reduction.
