Once an abdominal aortic aneurysm is diagnosed, the patient should be referred to a vascular surgeon. Surveillance imaging at 12-month intervals is recommended for patients with an AAA of 4.0 to 4.9 cm in diameter.

To ensure that the patient is fit for surgery, cardiology and pulmonology, as indicated, are recommended.
