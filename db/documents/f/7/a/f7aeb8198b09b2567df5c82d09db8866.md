Fluoropolymers, also called fluorocarbons or perfluorocarbons, can be found in a variety of household and commercial products.  They are most commonly encountered as components of waterproofing agents. Other uses include lubricants, sealants, and leather conditioners. Fluoropolymers are defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as molecules consisting solely of carbon and fluorine. However, compounds that contain molecules other than carbon and fluorine (described as fluorocarbon derivatives) are often referred to as fluoropolymers as well.
