The metabolism of dietary fructose to yield energy is known as fructolysis. The process of fructolysis utilizes most of the same enzymes and metabolic intermediates as the glycolysis pathway. However, in contrast to glucose, which metabolizes directly throughout the body, fructose metabolizes predominantly in the liver. It directs toward the replenishment of liver glycogen and the synthesis of triglycerides.

As a result, fructose metabolism produces the same ATP as glucose. However, that fructose enters glycolysis without going through the energy investment step; as a result, it yields one extra ATP. There are two pathways to metabolize fructose. The hexokinase in muscle and adipose tissue phosphorylates fructose, which then enters glycolysis.
