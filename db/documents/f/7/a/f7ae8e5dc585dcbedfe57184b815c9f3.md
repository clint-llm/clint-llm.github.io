With the recognition of potential etiologies come diagnostic criteria for CHS.

- Criteria fulfilled for at minimum three months, with symptomatic onset occurring at least six months before diagnosis

- Stereotypical episodic vomiting resembling cyclical vomiting syndrome in onset, duration, and frequency

- Presentation after prolonged, excessive cannabis use

- Relief of vomiting by a sustained cessation of cannabis use

- May be associated with “pathologic” bathing behavior, e.g., prolonged hot baths and showers.

While diagnostic criteria can be helpful to tease out similar appearing disease processes, the Rome IV criteria suffer from a lack of data granularity, especially in terms of the specifics regarding number of vomiting episodes, amount of cannabis use, number of pathologic bathing episodes per day for however much time, period of time of sustained cessation of cannabis.

An intriguing point to keep in mind is that the Rome IV criteria include the phrase "resembling cyclical vomiting syndrome." In that regard, it is important to distinguish between the two. Per the Nelson Textbook of Pediatrics, cyclic vomiting syndrome is defined by having sudden onset episodes of vomiting, having at least four bouts of vomiting per hour, and often having 12 to 15 episodes of vomiting per day. These episodes of vomiting are often separated by weeks or months, and there is a return to baseline between episodes. Importantly, for the definition of cyclic vomiting syndrome, these episodes of vomiting cannot be attributed to other disorders. This factor is a key distinguishing feature from cannabis hyperemesis syndrome, where the toxicokinetics of cannabis itself influence the course of the disease.

Regardless, specific recommended historical points to keep in mind include demographics and associated risk factors (age, gender, medical and surgical history), the onset, frequency, and progression of the patient’s vomiting, as well as any associated symptoms (notably headaches), the use of hot showers or baths, the duration of vomiting-free intervals, medication as well as illicit drug use, prior treatments and efficacies, periods of abstinence from various medications and illicit drugs, ability to follow up with a primary care provider, and any comorbidities, especially anxiety, depression, panic disorder, and migraine headaches.
