Dermatosis papulosa nigra (DPN) is a benign epidermal growth that presents as hyperpigmented or skin-colored papules that develop on the face and neck beginning in adolescence. It typically occurs in individuals with Fitzpatrick skin types III to VI, most commonly affecting people of African and Asian descent. It is considered to be a common variant of seborrheic keratoses (SKs). It was first described in 1925 by Dr. Aldo Castellani based on his observations while visiting Jamaica and Central America.
