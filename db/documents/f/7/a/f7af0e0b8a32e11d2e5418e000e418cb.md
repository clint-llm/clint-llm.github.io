The HPV virus is transmitted through skin to skin contact, most commonly through sexual contact. Nonsexual transfer can occur with fomites, but the transmission typically is seen with genital contact and sexual activity. Multiple sexual partners or a partner who has multiple sexual partners significantly increases the risk of exposure. Exposure at a young age also increases the risk of persistent HPV. This is based on the observation that HPV infection is most common in young women 18-30 years old, with prevalence sharply declining after age 30. The greatest metaplastic activity of the cervix is during puberty and the first pregnancy; HPV needs to infect these areas to have the DNA incorporated into the cell. The median age of HPV-associated cervical cancer diagnosis is 49. This implies an earlier age of exposure because it has a slow growing dysplastic process, which leads to cancer in approximately 10-30 years.
