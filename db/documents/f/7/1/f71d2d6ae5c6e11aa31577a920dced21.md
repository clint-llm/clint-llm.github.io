Parotitis is caused by duct obstruction (such as sialolithiasis), infectious organisms (viruses or bacteria), or inflammatory conditions (such as Sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and sarcoidosis). Parotitis can result in pain and discomfort, glandular enlargement and swelling, dry mouth, and sometimes fever. Predisposing factors include dehydration, malnutrition, immunosuppression, sialolithiasis, oral neoplasms, and medications, causing decreased salivation. This activity discusses parotitis, its etiology, diagnosis, and management, and it also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with parotitis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of parotitis.
- Outline the steps in the evaluation of patients with parotitis.
- Review the management options available for parotitis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination in case of chronic parotitis.
