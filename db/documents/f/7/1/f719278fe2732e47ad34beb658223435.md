Comprising the larynx are both intrinsic and extrinsic muscles that play a part in the manipulation of air movement, swallowing, and the production of voice. These muscles participate in the orchestrated control of vocal cord abduction, adduction, and lengthening. The four paired, and one unpaired intrinsic muscles are those which are localized to the larynx while extrinsic muscles involve those which attach to both the larynx and other proximity structures. These intrinsic muscles of the larynx include the paired thyroarytenoid, lateral cricoarytenoid, posterior cricoarytenoid, and cricothyroid muscles and the unpaired interarytenoid muscle — all the intrinsic muscles except the posterior cricoarytenoid act to adduct the vocal folds. The action of abduction is a result of posterior cricoarytenoid activation. The cricothyroid muscle is unique in that it elongates the vocal cords as well, which creates tension on the vocal cords and assists in high pitch phonation. The extrinsic muscles of the larynx such as the thyrohyoid (which raises the thyroid cartilage) and the sternothyroid muscle (which lowers the thyroid cartilage) function to manipulate the position of the larynx during swallowing or pitch control during phonation.
