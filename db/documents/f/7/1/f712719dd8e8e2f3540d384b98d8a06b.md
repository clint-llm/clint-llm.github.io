An annular fissure or tear is a deficiency of one or more layers of the annulus fibrosus. Most annular fissures are asymptomatic, but some may be painful. Chronic pain due to annular fissures can be due to granulation tissue or in-growth of nerve endings near the dorsal root ganglion, and/or due to disc herniation of the nucleus pulposus. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of this condition, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in providing care to patients affected by annular disc tears, and improving long term outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology, pathophysiology, and complications of annular disc tears.
- Outline the evaluation in patients with annular disc tears.
- Explain the conservative and interventional treatment strategies in patients with annular disc tears.
- Employ a well-organized interprofessional team approach to provide early and effective care to patients with annular disc tears.
