Differential diagnosis of follicular thyroid carcinoma includes a follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma, papillary thyroid carcinoma, noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features or NIFTP,Â and follicular adenoma.

NIFTP is one of the newest categories added to the pathology description of thyroid cancer cases. It is now considered benign, so it is recommended to be treated as such.
