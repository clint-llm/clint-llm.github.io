**IT Chemotherapy**

IT chemotherapy has shown a survival benefit in retrospective studies. The agent used commonly includes methotrexate (MTX), cytarabine, thiotepa, and sustained release liposomal cytarabine. Studies have shown superior efficacy of sustained-release cytarabine compared to MTX.

Aseptic/chemical meningitis is a common complication that is manageable with steroids. Infectious meningitis (commonly implicated organism is Staphylococcus epidermidis), seizure, myelosuppression, and leukoencephalopathy are some other complications encountered.

**Systemic Chemotherapy**

Numerous studies have shown that systemic chemotherapy has improved survival. It bypasses the administration issues of IT chemotherapy, treats the primary tumor, and also is effective in treating nodular type LC. BBB is disrupted in LC; hence systemic chemotherapy has been demonstrated to achieve therapeutic levels in CSF. Agents used include high-dose MTX, high-dose cytarabine, capecitabine (particularly for breast cancer), thiotepa, and temozolomide. There seems to be some promise in using etoposide in small cell lung cancer.

**Targeted Therapy**

Bevacizumab (VGEF inhibitor) and dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) have been reported to demonstrate a response in LC from melanoma. IT trastuzumab in LC from HER-2 positive breast cancer also has shown some promise and a favorable adverse effect profile. There are several ongoing phase II trials on the subject. EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has shown a response to erlotinib and gefitinib, but at higher doses, as they do not cross the BBB easily. There are ongoing trials of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in LC from EGFR-mutant NSCLC that have shown promising results in terms of extended survival. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors are another class of drugs shown to be effective in LC from NSCLC with ALK rearrangements in ongoing trials.

**Novel Therapeutics**

Immunotherapy is another novel treatment approach to LC. Agents like nivolumab, ipilimumab, and pembrolizumab have been studied and have shown some positive results. Intrathecal Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and intrathecal tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) therapies also have been studied, but the data on these therapies is scant so far, and further trials are needed before these regimens can be considered in routine treatment.
