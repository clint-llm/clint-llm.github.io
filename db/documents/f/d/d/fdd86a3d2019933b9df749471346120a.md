Miliary tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The human host serves as a natural reservoir. M. bovis, M. africanum, and M. microti, together with M. tuberculosis, are known as the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Other mycobacteria organisms are classified as non-tuberculous or atypical mycobacterial organisms. M. tuberculosis is a non-spore forming, non-motile, obligate-aerobic, facultative, catalase-negative, intracellular bacteria. It is gram stain neutral and stained by Ziehl-Neelsen stain. The presence of mycolic acids in the cell wall imparts acid fastness when decolorized with acid-alcohol and are thus known as alcohol and acid-fast bacillus (AAFB).
