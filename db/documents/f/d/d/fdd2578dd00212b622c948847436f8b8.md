As the United States faces two decades of continuous war, media and individuals with personal military connections have elevated public and professional concerns for the mental health of veterans and service members. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of mental health disorders affecting military service members and veterans, focusing on screening for military service and risk factors unique to these populations. Several of the most salient disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, suicidality, and substance use, are explored. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology and diagnostic features of PTSD.
- Review the effective therapies of depression in the military community.
- Identify risk and protective factors for suicide in military and veteran populations.
- Summarize management options by the interprofessional team for substance use disorders (SUDs) in military members and veterans.
