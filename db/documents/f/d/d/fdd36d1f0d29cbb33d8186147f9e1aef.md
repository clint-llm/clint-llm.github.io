Around 25% of the world's crop is affected by mycotoxin, most of which is aflatoxin. They are regularly found in improperly stored cassava, cottonseed, chili pepper, maize, wheat, millet, peanut, rice, sesame, sunflower seed, and many spices. Crops can be contaminated in two phases:

- Aspergillus species infect crops during growth and development.

- Contamination can build during storage or transport with exposure to warm and humid conditions or severe drought.

Animals fed on contaminated feed can pass aflatoxin metabolism products into eggs, milk products, and meat, and thus humans can be exposed.

Structural derivatives of difurocoumarin and aflatoxins are commonly produced by strains of A. flavus, A. parasiticus, and A. minus. Furthermore, many other Aspergilli, such as Emericella teleomorphs, have aflatoxigenic capabilities. Named according to their green or blue color under UV light, there are four primary aflatoxins. Of these, AFB is the most mutagenic, the most hepatotoxic, and the most prevalent worldwide.

The following is a concise list of all the risk factors that can lead to aflatoxin exposure in humans and livestock:

- Contaminated feed (corn, cottonseed, peanuts, sorghum, figs, tree nuts, and spices)

- Stress from drought or insect damage

- Warm and humid conditions

- Temperatures near 30 C (86 F)

- Substrate, CO levels, time, and other environmental factors
