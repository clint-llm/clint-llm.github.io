Heparin administration can be by intravenous (IV) route or subcutaneous SQ) route. Intravenous heparin is continuously administered for therapeutic anticoagulation, while intermittent subcutaneous administration is used to prevent thromboembolism. Intermittent IV administration is also an option. For example, heparin is given intermittently by the interventional cardiologist in the cardiac catheterization lab, dependent upon laboratory markers throughout the case. When administered SQ, the onset of action is usually within 1 to 2 hours compared to an immediate anticoagulant effect with IV administration of heparin. There was an assessment of intramuscular (IM) injection, but researchers observed an increased level of pain, irritation, and hematoma formation with IM injections of heparin.
