Ewing sarcoma is associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. Patients treated with current therapy are likely to develop severe neutropenia, and it may be complicated by recurrent fever, opportunistic infections, and mucositis, despite the administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Potential adverse events of radiotherapy and chemotherapy include an increased risk of a second malignant neoplasm. The cumulative incidence of the second neoplasm in cancer survivors of large series was less than 2% that usually occurs within three years of initial diagnosis.

Anthracyclines, including doxorubicin, are well known to cause cumulative-dose-related cardiotoxicity. Treatment with doxorubicin can be complicated by cardiomyopathy in a dose-dependent manner and it can manifest many years after the treatment. Prolonged infusion or dexrazoxane can be administered before doxorubicin to decrease the risk of cardiotoxicity.

Radiation-induced secondary malignant neoplasms, particularly osteosarcomas, have also been observed, especially at high doses. These second malignancies can occur more than 15 years after the diagnosis. Patients treated with radiation therapy should be carefully evaluated for the presence of sarcoma within the radiation field if symptoms occur. Second malignancies after Ewing tumor treatment were seen in 690 patients from a cooperative German, Austrian, and Dutch study.
