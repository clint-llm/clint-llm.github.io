Due to its multiple connections including its significant role in draining the cerebral hemispheres as well as receiving blood from the diploic, meningeal and emissary veins from the scalp, there are multiple complications and pathological processes that can affect the superior sagittal sinus. This section will briefly discuss some of the more common pathologies affecting the sinus. First and foremost, the superior sagittal sinus is prone to thrombosis, presenting with various features from headaches, hemiparesis, sixth nerve palsy, papilledema, nausea, and seizures. It has to merit consideration in the context of a cryptogenic stroke in a young woman on birth control pills due to the hypercoagulable state. Additional risk factors for superior sagittal sinus thrombosis include pregnancy, previous venous thrombosis, malignancy, Bechet disease, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, and protein C and protein S deficiency. Septic thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus is rare and most frequently accompanies bacterial meningitis or paranasal nasal sinus infection.

Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis is of extreme clinical importance due to the irreversible consequences that can occur secondary to the increased intracranial pressure that is associated with dural vein occlusion. Due to its major role in CSF circulation, obstruction of the vein often leads to dysregulation of the normal CSF drainage pathway, potentially causing increased intracranial pressures. Another mechanism of increased intracranial pressure in these instances is due to the edema produced after venous occlusion.

In addition to direct thrombosis of the vessel, the superior sagittal sinus is often implicated in the development of meningiomas due to its intimate proximity to the falx cerebri. When surgical intervention is necessary for these situations, the clinician must account for a tumor that may involve the superior sagittal sinus as this often time complicates gross resection resulting in suboptimal tumor resection with increased rates of recurrence. When intracranial pressure increases, there is increased reverse flow of venous blood through the emissary and diploic veins of the scalp and cranium, leading to increased rates of scalp, skull, and intracranial hemorrhage during craniotomies. In addition to being aware of the increased rate of hemorrhage, the surgeons must also know the location of the superior sagittal sinus relative to the sagittal suture and take extreme caution to avoid injuring the sinus while creating burr holes.

Dural arteriovenous (AV) fistulas involving the superior sagittal sinus are rare but are associated with life-threatening venous hypertension and intracranial hemorrhage. Dural AV fistulas are aberrant, abnormal connections between the dural arteries and veins leading to a high-pressure intracranial vascular system prone to hemorrhage. A variety of techniques exist for managing this condition such as embolization or open total resection; however, these have correlations with a significant risk of hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, or further damage to normal surrounding vasculature.

The superior sagittal sinus is a vital structure that is involved in a variety of potentially life-threatening conditions. Proper diagnosis requires familiarity with its anatomy (including anatomic variants) and a high index of clinical suspicion regarding its protean clinical presentations. The involvement of the superior sagittal sinus should be considered in presentations as varied as papilledema, cryptogenic stroke, seizures, or change in mental status. Firm diagnosis ultimately rests upon neuroradiologic evaluation with CT venography CTV, magnetic resonance venographyMRV, and conventional catheter angiography being the modalities of choice.

Intracranial sinus evaluation with CTV or MRV are particularly essential modalities in the evaluation of headaches, frequently occurring in obese females, associated with visual obscurations, pulsatile tinnitus, and the potential permanent blindness due to idiopathic intracranial hypertension IIH(pseudotumor cerebri). Venous sinus thrombosis is identified frequently in cases of IIH. The reality is that beyond the specialties of ophthalmology or neuro-ophthalmology, the current level of physical diagnostic skills evaluating the optic fundus with direct ophthalmoscopy are almost universally inadequate. The diagnosis of papilledema is frequently delayed with the disastrous consequences of permanent visual loss.

Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) is an important cause of stroke particularly in young adults (two-thirds of which are young females) caused by complete or partial occlusion most frequently involving the superior sagittal sinus but the other venous sinuses as well. Risk factors include pregnancy, estrogen replacement therapy, malignancy, dehydration, prothrombotic conditions including antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, prothrombin gene mutation, factor V Leiden mutation, protein S/C deficiency, infections involving the ears, mouth, and paranasal sinuses. Although a rare cause of all strokes (1-2%), CVT thrombosis with brain infarction is often delayed or missed entirely. Symptoms related to superior sagittal sinus thrombosis are multiple including headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, aphasia, hemisensory loss/hemiparesis, and seizures. Diagnosis is facilitated by CTV and MRV in conjunction with standard CT and MR imaging demonstrating areas of infarction uncharacteristic of a particular arterial, distribution and frequently associated with varying degrees of intraparenchymal hemorrhage (figure 3). A high index of suspicion and knowledge of the risk factors, patient demographics, and neuroimaging features facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment.
