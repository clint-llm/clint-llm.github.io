SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) is a much-feared complication of epilepsy. Though several studies have shown that a higher burden of generalized tonic-clonic seizures is a risk factor for SUDEP, it has been reported in a full spectrum of epilepsies, including patients with relatively benign epilepsies.

Childhood absence epilepsy is often thought to have a better prognosis than Juvenile absence epilepsyÂ though this is not entirely supported by data.

Though traditionally, patients with absence epilepsy were considered to have normal cognitive functioning, several recent studies showed weaknesses in various domains such as behavior, emotion, executive functioning, intelligence, attention, and language.
