The toxic effects of MAOIs are observed when their inhibitory effects on monoamine oxidase are compounded by drug-food interactions, overdose or drug-drug interactions. Without MAO to break down epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and tyramine, the storage, and release of these monoamines are increased. Increased adrenergic tone produces findings of tachycardia, hyperthermia, myoclonus, hypertension, and agitation (see below for a more comprehensive list of findings). The time course can range from minutes for a drug-food interaction to several hours in a pure MAOI overdose.
