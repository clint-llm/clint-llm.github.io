Bone mineral density tends to decrease with age following peak bone mass, leading to osteoporotic bone. Osteoporotic bone is of normal quality but decreased in quantity. The cancellous bone has decreased trabecular quantity and thin cortical bone, leading to a decreased load to failure capacity and more prone to fracture.Â Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are the result of axial force overcoming bony integrity. VCFs are defined as a loss of about 20% or at least 4 mm of anterior, middle, or posterior vertebral height.

Compression fractures characteristically involve the anterior column of the spine which is comprised of the anterior two-thirds of the vertebral body, the anterior two-thirds of the intervertebral disc, and the anterior longitudinal ligament. Unlike vertebral burst or Chance fractures, a compression fracture does not compromise the posterior tension band.

Posterior tension band components include:

- Posterior ligamentous complex: Supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, ligamentum flavum

- Musculature: Longissimus, iliocostalis, spinalis, semispinalis, rotatores, intertransversarii, multifidus

- Bone: Transverse and spinous processes, pedicles, facets
