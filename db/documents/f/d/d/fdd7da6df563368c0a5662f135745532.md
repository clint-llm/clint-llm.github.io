Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic, autoimmune, blistering disease that causes an extremely pruritic rash that predominantly affects the extensor surfaces. The characteristic vesicles are often not apparent as they are destroyed by excoriation. The disease is closely associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE); both conditions are characterized by the development of IgA autoantibodies against transglutaminases that, in the case of dermatitis herpetiformis, are deposited in the superficial papillary dermis. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of dermatitis herpetiformis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of dermatitis herpetiformis.
- Review the presentation of dermatitis herpetiformis.
- Summarize the treatment options for dermatitis herpetiformis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by dermatitis herpetiformis.
