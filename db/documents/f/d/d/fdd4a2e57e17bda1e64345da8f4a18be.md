Chloracne is a rare skin disorder but when it presents, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes poison control, a dermatologist, a biohazard expert, and an internist. The source needs to be identified as rapidly as possible to help minimize a public health disaster. Chloracne is the hallmark cutaneous feature and may best be treated by a dermatologist when recalcitrant.Â However, regular physicals and blood work monitoring should be carried out by an internist to identify other possible systemic sequelae.
