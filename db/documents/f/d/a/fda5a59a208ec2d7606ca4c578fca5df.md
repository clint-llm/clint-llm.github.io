MR remains a very common global valvular heart disease with a rising patient population due to a rapid increase in the aging population.

MV surgery is recommended in symptomatic, severe, primary MR without significant impairment of LV function (LVEF>30%)[Level 1] and with impaired LV function as well (LVEF <30%). [Level 2] In asymptomatic, severe primary MR, with normal EF >60% and normal LV cavity size (LVESD <40 mm), MV surgery is recommended [level 2], with preference to MV repair over replacement when the likelihood of successful repair is high (>95%) and expected mortality is low (<1%). [Level 2] Presence of LV cavity dilatation (LVESD >40 mm) or intermediate decline in systolic function (LVEF=30% to 60%) in asymptomatic severe MR is considered class I recommendation for MV surgery.[Level 1] New-onset atrial fibrillation or the development of pulmonary hypertension (PASP>50mmHg) are also indications for MV surgery.[Level 2] In patients with severe symptomatic secondary MR despite optimal treatment of CAD, HF, and CRT, MV repair can be considered for symptomatic improvement. [Level 2] In symptomatic severe MR with prohibitive surgical risk, a transcatheter repair is recommended when MV anatomy is favorable and patients have a reasonable life expectancy otherwise.
