Ensuring that the correct blood is delivered to the right patient requires a team effort and the involvement of clinicians, nurses, and laboratory personnel. Transfusion medicine physicians play a critical role in establishing an efficient transfusion chain in a hospital. However, from the attending physician's decision to transfuse to the bedside administration of blood products, the medical staff involved, including the phlebotomist who collects the sample, the laboratory staff who performs the tests, and the staff who collects and transports the blood products to the transfusion site, which may be a ward or operating room, as well as the nurses who administer and monitor the transfusion, are an indispensable link in the transfusion chain.Transfusion medicine staff work with physicians to implement patient blood management and the rational use of blood products. They oversee blood donation, pre-transfusion testing for compatibility and blood-related antigens and antibodies, and the selection of blood for patients undergoing transplantation. Therapeutically, they handle transfusion reactions, plasmapheresis, exchange transfusions, and peripheral stem cell collections. Transfusion physicians manage and support clinical transfusion therapy, which requires modified blood products such as intrauterine transfusions and exchange blood transfusions. Transfusion laboratories apply key quality assurance systems to provide safe and high-quality blood products. Transfusion medicine is highly complex, with many opportunities for redundancy. Designing transfusion medicine processes with human factors in mind will reduce the possibility of errors. Creating causal trees provides a realistic view of how a system works and facilitates the development of effective and durable solutions. Because of the potential impact of blood administration, transfusion medicine is at the forefront of safety innovation in healthcare. The reduction and elimination of numerous clinical hazards have been demonstrated over many years. Although there is still a heavy reliance on procedural methods for the essentially manual steps that make up the phases of the transfusion chain, recognizing this continuing vulnerability has led to increased attention to the transfusion process itself. An encouraging example of this current phase of transfusion safety improvement is the creation of the new Transfusion Safety Officer role in hospitals to support efforts and progress in monitoring, identifying, and eliminating conditions that may compromise safety. Key Lessons: Safety in transfusion medicine has evolved from an exclusive focus on disease transmission and clinical outcomes to attention to error-prone processes.Â Knowledge of the key steps in pre-transfusion testing and the critical points in the process flow will help strengthen the transfusion chain.
