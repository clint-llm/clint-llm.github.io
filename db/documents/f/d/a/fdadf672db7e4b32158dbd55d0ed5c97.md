Due to its properties as an acid-based compound, the Dakin solution can be corrosive to healthy tissue, especially at higher concentrations. An oil-based ointment such as petroleum jelly can be applied to surrounding healthy tissue to reduce skin irritation and prevent the debridement of viable tissue. Dakin solution also loses its antiseptic properties rapidly after application due to the instability of the compound. Therefore, gauze sponges soaked with Dakin used to pack necrotic wounds need to be frequently changed. It is usually applied once a day to lightly to moderately exudative wounds and twice a day for highly exudative or contaminated wounds.
