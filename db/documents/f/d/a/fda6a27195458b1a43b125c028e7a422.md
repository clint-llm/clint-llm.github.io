Splenic sequestration crises are one of the first serious manifestations of sickle cell anemia and typically occur from age six months to 5 years, after which the spleen has typically undergone autoinfarction. However, a case series of acute sequestration events in adults demonstrated continued risk for those with variant hemoglobinopathies such as HbSC disease and sickle cell beta-thalassemia.

The median age of children with sequestration crises is 1.4 years, with 75% of episodes occurring before age 2.
