The treatment of ciguatera poisoning is supportive care. There is no specific antidote for the toxin. If the patient’s nausea and vomiting are not severe, activated charcoal may be used in the first few hours of toxicity to prevent further absorption of the ciguatoxin. Antihistamines can be used for pruritus. Symptomatic relief of nausea and vomiting should also be provided. Dehydration can occur due to nausea and vomiting and should be treated with intravenous fluids. If intravenous (IV) fluid resuscitation is not sufficient, then IV vasopressor infusion may be added. There is evidence that calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine and verapamil are useful in treating some symptoms like headaches. In rare cases, patients may experience respiratory failure and should be managed by traditional rapid sequence intubation. Symptomatic bradycardia is treated with intravenous atropine. Medications such as amitriptyline may reduce some symptoms, such as paresthesia and fatigue. Steroids and vitamin supplements support recovery but do not reduce toxic effects. Mannitol's role is controversial in Ciguatera poisoning as a clinical trial found no difference between mannitol and normal saline. But at the same time, many trials have demonstrated improvement of neurologic symptoms after administrating mannitol. A mid approach can be followed by giving only one dose of Mannitol in addition to Normal Saline.
