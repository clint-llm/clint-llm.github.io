Patient education should occur at each visit to mitigate the risk of developing eyelid malignancy. The two most important modifiable risk factors are sun protection and nicotine avoidance or cessation. Patients should avoid ultraviolet radiation; short-wavelength UVB radiation is more damaging than long-wavelength UVA radiation and can induce DNA damage in tumor-suppression genes. Studies suggest that UV exposure contributes to almost 65% of melanoma and 90% of nonmelanoma skin cancer.

Educate patients to avoid excess sun exposure, wear wide-brim hats to shade the head and neck, avoid tanning salons, and apply SPF lotion. In addition, clinicians should counsel patients against nicotine use as this has increased the risk of malignancies. Furthermore, patients with a family history of skin cancers, immunosuppressive status, previous radiation, or exposure to toxic substances are at higher risk of developing skin malignancies.
