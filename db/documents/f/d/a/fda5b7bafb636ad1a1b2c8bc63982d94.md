Management for patients with afferent loop syndrome can largely subdivide according to underlying etiology. For most benign causes, surgery usually provides definitive treatment. In the setting of malignancy, initial neoadjuvant management may be followed by surgical treatment with curative/palliative intent.

The nature of intervention for afferent loop syndrome secondary to benign causes depends on the original surgery performed and the underlying cause of obstruction. Various corrective surgical procedures have been described, including:

- Converting a Billroth II to a Roux-en-Y

- Creating a Braun anastomosis in a Billroth II, which is an anastomosis from the afferent limb directly to the efferent limb allowing secretions to bypass the gastrojejunal anastomosis

- Redundant loops may be excised and reconstructed.

Obstructions that involve the supramesocolic portion of the afferent loop are often more technically complex to fix due to the dense adhesions that form in the region. Of the benign causes for afferent loop syndrome, anastomotic scarring from a healed marginal ulcer may receive management by endoscopic balloon dilation.

Patients with acute afferent loop syndrome due to malignant causes that are deemed non-operative should undergo palliative treatment targeted at relieving the acute obstruction. Excision and reconstruction are not typically performed in the acute setting for these patients.
