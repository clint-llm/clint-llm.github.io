Calcium gluconate is a medication used to manage hypocalcemia, cardiac arrest, and cardiotoxicity due to hyperkalemia or hypermagnesemia. It is classified as a calcium salt. This activity outlines the indications, action, and contraindications for calcium gluconate as a valuable agent in managing hypocalcemia, cardiac arrest, cardiotoxicity due to hyperkalemia or hypermagnesemia, and other disorders as applicable. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse events, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, monitoring, relevant interactions). The activity is pertinent for members of the healthcare team who are engaged in the management of hypocalcemia, cardiac arrest, cardiotoxicity due to hyperkalemia or hypermagnesemia, and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Review the mechanism of action of calcium gluconate as a treatment.
- Identify indications where calcium gluconate has a clinical role.
- Summarize the dosing parameters for calcium gluconate therapy.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication when using calcium gluconate in applicable clinical scenarios.
