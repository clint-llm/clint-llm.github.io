The pars nervosa is supplied primarily by the inferior and middle hypophyseal arteries with some contribution of the superior hypophyseal artery, all of which branches of the internal carotid artery. While the hypophyseal veins serve as primary drainage of the pars nervosa, portal venous branches also carry some blood to the anterior pituitary, permitting the direct effects of AVP on secretory activity within the anterior pituitary. Both of these venous systems drain through the intercavernous sinus and eventually into the internal jugular vein.
