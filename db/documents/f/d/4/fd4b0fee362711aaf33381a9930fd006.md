Patients with velopharyngeal dysfunction should be managed by a multidisciplinary team of otolaryngologists, oral maxillary facial surgeons, plastic surgeons, neurologists, speech-language pathologists, prosthodontists, radiologists, primary care physicians, pediatricians, and geneticists. Early diagnosis and treatment of VPD are essential for long-term speech fluency and social function. Children with poor speech development and signs of VPD such as hypernasal speech and nasal regurgitation should be referred by their pediatricians to speech therapy for first-line treatment. A geneticÂ workup should also be performed in collaboration with a geneticist.

Patients with associated neurological weakness should be evaluated by neurology. If anatomical abnormalities such as submucosal or occult cleft palate are diagnosed on instrumentation, a referral should be sent to an otolaryngologist or plastic surgeon specializing in velopharyngeal surgery. Speech therapy should continue even after surgical repair to enhance speech outcomes and address poor compensatory behaviors used by patients prior to surgery. Finally, patients may develop social anxiety and avoidance due to the intelligibility of their speech, especially in school and work settings. Formal peer support groups with parents and patients who share the diagnosis can aid patients in addressing their concerns.
