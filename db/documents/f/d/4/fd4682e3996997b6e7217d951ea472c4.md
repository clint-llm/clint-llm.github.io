Fentanyl (which can also be spelled fentanil) is a potent synthetic opioid similar to morphine but produces analgesia to a greater extent. This robust pharmacologic agent is typically 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. A dose of only 100 micrograms can produce equivalent analgesia to approximately 10 mg of morphine. However, fentanyl exhibits vastly different properties and pharmacokinetics. Clinically, its most frequent use is as a sedative in intubated patients and in severe cases of pain in patients with renal failure due to its primarily hepatic elimination.

At times, clinicians may also use fentanyl to treat chronic pain patients who have developed tolerance to opiates. When used as a sedative, it is most commonly administered as a drip, owing to its versatility in titration scenarios.

Indications for fentanyl are as follows:

- Preoperative analgesia

- Anesthesia adjunct

- Regional anesthesia adjunct

- General anesthesia

- Postoperative pain control

- Moderate to severe acute pain (off-label)

Fentanyl was first produced in 1960 and approved for use in the USA in 1968.

Fentanyl is also a drug subject to diversion for misuse. Fentanyl can be added to heroin for increased potency or be distributed under the guise of highly potent heroin. When users think they are purchasing heroin and instead actually receive fentanyl, it can often result in overdose deaths.
