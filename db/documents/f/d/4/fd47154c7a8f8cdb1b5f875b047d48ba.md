Congenital unilateral lower lip palsy is a minor congenital anomaly that only affects the lower lip movements. When the baby cries, the mouth is pulled downwards on the healthy side and does not move on the affected side. Parents should be counseled that affected children do not have any difficulties with eye movements, feeding, or breathing. It can result from a traumatic injury to the nerve in the antenatal or peripartum period or from a developmental problem of the facial nerve or of the affected muscle.

While it can be an isolated finding, in some cases it can be accompanied by other congenital anomalies such as heart defects, musculoskeletal defects (less frequently), kidney problems, neck or face problems, etc. and parents should be encouraged to be compliant with the recommended consultations and evaluations. Whenever there are other underlying anomalies, patients should be followed by an interprofessional team. Parents should also be educated that the outcome is good in isolated cases, and no treatment is required in most cases. If cosmetic concerns persist, minor surgeries or botox injections may provide a good outcome.
