The heart is dependent on adequate oxygen supply for energy production to support contractility. At the cellular level, ischemia causes an increase in anaerobic glycolysis. This increases the levels of hydrogen, potassium, and lactate in the venous return of the ischemic or affected area of the myocardium. The hydrogen ions compete with calcium ions causing hypokinesia/akinesia of the affected area. For stable angina, this change in oxygen supply requires a trigger that would cause metabolic mismatchâ€” exercise, stress, and low temperature.
