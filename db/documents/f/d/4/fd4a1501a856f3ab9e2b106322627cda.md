The normal respiratory rate changes with age are 12 to 20 respirations per minute for a resting adult. However, in the elderly population, an individual with more than 28 respirations/min is deemed tachypneic.

Along with blood pressure, temperature, and pulse rate, respiratory rate is one of the vital signs routinely monitored in a clinical setting.

An alteration from the normal respiratory rate is often a clinical manifestation of pathological conditions. These conditions induce changes in the previously mentioned feedback categories, and the resulting respiratory rate or volume change is an adjustment to the disease state. Metabolic acidosis states increase the tidal volume, while metabolic alkalosis has the opposite effect in ventilation, decreasing the respiratory rate. Interstitial diseases that change the mechanical input to the respiratory center lead to a rapid breathing rate. Congestive heart failure has the same effect by stimulating J-receptors with the mechanism as described earlier. Higher cortical centers can be affected by an increase in intracranial pressure, e.g., in a patient with head trauma or by pain in a patient with a rib fracture, resulting in an increased respiratory rate. The opposite effect on higher centers will be observable in an individual who has taken CNS depressant substances.

Patients with several pathologic conditions leading to changes in respiratory rate may present with very specific respiratory patterns identifying the causal condition. Cheyne-Stokes pattern includes a crescendo-decrescendo pattern of respirations between apneas or hypopneas. This respiratory pattern can present in patients with pontine lesions or heart failure.
