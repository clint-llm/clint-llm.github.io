Chronic mesenteric ischemia can lead to the following complications:

- Poor quality of life

- Avoidance of food and malnutrition

- Thrombosis leading to ischemia of the colon

- Repeated hospital admissions

- GI tract bleeding

- Infection

- Prolonged ileus

For most patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia, the quality of life is poor. The constant fear of abdominal pain that may occur when eating food leads to significant weight loss. The malnourished state often leads to other metabolic and endocrine problems, bone thinning and easy bruising.
