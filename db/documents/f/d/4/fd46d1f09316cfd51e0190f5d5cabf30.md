Treatment of JFS depends on the etiology:

- Surgery:

- Safe resection is the treatment of choice and maybe curative in schwannomas, meningiomas, non-infiltrative paragangliomas, and other benign tumors. Subtotal removalmay be needed to preserve the functions of cranial nerves and the integrity of vascular structures and the brainstem. A multidisciplinary approach is vital in the radical excision of large paragangliomas with intracranial extension.
- Shunt procedure, venous sinus angioplasty, and stenting, or optic nerve sheath fenestration - these are for intracranial hypertension due to venous sinus stenosis.

- Radiotherapy:

- Stereotactic radiosurgery (e.g., gamma knife, LINAC) is a useful and safe treatment option for paragangliomas at this location, if the diameter is under 3 cm, to reduce the morbidity.
- Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is the technology which combines the precision of stereotaxy with dose fractionation in large tumors greater than 3 to 4 cm in diameter which are not suitable for radiosurgery
- Postoperative radiotherapy is sometimes used to control the residual disease following subtotal resection.

- Embolization - Preoperative embolization may be useful in extensively vascular tumors like paragangliomas to reduce the blood loss during surgery

- Anticoagulants (low molecular weight heparin) - For jugular vein thrombosis

- Acyclovir and steroids - For viral infections
