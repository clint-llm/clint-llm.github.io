Personality disorders are pervasive, maladaptive, and chronic patterns of behavior, cognition, and mood. Persons who have personality disorders experience distorted perceptions of reality and abnormal affective responses, ultimately manifesting in distress across all aspects of the individual's life, including occupational difficulties, impaired social functioning, and interpersonal hardships. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of personality disorders and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with personality disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Review the hypothesized risk factors for developing personality disorders. 
- Summarize the epidemiology of personality disorders. 
- Explain the common presentation of the different clusters of personality disorders. 
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interdisciplinary team members to improve outcomes for patients who have personality disorders, and thus indirectly improving the outcome for the community.
