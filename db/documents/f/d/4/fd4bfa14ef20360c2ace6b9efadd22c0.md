In patients with refractory hypertension, some other differentials to include are renal artery stenosis, secondary aldosteronism, pheochromocytoma (spontaneous and drug-mediated),

Other genetic diseases presenting similarly to primary hyperaldosteronism include but are not limited to:

Chrétien syndrome is a rare syndrome that is caused by excess secretion of POMC from pituitary adenoma leading to adrenocortical hypertension.

Gitelman syndrome, which is a loss of function of the sodium chloride cotransporter in the renal tubules, leading to salt wasting and secondary hyperaldosteronism.

Liddle syndrome is a pseudohyperaldosteronism which is a rare autosomal dominant disorder causing hyperactive renal epithelial sodium channels with increased sodium reabsorption in the distal tubules. In this syndrome, levels of renin and aldosterone are low.
