If there is any bleeding, it should be halted prior to the application of the selected photosensitizer. The incubation time required varies as per the photosensitizer and the indication for which PDT is being used. ALA requires an incubation period of 30 mins to 18 hours with or without occlusion. For MAL-PDT, the incubation period is of 3 hours with occlusion. Physical protection against the light with aluminum foil is required to prevent any effect of natural light. After the incubation period, the topical agent is removed with either a dry gauze or saline solution. ALA-PDT employs various light sources. MAL-PDT uses a 635 nm red light. The patient is advised to use chemical and physical photoprotective measures after the procedure.

Ophthalmic Procedure:

Verteporfin is injected intravenously as an infusion. The infusion is given for about 10 min. The dose used is 6 mg/m of the body surface area.

To enhance the safety profile of PDT and reduce the chances of subretinal hemorrhage, reduced fluence PDT is used, which uses a laser fluence of 25 J/cm.

Reduced dose PDT is also used at times, which uses half the amount of standard dose, that is, 3 mg/m of the body surface area.

Literature is limited to decide upon the adequate parameters for different chorioretinal disorders.
