The underlying cause of dry mouth determines prognosis. Almost all patients will benefit from symptomatic treatment. Providers can address a temporary etiology such as dehydration, medication-induced salivary hypofunction, and use of substances such as caffeine, smoking, and alcohol with good results. The symptoms tend to be persistent for chronic and irreversible causes such as Sj√∂gren syndrome and head and neck cancer post-irradiation, where palliative treatment is the only alternative.
