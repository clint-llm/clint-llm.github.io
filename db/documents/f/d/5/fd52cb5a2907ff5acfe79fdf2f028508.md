Patients with drug-induced esophagitis typically present with retrosternal chest pain or heartburn, dysphagia, or odynophagia. A retrospective study that included 78 patients with pill-induced esophagitis observed the frequency of chest pain (71.8%), odynophagia (38.5%), and dysphagia (29.5%).

**Drug-induced esophagitis in children**: Children with symptoms of dysphagia, retrosternal chest pain, odynophagia, and vomiting should raise suspicion for drug-induced esophagitis if there is any recent medication administration history. Drug-induced esophagitis can occur in children who take capsules or tablet formulations of medicines. Inadequate water intake and medication administration at bedtime are usually the risk factors associated with children. Severe complications are rare in children having drug-induced esophagitis, but morbidity and mortality have correlated with iron and potassium preparations. Children generally have an uneventful clinical course in drug-induced esophagitis.
