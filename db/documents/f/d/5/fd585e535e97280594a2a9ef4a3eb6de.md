With purse-lip breathing, the action of breathing initiates voluntarily. For purse-lip breathing to be effective, the individual must be able to perform the technique correctly. The technique requires proper coordination to maintain prolonged exhalation. As for the therapeutic effects, they are short-lived. The technique is limited to 3 to 5 breaths since prolonging the duration of the technique causes fatigue of the respiratory muscles and significantly lower than normal levels of carbon dioxide in a normal individual potentially leading to a decrease perfusion pressure in the brain causing syncope. Without the proper use of purse-lip breathing, an individual could exacerbate air trapping and carbon dioxide retention.
