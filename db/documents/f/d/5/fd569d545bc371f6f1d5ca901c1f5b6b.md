The prognosis of nocturnal cough is dependent on the cause.Â A cough should improve within eight weeks of smoking cessation. In the case of ACEI therapy, improvement occurs within four weeks. Cough caused by GERD only improves after the underlying condition is treated. However, the cough of asthma may be present for years.
