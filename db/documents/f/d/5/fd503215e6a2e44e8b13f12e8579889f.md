All immunizations and vaccines should be stored and managed in a manner that has been outlined by their manufacturers. When handling vials for the vaccines, make sure to read the labels carefully to ensure that the vaccinations are the correct immunizations for the patient. Be sure to document in the patient's chart and records as outlined by state or local entities.

Before injecting any site with a vaccination, make sure to observe universal precautions by washing hands and placing on protective equipment such as gloves before touching the patient.
