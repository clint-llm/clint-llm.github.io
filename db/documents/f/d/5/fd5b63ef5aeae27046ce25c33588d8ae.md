The diagnosis of periodontal diseases requires the comparison of findings in relation to the normal periodontium. This comparison uses visual inspection, periodontal probing, and evaluation of bone levels seen radiographically. The normal periodontium consists of stippled, pale pink gingiva that is well adapted to the underlying bone. Between the gingiva and the tooth, there is a 1 to 3 mm physiological sulcus that normally displays no signs of bleeding. Comparatively, signs of periodontal disease include active bleeding in response to mild or no tissue manipulation, pain, bad taste/odor, periodontal pocketing, radiographic bone loss, clinical attachment loss, and tooth loss. The radiographs of a patient with periodontitis will show an alveolar bone loss in close proximity to a deep periodontal probing depth. These findings suggest that there is a deep periodontal pocket associated with the tooth that contains the periodontal pathogens that are actively triggering the host response. If left untreated, the bone loss will progress until there is inadequate tooth support, and the associated tooth will become mobile and eventually be lost
