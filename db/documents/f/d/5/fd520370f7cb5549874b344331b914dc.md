Cisatracurium should be administered only by adequately trained individuals (anesthesiologist,Â nurse anesthetist, intensivist, emergency physician) familiar with its actions, characteristics, and hazards. The drug should not be administered absent personnel and facilities for resuscitation, and life support and an antagonist for cisatracurium must be immediately available. Cisatracurium dosing should be individualized, and a peripheral nerve stimulator should be used to measure neuromuscular function during the administration of cisatracurium to monitor drug effect, to determine the need for additional doses, and to confirm recovery from neuromuscular block. Cisatracurium has no known effects on consciousness or pain threshold, so to avoid patient distress, a neuromuscular block should not be induced before unconsciousness. The use of this medication is safest when used by an interprofessional team monitoring the patient. [Level 5]
