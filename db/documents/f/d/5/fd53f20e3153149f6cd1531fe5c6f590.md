Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin found in various animal products and fortified foods and is also made endogenously in the human body.

Hypervitaminosis D is rare and usually caused by excessive doses of vitamin D due to misuse of over-the-counter supplements or erroneous prescriptions. Less commonly, poisoning from exposure to rodenticides containing cholecalciferol can also lead to vitamin D toxicity. Toxicity leads to hypercalcemia and an imbalance in the regulation of bone metabolism with resultant hypercalcemia and its associated signs and symptoms.
