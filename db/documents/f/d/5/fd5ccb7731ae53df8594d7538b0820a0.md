In general terms, the resolution of a superficial infection has a very good prognosis. Most patients are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms. Although relapses are common, the removal of the affected hair is usually curative. White piedra is not a risk factor for invasive Trichosporon infections.

The prognosis of invasive infection is dependent on the underlying condition or immune state of the patient, with the mortality rate being high in several published cases. The cure of disseminated infection has been seen in patients who were either not neutropenic at the time of diagnosis or who recovered from their neutropenia quickly. Mortality rates of 40% to 60% have been reported in patients with severe invasive disease.

Patients with localized disease, such as wound infections and cellulitis due to T. asahii, have been cured with surgical debridement and prolonged antifungal therapy.
