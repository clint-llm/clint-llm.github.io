Jannetta was of the opinion that even patients who did not show clear neuroimaging findings of compression of the facial nerve might respond to neurosurgical, neurovascular decompression in patients with hemifacial spasms.Â There have only been a handful of patients with SOM who have undergone neurosurgical decompression, although all achieved success.

As more clinical information is collected, it will be interesting to see if the same mandate will apply to SOM and where most patients with intractable symptoms will respond to neurosurgical, neurovascular decompression of the trochlear nerve.
