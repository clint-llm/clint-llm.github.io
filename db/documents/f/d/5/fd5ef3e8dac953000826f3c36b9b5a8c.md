Nonorganic functional hearing loss has a generally good prognosis if the diagnosis is made and appropriate treatment is initiated. Spontaneous recovery has been noted in many studies.

However, in those patients with spontaneous recovery, relapse can occur in up to 25% of patients within a year. Factors indicating a better prognosis include prompt recognition, appropriate treatment, assessment of predisposing stress, and the absence of comorbid medical or psychiatric illness.
