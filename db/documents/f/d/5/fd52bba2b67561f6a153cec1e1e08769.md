Renal mass is an abnormal growth in the kidney. The majority of renal masses are benign; however, a significant number of them require further intervention. The retroperitoneum's anatomy, signs, symptoms, or physical examination are insufficient for detecting renal masses. Imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, or ultrasound are used to diagnose such masses.

Renal masses are classified into either solid or cystic. This review will focus on the solid tumor with minimal discussion on the cystic type. One of the main concerns for a solid renal mass is carcinoma. There were about 74,000 new cases in 2019; of these, it is expected that 15,000 patients will die from cancer.

The five-year survival rate increases with early diagnosis. The survival rate for stage 1 and 2 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is above 90% versus below 15% for certain types of stage 3 or metastatic disease.

Since renal mass is a diverse subject with many nuances in both treatment and management, this review will explore renal mass, emphasizing small renal masses because of clinical practice relevance. We will examine the etiologies, diagnosis, and management of renal mass.
