The pericardium is the fibroelastic sac that covers the heart. Besides acting as a protective barrier, it also affects cardiac hemodynamics. Constrictive pericarditis is a condition in which granulation tissue formation in the pericardium results in loss of pericardial elasticity leading to restriction in the ventricular filling. It is usually a chronic condition however subacute, transient and occult variants have been described. This activity describes the pathophysiology, presentation and diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of constrictive pericarditis.
- Review the presentation of a patient with constrictive pericarditis.
- Summarize the treatment options for constrictive pericarditis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by constrictive pericarditis.
