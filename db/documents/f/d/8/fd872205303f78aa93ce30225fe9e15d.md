A metabolic cart is used to measure the variables of metabolic gas exchange accurately. To interpret the values accurately, adhering to the calibration standards and quality assurance procedures is essential. There may be slight differences in calibration techniques as there are a variety of metabolic carts available. Following the instructions provided by the manufacturer, in conjunction with the recommendation that is described in detail in the AHA scientific statement by Balady et al., is vital.

Additionally, emergency equipment should be readily available. This equipment includes:

- Crash cart w/ cardioverter – defibrillator
