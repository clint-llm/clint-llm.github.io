Fibular tissue grafts/flaps are used in the following scenarios:

- Large posttraumatic skeletal defects (>6 cm for either upper or lower limbs)

- Significant bone stock deficit after tumor resection

- Pseudarthrosis of the long bones

- Leg length discrepancy

- Mandibular or maxillary defect reconstruction

- Chronic osteomyelitis (when antimicrobial options fail)

- Vascularized epiphyseal transfer

- Cortical bone grafting (osteoconductive and osteoinductive for non-union)

- Grafting for osteonecrosis of the head of the humerus or femur

Selecting the appropriate surgical technique is a complex decision to be made after a discussion between the interprofessional team and the patient. While a plethora of options are available for the management of various bone defects, there is no formal consensus in the literature regarding which method is consistently most appropriate for a given defect; however, a preponderance of evidence supports the use of fibular grafting is an excellent option in many cases due to its high success rate and low incidence of complications or donor site morbidity.
