When the opthalmologist makes a diagnosis of roth spots, the patient should be referred to other relevant specialists for work up because there are many causes. The initial referral should be to the primary care physician, nurse practitioner and the internist. The evaluation is based largely on results of a thorough history and physical examination. A complete blood count with differential to assess for leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia along with other hematologic abnormalities should be completed in all patients. A fasting plasma glucose or hemoglobin A1C to assess for diabetes mellitus should be performed. If infectious etiology is suspected erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and blood cultures may be indicated. A cardiologist should perform a transthoracic echocardiogram to rule out endocarditis.  The infectious disease expert should conduct HIV antibody testing, imaging studies or peripheral blood smear, if indicated based on presenting symptoms and physical examination findings.
