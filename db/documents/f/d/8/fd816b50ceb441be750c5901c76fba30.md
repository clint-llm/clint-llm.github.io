Overuse of infliximab results in long-term inhibition of TNFa and thereby enhances the risk of infections, which furthermore poses deleterious effects for pregnancy and lactation by impairing newborn’s defense mechanisms.

Since TNFa is involved in embryogenesis and organogenesis, a deleterious effect on embryo and fetal development is postulated.

Another toxic effect of infliximab is the carcinogenic potential resulting from reports of malignancies in children, adolescents, and young adults receiving infliximab over a median value of 30 sessions. This hypothesis comes from the finding that TNFa causes tumoral hemorrhagic necrosis and therefore used as a treatment for selective tumors.
