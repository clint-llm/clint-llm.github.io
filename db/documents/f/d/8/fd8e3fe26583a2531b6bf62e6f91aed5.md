Diagnosis can be established clinically through history and physical examination, therefore further diagnostic investigation is not always necessary.

Findings on plain radiographs may consist of calcification in the flexor-pronator tendons or traction osteophytes.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is generally regarded as the gold standard for the diagnosis of medial epicondylitis.

Musculoskeletal ultrasound (US) evaluation has a sensitivity and specificity, 95.2% and 92% respectively, for the diagnosis of medial epicondylitis.

Although MRI and US evaluations are found to be clinically the most beneficial in the diagnosis of medial epicondylitis, bone scans, and computed tomography may also be useful for ruling out other etiologies.

In patients whose exam is suggestive of ulnar neuritis or neuropathy, electromyography and nerve conduction studies could be a helpful adjunctive diagnostic tool.
