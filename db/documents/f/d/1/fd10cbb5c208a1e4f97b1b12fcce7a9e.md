Complications of this disorder are just as heterogeneous as its protean presentation. The severity of complications ranges from subtle iatrogenic side effects to suicide. The most common manifestations of complications include iatrogenic worsening of mood cyclicity and sequelae of emotional dysregulation, such as impulse control and substance use disorders. Less commonly, cyclothymia in youth can prove to be heterotypic, developing into bipolar disorder in adulthood.
