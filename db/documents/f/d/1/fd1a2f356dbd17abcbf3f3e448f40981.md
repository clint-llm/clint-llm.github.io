Anisometropia causes induced prism. When anisometropia is accompanied by symptoms of asthenopia, diplopia, nausea, imbalance, and headache, the assumption is generally made that aniseikonia is the cause. However, anisometropic spectacles can cause similar symptoms due to either optical aniseikonia (from a difference in spectacle magnification between the eyes) or from induced prism when looking away from the optical center of the lenses (Prentice rule). To add to the potential confusion, contact lenses will treat both induced prism and optical aniseikonia. Differentiating between these two is to test for aniseikonia using the different methods discussed in the treatment section or to observe whether spectacle correction does not require looking away from the optical center (such as separate single vision distance and reading glasses) to alleviate the symptoms.

Altered brain function can cause micropsia and macropsia, and other distortions and can occur in conditions such as Alice in Wonderland syndrome, Charles Bonnet syndrome, migraine, and other types of hallucinations.

Retinal pathology is often associated with symptoms of aniseikonia but has not caused retinal aniseikonia. Since retinal aniseikonia is generally treated medically and not optically, testing for aniseikonia is usually not done, and optical solutions are not pursued. Therefore, in many cases, it is not clear whether the blur caused by the retinal pathology is the cause of the symptoms instead of the presence of aniseikonia.
