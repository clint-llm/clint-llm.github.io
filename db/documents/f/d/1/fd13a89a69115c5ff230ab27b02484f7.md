Treatment of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) is symptomatic by raising the seizure threshold through pharmacologic interventions such as administering benzodiazepines and/or barbiturates or propofol. Hyperventilation with high doses of oxygen reduces cerebral blood flow.

The other mainstay of treatment is to reduce the free available local anesthetic concentration in the plasma by the administration of lipid emulsions. Due to the high lipid solubility, the infusion of lipid emulsions will bind free circulating local anesthetics and lower the plasma levels. The following is the treatment algorithm suggested by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine:

**"Call for Help"**

- Even premonitory CNS systems may progress to severe cardio-respiratory compromise, and many tasks may need to be done simultaneously, such as getting code carts and obtaining the lipid emulsion.

**Initial Focus**

- Airway management: ventilate with 100% oxygen

- Seizure suppression: benzodiazepines are preferred; AVOID propofol in patients having signs of cardiovascular instability

**Alert the Nearest Facility Having Cardiopulmonary Bypass Capability**

**Management of Cardiac Arrhythmias**

- Basic and Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) will require adjustment of medications and perhaps prolonged effort.

- AVOID vasopressin, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and local anesthetics

- REDUCE individual epinephrine doses to <1 mcg/kg

**Lipid Emulsion (20%) Therapy**(values in parenthesis are for 70kg patient)

- Bolus 1.5 mL/kg (lean body mass) intravenously over 1 minute (~100mL)

- Continuous infusion 0.25 mL/kg/min (~18 mL/min; adjust by roller clamp)

- Repeat bolus once or twice for persistent cardiovascular collapse

- Double the infusion rate to 0.5 mL/kg/min if blood pressure remains low

- Continue infusion for at least 10 minutes after attaining circulatory stability

- Recommended upper limit: Approximately 10 mL/kg lipid emulsion over the first 30 minutes

Resuscitation may need to include cardiopulmonary bypass, as successful outcomes have been reported even after prolonged resuscitation, which may, in part, be explained by suggestions in animal models that bupivacaine, when added to cardioplegia solution, actually improves function and reduces the cellular damage of rat isolated hearts after prolonged, cold storage.
