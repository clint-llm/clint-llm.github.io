As the nasopalatine nerve is a derivative of the maxillary nerve, the V2 branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V); originates from the first pharyngeal arch. The first pharyngeal arch appears at the beginning of the fourth week of gestation, and cranial nerve V2 spreads to provide sensation to the maxillary region of the face.

The nasopalatine canal forms as part of the primary palate, which itself results from the fusion of the two medial nasal prominences in the midline. It is then the point of union between the primary and secondary palate, which is composed of the palatine shelves- outgrowths of the maxillary prominences. Â As development occurs, the nasopalatine nerve passes through a wide tissue space initially, but as ossification of the incisive bone takes place at 12 to 15 weeks, the incisive canal becomes narrow and fills with fibrous tissue.
