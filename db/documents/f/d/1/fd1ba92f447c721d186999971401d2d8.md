The lid-wiper region is composed of a thin layer of stratified squamous epithelium that overlies a dense layer of connective tissue. The lid wiper area is responsible for distributing the tear film evenly across the ocular surface. Damage to this area can lead to poor tear film quality and stability, resulting in a range of ocular symptoms, including foreign body sensation, burning, and redness.

The inflammatory response associated with LWE is believed to be mediated by cytokines and chemokines released by the damaged epithelium. Increased levels of inflammatory cytokines lead to a decrease in the number of goblet cells in the conjunctiva, further propagating ocular surface inflammation and damage. Additionally, the expression of keratinization-related proteins (filaggrin, TGase1, and cytokeratin 1/10) has been linked to conjunctival changes seen in LWE. This gives rise to the hypothesis that LWE results from anterior displacement of the mucocutaneous junction (Line of Marx) of the palpebral conjunctiva, disrupting the normal function of the lid wiper.

Conjunctival changes noted in LWE include squamous metaplasia, hyperkeratosis, and epithelial thickening. The mechanical stress placed on this region during blinking is thought to cause damage to the epithelium, leading to the development of these changes.
