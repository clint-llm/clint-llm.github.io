This activity reviews the indications and contraindications of intra-aortic balloon pump in patients with cardiogenic shock secondary to various cardiac conditions, including myocardial infarction and subsequent mechanical complications. It covers the structure of the IABP device and its hemodynamic effects, the complications related to IABP use, and, most importantly, how an interprofessional team approach in caring for patients with cardiogenic shock requiring IABP support can help improve the clinical outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomic and physiologic effects of the intra-aortic balloon pump.
- Review the indications for the intra-aortic balloon pump procedure.
-  Review the technique of intraaortic balloon pump placement.
- Outline strategies for interprofessional communication to help make timely decisions about escalation or deescalation of care consistent with the patient's goals of care and the long-term prognosis with an intra-aortic balloon pump.
