Smoking is the most significant risk factor for cancers of the larynx, associated with an estimated 70% to 95% of all cases. Any history of smoking portends higher risk, with current smokers exhibiting increased relative risk versus ex-smokers overall and increased relative risk for supraglottic versus glottic cancers. An association with heavy alcohol consumption has also been characterized, though the independent effect of alcohol is not clear given that combined use with tobacco is noted in most cases. Marijuana smoking may play a role in younger patients. In contrast to other cancers of the head and neck, the role of human papillomavirus (HPV) as a causative agent has not been established.

Other risk factors for laryngeal cancer include the following:

- Advanced age

- Diet low in green leafy vegetables

- Infection with HPV

- Diet rich in fats and salt-preserved meat

- Exposure to paint, asbestos, gasoline fumes and radiation
