Adult acquired flatfoot (AAFD), first described as posterior tibial tendon dysfunction (PTTD), is a complex pathology defined by the collapse of the medial longitudinal arch of the foot with continued progressive deformity of the foot and ankle.

The anatomy of the foot and ankle are complex, with multiple structures involved in the stability and function needed to walk and bear weight. A structure principally involved in the development of adult acquired flatfoot is the posterior tibial tendon. In addition to plantar flexion, the posterior tibial tendon is the primary inverter of the foot. Â The posterior tibial tendon inserts principally on the navicular tuberosity, but also has lesser insertions on to other tarsal and metatarsal structures.

Acquired flatfoot grading is by the Johnson and Strom classification system, which has classification grades of I to III.
