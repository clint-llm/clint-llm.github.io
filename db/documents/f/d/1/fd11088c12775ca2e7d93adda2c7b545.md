The most common clinical manifestations are downward-slanting palpebral fissures (89%-100%), malar hypoplasia or hypoplasia of the zygomatic complex (81% to 97%), mandibular hypoplasia or micrognathia (a small lower jaw) (78% to 91%), auricular pinna malformations (77%), lower eyelid colobomas (54% to 69%), and dental anomalies (60%; most commonly hypoplastic, but also heterotopic or hyperplastic).

Eye manifestations of Treacher Collins syndrome include downward-slanting palpebral fissures, colobomas, and hypoplasia of the lower lids and lateral canthi, hypertelorism (a large distance between the eyes), and partial absence of eyelid cilia (or eyelashes).

Facial bone malformation manifestations include malar and mandibular hypoplasia. The malar and mandibular hypoplasia can lead to respiratory distress via obstructive sleep apnea (46%).

Ear manifestations of Treacher Collins syndrome most commonly involve abnormalities of the auricular pinna (or microtia) and are variably (though often) associated with atresia of the external auditory canals (EAC) and anomalies of the middle ear ossicles. Bilateral conductive hearing loss is a common result (83% to 96%).

There are other less common manifestations of Treacher Collins syndrome as well. Salivary gland abnormalities and subsequent dry mucosa can be seen in up 48% of patients with TCS.
