Organophosphate molecules can be absorbed via the skin, inhalation, or in the gastrointestinal tract. Once absorbed, the molecule binds to an acetylcholinesterase molecule in red blood cells, thus making the enzyme inactive. This leads to an overabundance of acetylcholine within synapses and neuromuscular junctions. Overstimulation of nicotinic receptors found at neuromuscular junctions can lead to fasciculations and myoclonic jerks. This eventually leads to flaccid paralysis because of the depolarizing block. Nicotinic receptors also are found in the adrenal glands, which may cause hypertension, sweating, tachycardia, and leukocytosis with a left shift.

Organophosphate poisoning also produces symptoms based on its action at muscarinic receptors. These effects are usually slower than the nicotinic receptors because the effects occur via a G-protein-coupled receptor mechanism. Muscarinic receptors are found in the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. Sweat glands within the sympathetic nervous system get overstimulated and cause large amounts of sweating. The parasympathetic effects of organophosphate poisoning can be seen in multiple systems, including the heart, exocrine glands, and smooth muscles. At some point, which is different for each specific compound, the acetylcholinesterase-organophosphate compound undergoes a process called aging. This is a conformational change that renders the enzyme resistant to reactivation, making some treatment options useless.
