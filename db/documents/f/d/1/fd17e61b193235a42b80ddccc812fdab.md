In many instances, the disease progression of this mononeuropathy is reversible if addressed early on. Efficient interdisciplinary and interprofessional communication is a crucial component of treating patients with neuropathy. Appropriate referral by the first medical professional who encounters a patient’s complaint can be the difference between an acute disease process and a chronic complication.

By identifying the location of the nerve lesion to the tibial nerve at the level of the medial malleolus, the EMG practitioner can address the causative agent. Initially, conservative measures require clinical attention—these include changes in footwear, physical therapy, and anti-inflammatory medications. Through effective interdisciplinary and interprofessional communication, the patient’s medical providers can monitor the patient’s progress.

If the patient does not demonstrate adequate progress, surgical intervention is needed. Ultimately, it is through collaboration and shared decision making that allows the patient to have the best possible outcome. The earlier the signs and symptoms of neuropathy identified, and the electrodiagnosis test performed, the better the prognosis and outcome.
