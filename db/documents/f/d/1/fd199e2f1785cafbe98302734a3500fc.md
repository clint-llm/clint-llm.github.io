Striae, or stretch marks, are indented streaks that often affect the abdomen, buttocks, thighs, back, breasts, axillae and groin. They are divided into striae atrophicans (thinned skin), striae gravidarum (following pregnancy), striae distensae (stretched skin), striae rubrae (red), striae albae (white), striae nigra (black), and striae caerulea (dark blue). These common complaints are difficult to treat. This activity outlines the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of stretch marks.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of stretch marks.
- Describe the pathophysiology of stretch marks.
- Summarize the treatment options for stretech marks
- Explain the value of improving care coordination among the members of the interprofessional team to educate patients with stretch marks.
