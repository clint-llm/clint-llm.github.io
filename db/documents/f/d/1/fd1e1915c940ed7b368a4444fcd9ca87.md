In patients presenting with new diarrhea, infectious etiologies of diarrhea including parasites, Escherichia coli 0157:H7 and Clostridium difficile must be ruled out first. Other colitis etiologies should be considered including, but not limited to, microscopic, lymphocytic, and collagenous. Those presenting with abdominal pain must have other causes considered as well including, but not limited to, appendicitis, irritable bowel disease, celiac disease, and functional abdominal pain.
