The treatment of Budd-Chiari syndrome is focused on alleviating the obstruction, preventing the progression of the clot, limiting progressive liver injury, and preventing or managing complications.

**Goals of Treatment**

- Relieving obstruction

- Correcting underlying conditions

- Monitoring liver deterioration

**Treatment of Budd-Chiari Syndrome**

- Anticoagulants are the mainstay of treatment. They are started initially with low-molecular-weight heparin and then transitioned to warfarin, which is continued lifelong. PT/INR should be monitored and should be kept in the therapeutic range for patients on warfarin.

- Other treatment options include thrombolysis and stenting, as well as placement of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in acute forms of BCS, which fail to respond.

- Surgical decompression can also be considered in acute forms if other therapies fail.

Liver transplantation: In patients who fail all therapies or who have developed decompensated cirrhosis, liver transplantation may be an option. The ten-year survival rate ranges from 69-84% as per two reported studies.
