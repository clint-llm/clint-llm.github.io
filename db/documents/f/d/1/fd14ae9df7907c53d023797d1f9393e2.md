Herpangina is a viral infection that is manifested clinically as an acute febrile illness with small ulcerative or vesicular lesions in the posterior oropharynx. Though primarily a pediatric disease, multiple cases in newborns, adolescents, and young adults have also been reported. The disease is highly contagious, and most cases are reported in the summer months. The disease is caused by 22 enterovirus serotypes and is most commonly associated with the Coxsackie B virus serotype. It can occur in association with an enteroviral exanthem and several neurological conditions, including, but not limited to, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, and encephalitis.
