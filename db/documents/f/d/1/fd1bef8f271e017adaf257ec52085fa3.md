Peripheral intravenous (IV) catheterization is an essential procedure performed by a variety of interprofessional healthcare team members. IV access can allow for the sampling of blood for laboratory analysis. Also, IV catheterization allows for fluid and medication administration directly to the patient’s circulatory system. Traditionally, IV catheterization is performed in the extremities (arms and hands being more common than legs or feet). This chapter will discuss obtaining peripheral IV access through scalp veins, a less often used but viable alternative to traditional extremity sites. Scalp IVs are an efficient and safe option. Knowing the unique considerations for obtaining IV access in the scalp is essential to successful utilization.
