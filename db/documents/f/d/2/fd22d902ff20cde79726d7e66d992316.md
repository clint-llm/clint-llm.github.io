The pathophysiology of this condition is complex, requiring an interplay of various factors such as EBV coinfection along with its productive replication, virulence, genetic evolution in association with expressing specific EBV genes that are in a latent state. All these factors enhanced by local as well as systemic deficiency of the host immune system lead to hairy leucoplakia.

Moreover, a marked reduction or an absence of Langerhans cells (antigen-presenting immune cells necessary for the response of the immune system to the viral infection) has also been found in hairy leukoplakia biopsy tissues.

Since the lateral border of the tongue is more susceptible to mechanical trauma, access to EBV to the prickle cell receptors is easy. Impaired immune status of the host along with a marked reduction of Langerhans cells. then contribute to the successful establishment of EBV in the oral epithelium.
