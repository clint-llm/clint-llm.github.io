Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) presents as bilateral corneal opacification present at birth or in the immediate newborn period and is due to an autosomal recessive mutation affecting the corneal endothelium. This activity will review the etiology, epidemiology, and pathophysiology for CHED. Recommendations for evaluation, treatment, and management of patients with CHED by an interprofessional team will be discussed.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the pathophysiology of congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy.
- Identify the specific characteristics of congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy.

- Review the surgical and medical options for the treatment of congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy.
- Describe the importance of early congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy identification, prompt treatment, and management among the interdisciplinary team as it relates to improving patient outcomes and preventing visual sequelae.
