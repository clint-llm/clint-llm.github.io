After determining the necessity for an umbilical arterial catheter, informed consent must be obtained as per the local institutional policy. Measures should be taken to avoid hypothermia in the infant while doing the procedure. These include the use of a radiant warmer and placement of an exothermic mattress under the infant, as necessary while performing the procedure. The three-way stopcock must be attached to the desired catheter and flushed with saline solution. It is better to use 0.45% normal saline to avoid hypernatremia using 0.9% normal saline. The flush syringe must be left attached to the stopcock with the stopcock turned off. The length of the insertion of the catheter tip has to be determined before the insertion.

The ideal position of the catheter tip should be in the descending aorta above the origin of the celiac, mesenteric, and renal arteries to avoid occlusion of these vessels. This high position (thoracic vertebra level T6-T9) is preferred compared to the low position, i.e., below the renal arteries (lumbar vertebra level L3-L4), as it is associated with fewer complications of thrombosis.
