At lower concentrations, patients may not report the characteristic odor of phosgene, though the odor will be sharper and “suffocating” at higher concentrations. System review may reveal subjective findings such as headache, nausea, and fatigue. Irritant effects such as burning, lacrimation, eye redness, eye pain, pharyngitis, wheezing, and cough may be present.

Uniquely, tobacco smokers may report an aversion to tobacco smoke following exposure to phosgene. Pulmonary and cardiovascular findings may include wheezing, choking sensation, chest tightness, dyspnea, and chest pain.

Vital signs most frequently reveal tachypnea, hypotension, and decreased pulse oximetry though it may not be evident early in the clinical course. Physical exam may reveal a productive cough with pink, frothy sputum, pharyngeal edema, or erythema with inspiratory and expiratory rhonchi. Wheezing may be appreciated during the auscultation of lung fields. Patients in distress may appear cyanotic. Significant concentrations of inhaled phosgene have been reported to induce rapid onset laryngospasm.
