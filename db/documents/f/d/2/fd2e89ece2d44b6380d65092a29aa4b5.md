Autogenous vascularized fibular grafting plays a vital role in the reconstruction of long bone defects, infected nonunions, andÂ reconstruction of tumor resection defects in adults and children. Vascularized fibular grafts not only provide osteoinductive and mechanical support but also have the ability to remodel and hypertrophy to withstand loading, making fibular grafting different from other types of bony reconstruction. A successful outcome depends not only on surgeon experience but also on appropriate patient selection and preoperative expectation management.
