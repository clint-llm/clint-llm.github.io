The pelvic abscess is a circumscribed collection of infected exudate. It is formed by liquefaction necrosis. It develops due to an imbalance between host defense mechanisms and insufficient antibiotic coverage in the setting of bacterial inoculum of high virulence. The necrotic tissues are built up around the infective exudate, which formed a thick fibrous wall. If the pus does not drain, it will localize the microbes as well as toxins which could be detrimental to the host and make it more difficult for antimicrobial agents to penetrate the fibrous inflammatory capsule and act on it. The enzymatic degradation of immunoglobulins and local release of complements occurs, which results in persistent pus formation.

In young women, pelvic abscess occurs as one of the complications of pelvic inflammatory disease. It starts as an ascending infection from the vagina, cervix and spreads to the uterus, fallopian tube, ovary, and peritoneum.  It causes endothelial damage and edema of the fallopian tube and consequently leads to tubal blockage. Notably, it generally occurs in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Likewise, high estrogen and cervical ectopy help link Neisseria Gonorrhea and chlamydia to the genital tract, which is one of the most common causes of Pelvic inflammatory disease and its complication.

In postoperative patients, the theory is that blood loss, serous fluid, lymphatic debris, necrotic tissue, and fibrillar hemostats cumulates in the lower pelvic area and vaginal vault. It results in the formation of a simple collection of fluid. The fluid accumulation eventually becomes infected via skin contamination and vaginal opening and results in pelvic abscess formation. The pathogenic organism ascends from the vagina, endocervix, and via skin to the surgical site, including vaginal vault and abdominal incision.

Compound and dynamic mixture of pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria ascend from the vagina comprises anaerobic facultative gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. As a result of an imbalance of the pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria, the sterile tissue gets infected and evolves in a pelvic abscess. Infection is usually polymicrobial, with the predominance of anaerobic bacteria. The bacteria involved are Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus,  aerobic Streptococcus, and Peptococcus.
