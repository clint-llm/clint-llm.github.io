Patients with scleroderma can experience a number of adverse outcomes, and scleroderma-associated pulmonary hypertension is a particularly severe condition with a high impact on patients' quality of life, morbidity, and even mortality. Complete coordination of an interprofessional team is crucial in managing these patients, and such a team should include primary care clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists (dermatologists, rheumatologists, pulmonologists), nursing staff, pharmacists, respiratory therapists, and the patient themselves along with their family.

Specialists will generally need to coordinate direct care, with the pulmonologist providing input to the dermatologist and/or rheumatologist. With the potential for complex drug regimens, a clinical pharmacist should also have significant input regarding drug-drug interactions, appropriate dosing, and can offer medication counseling to the patient. Nursing staff can provide disease state counseling, serve as a point of contact for the patient, and help coordinate care among the various clinicians involved in the case. All healthcare providers involved in the case must have complete access to all relevant clinical information, with open access and empowerment to provide input when they feel it is important to the outcome of the case. It is only through this kind of coordinated interprofessional teamwork that patients with scleroderma-associated pulmonary hypertension can achieve optimal outcomes with minimal adverse events.[Level 5]
