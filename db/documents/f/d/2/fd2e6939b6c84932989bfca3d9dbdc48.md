Breath holding spells might be a frightening experience for children and consequently for their parents. Breath holding spells may occur in children who have a normal neurological exam and in children who meet age-appropriate developmental milestones, but normally breath-holding spells do not affect the subsequent neurological development of a child. Breath holding episodes usually follow an inciting event in which the patient is being disciplined, is angry, or is being irritated, etc. Then an episode of crying and breath holding episode may occur which may proceed to loss of consciousness. These episodes may be prevented by distracting the child and by avoiding the triggers. This activity reviews the evaluation of breath holding spells and the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition and educating the parents.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the cause of breath holding spells.
- Discuss the impact of breath holding spells on neurologic development.
- Outline management options for breath holding spells.
- Summarize the interprofessional team response to evaluating a patient with breath holding spells and the management options.
