Serious complications can arise from dental infections as they spread to potential fascial planes of the head and neck. There are different paths for the dissemination of the infection. They can spread contiguously to the jaw, causing osteomyelitis. Second and third molars infections can migrate to the sublingual, submandibular and submental space, causing Ludwig angina. In children, dental infections may spread to the retropharyngeal or to the parapharyngeal space causing retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal abscess, respectively. Descending necrotizing mediastinitis is a severe life-threatening infection caused by the descent of dental infection through deep and superficial fascial planes. There have been case reports of dental infections spreading and causing cavernous sinus thrombosis

Dental infections and tooth extractions can cause the hematogenous spread of infection-causing bacteremia and endocarditis, especially in patients with valvular heart disease
