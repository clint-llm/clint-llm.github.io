The Chiari type I malformation is a rare developmental disorder that is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, pediatrician, surgeon, social worker, nurse, and physical therapist. These patients tend to have many physical and functional limitations, including impairment of swallowing, speaking, and even walking.

While the prognosis for most patients is good, when clinically suspected, appropriate investigations should be performed promptly to facilitate an appropriate level of treatment (e.g.conservative vs. surgical) and, in turn, to prevent future deterioration.
