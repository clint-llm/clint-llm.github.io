HSV-2 is transmitted through direct contact of sections in a seropositive individual who is actively shedding the virus. The virus preferentially affects the skin and mucous membranes with the virus invading epithelial cells on initial exposure and ultimately replicating intracellularly at that site. After the initial exposure and symptoms resolve, in 10 to 14 days, on average, the virus then lays dormant in the periaxonal sheath of the sensory nerves of either the trigeminal, cervical, lumbosacral, or autonomic ganglia. In these locations, the viral replication is often controlled by the patient's immune system and remains in a dormant state only to later reactive later in life.
