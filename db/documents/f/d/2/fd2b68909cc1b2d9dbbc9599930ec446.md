The pathophysiology of syncope varies by its etiology. In benign syncope, as vasovagal syncope, the vagus nerve is often over-stimulated, thus causing a transient loss of consciousness. The most common causes are classically due to fear, excitement, or temperature intolerances.

The other etiologies, listed above, require a careful history, physical, and evaluation, as the etiology is most-often cardiac and may be a predictor of a dangerous, life-threatening pathology.
