During the laser procedure, protective safety wear must be worn by all participants in the room to avoid inadvertent laser scatter.

**TCP**

If performed under local anesthesia, a peribulbar block or retrobulbar block is administered preoperatively. The patient may also receive sedation or, in rare cases, a general anesthetic.

The patient remains supine on the bed, and a speculum may be inserted to obtain adequate exposure of the eye.

It is recommended the ciliary body be identified with a handheld transilluminator before treatment to visualize the dark band of the ciliary processes, and this is particularly important in congenital cases where there may be distorted limbal anatomy.

The power is increased in increments from 150 to 250 mW/shot until an audible pop is heard, implying an excess of power resulting in an explosion of the ciliary processes and surrounding tissues. From here, the power level is titrated to just below the audible popping noise by similar increments. Depending on the desired IOP-lowering effect, 180 to 360 degrees can be administered to the eye, ranging from 12 to 40 spot burns.

Postoperatively, topical corticosteroid drops are prescribed 4 to 8 times per day; depending on patient characteristics and clinician discretion, anti-ocular hypertensives are usually continued postoperatively initially and then tapered according to the postoperative IOP response.

**MP-TCP**

Similar to TCP, this procedure is generally performed under local anesthesia, and the patient is positioned as per TCP.

The MP-TCP device is set to pulse with specified on/off time frames, typically 0.5 ms 'on' and 1.1 ms 'off,' with power ranging from 1600-2400 mW.

A viscous coupling gel is applied to the eye to enable sustained contact of the probe to the ocular surface. The probe is placed adjacent to the limbus on the sclera, and the handpiece is aligned perpendicularly to the globe. The probe is then moved in a smooth continuous back and forth painting motion with constant gentle pressure on the eye along the arc of the limbus coursing over each quadrant or hemisphere. This technique similarly spares the 3 and 9 o'clock regions. Unlike TCP, there is no audible pop heard to define an endpoint of maximal recommended power settings. Each quadrant receives 10 to 15 seconds of sweeping laser application and can undergo 3 to 5 repeat passes, with the total duration of laser application ranging from 80 to 360 seconds. Postoperative drops are prescribed as per TCP.

**ECP**

Preoperatively, dilating drops are applied to enhance pupillary dilatation for improved access and visualization of the ciliary processes. Like TCP and MP-TCP, a peribulbar block is administered, or the procedure is performed under topical anesthetic with adjunct sedation or general anesthesia in rare cases.

ECP is commonly performed at the time of cataract surgery, post crystalline lens removal, and following IOL insertion to avoid inadvertent lens damage and enable deepening of the ciliary sulcus to further facilitate visualization and access.

ECP is most commonly performed via a limbal approach, with a 2.2 to 3.2 mm temporally based corneal incision. A viscoelastic agent is then inserted into the anterior chamber and the ciliary sulcus to maintain anterior chamber stability and enlarge the space between the lens and posterior surface of the iris.

The laser energy can be applied in a painting or sweeping fashion or individually via direct shots upon visualization of the ciliary processes. It is recommended that up to 6 ciliary processes be in view to ascertain the correct working distance for effective laser application.

Viscoelastic is then removed from the anterior chamber via irrigation and aspiration, and the corneal wounds are sealed.

Intracameral or subconjunctival antibiotics and corticosteroids are routinely given at the end of the procedure, followed by topical postoperative steroids and antibiotics.
