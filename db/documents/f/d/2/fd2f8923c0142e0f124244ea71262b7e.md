Patients presenting with obstructive biliary pathology can be challenging to evaluate with noninvasive imaging. Percutaneous cholangiography, in conjunction with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, is critical to diagnose and treat specific pathologies. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team for this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for percutaneous cholangiography.
- Describe the technique of percutaneous cholangiography. 
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of percutaneous cholangiography.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance percutaneous cholangiography and improve outcomes.
