Appropriate history and physical examination findings would guide diagnosis and management including which evaluation studies to order.

Liquefactive necrosis closely mirrors acute inflammation and response to an infectious process. The only exemption is in the brain where liquefaction may occur in response to ischemia.

Evaluation and management are geared toward effective clinical management which could be medical with either antibiotics or surgical management.

Hypoxic injury is the cause of coagulative necrosis. Re-establishment of blood flow or oxygen supply is reperfusion. This is important for management. Hence, for this pattern of tissue damage, studies such as Doppler ultrasound are useful to determine blood flow.

**Useful evaluation includes:**

- Physical examination, including monitoring vital signs

- Laboratory investigations such (complete blood count, blood culture, urine culture, urinalysis)

- Imaging studies such as x-Rays

- Venous Doppler Scan

- CT

- Blood electrolytes
