Interesting findings regarding the involvement of the putamen in various physiological states

- Studies have demonstrated that the total volume of bilateral putamen in bilinguals is greater compared to monolingual individuals.

- A recent neuropsychological study evaluated the volumes of subcortical structures regarding the ability to recognize facial expressions of emotions. The results elicited the putamen volume inversely correlated with the recognition of the fearful face.

- The putamen, along with some other brain regions, mainly orbitofrontal cortices in the left and right hemispheres, is involved in the recognition of a mother’s own infant versus other infants, demonstrating the significant role of striatal structures in maternal behavior and love.
