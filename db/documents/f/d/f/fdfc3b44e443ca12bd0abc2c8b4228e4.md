Another issue for proper ergonomics to occur (especially in the healthcare sector) is the lack of proper equipment required to reduce the workload on employees. Overexposure to heavy lifting tasks and prolonged posturing has been cited as a major contribution to WMSDs across the general working population due to the inability to maintain proper ergonomic form secondary to fatigue.

Lack of assistive equipment, coupled with inadequate personnel to complete safe transfers and pressure to complete transfers quickly for increased productivity, often results in poor ergonomic measures and leads to increased incidence and severity of the injury.
