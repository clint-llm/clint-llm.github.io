The abdominopelvic cavity is confined superiorly by the diaphragm and extends inferiorly into the pelvis. This cavity houses most of the organs of the digestive system and parts of the urogenital system. The vasculature of the abdomen and pelvisÂ supplies the various organs and layers of tissue across many planes; it is among the most complex vascular systems in the body. Physiologic variation among vessels exists to introduce diversity amongst patient populations. Understanding the vast anatomy and vasculature of the abdomen and pelvis is vital to clinical and surgical knowledge and aids decision-making in patients with a plethora of complaints.
