Health professionals may not always be aware when a referral to a neuropsychologist is needed. Neuropsychologists have specialized training in brain-behavior relationships and perform comprehensive cognitive evaluations in addition to providing treatment. Cognitive screening can be useful to indicate the need for a consult for further, more formal testing. Primary care providers, neurologists, and nurses should be involved in referrals. The interprofessional team should be aware of this option to provide the best outcomes for patients.
