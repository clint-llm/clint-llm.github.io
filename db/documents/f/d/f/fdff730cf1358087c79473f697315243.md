It is important to understand that patients with aphasia have an impairment of language due to injury from the brain and not a cognitive deficit. When communicating with patients with aphasia, speak clearly, and use simple and short sentences. Another technique is repeating or writing down keywords. Also, allow patients time to talk and finish their thoughts and avoid correcting their speech.
