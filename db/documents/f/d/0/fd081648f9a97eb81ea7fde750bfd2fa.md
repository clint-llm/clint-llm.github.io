Poly-L-lactic acid is an absorbable, semi-permanent, injectable implant that can be used to gradually restore volume and stimulate collagen formation. It is FDA-approved for the correction of facial fat loss associated with antiretroviral therapy-induced lipoatrophy in HIV patients. It is FDA-approved for use in immunocompetent people to correct nasolabial fold deficiencies and other facial wrinkles. It has been used off-label to enhance the cheeks, hands, neck, and thighs.

It has also been used off-label for gluteal enhancement and chest wall deformities, such as pectus excavatum or thoracic deformities secondary to surgical procedures. Poly-L-lactic acid has been reported to improve “step off” chest wall deformities after mastectomy and implant reconstruction, suggesting that this product can also help improve breast abnormalities. For maximal correction, a series of injections is recommended at 3 to 6-week intervals. The degree of lipoatrophy correction is based on the number of sessions, not the volume injected at each session.
