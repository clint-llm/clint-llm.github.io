Four stages of gyrate atrophy have been described according to the disease progression

- Stage I is characterized by sharply defined and separate areas of peripheral chorioretinal atrophy with a normal disc, macula, and retinal vasculature, and concentric visual field limitation.

- Stage II is characterized by sharp areas of chorioretinal atrophy that become more fused and spread towards the posterior pole with narrower vessels, peripapillary degeneration, and similar concentric field limitation as stage I.

- Stage III is characterized by a large area of peripapillary degeneration, with an annular zone of a functioning retina between it and the peripheral degeneration, and a pale optic disc with narrower vessels. The macula is still spared with fine pigmentation, but the visual field is more deteriorated.

- Stage IV is characterized by a posterior pole that is completely atrophic with only a small functioning macular area and an extremely narrow retinal vasculature. Some patients also developed pigmentation with peripheral crystals.
