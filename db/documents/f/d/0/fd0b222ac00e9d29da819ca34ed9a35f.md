The differential diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection includes other conditions causing coronary artery dissection or mimicking it on a coronary angiogram.

**Iatrogenic Catheter-induced Coronary Artery Dissection**

The coronary guidewires used during PCI or intravascular imaging may inadvertently cause intimal injury leading to intramural hematoma formation and the creation of a false lumen. The angiographic picture resembles spontaneous coronary artery dissection, but there is a history of antecedent coronary intervention.

**Atherosclerotic Coronary Artery Disease**

Type 3 SCAD presents as focal or tubular stenosis that resembles atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. This appears as a filling defect distal to the stenosis in coronary angiogram and should be confirmed with intravascular imaging like IVUS or OCT.

**Coronary Artery Thrombosis**

Coronary thrombosis due to plaque rupture, smoking, thrombophilia, or cardiac source of embolism may mimic type 3 SCAD. Thrombus appears hazy in coronary angiogram with filling defects and smooth meniscus at the occlusion site. Intravascular imaging is instrumental in diagnosis.

**Coronary Calcification**

Coronary atherosclerosis appears as areas of discrete calcifications in CCTA. Noncalcified plaques in CCTA may mimic an intramural hematoma. Diagnosis is by intracoronary imaging.
