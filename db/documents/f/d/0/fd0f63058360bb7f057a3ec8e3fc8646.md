The diagnosis and management of pneumatosis intestinalis require interprofessional team collaboration. Diagnosis begins with imaging interpreted by radiologists. Once a diagnosis is made, a treatment plan is devised by a team of providers, including hospitalists, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, gastroenterologists, and surgeons, depending on the clinical severity of the patient. Medical intensive care unit admission is also warranted if the patient becomes clinically unstable, requiring vasopressors and closer monitoring. A surgical consult is necessary for patients meeting the criteria of septic shock, presence of portal venous gas, acute abdomen, or perforation. However, patients who are septic at the time of diagnosis have increased mortality.
