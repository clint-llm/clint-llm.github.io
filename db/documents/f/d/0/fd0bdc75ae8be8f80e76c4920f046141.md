Any testing does not currently monitor nitroglycerin levels as its half-life is approximately 2 to 3 minutes, and the drug undergoes rapid metabolism in the liver. When administered intravenously in the emergency room or ICU, its effects are often very closely monitored for real-time blood pressure monitoring. This vigilance is necessary to maximize the effectiveness and provide rapid feedback on the patient's condition. When administered sublingually, nitroglycerin's effectiveness is typically measured via the resolution of symptoms; angina, hypertension, and congestive heart failure. In the event of overdose, monitoring vital signs may be necessary to monitor the hemodynamic effects of nitroglycerin. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation is recommended.

Nitroglycerin is a protein-bound drug, and it undergoes hepatic metabolism. Therefore it has numerous drug interactions. Before prescribing, providers should determine if the patient is taking any medications that may interact with nitroglycerin. Common interactions include alteplase, heparin, tricyclic antidepressants, and other anticholinergic drugs. Alcohol intake should also be limited. Nitroglycerin is pregnancy category C, and its use requires caution in breastfeeding mothers. It is not currently known whether nitroglycerin is excreted in breast milk.
