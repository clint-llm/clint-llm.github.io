The greatest risk of surgical treatment involves disruption of the external sphincter resulting in fecal incontinence. The preoperative evaluation must include the patientâ€™s preoperative continence status and, if possible, documentation of sphincter tone prior to anesthesia and paralysis. The anatomic classification of the fistula, as well as the surgical approach, are the most important factors when determining the risk of post-operative fecal incontinence. For this reason, the surgical approach depends on the anatomic considerations to reduce the risk of incontinence. Complex fistulas, including suprasphincteric and extrasphincteric fistulas, have a higher risk of incontinence due to sphincter involvement.

Recurrence of fistula-in-ano is higher in obese patients, smokers, and those with a history of anal surgery. Anatomical factors including multiple fistula tracts, high transphincteric fistula, inability to determine an internal opening, seton placement, and horseshoe abscesses were also associated with a higher rate of recurrence.
