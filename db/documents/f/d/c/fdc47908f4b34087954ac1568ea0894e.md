Providing quality care for patient’s with Korsakoff syndrome requires a large number of resources and coordination between a variety of healthcare professionals. In the early stages, triage nurses, visiting nurses and EMS providers can help identify patients who may be presenting for other complaints or would otherwise not seek care. Effective screening tools in the emergency department or outpatient clinic could help identify alcohol abuse, the major risk factor for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. In the acute setting, identifying the disease (preferably early on or before the onset of Korsakoff Syndrome) and treating requires interprofessional work between the emergency physicians, neurologists, and dieticians to rule out other causes and treat. Long term care of these patients may require the attention of neuropsychiatrists, neurologists, psychiatrists, dieticians, social workers, and the patient’s primary care provider to ensure sobriety, continued nutrition, and memory rehabilitation.
