The care of patients with tuberous sclerosis is best managed with an interprofessional team approach. Primary care providers, particularly community and acute pediatricians providing annual examinations for patients with tuberous sclerosis should focus on the common manifestations and complications of tuberous sclerosis and know which questions should be asked on each visit. Physical examination should also be comprehensive, and consultations to other specialties are done when necessary.
