Family clinicians and pediatricians will generally be the first clinicians to come in contact with children who have a lipid disorder. The primary care clinician can manage many of these conditions without referrals. However, other rare conditions would benefit from evaluation and management under a lipidologist.

If a lipidologist is not accessible, then a pediatric cardiologist or pediatric endocrinologist with a particular interestÂ in lipid disorders would also be suitable. In some cases, adult cardiologists or endocrinologists may be given exemption permission to treat pediatric patients with lipid disorders. Aside from medical consultations, referral to a dietitian is often universally beneficial for children with lipid disorders.
