History and physical examination in patients with OUD vary depending on duration and intensity of use. Patients who sporadically misuse small doses of opioids may have a completely normal physical exam and no clear historical findings. Patients with chronic oral opioid use may have sedation if actively using the drug, along with miosis and hyperactive response to pain.

Patients who are dependent on intravenous heroin may have the many effects of injection drug abuse:

- Bacteremia

- Endocarditis

- Track marks and scarring in common sites of injection

- Skin-popping scars

- Poor dentition

- Lack of IV access sites

- Abscess or cellulitis

- Stigmata of hepatitis

- Cirrhosis, and many other findings.

History may be limited as patients are often not forthcoming when discussing substance abuse patterns. However, it is crucial to obtain detailed history in patients in whom OUD or its sequelae are suspected.
