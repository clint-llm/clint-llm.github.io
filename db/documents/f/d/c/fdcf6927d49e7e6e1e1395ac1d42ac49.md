Mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms (MCPN) are rare tumors of the pancreas, which mostly occur in middle-aged females. The survival rate for this disease is far better than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. The tumors frequently are confused with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms differ from mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms because ovarian stroma is observed in the latter.
