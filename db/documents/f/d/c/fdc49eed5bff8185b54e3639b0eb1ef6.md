Laboratory medicine service in a hospital is concerned with relevant investigations of patientâ€™s presenting complaints and sometimes with detection and potential prevention of disease. It involves a systematic approach of clinical advice or request for a particular investigation, analysis of the collected specimen, interpretation of results, and appropriate reporting in a timely fashion. These functions are carried out in a specified and designated area inside the hospital premises called the pathology laboratory, supervised by a physician who specializes in pathology. A pathologist is responsible for issuing a report and providing guidance to physician colleagues on the best utilization of laboratory services. The size and facilities of a laboratory depend upon the population of the community it serves, bed strength of the hospital, and diversity of cases seen in the hospital.
