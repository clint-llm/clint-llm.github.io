The palatoglossus muscle, also known as musculus palatoglossus, is among the four extrinsic muscles of the tongue and the paired muscles of the soft palate. The right and left palatoglossus muscles create ridges in the lateral pharyngeal wall, referred to as the palatoglossal arches (anterior faucial pillars). These pillars separate the oral cavity and the oropharynx — the muscle functions as an antagonist to the levator veli palatini muscle.
