Punctal stenosis can occur due to a wide range of causes. The most common cause of punctal stenosis is chronic blepharitis (45%). Other causes include unknown etiology (21%), ectropion (23%), and drug-related (5%).

The use of topical antiglaucoma medication such as timolol, latanoprost, betaxolol, dipivefrin hydrochloride, echothiophate iodide, and pilocarpine pose a risk for the development of punctal stenosis as well.
