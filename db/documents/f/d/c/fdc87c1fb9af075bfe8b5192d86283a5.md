Although onset is at birth or very shortly afterward, many patients with posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) are visually asymptomatic and the condition is not diagnosed for years to decades later. If lesions at Descemet membrane areÂ consistent with PPCD but there is no evidence of corneal edema, elevated intraocular pressure or irregularities of the angle or iris, then it is appropriate to recommend periodic comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation by a primary eyecare practitioner.

If glaucoma is diagnosed and topical therapy is prescribed the ophthalmic care provider team must educate regarding the importance of rigid compliance using medications as well as the proper use and storage of topical medications. This can be performed by the physician, nurse, ophthalmic assistant or pharmacy staff.

If intraocular pressure is not adequately controlled or there is evidence of glaucomatous progression, then it is appropriate to seek glaucoma specialist evaluation to determine suitability for altered topical therapy, new laser therapy or glaucoma filtration surgery.

If corneal edema is present and responsive to topical hyperosmotic agents it is appropriate to provide education regarding the proper use of topical medications. This can be performed by the physician, nurse, ophthalmic assistant or pharmacy staff. Similarly, the proper placement, removal, and care for bandage contact lenses should be trained by a qualified physician, nurse or ophthalmic assistant.

If recalcitrant corneal edema obscures vision or leads to painful bullae or corneal erosions, then a corneal specialist should evaluate the suitability for a form of keratoplasty.

Patients must be aware that they too have the right and responsibility to communicate any perceived changes or difficulties to their healthcare team.
