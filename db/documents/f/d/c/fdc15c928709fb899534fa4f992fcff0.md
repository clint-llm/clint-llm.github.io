Anal abscesses are a common condition and may result in anal fistula in up to 40% of cases, and the majority of anorectal fistulas are cryptoglandular in origin. Prevention of anal abscesses will likely, therefore, decrease anal fistula. Patient education on a healthy diet and exercise to prevent diabetes is an essential component of this. Since anorectal sexually transmitted infections may cause anorectal fistula education about safe sex practices, particularly in the homosexual community, it is a necessary aspect of preventing these diseases.

Educating the general public on the warning signs of Crohn disease, such as weight loss, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, or extra-intestinal manifestations, may aid early diagnosis of Crohn disease and, hopefully, with proper medical management, decrease the suffering of this patient population with anal fistula. Expanding access to healthcare is essential to prevent complications of anal abscess as untreated abscesses are more likely to result in a fistula. Educating patients on proper hygiene and skincare of the perianal region, such as showering daily and washing when soiled, may also help prevent this morbid condition.
