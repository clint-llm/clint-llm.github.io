In addition to the treatments described below, all dental emergencies benefit from basic oral hygiene measures to prevent the overgrowth of the natural oral cavity flora and prevent opportunistic infections.

**Traumatic Dental Emergencies**

**Tooth Fractures**

Enamel infractions generally do not require treatment. However, if the microcrack starts progressing in size, etching and sealing with bonding resin is recommended to prevent discoloration and bacterial infection.

If the tooth fragment is available, enamel fractures can be managed by reattaching the enamel fragment. If the tooth fragment is unavailable, the tooth edges can either be smoothed if the lesion is small or restored with resin composite if the lesion is more extensive. It is recommended that patients follow up in 2 and 12 months so the dentist can assess the integrity of the restoration clinically and with radiographs.

The focus of initial treatment for enamel-dentin fractures is to protect the exposed dentin. Calcium hydroxide liners are commonly available in urgent care clinics, emergency departments, and primary care offices. These healthcare providers should apply this temporizing treatment to prevent infection and protect the tooth’s viability.

The focus of initial treatment for enamel-dentin fractures with pulp exposure is to protect the pulp. Calcium hydroxide is one method to accomplish this and is often available in non-dentistry practice settings, and when initiated early, it can help prevent bacterial infection.

Pulp capping works best in immature teeth with open apices in which the pulp was considered to be healthy before the trauma. Indications for pulp capping include pulp exposure of a small diameter (less than 1.5 mm) that has only been exposed for a short amount of time, thus minimizing the risk of bacterial invasion.

Partial pulpotomy is indicated when either the duration of pulp exposure has been extensive, or the diameter of exposure exceeds 1.5 mm. In these cases, a partial pulpotomy can be performed, which ultimately allows the tooth to remain vital for an extended amount of time. However, the tooth will eventually require root canal therapy and a subsequent restoration procedure.

Crown-root fractures are initially managed by identifying the extent of the fracture and exposing its margins. If still attached, the tooth fragment is removed by the dentist to evaluate for pulp involvement. If the pulp is not involved, the fragment can be reattached, or the exposed dentin can be covered with resin composite or glass ionomer.

If the pulp is exposed or the fracture extends far past the cementoenamel junction, definitive management becomes more complex and interdisciplinary, involving the dentist, endodontist, and oral surgeon.

The initial focus for treating root fractures involves ensuring appropriate crown fragment placement on physical exams and radiography. The crown will often be mobile and thus will need to be stabilized with a dental splint for weeks to months, with cervically located fractures requiring a longer duration of immobilization when compared to apically located fractures.

It is recommended that patients who have undergone treatment for enamel-dentin fractures with pulp exposure, crown-root fractures, and root fractures should have regular follow up with their dentist or oral surgeon at two months, three months, six months, and 12 months duration.

**Tooth Luxations**

Tooth subluxations generally do not require treatment; however, a passive and flexible splint can be utilized to stabilize the tooth if there is marked mobility or tenderness when the patient bites down. If a splint is applied, it is recommended that the patient follow up with a dentist after two weeks to remove the splint. If a splint is not utilized, the patient should be reevaluated by a dentist clinically and radiographically after two weeks, 12 weeks, six months, and 12 months.

Extrusive luxations require that the tooth be gently pushed back into its alveolar socket under local anesthesia. The tooth needs to be stabilized with a passive and flexible splint for two to four weeks. The patient is recommended to follow up with a dentist after two weeks, four weeks, eight weeks, 12 weeks, six months, and 12 months. The patient will require endodontic treatment if subsequent radiographs or pulp sensitivity testing indicate pulp necrosis.

Intrusive luxations in teeth with incomplete root formation may spontaneously re-erupt without intervention. If spontaneous repositioning does not occur within four weeks, orthodontic repositioning becomes necessary. Teeth with complete root formation may spontaneously re-erupt if there is less than 3 mm of intrusion; however surgical repositioning should be initiated if there is no spontaneous eruption within eight weeks. If there is more than 3 mm of intrusion, the tooth should be repositioned surgically. For four weeks, the tooth should be stabilized in a passive and flexible splint. While teeth with incomplete root formation are unlikely to develop pulp necrosis, mature teeth almost always experience pulp necrosis, and the health of the pulp should be monitored at subsequent follow-up appointments. Root canal therapy should be considered early.

Lateral luxations require that the tooth be gently relocated back to this alveolar socket under local anesthesia. This can be difficult in certain situations when the root is “locked” into position by a concomitant alveolar fracture and may require the dentist to first disengage the tooth apex before repositioning it. The tooth will require stabilization with a passive and flexible splint for at least four weeks, perhaps longer if there are concomitant alveolar fractures. Two weeks after the injury, the pulp should be evaluated for pulp necrosis with sensitivity testing. Teeth with incomplete root formation may experience spontaneous revascularization. However, teeth with complete root formation will likely experience pulp necrosis, and root canal therapy is often indicated. The patient is recommended to follow up with a dentist after two weeks, four weeks, eight weeks, 12 weeks, six months, and 12 months.

**Tooth Avulsions**

If possible, replantation is the preferred treatment modality.

Before replantation, it is recommended that the avulsed tooth be stored in an isotonic solution to prevent apoptosis of the periodontal ligament. Such acceptable solutions include milk, normal saline, or the patient’s saliva. Cell death of the periodontal ligament is inevitable and can only be temporarily delayed with a proper storage medium.

The tooth should be replanted in the correct anatomic alignment with firm pressure into the alveolar socket. It should then be stabilized with a passive and flexible splint.

**Infectious Dental Emergencies**

Dental infections should be promptly identified and treated as soon as possible to avoid contiguous or hematogenous spread and subsequent life-threatening complications.

As with any infection, complete removal of the source is always ideal but not always practical in the case of dental infections. Tooth extraction is an option for certain patients but is usually the last resort. Often other techniques are recommended so patients can maintain their dentition.

Pulpitis requires treatment aimed at pulp protection and insertion of restorative materials if considered reversible. Irreversible pulpitis and pulp necrosis are treated by either root canal therapy or tooth extraction.

Periapical abscesses and periodontal abscesses require incision and drainage if a tooth extraction is not the desired option. Oral antibiotics should also be given if there is surrounding cellulitis or the patient is immunocompromised. Antibiotics should include gram-negative bacteria and anaerobic coverage. Common antibiotic choices include amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, or clindamycin.

Treatment for periodontitis is almost universally non-surgical. Mitigation of risk factors such as tobacco cessation and diabetes control is essential for treatment. Professional dental cleanings can be a first step to reversing the disease as it removes the gross buildup of plaque and calculus. Proper home oral hygiene and antimicrobial mouth rinses such as chlorhexidine gluconate are recommended. Rarely systemic oral antibiotics are needed. In extreme cases, surgery to remove the infected gums can be done to maintain dentition.

Treatment for necrotizing periodontal disease is dependent on the severity of the disease. However, the initial management generally involves mechanical debridement of necrotic tissue under local anesthesia, removal of any pseudomembrane, and aggressive oral hygiene incorporating an antiseptic mouthwash. In addition to these local measures, oral antibiotics are indicated if systemic symptoms (such as fever or lymphadenopathy) are present. Mitigating risk factors such as tobacco use and/or any underlying immunologic condition is also important in managing necrotizing periodontal disease.

Treatment for pericoronitis includes non-surgical and surgical treatment options. Aggressive oral hygiene with irrigation of the pericoronal space is recommended to dislodge any impacted debris.

**Post-procedural Dental Emergencies**

**Post-procedural Bleeding**

The initial treatment of post-extraction and postoperative bleeding is to augment hemostasis while maintaining airway patency. The interventions available for post-extraction and postoperative bleeding can be categorized into local or systemic treatments.

Local interventions consist of both surgical and non-surgical hemostatic measures. Basic non-surgical hemostatic measures include manual pressure or pressure packing with gauze. However, an array of therapies can be applied locally to either absorb or halt bleeding. These therapies typically involve hemostatic pharmacologic or biologic agents that are impregnated into packing material, sponge, gel foam, adhesive, or solution, which are applied locally to the site of bleeding. These therapies have been well documented in the literature and are considered effective in common practice.

- Adhesive agents: cyanoacrylate glue, fibrin glue, and chlorhexidine bio-adhesive gel

- Absorbable agents: oxidized cellulose, gel foam, collagen fleeces or sponges, and gelatin sponge

- Biologic agents: topical thrombin, green tea extract, Haemocoagulase, and Ankaferd Blood Stopper

- Sealant agents: acrylic or surgical splints and calcium alginate

- Pharmacotherapies: local antifibrinolytic solutions (i.e., tranexamic acid mouthwash) and gauze soaked in tranexamic acid

Surgical measures can also be used in isolation or in combination with non-surgical methods to obtain hemostasis. This involves the oral surgeon cauterizing or suturing the site of bleeding. The exact surgical approach will depend on the source of the bleeding.

Systemic interventions should be considered when a patient has a known congenital coagulopathy, a systemic illness that makes them prone to bleeding or using anticoagulant therapies. The role of local hemostatic agents can be limited in these scenarios as they do not address the underlying etiology of the bleeding. Systemic interventions include the administration of:

- Blood products such as fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, or packed red blood cells (pRBCs) in the setting of warfarin use or cirrhosis

- Specific factor replacement therapy in the setting of congenital coagulopathies

- Anti-hemophilic factor A or anti-hemophilic factor B for Hemophilia A and B, respectively

- Von Willebrand factor concentrate on the setting of Von Willebrand disease

- Prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) in the setting of cirrhosis, warfarin use, or direct oral anticoagulant use

- Epsilon amino-d-caproic acid in the setting of enoxaparin use

- Desmopressin in the setting of damaged platelets

- Tranexamic acid

Systemic agents should be used cautiously in the anticoagulated patient as there is a risk of thrombotic events with anticoagulation reversal. The risks and benefits of anticoagulation reversal must be considered on an individual basis, discussed with the patient, and using the clinician’s best judgment.

The general approach to the patient experiencing postoperative bleeding should be for the dentist or oral surgeon to first clearly visualize the source of bleeding by removing all saliva and residual clot from the surgical site with suction. Manual pressure should be applied firmly with a damp gauze for at least 5 minutes. If the bleeding has not resolved with this measure, local anesthesia should be administered so the patient can be treated with more aggressive therapy. The oral surgeon or dentist should then utilize an appropriate local non-surgical hemostatic agent with or without sutures. If the bleeding is not controlled with these methods, systemic treatment should be considered in conjunction with a hematologist.

If the bleeding is brisk and hemostasis is not obtained such that the patient cannot adequately tolerate their secretions, or if there is an expanding hematoma, the healthcare provider should have a low threshold to secure the patient’s airway in conjunction with definitive hemostasis.

**Alveolar Osteitis**

Not surprisingly, as the pathophysiology of alveolar osteitis is not well understood, there is no consensus on protocols for its treatment or management. Despite this, treatment approaches tend to focus on symptomatic relief rather than addressing any underlying disease process.

While it does little to relieve pain, initial management involves intra-alveolar irrigation, which assists in removing clot debris and necrotic tissue. Local analgesia can be obtained with topical anesthetics gels, which can be applied after irrigation. Local analgesia can also be augmented with oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Although they may impair healing and cause local inflammatory reactions, there does appear to be a role for the temporary application of medicated dressings (impregnated with analgesic and/or antibacterial compounds) post-operatively. Additionally, chlorhexidine oral rinses after exodontia have been shown to help prevent alveolar osteitis, while its use as a primary treatment is still being investigated.

More recently, low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has been suggested to be an effective alternative treatment with comparable results to other known treatments with the benefit of being both safe and inexpensive.
