Many theories have been proposed regarding the origin of metastatic cells involve in the spread of the tumor.

- Epithelial to mesenchyme transition (EMT): Epithelial stem cells transform into mesenchymal cells by the step-wise accumulation of gene mutations. These mesenchymal cells form metastatic neoplastic cells. They lack cell-cell adhesion, are dysmorphic in shape, and have the capacity to spread to distant organs.

- Stem cell origin of metastatic tumors: Tissue stem cells are considered to be the origin of metastatic cancers due to similarities in gene expression and biological characteristics. This theory is supported by the fact that both cancer cells and stem cells have high telomerase activity that links to the use of high anaerobic energy (fermentation) for metabolism. Both cells survive and grow on the same anaerobic energy source.

- Macrophage facilitation of metastasis: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), especially those in the stroma, facilitate tumor development, progression, and the eventual seeding of metastasis. Researchers do not consider them neoplastic. However, many human metastatic tumors also contain neoplastic cells with macrophage properties. It is not possible to differentiate neoplastic macrophages from non-neoplastic ones.

- Myeloid cell origin of metastasis: Metastatic cancer cells arise directly from myeloid origin cells or hybrid cells formed by fusion between macrophages and non-metastatic stem cells. Myeloid cells have mesenchymal properties promoting metastasis and are the precursors of macrophages that promote the metastatic cascade. An alternative explanation of this theory is that macrophages fuse with epithelial cells within the inflamed microenvironment, thus manifesting properties of both the epithelial cell and the macrophage in the fusion hybrids. These fusion hybrids then form the metastatic cells possessing epithelial and macrophage properties.

Metastatic spread is also under the control of a combined play of genetic or epigenetic factors.

Smoking exposure correlates to the activation of the ubiquitin- chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) pathway, high tissue levels of E-selectin, activation of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF_B) signaling in pneumocytes, increased chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) expression and macrophage infiltration in the lung microenvironment. This chemokine secretion by alveolar cells recruit neutrophils, which in turn synthesize arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase (ALOX5)-dependent leukotriene. Leukotriene promotes survival and proliferation of leukotriene B4-expressing metastatic clones. Neutrophils also secrete cathepsin G and elastases, which further facilitate metastatic growth.

The fate of the cells that reach the distant focus will be either ended up in apoptosis, survival, or dormancy. Distant metastatic cells dormancy period varies, e.g., short ( few weeks) in lung cancer, long ( years/decades) in ER + breast ca, prostate cancer.

Also, recent discoveries show that metastatic focus gets prepared before the arrival of the metastatic cells themselves.

Before the actual arrival of metastatic cells, a microenvironment gets created by interaction among:

- Cell-intrinsic determinants, e.g., chemokines, cytokines

- Adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules, for example, tenascin and periostin.

- Tumor-derived exosomes

**Intrinsic Cell Determinants**

Metastatic cells utilize cell-autonomous traits that facilitate homing and survival by altering the following genes:

- Gene of Rous sarcoma virus (SRC) tyrosine kinase signaling

- P38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) kinase signaling pathways

By those alterations, metastatic acquire a stem-cell-like genetic profile.

Various stromal cells, including fibroblasts, neutrophils, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1)-positive bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells play a crucial role in niche preparation.

It is worth noting that the metastatic niche can be stimulating or suppressive.

- In the prostate cancer metastasis model, mitogen-activated protein kinases 7 (MKK7) suppress the formation of lung metastases by inhibiting the ability of disseminated cells to colonize the distant tissue.

- Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6) proteins produced by osteoblasts can directly inhibit disseminated tumor cell proliferation. Single cells enter arrest immediately upon infiltrating the lung and are therefore unable to form micrometastatic lesions.

Adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules: To establish metastatic mass, circulating neoplastic cells need to adhere to endothelial walls and extravasate to reach the lung parenchyma.

- VCAM 1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) has been reported in secondary lung masses from breast cancer. It expresses on endothelial cells. Upon activation, it initiates trans-endothelial migration by binding specific integrins, which in turn induce the activation of GTPase Ras-related c3 botulinum toxin substrate. Activation of GTPases causes modification of the cytoskeleton network and facilitates cell migration.

- SSeCKS (scaffold protein src-suppressed C-kinase substrate complex) dysregulation occurs in lung metastases from melanoma. It is known to control metastasis-associated protein kinase C (PKC) and SRC (Gene of Rous sarcoma virus) signaling through direct scaffolding activity.

- Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) acts as the mediator of lung metastases. It recruits macrophages, which, in turn, secrete epidermal growth factor, followed by CSF1 secretion by tumor cells and further recruitment of macrophages. The presence of macrophages indicates highly invasive potential, which enhances the formation of neoplastic lung colonies.

- Successful metastasis formation requires early remodeling of the lung ECM in the metastatic niche. Tumor-related tenascin C  is a protein that is deemed essential in the early phases of metastatic onset. There is a direct correlation between the expression of the extracellular matrix glycoprotein tenascin C and breast cancer metastasis to the lung. Tenascin C enhances the Wingless-related integration site (WNT) and NOTCH signaling pathway, which plays a critical role in improving the viability of cancer cells.

- Periostin is an ECM protein involved in metastatic lung development. Mice without periostin gene presence develop a reduced number of lung metastasis in the setting of mammary tumors.

**Tumor-derived Exosomes**

Exosomes are small membrane-bound vesicles of endocytic origin that can transport molecules, including proteins, DNA, RNA, and non-coding RNA, from one cell to another. They can disseminate via the bloodstream and can induce changes in distant sites to establish a favorable environment for the cancer cells.

In the cancer setting, tumor-derived exosomes have demonstrated being taken up by organ-specific cells to prepare the pre-metastatic niche. e.g., mice injected when with tumor cells that have a predilection to metastasize to the lung interact with the lung epithelial lining cells.

Lung-tropic exosomes expressing the integrin preferentially interact with S100A4-positive fibroblasts and surfactant protein-positive pneumocytes. RNAs in tumor exosomes can activate toll-like receptor 3 in alveolar type II cells. It induces chemokine secretion and neutrophil recruitment in the lung. These steps are critical for initiating the formation of a metastatic niche in the lung.

Exosomes coded proteins help to establish a favorable environment at distant sites.

These proteins include tenascin, bone morphogenic protein inhibitor. Tenascin C increases the concentration of growth factors such as EGF, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factors (FGF), which promotes the growth of metastatic masses.

Bone morphogenic protein inhibitor (COCO) regulates the cycle of tumor dormancy and activity in the lungs and promotes metastasis of breast cancer cells to the lungs but not to the bone or brain.

Colorectal cancer cells that metastasize have specific markers CD110 and CDCP1, which adhere to the epithelium of the liver and lung, encouraging organ-specific metastasis.

**Genetic Factors Predisposing Cancers to Metastasis**

Analysis of metastatic adenocarcinoma nodules of different origin (lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, uterus, ovary) and comparison with the expression profiles of 64 primary adenocarcinomas revealed the same spectrum, though the primaries were different and researchers obtained samples from different individuals. This comparison allowed the identification of an expression pattern of 128 genes that best differentiate primary and metastatic adenocarcinomas.

Similarly, the gene expression profile analysis of a subset of primary breast tumors generated a unique 14-gene signature expression(WDR6, CDYL, ATP6V0A4, CHAD, IDUA, MYL5, PREP, RTN4IP1, BTG2, TPRG1, ABHD14A, KIF18A, S100PBP, and BEND3). With the help of this, clinicians can predict the risk of the development of visceral organ metastases.

Inhibitor of cell differentiation 1 (ID1), matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1), chemokine CXC motif ligand 1 (CXCL1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase (PTGS2), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1), and epiregulin (EREG) are the genes that promote lung metastasis in animal models carrying breast carcinoma. ID1 promotes the formation of lung metastases by itself in animal models and expresses significantly in samples from breast cancer patients with lung metastases. Its activation promotes breast cancer dissemination by modulating S100A9 expression.

Analysis of human cancer samples has shown that the comparison of lung and non-lung metastases from breast cancer identified 21 differentially expressed genes, which mainly encode adhesion molecules, resulting in the cell to cell interactions and thus facilitating lung colonization. Among them are integrins (ITGB8), cadherins (CDH3), desmosomal proteins (DSC2), and focal adhesion molecules (FERMT1).

**Epithelial to Mesenchyme Transition**

Concerning the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a step required for metastatic dissemination, the miR-200 family has been reported as a critical mediator in regulating E-cadherin expression. Many miRNAs control the angiogenic process. The mir-143-3p expression decreases in a metastatic osteosarcoma cell line (143B) and primary osteosarcoma tissues with lung metastasis. Increased expression of miR-27a,  decreased miR-95-3p, miR-195 expression, and miR-133 dysfunction are associated with cancers that develop lung metastasis.

In colorectal cancer, the overexpression of miR-885-5p resulted in significantly induced cell migration, invasion, and stress fiber formation in vitro. It was associated with the development of liver and lung metastases in in-vivo models.

**Mechanical Interaction Between the Metastatic Cell and Distant Site**

Mechanical interaction between tumor mass and surrounding parenchymal structures also play a role in metastasis. Per one study, tumors should be at least 1.5 times stiffer than their surrounding healthy tissue to exert a sufficient compressive force to overcome confinement by the host tissue. Such compression forces progressively shrink the surrounding interstitial space hence concentrating tumor-promoting growth factors and cytokines. These stresses may play a role in tumor angiogenesis, either through direct upregulation of VEGF secretion or indirectly due to induced tissue hypoxia.

The ECM near a tumor is typically rather dense due to increased matrix deposition, collagen crosslinking through enzymes such as lysyl oxidase, and an intense fibrotic response known as desmoplasia. It promotes cell invasion and migration by elevated tissue stiffness. This stiffening routinely gets exploited clinically to detect tumors through physical palpation and by commonly used imaging techniques.

The occurrence of ECM stiffening around metastatic lesions at similar levels as that of the primary tumor is a feature in pancreatic cancer. ECM stiffening activates mechano-transduction signaling pathways, which drive force-dependent integrin clustering and subsequent increased focal adhesion assembly and disruption of adherens junctions by cytoskeletal contractility.

Circulating metastatic cells also can withstand the metabolic challenges in the future site of colonization. In lung metastasis, tumor cells upregulate PPAR gamma coactivator-1-alpha (PGC-1alpha ) expression. PGC-1 alpha stimulates the expression of antioxidant genes, which can help lung metastases cope with increased oxidative and chemical toxicity. Another antioxidant mechanism found to play a role in lung metastasis is the upregulation of peroxiredoxins. Peroxiredoxins are small antioxidant proteins that shuttle electrons to reduce hydrogen peroxide, hence decreasing reactive oxygen species.

Besides that, the pericyte of lung epithelial cells plays a role in anchoring metastatic cells. A study in which researchers deleted the pericyte gene KCL4 in mice resulted in fewer premetastatic niches and less lung metastasis.
