Memantine is an antagonist of the NMDA (N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)-receptor subtype of glutamate receptor. It is used to slow the neurotoxicity thought to be involved in Alzheimer disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.Memantine blocks the NMDA-receptor subtype of glutamate receptors preventing over-activation of glutamine receptors while allowing the normal activity. Its blocking effects antagonize an overactive glutaminergic system in the central nervous system (CNS) which is thought to be involved in the neurotoxicity seen in Alzheimer disease. This activity reviews the uses, indications, side effects and contraindications of memantine and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with dementia.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of memantine.
- Describe the adverse effects of memantine.
- Recall the contraindications of memantine.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the safe use of memantine and improve patient outcomes.
