Nipah virus (NiV) is an RNA virus that belongs to the family of Paramyxoviridae and Henipavirus genus, which also consists of Hendra virus (HeV) as well as the Cedar virus. NiV was first identified in Malaysia in 1998 and has since caused numerous outbreaks in and around South and Southeast Asia. NiV is a WHO priority pathogen due to its propensity for causing outbreaks.

NiV is a zoonotic disease, with the reservoir of NiV being the Pteropus fruit bat from which spillover likely happened to pigs and subsequently humans. NiV is considered a Biological safety level 4 (BSL 4) pathogen due to the unavailability of effective treatment or vaccination against it.
