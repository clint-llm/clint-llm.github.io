Scleroderma is a rare disease. Its prevalence varies with ethnicity, gender, and geographic area. In France, the estimated incidence of systemic sclerosis was 158.3 per million in 2002, mostly limited to the cutaneous forms. The prevalence of the disease in Detroit was 242 cases per million adults with an annual incidence of 19.3 new cases per year per million adults over the period 1989-91. As in numerous other autoimmune diseases, women are at higher risk than men (ratio 4.6:1). Systemic scleroderma can occur at any age; however, it is rare in children and the elderly. The disease is most prevalent in individuals aged 30-50 years.

Localized scleroderma affects mostly women with an incidence of 3 cases per 100,000 individuals/year. Plaque form (also called morphea) is more prevalent in adults while linear scleroderma affects mostly children.
