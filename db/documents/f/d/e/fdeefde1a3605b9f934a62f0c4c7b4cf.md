The cause of myocarditis is most commonly viral, and most prominently linked with enteroviruses like Coxsackie B,

The non-viral causes of myocarditis can broadly classify into infectious, immune-mediated, and toxic.

Infectious causes include:

- Bacterial pathogens like group A Streptococci, which can cause rheumatic myocarditis, characterized by Aschoff nodules on histopathology; Corynebacterium diphtheriae associated with toxin-mediated myocarditis; Mycobacterium, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Other bacteria which may lead to myocarditis include Staphylococcus, Gonococcus, Meningococcus, Pneumococcus, Hemophilus influenzae, and Brucella. There are also a few reported cases of myocarditis associated with non-typhi Salmonella species like S. enteritidis and S. berta, and rarely with typhoid fever

- Spirochetes like Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme myocarditis and may correlate with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities; Leptospira, associated with Weil's disease; and rarely Treponema pallidum, causing gummatous myocarditis in tertiary syphilis

- Protozoa like Trypanosoma cruzi, causing Chagas' disease, which could present as acute myocarditis or chronic cardiomyopathy; Toxoplasma gondii, associated with post-cardiac transplant myocarditis and rejection; Entameba histolytica, which often also causes acute pericarditis; Leishmania; and Naegleria fowleri

- Parasitic causes like cysticercosis because of Tenia solium; Trichinella-associated eosinophilic myocarditis, larva migrans, and Echinococcus granulosus

- Fungi like Aspergillus, Candida, Actinomyces, Blastomyces, Coccidioides, Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, Mucormycosis, Nocardia, and Sporothrix

- Rickettsial diseases like Q fever, caused by Coxiella burnetii; or Rocky Mountain spotted fever, due to R. rickettsii

Immune-mediated myocarditis could be due to:

- Autoimmune causes, like giant cell myocarditis and infection-negative lymphocytic myocarditis; or associated with immunologic syndromes like systemic lupus erythematosus, Churg-Strauss syndrome, Wegener’s granulomatosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kawasaki disease, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, myasthenia gravis, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, thyrotoxicosis or sarcoidosis

- Hypersensitivity reaction to drugs like sulfonamides, penicillin, cephalosporins, furosemide, thiazide, digoxin, dobutamine, tricyclic antidepressants, isoniazid, tetracycline, phenytoin, phenylbutazone, and methyldopa; or serum sickness-like reaction to toxoids or vaccines

- Allograft rejection after a cardiac transplant

Toxic myocarditis may be caused by:

- Drugs, like amphetamines, cocaine, ethanol, chemotherapeutic agents (anthracyclines, trastuzumab, cyclophosphamide), antipsychotic medications (clozapine, lithium) and interleukin-2

- Heavy metal toxicity with copper, iron, lead

- Metabolic causes like pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, hemochromatosis, or beriberi
