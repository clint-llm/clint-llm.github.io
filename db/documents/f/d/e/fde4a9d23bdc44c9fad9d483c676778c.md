Parkinsonism comprises a clinical syndrome that presents with a varying degree of rigidity, and a variety of symptoms that include bradykinesia, tremor, and unstable posture, all of which can cause a profound gait impairment. James Parkinson was the author first to describe a case series of six patients in the essay that was titled, “An Essay on the Shaking Palsy" in 1817.

Parkinsonism is characteristically present in Parkinson's disease (PD). These symptoms can also result from other neurodegenerative disorders, as well as specific brain lesions, head trauma, medications, metabolic conditions, and toxin exposure.
