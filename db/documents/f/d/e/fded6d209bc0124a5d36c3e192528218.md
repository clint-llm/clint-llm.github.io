Patients with selective IgA deficiency should wear a medical alert bracelet stating their condition and that they are at an increased risk of an allergic reaction to transfused blood products. This applies to patients with or without anti-IgA antibodies. Although there is no specific guideline on how often IgA deficient patients should be tested for anti-IgA antibodies, one study did find that 11.8% of patients with IgA levels < 0.05 mg/dL had formed antibodies upon a 16 to 21-year follow-up.
