**Classifying Asthma Severity and Control**

Asthma is classified based on two domains: severity and control. Each has two components: impairment and risk.

Severity is assigned when the patient is first seen and before treatment. The number of subgroups within impairment will increase as the reference age group increases.

Impairment

Assessment of impairment includes the following for each age group:

Ages 0 to 4:

- Daytime symptoms, nighttime awakenings, use of short-acting B agonists and activity

Ages 5 to 11:

- Daytime symptoms, nighttime awakenings, use of short-acting B agonists and activity

- Lung function measures

Ages 12 and above:

- Daytime symptoms, nighttime awakenings, use of short-acting B agonists and activity

- Lung function measures

- Quality of life measures

- 
              
- Three quality of life questionnaires appear within the EPR - 3 documents: The Asthma Therapy Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ), the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), and the Asthma Control Test (ACT).

Control assessment is necessary on all subsequent visits. Asthma severity falls into one of four groups:  intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent. Asthma control can classify as well-controlled, not well-controlled, and very poorly controlled. Increased morbidity, cost, and mortality are associated with poor asthma control.

Risk refers to the number of systemic steroid bursts in the 0 to 4-year group, while in those 5 to 11 years and over 12 years through adulthood, adverse effects from medication and deterioration in lung function are also included.

**The goals of therapy require development in partnership with patients**.

Treatment goals include reduced or absent asthma symptoms, normal or near-normal lung function, normal activities, and sleep and minor or absent side effects from medications.

Treatment of asthma requires a multi-pronged approach - considering comorbid conditions such as allergic rhinitis, gastroesophageal reflux, etc. Patients should receive knowledge and skills training to facilitate their participation in asthma self-management.

**Monitoring Asthma**

At each visit, consider

- Asthma signs and symptoms

- Lung function

- Quality of life assessment

- Exacerbation history

- Pharmacotherapy – medications and side effects

- Patient-provider communication and patient satisfaction
