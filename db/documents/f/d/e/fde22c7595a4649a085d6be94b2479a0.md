The Bowditch effect has mainly been studied in the myocardium and is considered “a major contributor to the intrinsic myocardial reserve and responsible for 40% of the increase in cardiac output” secondary to the frequency-strength relationship.

A similar staircase response also has implications in skeletal muscle, attributed to a progressive increase in muscle tension during an early phase of repetitive tension by increasing calcium concentrations in the myocyte's’ sarcoplasm. However, augmented sensitivity of myofilaments to calcium by myosin light chain phosphorylation leads to further enhanced phosphorylation, which happens when the calcium released from SR binds to calmodulin, activating the myosin light chain kinase. With each subsequent stimulation of skeletal muscle fiber, phosphorylation of the myosin light chain persists as the phosphatase activity is slower than the kinase.
