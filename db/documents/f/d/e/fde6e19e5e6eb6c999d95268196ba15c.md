Bone cysts are often asymptomatic and found incidentally on radiographs. Sometimes, they may present with pain due to repeated hemorrhages or pathological fracture. Bone cysts are inclusive of but not limited to the simple/unicameral bone cyst (SBC/UBC) and aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC).

A simple bone cyst is a solitary fluid-filled; a benignÂ bone cyst which may be unicameral (single chamber) or septated. It can involve any bone of extremities, the most common site being proximal humerus and proximal femur.

An aneurysmal bone cyst is a rare, locally destructive, blood-filled, benign cystic bone tumor. It involves the metaphysis of long bones in children and young adults.
