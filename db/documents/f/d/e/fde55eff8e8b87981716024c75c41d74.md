Breast cancer surgery with breast reconstruction is a potentially long and stressful surgery that can lead to complications and nerve damage manifested by acute postoperative pain, including phantom breast pain, intercostobrachial neuralgia, or even neuropathic pain.

In some breast clinic centers, chronic pain symptoms at the operative site and ipsilateral upper limb may persist for up to 1 year after breast surgery or longer.

The factors influencing this transition to chronicity are linked to the intensity of the acute postoperative pain, the type of operation performed with total lymph node dissection, the involvement of regional lymph nodes, and the per- and postoperative radiotherapy.

In the literature, several authors have demonstrated the impact and positive effect of locoregional anesthesia in breast surgery on the incidence of chronic pain, which decreases morbidity and, therefore, reduces the length of hospital stay due to a decrease in opioid needs.

Postoperative morbidity after cancer surgery can delay oncological treatment, adversely affecting cancer recurrence.

Randomized controlled trials (Wang L et al.) have shown a significant reduction in NK and T cell activity in patients who received locoregional anesthesia combined with general anesthesia.
