To accurately stage the disease, it must be searched for metastatic or occult disease. Useful tools are serum tumor markers, CT scan, or MRI to screen for nodal pathway and visceral metastases. Metastases from mature and immature teratoma have been reported at initial presentation in 13% to 60% of cases.

The AJCC's 8th edition of a TNM staging system is the international gold standard. It uses T (tumor primary), N (node involvement), M (metastases) for pathological and radiological staging, plus S (serum markers), which is a unique parameter of testicular cancer.

**T**- Primary Tumor

pTx

Primary tumor cannot be assessed

pT0

No evidence of primary tumor

pTis

Intratubular germ cell neoplasia (carcinoma in situ)+

pT1

Tumor limited to testis and epididymis without vascular/lymphatic invasion, invasion of tunica albuginea, not tunica vaginalis

pT2

Tumor limited to testis and epididymis with vascular/lymphatic invasion or involvement of tunica vaginalis

pT3

Tumor invades spermatic cord with or without vascular/lymphatic invasion

pT4

Tumor invades scrotum with or without vascular/lymphatic invasion
