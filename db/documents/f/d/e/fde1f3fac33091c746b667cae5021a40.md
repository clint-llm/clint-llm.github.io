The most lethal complication arising from the use of a DLT is airway rupture from traumatic placement.

Other complications include hypoxemia due to tube malposition, displacement, tube occlusion from secretions or blood. Inadvertent entrapment of the DLT in suture lines during procedures have also been reported.

Malposition of the DLT can lead to life-threatening consequences. Ventilation can be severely impaired, leading to hypoxia, gas trapping, tension pneumothorax, cross-contamination of lung contents, and interference with surgical procedures.

Factors predisposing to airway injury include:

- Inserting a DLT too forcefully

- Placing undersized DLTs

- Overdistention of the endobronchial cuff

- Reposition of the DLT with the cuffs inflated

- Preexisting pathology of the airway including tumors
