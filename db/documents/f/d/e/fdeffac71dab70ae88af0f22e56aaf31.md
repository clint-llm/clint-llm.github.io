# Definition/Introduction

Bacterial meningitis affects more than 1 million people per year globally and ranks as one of the top ten most deadly infectious diseases.

Brudzinski's sign is characterized by reflexive flexion of the knees and hips following passive neck flexion. To elicit this sign, the examiner places one hand on the patient's chest and the other hand behind the patient's neck. The examiner then passively flexes the neck forward and assesses whether the knees and hips flex. Upon passive neck flexion, a positive test results when the patient flexes his knees and hips.

# Issues of Concern

While Brudzinski's sign is commonly used to assess for meningitis, it has limitations in the diagnosis of meningitis. Brudzinski's sign has low sensitivity but high specificity for detecting meningitis. For Brudzinski's sign, estimates are that the diagnostic sensitivity is between 2 and 43%, and the specificity for meningitis is between 80 to 100%.

An additional limitation of Brudzinski's sign is the fact the sign is not useful in certain populations. In very young (less than 2 months), immunocompromised and elderly patients, Brudzinski's sign may be absent despite severe disease.

# Clinical Significance

Meningitis is a devastating disease that without early treatment can cause lifelong neurologic sequelae or even death. Clinical signs and symptoms to aid in the early diagnosis and initiation of therapy are extremely important to help reduce long-term complications. While Brudzinski's sign may not definitively rule out meningitis, it can increase clinical suspicion of meningitis and trigger early treatment. Given its high specificity for the disease, there is a high likelihood of meningitis if the Brudzinski's sign is present.  A positive result can aid providers who have a clinical suspicion of meningitis by allowing them to initiate antibiotics early. However, it is important to note that the absence of the sign does not rule out meningitis due to its poor sensitivity.
