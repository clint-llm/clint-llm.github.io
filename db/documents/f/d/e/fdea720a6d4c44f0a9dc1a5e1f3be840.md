Pulsus bisferiens is a single central pulse wave with two peaks separated by a distinct mid-systolic dip. An early component percussion wave results from rapid left ventricular ejection. A late component tidal wave represents a reflected wave from the periphery due to an artery's recoil effect. It is best felt in the peripheral arteries, such as the brachial and radial arteries. Most commonly seen in mixed aortic disease with severe aortic regurgitation and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). This can remain silent in the milder form of cardiac disease, pronounced by the Valsalva maneuver and amyl nitrate. This activity helps evaluate and treat cardiac conditions associated with pulsus bisferiens. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of pulsus bisferiens.
- Outline the severity assessment of the cardiac conditions associated with pulsus bisferiens.
- Summarize the management of patients with severe aortic valve disease and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
- Explain the importance of the interprofessional team in the management and outcome of patients with pulsus bisferiens.
