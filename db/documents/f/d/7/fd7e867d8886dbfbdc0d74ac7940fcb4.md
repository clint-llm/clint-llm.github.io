Many dermatological conditionsÂ are associated with or present with nail abnormalities. Clinical examination of the nails may be insufficient to provide a straightforward diagnosis, often requiring additional evaluation for a precise diagnosis. Although biopsy-based histopathological evaluation remains the gold standard for a myriad of cutaneous diagnoses, biopsies of the nail unit can be challenging for providers and uncomfortable for patients. Dermoscopy of the nails (i.e., onychoscopy) as routine evaluation has aided the diagnosis of many lesions and limited the need for further procedural intervention.

Onychoscopy can be used to evaluate the nail matrix and nail bed, structures customarily obscured by the nail plate. The initial use of onychoscopy was often for evaluating nail pigmented lesions (i.e., melanonychia), yet the scope has expanded to include nonpigmented lesions and tumors.

Onychoscopy can be performed as non-polarized dermoscopy, polarized non-contact (dry) dermoscopy, or polarized contact (wet) dermoscopy.
