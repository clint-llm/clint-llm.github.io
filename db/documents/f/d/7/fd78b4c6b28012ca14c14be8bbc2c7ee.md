Balint syndrome is suspected clinically based on the symptoms described above in the clinical features section. Lack of proper understanding of this syndrome often results in misdiagnosis of the presentation. No specific diagnostic criteria exist for imaging studies of the brain. Computed tomogram (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain usually reveal atrophic changes in parietal and occipital lobes.Â However, Balint syndrome imaging studies may depict findings consistent with underlying etiology. Subsequent diagnostic studies are performed to delineate the etiology once there is clinical suspicion for Balint syndrome, and imaging findings are consistent with clinical presentation. In some cases, single positron emission computed tomography scan may be needed to evaluate for cerebral hypoperfusion of the involved areas.
