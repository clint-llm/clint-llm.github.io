The main function of the pelvis is to allow for the transfer of weight from the torso to the lower body and proper ambulation.

The primary extensor of the pelvis is the gluteus maximus. It is supplied with blood by the superior and inferior gluteal artery and innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve.

TheÂ final main muscle group of the pelvis is the hip abductors, those of which are the gluteus minimus and medius along with the tensor fascia lata. All of these muscles are supplied with blood mostly by the superior gluteal artery along with some branches from the inferior gluteal artery.
