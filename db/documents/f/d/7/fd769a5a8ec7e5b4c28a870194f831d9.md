The pathophysiology of hypertension is complicated and not fully understood. At baseline, perfusion of cardiac, renal, and brain tissue is tightly autoregulated by varying mechanisms. With chronic hypertension, the cerebral perfusion curve shifts to the right, accommodating a higher baseline blood pressure while maintaining a steady cerebral perfusion pressure.

The rapidity of blood pressure elevation is presumed to be an important factor in causing end-organ damage. Severe acute elevations are likely related to an influx of humoral vasoconstrictors, resulting in elevated systemic vascular resistance. The increased vascular wall stress and associated endothelial injury result in increased vascular permeability, activation of coagulation factors and platelets, and fibrin deposition. Continued endothelial damage and fibrinoid necrosis result in ischemia, which then leads to the further release of vasoactive mediators and further injury.

Pressure natriuresis and the activation of the renin-angiotensin system result in volume depletion, often leading to further vasoconstriction. Systemic vasoconstriction causes impaired blood flow to vital organs, leading to end-organ injury, which, although unrelated to hypertensive urgency, is the hallmark of hypertensive crisis.
