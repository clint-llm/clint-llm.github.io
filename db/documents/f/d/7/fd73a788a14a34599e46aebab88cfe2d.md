- In an individual with a new, clinical diagnosis of clubbing and joint or bone pain, attention must be directed to chest imaging, even if asymptomatic.

- In an individual with a known chronic disease like rheumatic heart disease or AV graft, new signs of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy should trigger a search for an emergent complication like an infection of the graft or endocarditis.

- Bilaterally symmetrical involvement of the appendicular skeleton characterizes hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, as opposed to metastatic disease, which is usually unilateral, focal, and irregular, involving both the axial and appendicular skeleton.

- Unlike inflammatory arthritis, joint effusion is pauci- or non-inflammatory and involves the adjoining bone.

- Definitive clinical management is aimed at treating the underlying cause, although symptom control can be achieved reasonably well with NSAIDs, bisphosphonates, or octreotide.
