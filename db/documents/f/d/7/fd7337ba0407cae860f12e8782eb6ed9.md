While there are no strict indications, non-invasive lower extremity studies are typically ordered for evaluation of arterial disease who present with the following:

- Claudication: Effort followed by discomfort that improves with rest; pain that improves when legs are held to gravity, i.e., off the side of the bed

- Ischemic rest pain

- Nonhealing lower extremity wound

For patients with advanced diabetes, symptoms can include:

- Leg fatigue

- Recurrent stenosis/occlusion of tibial vessels

- Peripheral neuropathy

Of note, if a patient has undergone previous lower extremity bypass surgery or arterial stenting, there is limited utility for ABI's with PVR and toe pressures, as artificial grafts and stents have different compressibility in comparison to native vasculature. These patients are typically evaluated initially with arterial Duplex or computed tomography angiography to image their bypass graft/intravascular stent to assess patency and velocities.

Continuous-wave Doppler can also be used in a variety of settings to assess blood flow. During pregnancy, continuous-wave doppler is used to assess fetal heart rate prenatally as well as during labor.

Ultrasound is frequently used to evaluate heart and valve function, as well as assess vascular access in patients on dialysis and renal artery stenosis.

For the critically ill, continuous-wave doppler can be used in a transcranial fashion as an adjunct to document brain deterioration.
