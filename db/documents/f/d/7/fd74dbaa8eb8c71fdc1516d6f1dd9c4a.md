Risk Stratification Scores

To help physicians manage patients with a TIA, several risk stratification scores have been developed. One widely used score is the ABCD2 score:

A= Age more than 60 years / Score 1

B= SBP> 140 or DBP> 90 / Score 1

C= Clinical features:

Speech impairment without weakness / Score 1

Weakness with/without speech impairment / Score 2

D= Duration

More than 60 mins / Score 2

Between 10-59 mins / Score 1

D= Diabetes / Score 1

Patients with an ABCD2 score of 6-7 have an 8% risk of stroke within 48 hours

Patients with an ABCD2 score of less than 4 have a 1% risk of stroke within 48 hours

Even though scales are important in the evaluation of TIA, be aware that patients with critical carotid artery stenosis may some times present with a very low ABCD2 score.
