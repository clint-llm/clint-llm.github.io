The diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is via the presence of clinical symptom that is pruritus in the third trimester with elevated maternal total serum bile acids and excluding other diagnoses, which can cause similar symptoms and lab abnormalities. Raised liver function tests in the absence of pruritus require investigation for another cause.Â  The most sensitive and specific marker for ICP is the total serum bile acid (91 and 93 percent) using a cut-off value of 10 micromol/L.

Kremer et al., in their animal model study, found that autotaxin, the serum enzyme converting lysophosphatidylcholine into LPA, which is pruritogenic, was markedly increased in patients with ICP versus pregnant controls and cholestatic patients with versus without pruritus.
