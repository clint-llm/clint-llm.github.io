The epidemiology of thrombosis varies depending on whether it is venous vs. arterial, provoked vs. unprovoked, and the first episode vs. subsequent episode. In venous thromboembolism (VTE), which includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), the annual incidence is 1 per 100000 in children, 1 per 10000 in reproductive age, 1 per 1000 in later middle age, and 1 per 100 in elderly.
