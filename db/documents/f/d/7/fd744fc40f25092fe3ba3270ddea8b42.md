**Pediatric Obesity and Medication Dosing**

Data from 2011 to 2014 showed the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents 2 to 19-year-old of age to be 17% in the United States and continues to increase.

Due to the alterations in medication loading doses, obese pediatric patients may be at risk for either medication toxicity or sub-therapeutic medication therapy. Studies have described the use of ideal body weight for the calculation of hydrophilic medication loading dose, total body weight for lipophilic medications loading dose, and adjusted body weight for a partially lipophilic medication loading dose.
