Optic neuritis (ON) is one manifestation of central nervous system inflammation with resultant demyelination. Recurrent episodes of ON indicate a propensity toward developing more generalized diseases

Optic neuritis is the initial inflammatory event in 15-20% of patients with MS

Optic neuritis related vision loss in patients with NMOSD and MOG is usually more severe and results in larger scotomas. Since both disorders affect the optic nerve, chiasm, and optic tracts, bilateral vision loss is common. Damage often extends longitudinally into the spinal cord in both conditions.

NMOSD is characterized by frequent ON attacks that cause severe bilateral vision loss with little chance of functional improvement. Spinal cord lesions that extend beyond three vertebral segments are typical of NMOSD and debilitating transverse myelitis often limits physical activities. Detection of AQP4-IgG antibodies confirms the diagnosis of NMOSD.

MOG is also associated with significant bilateral visual impairment but marked ON-related papillitis occurs less frequently than with NMOSD. Marked enhancement of the optic nerve, nerve sheath, and periocular tissues is evidentÂ with neural imaging studies. Compared to those with NMOSD, patients with MOG are more likely to experience improved visual function after ON and they may have lower spinal cord involvement. Males and females are affected with equal frequencies
