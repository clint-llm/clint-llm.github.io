Lower back pain can stem from a multitude of causes and create a significant cost on the patient, and healthcare, as a whole. These can include but are not limited to spinal fracture, tumor, herniated disk, stenosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and somatic dysfunctions.

Once a diagnosis has been reached, the care for the patient needs to continue. Analgesics, antibiotics, or other medications may be necessary. A pharmacist will be necessary to dispense and confirm that the patient is on the correct medications. If bracing or other assistive devices are needed, a nurse will be the one to educate the patient on the proper way to use the equipment. A physical and or occupational therapist may be necessary to help the patient recover mobility, strength, and coordination.

Besides working to regain physical function, chronic back pain can have a negative psychological effect on the patient.
