Complications of treatment of facet joint pain with medial branch blocks or radiofrequency ablation are rare. Patients may have a transient increase in their pain following radiofrequency ablations and medial branch blocks due to the heat denervation and needle entry. Post-dural headaches, transient numbness or weakness, bleeding, infection, and increased post-procedural pain are all potential but rare complications of facet interventions.
