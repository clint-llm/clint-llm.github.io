Abdominal based flaps have become the workhorses for autologous breast reconstruction. Options include free bipedicled TRAM, MS-TRAM, DIEP, and SIEA flaps. The decision regarding which approach to use should be individualized to the patientâ€™s needs and history. It is crucial to educate the patient regarding the potential complications and provide them with a complete list of options available. To achieve the best overall outcome, it is essential to have a multidisciplinary approach consisting of the plastic surgeon, breast surgeon, oncologist, anesthesiologist, pharmacists, and nursing staff.

Intraoperative and postoperative care is of critical importance to ensure the success of the flap. Communication with operative staff and anesthesia will create the most favorable environment. Nursing staff in the postoperative period are often the first to notice any flap issues, and they require appropriate training in regards to what to look for and how to recognize potential flap compromise. A cohesive, multidisciplinary team is necessary to prevent complications and to diagnose and effectively treat any flap issues promptly.
