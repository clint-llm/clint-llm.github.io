The pattern of elevation of liver enzymes is consistent with a hepatocellular injury with marked alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations (greater than 10 times the upper limit of normal) and minimal alkaline phosphatase (ALP) elevations. The injury is mostly self-limited except for 10% of the cases where it can progress to acute liver failure with clinical manifestations of coagulopathy, ascites, edema, and encephalopathy.
