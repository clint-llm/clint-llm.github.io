Cryotherapy is performed by many healthcare professionals. However, all providers need to know the potential complications and warn the patient.  There are a number of expected outcomes following cryosurgery that patient should be advised about before the surgery. Cryosurgery produces tissue damage that heals by secondary intention, which can take longer to heal than an excision, especially if it is performed on the leg. Healing time directly correlates with the depth of freezing, so lesions that have had a deeper freeze will take longer to heal. Pain is an expected outcome of this procedure. Pain will last less than a minute. Treated sites will progress from erythema, edema, and vesiculation over the course of several days. Depending on the depth of the treatment an exudate may be noted up to 2 weeks after treatment. Mummification or eschar formation may follow the exudative phase and can be gently debrided if necessary. Other complications include dyspigmentation, alopecia, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, depressed scars, and tissue distortion (nail dystrophy or notching of cartilage).

Overall, cryotherapy is a slow treatment that requires multiple sessions over a few months. While the treatment does work, compliance with treatment is low because of pain. Generally, an interprofessional team of nurses and clinicians will produce the best results and provide consistent patient follow up. [Level 5]
