There are a variety of important implications when considering the surgical, anesthetic, and clinical significance of the larynx. Clinical evaluation of the larynx in any patient with voice, swallowing, or airway symptoms is vital to determine functional or anatomic anomalies that may be a cause. Understanding the anatomy and function of the organ and its impact on the complex orchestration of swallowing and voicing will better equip the clinician to educate and treat patients with disorders of the upper aerodigestive tract.
