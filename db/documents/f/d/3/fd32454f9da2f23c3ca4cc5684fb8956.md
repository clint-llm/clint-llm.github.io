There have been multiple studies comparing CAS with CEA in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The risk of myocardial ischemia appears to be higher with CEA, while the risk of a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) appears to be higher with CAS. Restenosis rates appear to be similar between CEA and CAS after two years. CAS, as a procedure, appears to have worse outcomes in patients aged 70 years and over and in patients with a high burden of white-matter lesions on brain imaging. Therefore, patient selection is important for CAS. The transcarotid approach of CAS potentially reduces the risk of embolization in case of a hostile aortic arch. More experience with this technique is being gained in ongoing trials. Hospitalization and long-term costs of CAS and CEA appear similar.
