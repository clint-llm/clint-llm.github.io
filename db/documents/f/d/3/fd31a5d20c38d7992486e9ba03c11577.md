Local anesthesia is generally administered by dentists, dental hygienists, or dental therapists with the support of a dental assistant. The dental assistant ensures that the necessary equipment and materials are available. The operator or assistant can assemble the dental syringe. The operator administers the local anesthesia and appropriately disposes of the sharp instruments. The dental assistant is then responsible for sterilizing or disposing of the remaining equipment. Either the operator or the assistant can give the patient post-operative instructions concerning the local anesthesia following the procedure.
