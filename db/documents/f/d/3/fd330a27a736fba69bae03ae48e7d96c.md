Brown syndrome can be challenging to diagnose, with multiple etiologies possible in the acquired category. A thorough history and clinical evaluation are, therefore, essential.Â Observation and conservative management in primary congenital Brown syndrome can allow most patients time for spontaneous improvement to occur. Surgery can be reserved for patients who show no improvement; however, multiple surgeries are often required. Inflammatory causes of Brown syndrome could respond to local corticosteroid injection. Traumatic Brown syndrome is difficult to manage, often with disappointing results.
