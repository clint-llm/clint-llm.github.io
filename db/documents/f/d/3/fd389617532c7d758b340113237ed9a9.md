Trainees currently have reduced training opportunities in the operating room (OR) due to service provision demands and arduous on-calls. Simulation shortens the learning curve in surgical training and improves knowledge retention and transference of skills through DP.

Although improved access may increase the uptake of simulation resources for DP- this strategy is based on the premise that the rota will permit simulation training time. Another key area of improvement is the provision of structured simulation training time within the working week. Finally, feedback is essential in supporting behavioral change and preventing internalization of erroneous skills and behaviors; therefore, feedback should be provided by trainers and sought by trainees promptly.
