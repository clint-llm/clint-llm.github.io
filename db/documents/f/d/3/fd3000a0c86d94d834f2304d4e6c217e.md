The management of norovirus is best done with an interprofessionalÂ team of healthcare professionals that includes a nurse, an infectious disease expert, pediatrician, epidemiologist, and a pharmacist. Once a diagnosis of norovirus has been made, the key is to prevent further spread of the infection. The nurse is in the prime position to educate the patient and the family about the importance of hand washing. The outpatient nurse must educate food handlers on strict hand hygiene and keep updated on hygienic codes. The food storage environment must be regularly cleaned and disinfected. all individuals who have been diagnosed with norovirus should self-quarantine themselves. Infected children should remain at home until the symptoms subside.

**Outcomes**

In the healthy population, norovirus is a self-limited infection with an excellent outcome. Most people recover within 5-10 days. However, the condition still results in thousands of ER visits and hospital admissions each year because of complications like dehydration and electrolyte deficiencies. The two populations with the worst outcomes are neonates and those who are immunocompromised. The key to preventing the morbidity is to ensure adequate hydration and correction of any electrolyte deficiency.
