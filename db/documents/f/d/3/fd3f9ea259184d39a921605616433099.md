The diagnosis and management of inguinal hernia is best done with an interprofessional team. The majority of patients with an inguinal hernia first present to the nurse practitioner and primary care provider. These clinicians should be able to work up a patient with an inguinal hernia and make the appropriate referral to a surgeon. Unlike the past, the accumulating evidence indicates that asymptomatic patients with small hernias can be observed. Thus, the primary care providers including the nurse should advocate weight loss, a healthy diet and a change in lifestyle to avoid progression of the hernia.

All patients with an inguinal hernia should be referred to a general surgeon because there is always the potential for incarceration or strangulation. Today, there are many surgical techniques available to repair inguinal hernias. While most patients do have a good outcome, complications like nerve injury, bowel injury, recurrence, and wound infections are not uncommon. Prior to surgery, all men older than 50 and have risk factors for cardiac and lung disease should be seen by the anesthesiologist nurse to ensure that they are fit for surgery. Some of these patients may need cardiology and pulmonary clearance.

After surgery, recovery is often prolonged and most patients have moderate to severe pain, depending on how the surgery was performed.Â  The pharmacist should advise the patient on how to manage the pain, discontinuation of smoking, and gradually becoming active after the pain has subsided.

Irrespective of how the surgery is done, a small percentage of patients do develop recurrence.
