The performance of auscultation and interpretation of lung sounds is most familiar with a traditional stethoscope; however, newer, electronic stethoscopes may increase detection of abnormal lung sounds. Computerized interpretation of lung sounds is also actively under investigation; this could take the form of digitized analysis of sounds or of a visual display of the acoustic information that a clinician could interpret.  Computerized augmentation may prove to be more accurate in the future.
