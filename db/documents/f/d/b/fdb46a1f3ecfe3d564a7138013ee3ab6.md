There are multiple laboratory abnormalitiesÂ seen in the setting of adrenal crisis. The classic laboratory features may reveal:

- Hyponatremia (due to mineralocorticoid deficiency)

- Hyperkalemia (due to mineralocorticoid deficiency)

- Hypoglycemia (due to decreased gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis)

- Low or low normal ACTH level in secondary adrenal insufficiency and high or high normal ACTH level in primary adrenal insufficiency

- Hypercalcemia (due to hypovolemia)

- Prerenal failure with elevated creatinine level

- Low aldosterone (due to mineralocorticoid deficiency in primary adrenal insufficiency)

- High renin is expected in primary adrenal insufficiency as there is an increase in urinary sodium loss and decreases in the blood volume

- Normocytic normochromic anemia, lymphocytosis, and eosinophilia (due to glucocorticoid deficiency)

- Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels may be increased (due to coexisting hypothyroidism in autoimmune polyglandular endocrinopathy or due to the lack of the inhibitory effect of cortisol on TSH production)

**Evaluation of Cortisol Levels**

Treatment of adrenal crisis should never be delayed to obtain blood work for assessment of etiology. If no delay in treatment is expected, then blood work can be quickly obtained prior to the administration of hydrocortisone. Blood work to be obtained: ACTH, cortisol, aldosterone, renin, basic metabolic profile including glucose.

- High ACTH with low cortisol and aldosterone levels will be seen in primary adrenal insufficiency

- Low ACTH and low cortisol levels will be seen in secondary or tertiary adrenal insufficiency

In case there is doubt regarding the diagnosis of adrenal crisis with borderline cortisol levels, an ACTH stimulation test should not be done in the acute setting until the patient's condition has stabilized
