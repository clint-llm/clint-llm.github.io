In the United States, the majority of venomous snakes bites occur from snakes in the Crotalinae family. Data specific to cottonmouth envenomation is limited. The North American Snakebite Registry (NASBR) and Toxicology Investigator’s Consortium’s (ToxIC) between January 2013 and December 2017 reported 31 cottonmouth envenomations. Most of these bites occurred on the lower extremities, and swelling was the most common symptom reported. Nineteen percent of patients developed gastrointestinal symptoms, and 19% developed coagulopathy. Eighty-four percent of envenomations received antivenom, and 61% of patients required admission for greater than 24 hours.
