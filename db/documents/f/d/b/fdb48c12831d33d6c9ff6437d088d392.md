**Complications of trigger point injections include the following**

- Pain

- Bleeding

- Infection

- Allergic reaction to the anesthetic agent

- Systemic anesthetic toxicity

- Formation of a hematoma

- Vascular injury

- Although rare, there are some reports of complications such as pneumothorax, especially when treating trigger points in the cervicothoracic region using a needling technique

- For trigger points along the thoracic cage, recommend use of a pincer grip to bring the affected tissue away from the intercostal spaces. A tangential rather than vertical vector may also decrease risk of entering the pleura

- Severe hypokalemic paralysis has also been reported in one case report

- Adverse effects connected to dry-needling technique include soreness after treatment, vasovagal and syncopal response, hemorrhages at the site of treatment, and acute cervical epidural hematoma
