- Carnitine supplementation and prevention of hypoglycemia are the mainstays of PCD treatment. Catabolic states such as fasting should be avoided. Other inevitable catabolic states, such as intercurrent infections, should be recognized early. Additionally, metabolic decompensation should be aggressively managed with intravenous dextrose. Patients with PCD should continue L-carnitine therapy. Hypoglycemic episodes and sudden cardiac death have been reported in patients with poor compliance with L-carnitine therapy.

- Patient and caregiver education on proper treatment, especially medication compliance is essential for the management of PCD. Untreated patients can have profound effects that may progress to death. Adult females who are planning to get pregnant should be informed that pregnancy is a metabolically challenging situation that needs to be evaluated and managed with both a metabolic and genetic specialist before conception.

- In patients with SCD, it is crucial to prevent hypoglycemic episodes by frequent feeding and avoid fasting during day time and continuous corn starch supply during the night.
