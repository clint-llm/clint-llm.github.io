Distal humerus fractures in the adult population represent about 2% of all fractures and 33% of all humerus fractures. They typically present in a bimodal distribution as either younger males or elderly females. They are usually the result of high-energy trauma in the young population and low-energy falls in the more elderly patient. These fractures can be very challenging to manage, as they often can involve an articular as well as a diaphyseal component. As with all intra-articular fractures, anatomic reduction of the articular surface is paramount in keeping the chances of developing post-traumatic arthritis as low as possible. This often requires surgical intervention to achieve, with specific rehabilitation protocols set in place for successful recovery and to avoid certain complications, such as elbow stiffness, heterotopic ossification, and nerve injury.
