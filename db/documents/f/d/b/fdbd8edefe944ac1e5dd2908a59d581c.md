Most patients with BE will exhibit symptoms of GERD, such as the retrosternal burning sensation known as heartburn, especially after eating. Acid regurgitation is another likely symptom. Other possible symptoms, though less common, include dysphagia and a globus sensation where patients feel as if there is a “lump” or some obstruction in their throat when there is none. Rarely, patients may be asymptomatic. Commonly, patients will have a chronic history of GERD symptoms with no other specific physical examination findings.
