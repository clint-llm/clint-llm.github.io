Orf disease, being a zoonotic infection, follows a relatively benign course. It usually resolves spontaneously in 6 to 12 weeks and carries a very low rate of human to human spread. A more aggressive course with increased size (giant orf) may appear in immunocompromised hosts, and especially those with cell-mediated immune deficiency. Recurrence is possible but produces a progressively blunted infection.
