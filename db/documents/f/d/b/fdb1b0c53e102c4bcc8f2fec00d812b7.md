Angina affects 10 million people in the United States. Providers must be able to differentiate between stable angina and other causes of chest pain to care for their patients appropriately. The recognition and appropriate management of stable angina is critical in reducing the risks of future myocardial infarction. This activity highlights the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of stable angina by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify and appropriately diagnose stable angina.
- Understand pathophysiology behind myocardial ischemia to assist in treatment options. 
- Identify and manage risk factors to decrease mortality risk with coronary heart disease. 
- Stress the importance of utilizing an interdisciplinary approach with individuals who have stable angina and multiple comorbidities in order to optimize outcomes.
