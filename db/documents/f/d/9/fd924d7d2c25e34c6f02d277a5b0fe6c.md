The etiology for vitamin K deficiency can be grouped as idiopathic or secondary. The etiology of idiopathic causes is not known, but a few of the secondary causes have been explored. Vitamin K deficiency leads to decreased activity of clotting factors, resulting in hemorrhagic disease of the newborn. Adults can synthesize vitamin K in the large intestine through the gut bacteria, but neonates have reduced stores of vitamin K due to insufficient placental transfer and a sterile gut that fails to synthesize the necessary levels of vitamin K. Additionally, breast milk is deficient in vitamin K and poor hepatic storage.

Vitamin K deficiency can manifest in babies born to mothers on anti-tubercular drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin), antiepileptics (phenytoin, barbiturates, and carbamazepine), broad-spectrum antibiotics (cephalosporins), or vitamin K antagonists such as warfarin.
