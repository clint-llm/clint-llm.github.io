A normal hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is a prerequisite for normal testicular descent.

Birth weight appears to be the main risk factor for undescended testes, followed by family history.

The absence of an appendix testis has been linked to abdominal and cryptorchid testes, especially if located proximal to the external ring. The exact role of the appendix testis in testicular descent is unclear.

In full-term infants, the cause of cryptorchidism often cannot be determined, making this a common but sporadic, idiopathic congenital defect. It is thought that genetics, combined with maternal and environmental factors, may disrupt hormones and physical changes that influence testicular development and descent.

Possible underlying risk factors include:

- Premature infants born before the descent of the testicles

- Small for gestational age infants

- Smaller placental weight

- Chemicals endocrine disruptors may interfere with normal fetal hormone balance

- Maternal obesity

- Maternal diabetes

- Maternal exposure to DES

- Pesticides

- Alcohol consumption during pregnancy (5 or more drinks per week, 3x increase)

- Cigarette smoking

- Family history

- Cosmetics use

- Exposure to phthalate (DEHP)

- Ibuprofen

- Preeclampsia (The more severe the preeclampsia, the greater the risk of cryptorchidism)

- Congenital malformation syndromes - Down syndrome, Prader–Willi syndrome, and Noonan syndrome

- Persistent Mullerian duct syndrome

- In vitro fertilization
