Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is also known as IgG4-related systemic disease, hyper-IgG4 disease, IgG4-related autoimmune disease, IgG4-associated disease, IgG4-related sclerosing disease, and IgG4-syndrome. It is a multi-organ, fibro-inflammatory condition with tumefactive lesions of unknown etiology and characteristic histopathological features. Virtually any organ can be involved, but the most commonly involved organs are the pancreas, kidneys, orbital adnexal structures, salivary glands, and retroperitoneum. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of immunoglobulin G4-related disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care delivery for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD). 
- Describe the presentation of a patient with Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD).
- Summarize the treatment options for immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD). 
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD).
