The human eye is filled with two fluid-like substances, termed humors, which maintain the ocular pressure and shape of the eyeball. Aqueous humor is a water-like fluid that lies in front of the lens. Vitreous humor is a gel-like substance that lies behind the lens and in front of the retina. Aqueous humor is a low-viscosity fluid continuously being secreted and reabsorbed, with the balance between these two processes regulating the volume and pressure of the intraocular fluid.
