When an adult patient presents with hyperglycemia with or without symptoms and is controlled without the need for insulin in the first six months, LADA should be considered. A positive antibody to one of the islet antigens is the hallmark of LADA. Worldwide, the most prevalent islet autoantibody utilized is GADA. Others include IA-2A, which is associated increasingly with the LADA2 phenotype, insulin antibodies, and zinc transporter isoform 8 (ZnT8) antibody that occurs with varying frequencies. LADA has more of the other DAAs apart from GADA and IA2A than T1DM.

Patients with LADA have residual C-peptide levels typically between those with T1DM and T2DM. In T1DM, C-peptide is absent at first clinical presentation, and in T2DM, it is often increased. The levels of C-peptide correlate inversely with GADA titers. A stimulated C-peptide has a greater predictive value than a fasting level. Among the methods studied, the glucagon stimulation test (GST) and Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT) have been validated and found to be useful. The former is shorter in duration but associated with transient nausea while the latter takes a long time but is free of side effects. Measurement of C-peptide is preferable to the measurement of insulin as it has a longer half-life, not subjected to the first-pass hepatic metabolism, and a steady-state clearance from the circulation. Insulin undergoes first-pass hepatic metabolism, has variable clearance, a much shorter half-life, and exogenously administered insulin can confound results. C-peptide is cost-effective when used as the initial test to distinguish LADA from T2DM but has to be later confirmed with antibody testing. In LADA, the MMTT has also been utilized for choosing the treatment modality and predicting the time to transition to managing with insulin.

HLA typing is not routinely utilized in the evaluation of LADA.

All other routine investigations for other DM patients should be employed in LADA at recommended intervals and as dictated by the clinical situation.

Tests:

- Fasting glucose

- Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C)

- Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG)

- Measures of glycemic variability [best done by continuous glucose monitoring(CGM)]

- Lipid profile

- Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)

- Serum creatinine

- Urinalysis for albumin excretion (spot and 24-hour specimen with simultaneous creatinine)

- Tests for peripheral neuropathy (Semmes Weinstein monofilament test)

- Retinopathy screening by an ophthalmologist.

If diabetes-related complications set in, other tests may be indicated.
