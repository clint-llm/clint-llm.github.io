The primary nerves in the upper extremity originate from the brachial plexus. These nerves are:

- Axillary nerve

- Musculocutaneous nerve

- Radial nerve

- Ulnar nerve

- Median nerve

These nerves will go on and further branch into smaller branches. The smaller branches will innervate the skin and muscles. TheÂ deoxygenated blood created by the nerves will get drained via the nearby veins.

The autonomic nervous system innervates the veins. The autonomic nervous system subdivides into the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system can augment the diameter of the vein's lumen by vasoconstriction or the withdrawal of vasoconstriction's stimulus. The sympathetic nervous system function by the release of catecholamines in the form of epinephrine and norepinephrine. These catecholamines will act on the alpha and beta receptors to augment the diameters of the veins. The parasympathetic nervous system augments the venous diameter indirectly. The mechanism of vasodilation of the veins is by acetylcholine triggering the production of nitric oxide. The nitric oxide will diffuse into the smooth muscle that lines the veins and results in relaxation of the smooth muscle. The relaxation of the smooth muscle will cause vasodilation.
