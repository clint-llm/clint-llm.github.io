Once uremia has been diagnosed, patient education is vital. An interprofessional team approach is necessary to avoid the high morbidity and mortality of uremia. The healthcare provider, nephrologist, transplant surgeon, and pharmacist should work in an interprofessional team to educate the patient on dialysis, renal transplant, and the potential complications of these therapies. The pharmacist should ensure that the patient is on no nephrotoxic medications and is on erythropoiesis-stimulating treatment, calcitriol, iron, and phosphate binders. The diabetic nurse should educate the patient about the importance of blood glucose control. The dietitian should inform the patient about a low-protein diet. The clinician should ensure that the patient's cardiovascular risk factors are minimized by eating a healthy diet, discontinuing smoking, controlling diabetes, and maintaining a healthy body weight.

Finally, the nurse should always ensure that any patient with uremia undergoing an imaging study that requires contrast is adequately hydrated. If possible, another imaging modality that does not use contrast should be selected. Renal function should be closely monitored, and the patient should be urged to control the blood pressure. Medication compliance is vital. The social worker should be involved to ensure that the patient has adequate financial support to continue with the treatments. Only with such a team approach can the morbidity of uremia be lowered.

**Outcomes**

The prognosis for patients with uremia is generally poor unless they are treated with renal replacement therapy such as transplantation or dialysis. When the cause of uremia is a reversible cause, the prognosis is better than in patients with an irreversible cause. Uremic patients require frequent admission to hospitals and have high morbidity and mortality without treatment. While dialysis has improved the management of uremic patients, vascular access is still a major problem in the long run. In addition, there are not enough kidney donors. Patients with uremia are also at high risk for adverse cardiac events and stroke compared to the general population. Finally, the cost of care for a dialysis patient is prohibitively expensive, costing the healthcare system billions of dollars each year.
