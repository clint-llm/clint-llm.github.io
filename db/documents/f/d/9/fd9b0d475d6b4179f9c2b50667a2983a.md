Current guidelines for managing obesity in pregnancy include those from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Institute of Medicine (IOM). ACOG guidelines recommend utilizing BMI calculated at the first antenatal visit to counsel patients on weight loss based on the IOM's recommendations for GWG in pregnancy. Women with a BMI of 30 and greater are recommended an overall 11 to 20 lb (5 to 9 kg) weight gain during pregnancy, with a mean 0.5 lb (0.23 kg) weight gain each week during the second and third trimesters.

Behavioral interventions using diet and exercise are also recommended and have been shown to help reduce excessive GWG in overweight and obese pregnant women. Ideally, a woman will be counseled appropriately on achieving a healthy weight during a pre-conception visit through balanced nutrition and physical activity. By optimizing the body weight and metabolic environment prior to pregnancy, insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipotoxicity associated with obesity can be reduced, and the adverse effects to the mother and the fetus can be minimized.
