In recent years, some issues on management (and leadership) skills, particularly in the healthcare setting, begin to arise. The emergence of these issues highlights the need for improvement of healthcare management:

**Association between management skills and the efficiency of hospitals -**The study looked at nurses and obstetrician’s managers.

**Education and training needs for healthcare management as basic preconditions for the development and implementation of adequate programs -**Researchers performed a needs assessment in this research, which served as a basis for developing solutions in meeting the gap between healthcare managers and the competencies that they need.

**Training of practicing managers beyond clinical skills -**For middle managers, additional skills for managing subordinates and coordinating with top-level managers is necessary, which includes capabilities such as communication skills (not with patients but with colleagues and other stakeholders), self-awareness, change management, conflict resolution, and other leadership skills.

**Collaborative interprofessional practice -**Due to the reforms in transformational education and significant changes in health systems, there is a need to develop interprofessional education to cultivate the value of teamwork despite differences across health professions.

**The leadership of self as key to leading others -**This paper discusses the course for public health leadership where participants are expected to develop their plans for nurturing their leadership skills.

**Healthcare management as a profession -**This is a field of health service delivery where formal and informal learning opportunities become available across countries. There have been academic degrees which make it a distinct profession.
