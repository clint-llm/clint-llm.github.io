Management of Warthin tumor needs an interprofessional approach involving a team that consists of an otolaryngologist, maxillofacial surgeon, radiologist, and pathologist. The primary care provider and NP must refer patients with any parotid lump to an otolaryngologist for further workup. All health professionals must coordinate their actions to enhance the management of patients with Warthin tumor. Coordination starts with appropriate communication between doctors, nurses, and pharmacists.

The optimal treatment of Warthin tumor relies on surgical removal of the tumor. The interprofessional team should perform an exhaustive preoperative workup to minimize postoperative complications of surgery. This will result in a better patient outcome.
