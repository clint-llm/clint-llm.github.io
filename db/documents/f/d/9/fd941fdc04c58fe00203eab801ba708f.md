The arterial blood supply of the lacrimal gland is the lacrimal artery, a branch of the ophthalmic artery. Venous blood returns from the lacrimal gland via the lacrimal vein, which feeds into the superior ophthalmic vein that traverses the cavernous sinus. Lymphatic draining of the orbit and its associated structures is still an area of ongoing research and debate.
