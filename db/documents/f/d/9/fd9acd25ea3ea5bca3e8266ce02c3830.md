Most exposures to chlorine gas will present with a clear history of exposure obtained either from the patient themselves or first responders arriving from the scene. From prior exposures at chlorinated swimming pools, most patients will recognize the distinct odor of chlorine gas. Rarely a patient in respiratory distress and altered mental status may be found after the complete dispersal of chlorine gas, making the history unclear. Salivation, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, and bronchospasm can occur in cholinergic toxicity as well as chlorine gas exposure.
