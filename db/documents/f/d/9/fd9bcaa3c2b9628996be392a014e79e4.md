Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism (nPHPT) is a new classification of primary hyperparathyroidism. The definition of normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder where elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are the result of autonomous hypersecretion of one or more parathyroid glands and serum calcium is consistently within the normal range as measured at least twice over a six month period.

InÂ normocalcemic secondary hyperparathyroidism (nSHPT), the PTH elevation is a reaction to a low calcium stimulus from various causes. The PTH remains elevated as long as the low calcium stimulus persists and returns to normal as soon as it is removed. Patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism typically develop hyperplasia of all four parathyroid glands.

It is important to first exclude normocalcemic secondary hyperparathyroidism by a thorough history, physical, and directed laboratory investigations before considering a diagnosis of normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism, as medical treatment is directed at the causes of the low calcium stimuli in nSHPT while the treatment of nPHPT is focused on the abnormal parathyroid(s) which may include surgical parathyroidectomy.

This article reviews the latest literature describing the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, treatment strategies of nPHPT, and the differential diagnosis of pertinent nSHPT.
