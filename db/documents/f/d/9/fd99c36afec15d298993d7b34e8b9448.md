Coronary artery anomalies occur because of a developmental abnormality of a coronary artery. These include abnormalities of a vessel’s:

- Origin (such as an origin arising from a different aortic valve cusp)

- Course (such as an intramural course within the aorta)

- Termination (such as a coronary-cameral fistula)

- Morphology (such as an aneurysm)
