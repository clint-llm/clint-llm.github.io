The presentation can certainly vary, given multiple areas of possible entrapment. Symptoms usually develop very slowly. The duration of symptoms often averages multiple years before a definitive diagnosis is made. As mentioned previously, symptoms of this type of nerve entrapment include pain, sensory and motor changes, paresthesias, and/or paralysis. Physical exam and/or history often reveal symptoms limited to the dorsoradial aspect of the distal forearm and hand. Findings of decreased sensation over the dorsoradial aspect of the forearm or hand help establish the diagnosis. A positive Tinel sign along the radial aspect of the mid-forearm is suggestive of this process. Wrist flexion, ulnar deviation, and pronation place strain on the nerve and will often reproduce or exacerbate symptoms. Resisted extension of the middle finger with the elbow extended is another sign of nerve entrapment. This sign is often used to aid in the diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis, but it also often positive in cases of radial nerve entrapment.
