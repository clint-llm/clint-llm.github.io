Aluminum hydroxide when used as an antacid is to be delivered orally. Shake the aluminum hydroxide suspension well before use. It should be taken 5 to 6 times daily after meals and at bedtime, not to exceed 3.84 g per 24 hours. The patient should follow the dose with water intake.

Topical aluminum hydroxide should be applied to the desired area and left in place. Topical aluminum has minimal skin absorption, so topical treatment with aluminum hydroxide may require reapplication as necessary.

The administration of aluminum hydroxide as an antacid should not be for prolonged management of patient symptoms. Similarly, aluminum hydroxide should not be administered to patients with renal impairment. In these instances, increased aluminum may precipitate more severe adverse effects or deplete the body's phosphate reserves.
