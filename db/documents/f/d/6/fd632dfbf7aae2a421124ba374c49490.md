Motilin acts on several organs. It increases gall bladder emptying, increased insulin release from the pancreas, GI tract mobility, and increased hunger.

Motilin is considered recently as a primary orexigenic hormone by modulating the neurocircuit in the brain.

Motilin raises pepsin output and the acid secretion in the stomach.
