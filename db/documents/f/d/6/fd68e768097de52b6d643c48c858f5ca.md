Fractures of the hamate are rare, under-reported injuries. They can be divided anatomically into two groups: body or hook. While conventional X-rays may be insufficient, and special views may be needed, CT scanning is often necessary to spot the fracture. Proper fracture assessment and treatment are essential to avoid complications such as necrosis, nonunion, post-traumatic arthritis, ulnar nerve compression, and carpal tunnel syndrome. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of hamate fractures and highlights the importance of the entire interprofessional team in rendering specific treatment according to fracture type.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology and common mechanisms of hamate fractures.
- Describe the proper evaluation of a patient with a suspected hamate fracture.
- Summarize the treatment and management of hamate fractures.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by a hamate fracture to achieve optimal results.
