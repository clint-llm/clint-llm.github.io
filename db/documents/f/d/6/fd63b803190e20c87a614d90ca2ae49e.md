Significant adverse effects are electrolyte derangement (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, etc.), hypersensitivity reaction, and precipitation of acute gout attacks.

The adverse effects of chlorthalidone span across most organ systems to differing degrees and manifestations. Of significance, as a result of promoted diuresis and altering of nephron physiology, electrolyte derangement is a commonly reported adverse effect of this medication. Most commonly, chlorthalidone includes hypokalemia but may also cause hyponatremia or hypochloremia. These known derangements make monitoring serum electrolytes essential for patients receiving chlorthalidone periodically throughout hypertensive management.
