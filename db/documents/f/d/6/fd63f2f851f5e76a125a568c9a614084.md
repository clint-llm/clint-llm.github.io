- Marinescoâ€“Sjogren syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the triad of cerebellar ataxia, congenital cataract, and mental retardation that may resemble CTX. However, Marinesco-Sjogren syndrome does not present with intractable diarrhea and does not demonstrate an elevated level of cholestanol. The presence of tendon xanthomas is usually not associated with this disorder, although some case reports show this rare occurrence.

- Sitosterolemia is a rare sterol storage disease characterized by tendon xanthomas, premature atherosclerosis, and hematologic disorders such as hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenic purpura. Cataract development and neurologic diseases are not present, which may help differentiate from CTX. Treatment with ezetimibe and a low plant-sterol diet has been shown to improve cardiovascular and hematologic signs and promote xanthoma regression.

- Familial hypercholesterolemia is an autosomal dominant disorder that may also present with tendon xanthomas and a family history of premature atherosclerosis. Patients are diagnosed with the presence of elevated low-density lipid serum levels (>180mg/dL). Familial hypercholesterolemia is not associated with intractable diarrhea, cataract development, or neurologic symptoms.
