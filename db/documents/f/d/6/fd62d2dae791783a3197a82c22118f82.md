Corticobulbar tract supplies upper motor neuron innervation to the cranial nerves supplying head and face. The precentral gyrus in the posterior part of the frontal lobe of the cerebrum is the part of the primary motor cortex from where several motor pathways originate. Some fibers to cortico-bulbar tract (as with corticospinal tract) also come from the Pre-motor area and supplementary area.

The corticobulbar tract starts in the precentral gyrus. From here, the corticobulbar fibers pass through the corona radiata, genu of the internal capsule, peduncle of the cerebrum, base of the pons, and then to the medullary pyramid. They synapse at the motor nuclei of cranial nerve nuclei. The corticobulbar tract may synapse either directly on the motor nuclei or indirectly through interneurons. Corticobulbar tract supplies input bilaterally to trigeminal, facial, and hypoglossal nerve nuclei.
