Management of pseudoaneurysms requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, and specialty-trained nurses all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results.

Management of pseudoaneurysm depends on its etiology and location.  Nurses and physicians should routinely palpate the groin area after patients undergo cardiac catheterization, as pseudoaneurysms are not uncommon. A femoral pseudoaneurysm can be treated by the vascular surgeon or by interventional radiology with thrombin injection depending on local practice patterns.  Endovascular repair of visceral artery pseudoaneurysms may be performed by a vascular surgeon or interventional radiologist as well.  Aortic pseudoaneurysms are typically the domain of the vascular surgeon as there is a possible need for open repair and subsequent follow-up. Only the vascular surgeon can perform open repairs of all types of pseudoaneurysms. [Level V]
