Making a diagnosis of somatic syndrome is not always easy. Healthcare providers, including nurse practitioners and primary care clinicians, should try and rule out organic disorders first before making a diagnosis of a somatic syndrome. Some healthcare providers find patients with SSD difficult to manage and often describe them in derogatory terms; the misconceived bias is that physical disorders are considered genuine, while those with SSD are inappropriately accused of manufacturing their symptoms. As an increasing primary care population with medically unexplained symptoms receives a diagnosis of SSD, there is a need to educate and train physicians about SSD, its significance, and how to best manage these patients.
