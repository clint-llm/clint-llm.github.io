**FGF23 Function and Processing**

FGF23 is a peptide hormone secreted by mainly osteocytes and osteoblasts.

FGF23 undergoes post-translational processing in the form of O-glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus, done by N-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase-3 enzyme (encoded by GALNT3 gene).

**FGF23 Defect in HTC**

The most common form of HTC results from a loss-of-function mutation in the GALNT3 gene, resulting in congenital disorder of O-glycosylation of FGF23 (GALNT3-CDG). The resultant form of FGF23 undergoes degradation by the Furin enzyme into its inactive N-terminal and C-terminal fragments.

Ultimately, the resultant defect in all types of HTC is a lack of inhibition of the sodium-phosphate cotransporters NPT2a and NPT2c and decreased activity of 25-hydroxy vitamin D 1-alpha-hydroxylase in kidneys. It increases the serum phosphate levels and a high to inappropriately-normal 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D levels.
