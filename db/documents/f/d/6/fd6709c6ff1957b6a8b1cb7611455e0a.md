When new-onset hyperthyroidism is suspected in pregnancy, laboratory evaluation is similar to the non-gravid patient.

The interpretation of these laboratory studies is different in the pregnant patient, as the normal values vary between trimesters and the non-gravid state due to increasing levels of TBG.

A definitive diagnosis of hyperthyroidism may be difficult due to normally fluctuating levels of thyroid hormone in pregnancy. If the diagnosis is uncertain, it is appropriate to observe the thyroid level trends with further laboratory testing rather than immediately starting antithyroid drug therapy.
