The obstructive type of MGD is the most common form. The continuous meibum secretion results in increased pressure with the meibomian glands. This increased pressure results in ductal dilatation, duct dropouts, acinar degeneration, and ultimately, meibocytes.

The stagnation of the meibomian secretions results in alterations like increased melting points, loss of clarity, and bacterial colonization. Bacteria, most commonly Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Propionibacterium acnes, produce lipolytic enzymes and release inflammatory mediators.
