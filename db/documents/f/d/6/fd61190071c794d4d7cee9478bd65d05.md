Cell-mediated immunity plays a major role in triggering the clinical expression of lichen planopilaris. It is proposed that this cell-mediated reaction is potentially initiated by the action of an endogenous or exogenous agent, such as drugs, viruses, or contact sensitizers that bind to keratinocytes as well as follicular epithelium. Contact sensitizers, such as metals including gold, mercury, and cobalt, could act as haptens and evoke an inflammatory reaction. Microorganisms that may play a role include the hepatitis C virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus type 2, human papillomavirus, and syphilis. Drugs involved include antimalarial agents, gold, beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. After this initial trigger, keratinocytes and hair follicles may act as signal transducers, capable of converting these stimuli into producing cytokines and chemotactic factors for the initiation and perpetuation of inflammation. Most infiltrated T-lymphocytes are located around the bulge area. Lineage studies have proven that bulge area cells are multipotent and that their progeny generates the new lower anagen hair follicle. The failure of affected follicles to regenerate is thought to be due to the destruction of follicular stem cells located in the bulge area.
