The most common complications from the procedure are mild reactions to the vasodilators and other medications used during the test. These side effects include flushing, headache, GI distress, and lightheadedness. More severe side effects such as hypotension, arrhythmias, chest discomfort, or AV blockade may also be seen. Rarely, an allergic reaction to the tracer compound or study medications may occur. The healthcare team should also consider the risks of radiation exposure to the patient, particularly if the patient is pregnant or planning to become pregnant. A Tc stress/rest cardiac scan carries the greatest effective dose of radiation at 11.8 mSv, while a Tc brain scan carries an effective dose of 5.7 mSv. The effective dose for most SPECT scans, excluding cardiac stress/rest studies, is usually below 10 mSv. By comparison, the effective radiation doses for head computed tomography, chest computed tomography, andÂ computed tomography coronary angiography are 2.0, 7.0, and 16.0 mSv, respectively.
