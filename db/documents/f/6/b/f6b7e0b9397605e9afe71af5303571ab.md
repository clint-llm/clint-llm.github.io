In the USA, the incidence of ocular injuries is 2.4 million cases.

Workers and farmers are the two most common occupations because they are involved in hammering, drilling, chiseling, and shoveling. These activities generate more foreign bodies. The annual incidence rate of IOFBs is approximately 0.16 per 100,000 in the United Kingdom.
