Newborn screening tests will identify most cases of galactosemia in developed countries. Testing evaluates for pertinent enzyme activity levels so diagnosis can be made even if testing is done before the introduction of galactose in the diet. However, if a blood transfusion has occurred before newborn screening tests, a case may be misinterpreted as being normal due to the presence of normal enzyme activity in the transfused blood.

Severe symptoms often manifest within the first several days of life, before newborn screening tests may be finalized. Thus, it is important for the practitioner to maintain a high index of suspicion for inborn errors of metabolism such as galactosemia when the newborn demonstrates feeding intolerance, lethargy, and other suspicious signs like hepatomegaly renal failure, cataracts, hypoglycemia, and seizures.

If there is a known risk for galactosemia in a fetus, amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling can make or exclude a diagnosis of galactosemia before delivery.

Postnatal newborn screening is nearly universal in the United States and Europe. However, it should be noted that some populations with the highest incidence of galactosemia also may be less likely to deliver a baby in a hospital setting. GALT enzyme activity in red blood cells or GALT gene analysis should be performed in an infant suspected of having galactosemia.

Long-term, annual screening of calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D is recommended with supplementation as necessary following age-specific recommendations for the general population.

Biochemical monitoring is variable between treatment centers with most common assessments of blood galactose, RBC Gal-1-P, and/or urinary galactitol levels though it is unclear whether monitoring these levels is reflective of dietary adherence or correlates with clinical outcomes. Still, Gal-1-P levels are recommended at birth, 3 and nine months, and yearly.

Assessment of developmental milestones, intellectual development, and speech and language assessment should be done at regular intervals such as toddler, pre-school, elementary, middle school, and high school ages. Assessment of executive function using a standardized tool is recommended.

Bone density should be assessed using bone densitometry starting around age eight to ten years and repeated every five years or sooner if low bone density is determined.

If cataracts are found, a referral to an ophthalmologist is appropriate.

More than 80% of females with classic galactosemia have primary ovarian insufficiency.
