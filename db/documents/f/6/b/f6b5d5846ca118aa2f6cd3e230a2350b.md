While active patients and recreational athletes often return to baseline activity levels and work following both nonoperative and operative management of these injuries. High-level professional athletes most often report inferior results and return to play regardless of the chosen management plan.

A 2017 study from the American Journal of Sports MedicineÂ reported professional athletes' follow-up performance (NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL) at 1- and 2-year follow-ups after surgery performed between 1989 and 2013:

- >30% failure to return to play

- Athletes returning noted (at 1-year follow-up) the following:

- Fewer games played, overall
- Less playing time, overall
- Suboptimal performance level, overall

- Athletes able to return to play by 2-year follow-up show no statistically significant difference in performance level

Thus, athletes demonstrating the ability to return to play by 1-year should expect to achieve continuous improvement to baseline performance by the ensuing season.
