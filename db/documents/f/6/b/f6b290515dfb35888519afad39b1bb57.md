ALA is considered a safe supplementation without any side affect. One study supports the safety of the drug in which an adult can take up to 2400 mg without experiencing any harmful side effects.

An ALA study in 1996 on six rhesus monkeys showed that excess lethal dose in primates would cause hepatic necrosis. Researchers noted that 3 out of 6 monkeys that received 90 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg of intravenous ALA exhibited large necrotic areas in the large muscles of their thighs, the liver, the heart, and the kidneys. This situation led the researchers to conclude that exceptionally high doses of intravenous ALA can produce the same symptoms that smaller doses prevent.

Thus far, few studies have analyzed the safety of ALA supplementation in pregnant women or children. Therefore, these populations are advised to consult with their healthcare providers when considering taking ALA.
