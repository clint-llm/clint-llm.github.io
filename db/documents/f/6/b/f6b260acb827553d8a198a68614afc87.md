- Review the medical and surgical treatment options for patients with nail-patella syndrome.
- Summarize the interprofessional team's role in diagnosing and managing patients with nail-patella syndrome to reduce patient morbidity and improving quality of life.

# Introduction

Nail-patella syndrome (NPS), also known as Fong disease or hereditary onycho-osteodysplasia, is a rare multisystemic disease with a classic clinical tetrad of fingernail dysplasia, hypoplasia or absence of the patella, presence of iliac horns, and elbow deformities, although ocular, renal, and neurological involvement exists as well.

# Etiology

Nail-patella syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a heterozygous loss of function mutation of the LMXB1 gene on chromosome 9q34.1.LMXB1 encodes a transcription factor involved in multiple important embryological developments to include limb dorsal-ventral patterning, differentiation of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, skull patterning, periocular mesenchyme development, and renal podocyte development.LMXB1 mutations have been identified as well as evidence of somatic mosaicism, which is known to occur in unaffected parents of patients affected by autosomal dominant disorders.LMXB1 homeodomain with other genes. The PAX2 transcription factor has been studied for its interaction with LMXB1 as both proteins are involved in renal and eye development.LMXB1 gene homeodomain have been shown to affect interactions with PAX2 raising the question of the latter’s role in the NPS phenotypic variability, although more research would be needed to test this possibility.

# Epidemiology

The incidence of nail-patella syndrome has been reported as 1 in 50,000.

# Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of nail-patella syndrome centers around the LMX1B protein role in embryological development. LMX1B is involved in dorsal-ventral limb patterning and has a normal gradient of expression from distal to proximal and from anterior to posterior. This expression pattern likely explains nail and patellar (an epiphyseal equivalent) involvement with decreasing severity of findings going from anterior to posterior as well as going from distal to proximal.LMX1B.

In another example, the anterior structures of the eye to include the cornea, trabecular meshwork, and anterior chamber depth, are each influenced by LMX1B during development. It is an abnormal anterior chamber depth in patients with NPS that is most likely responsible for primary open-angle glaucoma, the most potentially serious and most frequent ocular complication of NPS.

LMX1B plays an important role in embryological renal development, particularly with the podocytes and glomeruli. The podocyte foot processes may be effaced and exhibit abnormal slit diaphragms, causing splitting of the glomerular basement membrane as well as decreased endothelial fenestrations.

# Histopathology

Electron microscopic and immunohistochemical study of the developing kidney has led to ultrastructural findings related to NPS-related nephropathy. The glomerular basement membrane is seen as irregularly thickened and with a moth-eaten appearance due to the deposition of fibrillar collagen-like material, the latter of which is considered a hallmark of NPS.

# History and Physical

Patients with nail-patella syndrome can show decreased upper and lower extremity muscle mass resembling dystrophic muscular disease.

Similar to the nails, patients with NPS have absent, hypoplastic, or irregular patellae, which frequently sublux superolaterally, although the non-displaced position of the patella may be naturally lateral and superior.

Limited elbow joint range of motion in extension, pronation, and supination may be elicited. Skin contractures and superficial web-like membranes called pterygia at the elbow joint can be seen.

Extraskeletal systemic manifestations of NPS are notable for renal, ophthalmic, and neurological involvement. Renal involvement has been reported in 30-60% of patients with NPS, and the degree of severity is the dominant factor that influences mortality, as progression to renal failure can occur rapidly and in as much as 10% of patients.

The most common ophthalmic findings are open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension, which present earlier in patients with NPS compared to the unaffected population but are treatable and preventable with screening measures.

Common neurological symptoms can include numbness, tingling, and neuropathic pain in a non-peripheral nerve or dermatomal pattern, which affect the distal more so than the proximal limb.

# Evaluation

**Laboratory Evaluation**

Nail-patella syndrome with renal involvement can be suspected on routine urinalysis, as evidenced by proteinuria with or without hematuria, which is usually the initial manifestations.

**Imaging Evaluation**

Radiography plays an important role in diagnosing NPS with most of the condition’s musculoskeletal characteristics evident on radiographs. The knee will demonstrate a small or absent patella in addition to various morphological abnormalities of the femoral condyles and trochlea.

# Treatment / Management

**Medical Treatment**

Treatment of renal involvement is focused on slowing the progression of proteinuria by achieving blockage of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Two classes of drugs that target the RAAS and are well studied in patients with genetic or acquired proteinuria are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The literature is lacking robust evidence to support any particular medical treatment, although the authors of a case report involving an infant girl with NPS and proteinuria described complete remission of the patient's proteinuria using a combination therapy of an ACEi and ARB.

**Surgical Treatment**

Patellofemoral pain and patellar dislocation are common symptoms of NPS, which may be initially treated with conservative measures. Multiple surgical techniques and approaches have been described for the correction of patellar instability.

**Patient Management**

No specific management guidelines have been proposed by any large medical organization. Sweeney et al. put forth recommendations that aim to maintain quality of life, provide genetic counseling for patients and their families, and provide screening measures to prevent NPS complications associated with elevated morbidity and mortality such as glaucoma and renal failure.

# Differential Diagnosis

The combination of musculoskeletal and systemic findings in nail-patella syndrome is characteristic, but because the clinical manifestations are varied and nonspecific, there is overlap with other genetic conditions. In their review article, Sweeney et al. offered a broad differential and listed the similarities and differences in each differential diagnosis with regards to NPS.

# Prognosis

Patients with NPS live a normal lifespan, and the reported association with malignancy is favored to be coincidental.

# Complications

The most potentially serious complications of NPS are acute open-angle glaucoma and renal failure. The prevalence of glaucoma has been reported at nearly 17% in patients over the age of 40 and is treatable and preventable with screening.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients with NPS have multiple abnormalities, which can make understanding the various clinical manifestations of their condition challenging. A multidisciplinary approach is likely best, with most patients treated conservatively. Genetic counseling should be offered to all patients with nail-patella syndrome and their families. Emphasis should be placed on screening for serious complications, particularly nephropathy and glaucoma.

# Pearls and Other Issues

- NPS is a rare multisystemic genetic condition with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern involving mutations of the LMX1B protein leading to various yet characteristic clinical manifestations.

- The classic clinical tetrad of NPS consists of the involvement of the nails, knees, elbows, and the presence of iliac horns, each of which is readily apparent on physical exam and/or imaging. Iliac horns are pathognomonic for the condition.

- Renal failure is an uncommon but serious complication and the primary influencer of patient mortality.

- Prognosis is good with screening precautions and early intervention of symptoms under the care of an interprofessional healthcare team.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Despite the well-documented phenotype of patients with nail-patella syndrome, this rare genetic condition can make for a challenging diagnosis as there are potentially multiple clinical manifestations, and diagnosis can be delayed into adulthood. Additionally, there are potentially serious complications of NPS if patient symptoms are not addressed. Due to these challenges, patients would likely benefit from an interprofessional healthcare team of pediatricians, primary care physicians, medical geneticists, nephrologists, radiologists, and orthopedic surgeons who collaborate to perform screening for complications, treat symptomatic complaints as they arrive, and ensure appropriate referral to subspecialist providers when medically warranted.
