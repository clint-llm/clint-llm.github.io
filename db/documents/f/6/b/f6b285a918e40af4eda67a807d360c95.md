The initial approach to a patient with new-onset lower extremity edema can be challenging, with the initial workup, often focusing on the hepatic, cardiovascular or renal system.  Screening for a vasculitic process is often performed, particularly when it involves the renal or pulmonary systems. It is important to understand the significance and limitations of serological markers when evaluating the patient.  This case aims to highlight the potential pitfalls of positive serologic markers and the importance of keeping a broad differential in new-onset lower extremity swelling.

This review separating vasculitic renal disease from infectious etiology highlights the importance of not empirically treating a patient with positive serological markers for vasculitis with cytotoxic agents as this could be disastrous for a patient with HIV. This case also presents an atypical presentation of HIV infection and the need to have a high index of suspicion for the disease, even when risk factors are not apparent. Treatment regimens will also differ for an HIV patient with concomitant renal impairment and special considerations must be given before starting ART.
