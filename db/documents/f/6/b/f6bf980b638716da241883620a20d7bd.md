The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website states that there were 619 confirmed outbreaks of Bacillus-related poisoning from 1998 through 2015, involving 7385 illnesses. In this timeframe, there were 75 illnesses and three deaths due to confirmed Bacillus-related illnesses. The website states that there were 19,119 outbreaks overall and 373,531 illnesses. It refers to 14,681 hospitalizations and 337 deaths during this timeframe. These statistics refer to all Bacillus-related illnesses, and not just B. cereus related illnesses.

The FDA "Bad Bug Book" further breaks this down and states that there are an estimated 63,400 episodes of B. cereus illness annually in the United States. From 2005 to 2007, there were 13 confirmed outbreaks and 37.6 suspected outbreaks involving over 1000 people.

Everyone is susceptible to B. cereus infection; however, mortality related to this illness is rare. The emetic enterotoxin has been associated with a few cases of liver failure and death in otherwise healthy people. The infective dose or the number of organisms most commonly associated with human illness is 10^5 to 10^8 organisms/gram, but pathogenicity arises from the preformed toxin, not the bacteria themselves.
