Polymorphic light eruption is the most common form of immunologically mediated photosensitivity dermatoses. Exposure to sunlight in spring or summer results in an irritable rash that resolves within a few days, providing further exposure is avoided. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of polymorphic light eruption and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of polymorphic light eruption.
- Review the presentation of polymorphic light eruption.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for polymorphic light eruption.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by polymorphic light eruption.
