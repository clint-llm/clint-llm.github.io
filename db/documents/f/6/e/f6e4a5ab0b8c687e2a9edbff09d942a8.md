When dealing with rare disorders, it is essential to establish care coordination amongst specialists. For factor V deficiency, patients require routine follow-up with a hematologist. For elective surgeries, prophylaxis and measures to control bleeding are discussed between the hematologist and surgeon or other specialists performing the procedure. For any emergency-related hemorrhage, hematologists need to be involved and transfusion medicine physicians for appropriate product availability. Furthermore, it is necessary to notify the pharmacy quickly when certain products are requested urgently.

Communication and team effort are critical for patient safety and improving outcomes. Patients must follow in a high-risk obstetrics clinic when pregnant for close monitoring. Parents should be counseled on the inheritance of factor V deficiency in future children and may benefit from a consultation with a geneticist. In the pediatric population, neonatologists and pediatricians should be mindful of family history and presentation of disease when not yet diagnosed. Intracranial hemorrhages are a lethal complication if not promptly diagnosed and difficult to treat if etiology is unknown.

Factor V deficiency is extremely rare; therefore, the article is at a level 3 based on the evidence provided in publications.
