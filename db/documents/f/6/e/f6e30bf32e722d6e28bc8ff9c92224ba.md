The flexor digitorum profundus is supplied by the anterior interosseous artery, which is a branch of the common interosseous artery. The anterior interosseous artery is accompanied by the palmar interosseous branch of the median nerve and gives off muscular branches to the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor pollicis longus muscles. The flexor digitorum profundus lymphatic drainage is part of the upper limb lymph system, consisting of superficial and deep lymphatic vessels. The superficial vessels around the basilic vein go to the cubital lymph nodes, which are proximal to the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Vessels around the cephalic vein go to the axillary lymph nodes. The deep lymphatic vessels also drain lymph from the flexor digitorum profundus and follow the major deep veins, eventually terminating in the humeral axillary lymph nodes.
