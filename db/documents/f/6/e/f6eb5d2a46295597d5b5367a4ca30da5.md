Strongyloidiasis is a disease caused by intestinal worms Strongyloides stercoralis or Strongyloides fuelleborni. The more common of the two, Stercoralis stercoralis, is a helminth that is transmitted by soil and can cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of strongyloidiasis and illustrates the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care for those with diseases caused by these intestinal nematodes.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how strongyloidiasis can affect different organ systems. 
- Describe the common presentation of a strongyloidiasis infection. 
- Explain how to treat strongyloidiasis infections. 
- Explain the significance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to educate patients about hand washing and maintaining personal hygiene, which will prevent the transmission of strongyloidiasis.
