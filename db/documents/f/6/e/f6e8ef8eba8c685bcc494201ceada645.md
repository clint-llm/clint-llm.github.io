There is no definitive etiology of Buerger disease, yet tobacco exposure is required for both disease initiation and progression. The mechanism of the disease remains a mystery, but it may involve immunologic dysfunction and tobacco hypersensitivity that is associated with enhanced cellular sensitivity to type-1 and type-3 collagen, impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation, and increased anti-endothelial cell antibody titers.Â A genetic link may exist as affected subjects have an increased prevalence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A9, HLA-B5, and HLA-54.
