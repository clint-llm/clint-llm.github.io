There are five types of ionizing radiation; we will discuss alpha, beta, and gamma. Alpha particles are made up of two protons and two neutrons. It is easily blocked by clothing but can be inhaled or ingested. Once on the surface of alveoli or intestinal mucosa, it can cause cellular damage resulting in certain cancers. An example of an alpha particle nuclear material is radon gas. Beta particles are made up of electrons. They have a higher penetrance than alpha particles and can cause damage to the skin. It can also be inhaled as well as ingested. It is the by-product of nuclear power plants and medical nuclear materials like xenon. Gamma rays have no mass and are highly penetrant. They are usually the result of a nuclear detonation.
