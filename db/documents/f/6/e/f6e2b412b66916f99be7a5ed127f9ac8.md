Variations in the origins, course, and position are common. However, variations of size are not.

Anomalies during embryology development, such as in angiogenesis, can cause

- Hypoplasia - Underdevelopment of the radicular arteries is most common.

- Atresia - as part of the VACTERL association

- Agenesis - Failure of an organ or associated vertebral component to form

- Absence - The absence of certain anastomoses can be due to embryological variation

- Duplication - Redundancy in specific the vertebral artery or certain radicular arteries can be present

- Fenestration - of the vertebral artery is considered to be an anastomosis abnormality occurring during embryologic development often associated with aneurysms
