Zones of care are the term used in the prehospital setting to delineate locations that require different levels of care and/or safety. Operationally speaking these zones help define the personnel and equipment that can and should be used depending on the type of incident. The zones are divided based on colors or names, and they vary from agency to agency.  The interagency variation in zone descriptors necessitates the use of "regular language" to ensure a cohesive response and that the right people and resources are in the correct location.
