The pathophysiology behind burning mouth syndrome is poorly understood and may be related to psychogenic and neuropathic pathways. Disruptions in circadian rhythm, chronic anxiety, disruptions in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, irritants, infection, and diabetes mellitus, are thought to contribute to its development.

The underlying type of the pain conduction is likely throughout the trigeminal distribution, and there is evidence of histopathologic changes in nociceptive nerves in patients displaying symptoms. Studies also show changes in taste perception and hot and cold sensation, which may have reflex hyperfunction to closely related nerve hypofunction. One study showed a link with the chorda tympani hypofunction, resulting in reduced taste while hyperstimulating the lingual nerve and causing symptoms.

Other theories include mechanisms similar to phantom limb syndrome and small fiber neuropathy.

Xerostomia in burning mouth syndrome is thought to be related more to neuropathy than a glandular issue. Mechanical damage from bruxism, clenching, and tongue thrusting may initiate symptoms, and psychiatric conditions most likely exacerbate symptoms.
