Gingival recession describes the process by which the junctional epithelium of the oral gingiva recedes, leading to the pathologic exposure of the root of the tooth.

Clinicians often have to decide whether or not to treat this condition surgically. Surgical correction of a gingival recession merits consideration when a patient is concerned about esthetics or tooth hypersensitivity, there is active gingival recession, or when the patient will undergo orthodontic treatment on a tooth with predisposing factors (inadequate keratinized mucosa, thin tissue-type). The two types of surgical procedures include root coverage or keratinized tissue augmentation. However, the benefits of surgical treatment lack substantial support in current literature relative to more conservative approaches such as management of the underlying etiological cause.
