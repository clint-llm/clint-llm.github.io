The sacrum and its function relative to the sacroiliac joint (SIJ) has been identified as a source of low back pain since the early 20 century. The SIJ is considered a diarthrodial joint, containing synovial fluid and encompassed by a fibrous capsule. The stabilization of the SIJ is provided by ligamentous attachments, tendinous attachments from the gluteus maximus and piriformis muscles, as well as the thoracolumbar fascia extending from the latissimus dorsi.

The sacrum has an inverted triangle wedge shape, with the widest portion forming the sacral base superiorly and the apex inferiorly towards the coccyx.

Initially, the belief was that the sacroiliac joint was immobile; however, studies have revealed simultaneous rotation and translation in a sagittal plane.

Studies have also revealed rotation of the sacrum and SIJ about oblique axes, which is responsible for developing sacral dysfunctions such as torsions.

With the extensive network of fasciae, muscles, and ligaments supporting and interconnecting skeletal structures, the movement of the sacrum about these axes has a strong relation to the lumbar spine.
