Erb palsy, or Erb-Duchenne paralysis, is a paralysis of the arm caused by the injury to the upper group of the main nerves supplying it, specifically the upper trunk C5-C6 of the brachial plexus.Â  It is one of the most common neurological birth injuries, and these injuries most commonly, though not exclusively, arise from the traction on the neck during difficult childbirth. According to the severity of the injury, it can either resolve on its own over some time or may require rehabilitative therapy and surgery.

It is often assumed that the cause is the obstetrical technique during delivery, but two major risk factors include shoulder dystocia and the large size of the fetus. Most cases resolve with time, but a few infants may need surgery. Permanent disability is rare.
