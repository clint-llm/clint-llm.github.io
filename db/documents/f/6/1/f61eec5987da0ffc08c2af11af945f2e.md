There are many relative contraindications for PTLB as described in the BTS guidelines (in near-verbatim language):

- Failure to obtain informed consent is a contraindication for the procedure according to the guidelines, and an alternative diagnostic modality must be considered.

- The previous history of pneumonectomy is a contraindication. However, if the lesion to be biopsied is pleural based, then the procedure can be attempted as long as the lung tissue is not traversed.

- If a vascular lesion or AVM is suspected on CT, the procedure should not be considered, and a multidisciplinary team meeting should be held to decide the next step in management.

- For patients on mechanical ventilation, lung biopsy may not be feasible due to limited access.

- Despite pre-procedure counseling, some patients may be uncooperative and move during the procedure. Hence, another diagnostic modality must be considered in these cases.

- Abnormal lung function or coagulation indices during the pre-procedure evaluation.

For transthoracic biopsies, besides bleeding diathesis, other contraindications include severe emphysematous disease, presence of bullae that obstruct the path of biopsy, patients with intractable cough, patients on mechanical ventilation, and patients with pulmonary hypertension.

Besides poor general condition, coagulopathies, and recent MI, VATS is contraindicated for patients with the inability to tolerate single lung ventilation.
