Ileus needs to be distinguished from other causes of abdominal pain, distension, and nausea/vomiting. Once diagnosed, treatment is supportive (IV fluids, NG decompression) with the management of precipitating factors (opiates, sepsis). Postoperative ileus is common, but steps canÂ be taken to help prevent it, especially in an outpatient/elective setting (ERAS protocols, ambulation, laparoscopy).
