The prognosis of kernicterus depends on the severity of the disease at presentation and the treatment provided. If caught early, there may be full recovery provided adequate treatment is given upon diagnosis. However, a late diagnosis can cause permanent neurological damage, leading to involuntary movements like chorea, visual and auditory disabilities, and cerebral palsy.
