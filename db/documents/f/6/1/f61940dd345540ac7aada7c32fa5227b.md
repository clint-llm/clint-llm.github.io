The brachial artery supplies blood to the upper extremity and bifurcates into the radial and ulnar arteries at the proximal cubital fossa.

The radial and middle collateral arteries, from the profunda brachii artery, anastomose with the radial recurrent artery and the interosseous recurrent artery to form the lateral arcade.

The deep lymphatic vessels of the forearm, the radial and ulnar lymphatic vessels (RLV, ULV), drain lymph from deep lymphatic vessels in the palm.
