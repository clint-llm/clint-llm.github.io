Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) is genetically heterogeneous with variable expression.

Several genetic mutations are implicated in the genesis of PPCD 1-4.

- PPCD1 (122000) is due to a heterozygous mutation in the promoter of the OVOL2 gene (616441), cytogenic location 20p11.22.

- PPCD2 (609140) is due to a mutation in the COL8A2 gene (120252), cytogenic location 1p34.2-p32.3.

- PPCD3 (609141) is due to a mutation in the ZEB1 gene (189909), cytogenic location 10p11.22.

- PPCD4 (618031) is due to a mutation in the GRHL2 gene (608576), cytogenic location 8q22.
