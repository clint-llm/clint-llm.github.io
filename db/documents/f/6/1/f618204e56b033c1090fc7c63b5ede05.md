The management of central pontine myelinolysis is challenging and requires the coordination of physicians and ancillary staff to have positive outcomes. The critical component is the prevention of the condition, which is structured around close monitoring of serum sodium levels. Patients being monitored should be under close surveillance in the appropriate setting, such as the intensive care unit. Serum sodium levels should be monitored every 4-6 hours, or hourly if there are severe derangements. Current recommendations for the rate of sodium correction are 8 to 12 mEq/L per 24 hours. However, in patients with hyponatremia lasting 48 hours or of unknown duration, the rate of serum sodium correction should not exceed 6 to 8 mEq/L per 24 hours. [Level 1]

The interprofessional team may include intensivists, neurologists, nurse practitioners, critical care nurses, and pharmacists. Providers should be aware of this devastating complication. Nurses must monitor sodium levels and patient condition, reporting back to managing providers. Pharmacists review orders for intravenous fluids and should communicate with ordering clinicians if there is a concern. [Level 5]
