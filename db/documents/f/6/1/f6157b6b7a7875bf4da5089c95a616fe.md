Central post-stroke pain is a kind of hemidystonia that typically involves the areas of the body affected by stroke. This pain is a sharp, burning, and stabbing pain with the intensity of somewhere between 3 to 6 on a numeric rating scale of 0 to 10 (10 being the worst pain imaginable), along with hyperalgesia and allodynia. The patient may even complain of one or more types of pain. The quality of pain varies and is often described as pricking, aching, lancinating, shooting, squeezing, freezing, lacerating, electrical, cold, numb, swollen, cutting, dull, and throbbing. It is difficult for the patient sometimes to describe the quality of pain. Some patients describe the pain as “troublesome,” “annoying,” and “tiring.” More than 90% of patients have abnormalities in either pain or temperature sensation. In other words, modalities carried by the spinothalamic sensory tract; whereas, loss of vibration or touch sensation, in other words, modalities carried by the dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway, is less common.

Central post-stroke pain is often split into three components. First can be a spontaneous, constant pain described as burning, aching, pricking, freezing, and squeezing. Second can be a spontaneous, intermittent component present in 15% of cases and lasting for a few seconds to minutes, intense in severity, and described as shooting and lancinating. This component may be the predominant complaint as it happens daily with pain-free intervals of a few hours. About two-thirds of the patients have a third evoked component, which is hyperalgesia, hyperesthesia, and/or allodynia. Any patient may experience one or more of these components of this neuropathic pain.
