Most people with spondylotic changes of the cervical spine on radiographic imaging remain asymptomatic, with 25% of individuals under the age of 40, 50% of individuals over the age of 40, and 85% of individuals over the age of 60 showing some evidence of degenerative changes. The most frequently affected levels are C6-C7, followed by C5-C6. Symptomatic cervical spondylosis most commonly presents as neck pain. In the general population, the point prevalence of neck pain ranges from 0.4% to 41.5%, the 1-year incidence ranges from 4.8% to 79.5%, and lifetime prevalence may be as high as 86.8%. According to the Global Burden of Disease 2015, low back and neck pain remain the leading cause of years lived with disability (YLD) and the fourth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).
