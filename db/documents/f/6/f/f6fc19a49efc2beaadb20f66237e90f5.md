It is essential to remember vertigo is a symptom, not a diagnosis. Most of us have experienced some vertigo in our lives. However, this can be difficult for an individual to describe, so often, vertigo is described in various ways. One of the simplest forms of vertigo which many have experienced is the transient feeling of dizziness and perception of ourselves or the environment spinning around us after rapidly turning in circles. Often, nausea and vomiting will accompany these symptoms.
