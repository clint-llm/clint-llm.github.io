Normal cellular prion protein (PrP) is found on the membranes of cells throughout the body, even in healthy people and animals. It has complex functions that are yet to be fully discovered. CJD is caused by the transformation of the normal cellular prion protein PrP into an abnormal, structurally changed, disease-causing form called the prion PrP scrapie (the prion disease of sheep and goats), which then self-propagates and accumulates throughout the brain. The infectious isoform known as PrP scrapie triggers the normal PrP proteins to convert into the infectious isoform (PrP) scrapie by inducing a structural change in native prion proteins, which accounts for its infective capacity. It is believed that both the transformation of prion proteins into prions and the accumulation of prions lead to neurodegeneration.
