Opioids produce analgesia by binding to the mu-opioid receptors distributed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) and in many peripheral regions. More specifically, CNS mu-opioid receptors are present in the cerebellum, nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus of the brain, putamen, cerebral cortex, substantia nigra, and spinal cord.
