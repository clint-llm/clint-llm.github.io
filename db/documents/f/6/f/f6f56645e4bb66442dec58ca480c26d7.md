Etiologies of traumatic peripheral nerve injury include high-velocity trauma, lacerations, bone fractures, penetrating injury, crush, traction, ischemia, and less common mechanisms such as thermal, electric shock, radiation, percussion, and vibration.

During wartime (Iraq and Afghanistan), the nerve lesions were predominantly focal prolonged conduction block/neurapraxia in 116 (45%), axonotmesis in 92 (35%), and neurotmesis in 53 (20%) and were evenly distributed between the upper and the lower limbs.

In the USA and Canada, during non-conflict time, the etiology usually is motor vehicle accidents.
