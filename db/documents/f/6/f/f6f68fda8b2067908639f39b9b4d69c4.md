Patients with thrombophilia without other risk factors may suffer from protein S deficiency. Alternative causes of thrombophilia include other congenital coagulation abnormalities or a combination of protein S deficiency with other VTE risk factors. Protein S deficiency may also be an acquired condition, rather than congenital, due to conditions including pregnancy, vitamin K deficiency, oral contraceptives, severe hepatic dysfunction, and chronic infections. Differential diagnoses that must be considered in patients with protein S deficiency include:

- Antiphospholipid syndrome

- Antithrombin deficiency

- Factor 5 Leiden mutation

- Protein C deficiency

- Malignancy

- Prothrombin gene mutation

- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria
