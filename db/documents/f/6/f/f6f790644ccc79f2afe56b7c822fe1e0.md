It is essential to know that seborrheic keratoses are benign skin lesions that are very common in the adult and elderly population. Typically, there is no indication for the treatment of SK if there is no suspicion for malignancy. Seborrheic keratosis removal is primarily for aesthetic reasons or secondary to chronic irritation. There are a number of treatment options available, including cryotherapy, excision, and topical hydrogen peroxide solution.
