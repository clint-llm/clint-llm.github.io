The initial presentation of IgA pemphigus is a subacute onset of flaccid pustules on an erythematous base that quickly rupture to form annular crusts over the plaque. Patients often describe the plaques as painful and pruritic. The most common areas of presentation include flexural areas such as the axilla and groin. It is not uncommon, however, for the whole body and trunk to be affected. One key feature that differentiates IgA pemphigus from other blistering diseases is the absence of mucosal involvement. Patient symptoms are usually limited to skin manifestations, and systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, headache, and weight loss are absent.
