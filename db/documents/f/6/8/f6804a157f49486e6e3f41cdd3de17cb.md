This activity outlines the causative factors of wrist instability, clinical diagnostic tests, laboratory investigations, and biomechanism of the wrist instability. The extent of ligamentous or osseous lesions determines the degree of carpal instability. To avoid the high morbidity associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of wrist instability and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of wrist instability.
-  Explain the common physical exam findings associated with wrist instability.
- Review the typical imaging findings associated with wrist instability.
-  Summarize the treatment options for wrist instability for management by an interprofessional team.
