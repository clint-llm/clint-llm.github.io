ACE inhibitors are medications used to treat and manage hypertension, which is a significant risk factor for coronary disease, heart failure, stroke, and a host of other cardiovascular conditions. Most cases are primary and not attributable to any specific etiology. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of ACE inhibitor therapy in the clinical setting related to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with hypertension and its related conditions and sequelae.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of ACE inhibitors.
- Summarize monitoring/follow-up for patients initiated on ACE inhibitor therapy.
- Review the dosing parameters adjusting or replacing ACE inhibitor therapy based on adverse events or inadequate therapeutic response.
- Explain the importance of ACE inhibitor therapy in hypertension management and how it affects therapeutic strategy as it pertains to improving care coordination and communication among the interprofessional team when using these agents to achieve therapeutic outcomes.
