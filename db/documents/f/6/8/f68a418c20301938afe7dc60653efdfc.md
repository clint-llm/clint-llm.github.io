Sinusitis, also referred to as rhinosinusitis, is the symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity mucosa. This inflammation may be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and allergens. Criteria for diagnosing rhinosinusitis were established in 1997 by the Rhinosinusitis Task Force.**either two major factors or one major plus two minor factors**. The diagnostic criteria are as follows:

- **Major**

- 
              
- Purulence on nasal examination
              
              
- Nasal obstruction/blockage
              
              
- Nasal discharge/purulence/discolored posterior drainage
              
              
- Hyposmia/anosmia
              
              
- Fever
              
              
- Facial pain/pressure
              
              
- Facial congestion/fullness

- 
**Minor**

- 
              
- Ear pain/pressure/fullness
              
              
- Cough
              
              
- Dental pain
              
              
- Fatigue
              
              
- Halitosis
              
              
- Fever
              
              
- Headache

Rhinosinusitis may also be classified according to the duration of symptoms. Acute rhinosinusitis lasts fewer than four weeks; subacute sinusitis lasts between 4 and 12 weeks; chronic sinusitis lasts more than 12 weeks. Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis (RARS) is defined as four or more episodes of acute rhinosinusitis per year, each lasting at least ten days, without persistent symptoms in between these distinct episodes.
