As a member of the first-generation class of antihistamines, doxylamine exerts its effects by competitively antagonizing the binding of free histamine at the H1-receptor binding sites. It antagonizes the effects of histamine in the uterus, GI tract, large blood vessels, and bronchial muscles. Doxylamine binds non-selectively to H1-receptors, both centrally and peripherally, contributing to the sedative effects that also make it an effective sleeping aid. However, due to their interactions with receptor residues that remain highly conserved across the aminergic receptors, H1 receptor antagonists can produce several off-target effects; these are anticholinergic. This activity also depresses labyrinthine function, blocks the chemoreceptor trigger zone, and diminishes vestibular stimulation.

Furthermore, doxylamine reduces nausea and vomiting by inhibiting histaminergic signaling to the vomiting center in the medulla.

The drug undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism and is excreted primarily in the urine. It has a half-life of approximately 10 hours, which increases to 12 to 15 hours in the elderly.
