Patients can be reassured that AGEP often resolves by discontinuing the causative agent, time, and symptom-guided therapy. The previously cited case-fatality rate of 2 to 5% cannot be definitively attributed solely to AGEP without other comorbidities.

If the cause of AGEP is ambiguous, patch or intradermal testing may be considered at least six weeks after complete resolution. However, empiric avoidance of the suspected trigger and appropriate documentation of an adverse drug reaction history in the patient's medical record, without confirmatory testing, is also reasonable.
