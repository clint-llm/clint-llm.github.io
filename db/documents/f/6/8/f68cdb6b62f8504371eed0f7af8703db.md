FDG is a glucose analog. Elevated blood glucose levels can competitively inhibit FDG uptake leading to a suboptimal or non-diagnostic scan. For this reason, patients should fast for 4 to 6 hours before the FDG injection. Parenteral feeds and dextrose-containing fluids should be stopped for 4 to 6 hours. Blood glucose levels should be checked before the FDG injection.

Patients with elevated blood sugar levels above 200 must be rescheduled. Patients should be instructed to avoid chewing gum during this time interval as the gum might contain sugar, and chewing can lead to increased FDG uptake in the muscles of mastication.

Exogenous insulin shortly before the FDG injection can lead to increased FDG uptake in the muscles and reduced tumor uptake, decreasing the study's sensitivity. Diabetic patients dependent on insulin should avoid long-acting insulin for 12 hours before the FDG administration. Short-acting insulin should be withheld for 1 to 2 hours. If possible, patients with diabetes should be scheduled in the morning.

Patients should refrain from strenuous physical activity 24 hours before the study, as exercise can lead to increased FDG uptake in the skeletal muscles.

Avoid exposure to cold during the exam and FDG uptake time. Warm blankets should be provided to avoid brown adipose tissue uptake.

The patient should be well hydrated.

For females of childbearing age, pregnancy tests should be obtained as per the institutional protocol.
