The cornerstone mechanism of pacemaker mediated tachycardia, which is retrograde VA conduction, is observed in about 30-80% of patients with pacemakers. It is more common in patients with sick sinus syndrome and AV block, among other indications for pacemaker implantation.

One study reported that around 20% of patients where VA conduction is present and 6% of all patients with pacemakers had at least one documented episode of pacemaker mediated tachycardia.
