There are no contraindications to hearing screening in newborns and children. Patients with congenital aural atresia or other visible ear deformities may not need to undergo screening while in the newborn nursery, as it would be expected to be abnormal, but should always have a referral placed immediately for comprehensive audiology evaluation to guide the next steps.
