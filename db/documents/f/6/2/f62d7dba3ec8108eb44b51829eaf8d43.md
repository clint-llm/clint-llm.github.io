Anaplasma phagocytophilum has an incubation period of 1 to 2 weeks. Most infections are probably subclinical. Clinical manifestations range from mild to severe and include fever, malaise, myalgias, and headache. Less than 50% of cases present with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, arthralgias, stiff neck, and confusion.

Physical exam findings include fever, diffuse muscle tenderness, and in patients coinfected with Borrelia burgdorferi,Â a rash may be seen; however, a rash is uncommon and is identified in approximately 10% of cases. Also, patients coinfected with Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) or Lyme disease may present with a rash.

Approximately one-third to one-half of symptomatic cases require hospitalizations due to the severe presentation, and 3% to 7% have life-threatening complications. These severe manifestations include respiratory insufficiency, septic shock, multiorgan failure, rhabdomyolysis, and opportunistic infections.

The involvement of the central nervous system is rare in HGA, with meningoencephalitis occurring in 1% of the cases. However, manifestations of peripheral nervous system involvement include brachial plexopathy, cranial nerve palsies, demyelinating polyneuropathy, and bilateral facial nerve palsy. Neurologic function recovery may take several months.
