Most cases of trigeminal neuralgia are due to trigeminal nerve compression. It is believed that TN is related to nerve demyelination occurring around the site of compression. The mechanism of how demyelination leads to the symptoms of TN is not known. It is thought to be due to the ectopic impulse generation set up by the demyelinated lesion, thereby causing ephaptic transmission.

A triggered episode followed by refractory periods and a single stimulus leading to painful sensations indicates the possible role of the central pain mechanism in TN. Altered grey matter in the sensory and motor cortex has also been described.

Some theories describe demyelination secondary to vascular compression of the nerve root by tortuous or aberrant vessels. Radiologic and pathologic studies have demonstrated the proximity of the trigeminal nerve root to such vessels. The vessel mostly implicated is the superior cerebellar artery.

According to the bio-resonance hypothesis, when the vibration frequency of the trigeminal nerve and the surrounding structures come close to each other, the trigeminal nerve fibers are damaged, leading to abnormal transmission of impulse, thereby resulting in facial pain.

Multiple other conditions like amyloid infiltration, bony compression, arteriovenous malformation, and small infarcts in the medulla and pons have been described to cause TN.

**Classification
**

TN is divided into classic TN, secondary TN, and idiopathic TN in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, Third Edition (ICHD-3)

**Classic TN:**This includes TN related to vascular compression.

**Secondary TN:**This includes TN due to a tumor along the trigeminal nerve or TN due to an underlying disease like multiple sclerosis.

**Idiopathic TN:**This is when the cause is unknown.
