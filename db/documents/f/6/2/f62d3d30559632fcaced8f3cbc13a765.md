While Brudzinski's sign is commonly used to assess for meningitis, it has limitations in the diagnosis of meningitis. Brudzinski's sign has low sensitivity but high specificity for detecting meningitis. For Brudzinski's sign, estimates are that the diagnostic sensitivity is between 2 and 43%, and the specificity for meningitis is between 80 to 100%.

An additional limitation of Brudzinski's sign is the fact the sign is not useful in certain populations. In very young (less than 2 months), immunocompromised and elderly patients, Brudzinski's sign may be absent despite severe disease.
