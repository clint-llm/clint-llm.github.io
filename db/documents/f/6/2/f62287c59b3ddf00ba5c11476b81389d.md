Microbiological work requires culture media and containers free of all contaminating microorganisms. There are two methods used to kill microorganisms in a sample.

**Sterilization**

Sterilization is defined as removing all organisms, such as viruses, bacteria, bacterial spores, fungi, and fungal spores, be it pathogenic or non-pathogenic in nature. It is used for culture media, suspended fluids, chemical reagents, containers, and other laboratory equipment.

**Methods of Sterilisation**

The methods used to achieve an absolute germ-free state are heat (dry heat and moist heat), ionizing radiation (beta electrons and gamma photons irradiation), filtration, and chemical disinfection (gases: ethylene oxide and liquids: glutaraldehydes).

**Autoclave**

Articles in an autoclave are exposed to moist heat (steam) at temperatures higher than 100 degrees centigrade (mostly 121 degrees centigrade) and pressure greater than the atmospheric pressure. This causes denaturation of protein, destroying the bacterial endospores as well as vegetative cells. Autoclaving is an important method to sterilize most bacteriological culture media, linen, and surgical instruments. The efficiency of an autoclave is checked with chemical and biological controls. The chemical controls include Browne's tube and Bowie Dick tape. The spores of bacillus stereothermophillus are employed as biological control and tested for viability after autoclaving.

**Filtration**

Filtration is another method of sterilization and is used for attaining bacteria-free solutions and fluids. Filtration is used for materials that are heat-sensitive such as antisera and toxins. There are two types of filtration methods.

- Surface filtration

- Depth filtration

In surface filtration, a medium with pores (filter papers, membranes, sieves) is used, and liquids are run through it. Particles that are bigger than the pores' size are retained on the surface of the medium, and the remaining filtrate is collected at the bottom.

Depth filtration follows a similar mechanism as surface filtration, but the particles are retained on the surface and the body of the filter. The fibers network is arranged in such a manner that they retain bi particles. Examples include earthenware (Berkfield and Chamberland), asbestos (Seitz), sintered glass, and cellulose membrane.

**Disinfection**

Disinfection implies killing most vegetative forms of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites but does not completely eradicate spores and non-vegetative forms. They kill by destroying proteins, lipids, or nucleic acids in the cell itself or its cell membrane. They are particularly used to disinfect surfaces that contact body fluids, tissues, pathological tissue, or samples and microbiological cultures. They are mainly classified into antiseptics and disinfectants.

Antiseptics are diluted forms of disinfectants and are non-toxic for living tissue. Examples include spirit, povidone, alcohol, etc.

Disinfectants are concentrated forms of chemicals and are corrosive to living tissues. They disinfect non-living objects. Examples include phenolic compounds (phenol, Lysol), halogen compounds (chlorine), metallic salts (mercuric chloride, silver nitrate 1%), formaldehyde, volatile solvents (ethyl alcohol, acetone), gaseous disinfectants (gentian violet, potassium permanganate), soaps and detergents.

**Titration**

It is a procedure used to identify the quantity of acid or base in a solution with an indicator's help. It helps find an estimate of acids and bases in body fluids such as gastric juice HCl.

**Electrophoresis**

It is based on the mechanism of the mobility of ions in an electric field. Positively charged ions attract o negative electrode (cathode), and negatively charged ions migrate towards a positive electrode (anode). It is used for the identification and quantification of abnormal patterns of proteins in disease processes. It delineates normal and abnormal protein bands, normal and abnormal hemoglobin, quantification of lipoproteins and isoenzymes.

**Chromatography**

This is a technique that involves separating pure substances from mixtures. It is based on the fact that different substances follow moving solvents at different speeds. There are two main types.

- Column chromatography

- Layer chromatography

- Thin-layer chromatography

- Liquid chromatography

- High-performance liquid chromatography

Some of the chromatography applications include identifying, quantifying, and analyzing drugs, drug metabolites, toxic materials, hemoglobin variants, amino acids and carbohydrates, hormones, etc., in a sample.

**Molecular Techniques**

Molecular biology involves amplifying small genetic material (DNA/RNA) and its detection using electrophoresis, ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), and chemiluminescence. Examples of amplification techniques are as under:

- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)

- Ligase chain reaction (LCR)

- Nucleic acid-based amplification (NASBA)

- Strand displacement assays (SDA)

PCR has useful applications in cases of infectious diseases (tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, EBV, HIV), genetic disorders (thalassemia, inborn errors of metabolism, insulin gene mutations, cystic fibrosis, muscle dystrophies), antenatal diagnosis, oncogenes, medicolegal science, and tissue typing.
