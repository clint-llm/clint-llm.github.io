Refractory non-infectious tenosynovitis and any form of infectious tenosynovitis may warrant consultation of an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation and treatment, including surgery. The consultation of an infectious disease specialist may also be beneficial in patients suffering from infectious tenosynovitis where narrowing or broadening of antibiotic coverage and determining the length of treatment is necessary; this can include a consult with a board-certified infectious disease pharmacist. Rheumatology may be able to further assist in the causes and treatment of the non-infectious etiologies of tenosynovitis. The inclusion of radiology in the assessment of the tenosynovitis can additionally support the interprofessional team by providing the imaging findings and their associated interpretations. Orthopedic nursing staff can serve as a coordination point for all these various disciplines, ensuring all providers are informed and on the same page.

In summary, tenosynovitis requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
