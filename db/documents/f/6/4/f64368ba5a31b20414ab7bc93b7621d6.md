Hypersensitivity reaction on administration, due to octreotide or any of its components, is the main contraindication to its future use. Octreotide should also be used very cautiously in patients with insulinoma and type 2 diabetes mellitus who require intensive blood glucose monitoring and control because it can lower glucose levels dramatically and reduce the insulin requirements in these patients by up to 50%. Therefore, serum glucose concentrations should be monitored carefully during octreotide therapy. Octreotide also increases the bioavailability of bromocriptine by up to 40%, which is a matter of concern because octreotide and bromocriptine are both used to treat acromegaly. Octreotide may also lead to bradycardia, arrhythmias, or conduction defects and, therefore, should be used with caution in the at-risk groups of patients.
