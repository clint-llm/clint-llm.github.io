Adenosine is administered intravenously in specific clinical cases. To manage supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), adenosine is ideally given through a peripheral intravenous (IV) access as a 6 mg dose followed by a 20 mL saline flush for rapid infusion. Subsequent doses start at 12 mg, followed by 20 mL of saline for rapid infusion.

Administration for pharmacological cardiac stress testing is intravenouslyÂ as well; however, in a continuous fashion rather than bolus therapy as with SVT. The dose of adenosine used in cardiac stress testing is weight-based and usually administered as 140 mcg/kg per minute.
