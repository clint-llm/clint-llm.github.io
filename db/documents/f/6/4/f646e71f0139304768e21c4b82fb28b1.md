Since orbital pseudotumor is diagnosed by excluding other diseases, the health care team should consist of an interprofessional team of pediatricians, primary care physicians, internists, rheumatologists, endocrinologists, allergologists, immunologists, radiologists, and auto-immune disease experts. A comprehensive systemic examination by qualified medical personnel and carefully documented history are vital to the ophthalmologist’s diagnosis and management. The use of systemic therapy should involve a follow-up with physicians to monitor the side effects or complications of treatment. The patient or the patient’s family should be always be informed of his prognosis at each stage of the disease and be actively involved in the choice of diagnostic procedures and management. Ophthalmology nurses often arrange follow-ups with patients, provide education, and report back to the team. Pharmacists review prescriptions for dosage and interactions. They assist the team by educating patients about the importance of compliance and discuss side effects. These are examples of how the interprofessional team approach can improve patient outcomes in orbital pseudotumor cases. [Level 5]
