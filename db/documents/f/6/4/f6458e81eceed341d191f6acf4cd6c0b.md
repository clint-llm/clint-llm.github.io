A prism is a transparent, triangular refracting surface with an apex and a base.

Charles Prentice was the first to introduce the term prism diopters to describe the intensity of prism. One prism diopter represents the deviation of light by 1 centimeter and perpendicular to the initial direction of the light ray on a plane placed 1 meter away from the prism. The power of the prism in prism diopters is represented by the symbol D. Thus, a prism of 2 prism diopters would deviate a light ray by 2 centimeters, perpendicular to the direction of the initial light ray, measured 100 cm beyond the prism.

Another unit of measurement of prism power is centrad. This is less frequently used as compared to prism diopters. Centrad unit is represented by the symbol Ã‘. One centrad represents the deviation of light by 1 centimeter and perpendicular to the initial direction of the light ray on an arc of a circle 1 meter away from the prism.
