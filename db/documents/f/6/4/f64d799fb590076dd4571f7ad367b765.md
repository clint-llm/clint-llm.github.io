VT is the most common cause of WCT, and the severity of its complications is determined by the duration and frequency of the arrhythmia and predisposing risk factors. VT most commonly occurs in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease (i.e., coronary artery disease, myocardial infarctions, structural heart disease). Common complications of VT include frequent episodes of syncope (and associated physical injuries sustained during the syncopal event) as well as decreased efficiency of the heart to pump blood, which could lead to heart failure. Although a history of cardiovascular disease poses its own risk for complications, this, in conjunction with VT, has increased risk for the most feared complication - sudden cardiac death. This fatal complication is defined as a death that occurs unexpectedly, immediately or an abrupt change in a patientâ€™s clinical presentation within one hour from the onset. Sudden cardiac death is believed to be secondary to VT deteriorating to the lethal Vfib arrhythmia.

In the United States, sudden cardiac death consists of 15% of the total causes of mortality and greater than half of all cardiac-related deaths. It is also important to keep in mind that a small portion of sudden cardiac deaths are from inherited familial disorders and should be carefully evaluated in patients with family members who were young, and died suddenly/unexpectedly.
