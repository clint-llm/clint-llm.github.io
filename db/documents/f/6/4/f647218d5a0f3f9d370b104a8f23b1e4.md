Subclavian steal syndrome (SSS), now termed subclavian-vertebral artery steal syndrome, refers to the diversion of blood flow away from its normal target and the arm. It is a cause of syncope or presyncope related to cerebral hypoperfusion that occurs during arm use. This condition commonly results from arteriovenous malformations that are either congenital or iatrogenic. A coronary variant of subclavian-vertebral artery steal syndrome can occur as an adverse effect of coronary artery bypass when using the arm on the same side of the internal mammary artery graft used to bypass the narrowed or obstructed coronary vessel. This variant usually results in symptoms of cardiac ischemia such as angina or, in severe cases, can cause myocardial infarction. The defining feature of subclavian-vertebral artery steal syndrome is the pathophysiologic phenomenon of taking blood flow away from the vertebrobasilar or coronary circulation and diverted to the arm. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of subclavian-vertebral artery steal syndrome and reviews the role of interprofessional team members in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the differential diagnosis of subclavian-vertebral artery steal syndrome.
- Describe the evaluation of subclavian-vertebral artery steal syndrome.
- Explain how to properly manage a patient affected by the subclavian-vertebral artery steal syndrome.
- Review the role of interprofessional team members in optimizing collaboration and communication to ensure high-quality care for patients with subclavian-vertebral artery steal syndrome, thereby leading to enhanced outcomes.
