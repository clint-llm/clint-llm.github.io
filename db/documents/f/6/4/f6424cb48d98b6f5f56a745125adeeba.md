Microscopically corneal arcus presentsÂ as non-unique lipid infiltration. On histologic analysis, the lipids can often be visualized in the peripheral regions of the cornea, and notably, the central corneal regions are often spared. The lipid deposition usually occurs in the extracellular region. This being said, the diagnosis of corneal arcus is made visually with a slit-lamp examination, and histologic analysis is not the standard of diagnosis in a clinical setting.
