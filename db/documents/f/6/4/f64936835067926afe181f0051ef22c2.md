Fractures of the naso-orbito-ethmoid (NOE) complex resulting from high-energy trauma to the face can have significant ramifications due to the NOE complex's relationship with adjacent structures. These injuries present challenges to surgeons because the anatomy of the NOE region is intricate, and the consequences of damage in the area can be difficult to rectify. This activity will outline the etiology, pathophysiology, anatomy, management, and complications of NOE fractures and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with these injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of naso-orbito-ethmoid complex fractures.
- Describe the anatomy of the naso-orbito-ethmoid complex.
- Review the assessment of naso-orbito-ethmoid complex fractures.
- Explain the management options available to treat patients presenting with naso-orbito-ethmoid complex fractures.
