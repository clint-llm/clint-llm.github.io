Adverse effects of rivastigmine have received thorough study as it has been on the market for some time. The main adverse effects associated with the use of rivastigmine are gastrointestinal. The primary symptoms are nausea and vomiting. These acute effects primarily occur during the initial dose-escalation phase of therapy with upward dose titration of the drug to achieve a therapeutic dose. These events can be minimized using a slow titration schedule and taking the medication with food if prescribing an oral formulation. In a study done to analyze the safety and tolerability of cholinesterase inhibitors used to treat Alzheimer dementia, researchers found rivastigmine to be the drug to have the highest rate of gastrointestinal side effects.

Common adverse effects include extrapyramidal symptoms, sleep disturbances, muscle cramps, and weakness. These issues are less frequent during the maintenance phase of therapy when the dose is not adjusted, but when the drug is being taken for an extended period, central nervous system effects can occur. However, these central nervous system effects are rather rare in rivastigmine and are more common with its counterpart drug, donepezil.

Studies have shown that using the transdermal patch to deliver rivastigmine is associated with fewer reports of nausea and vomiting.

Long-term use of rivastigmine has also been associated with an increased risk of death compared to patients treated with donepezil.
