Based on the latest U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the recommendation is to initiate the screening at age 50 in all individuals and continuing until age 75 years. For adults aged 76 to 85 years, the decision should be individualized, considering the patient’s overall health and screening history. Screening for polyps is usually performed by testing for fecal occult blood and the gold-standard colonoscopy. As mentioned earlier, polyps are mostly asymptomatic but can bleed. Colorectal polyps can be detected using a fecal occult blood test, digital rectal examination, flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, barium enema, or a pill camera. Colonoscopy and the subsequent pathological examination are necessary for a definitive diagnosis of the type of the tumor. Apart from the screening, surveillance colonoscopy should continue for the previously detected polyps.

If no polyps appear on the initial colonoscopic evaluation, the suggested follow-up colonoscopy is within ten years. Surveillance of previously detected polyps includes follow-up colonoscopy in three to five years based on the initial resected polyp size and microscopic dysplastic features. If the examiner detects more than ten adenomas or even an adenoma showed villous features, screening is recommended in less than three years, while for 3 to 10 adenomas, repeat screening should take place in 3 years. If only 1 to 2 small tubular adenomas are present, the interval can extend for 5 to 10 years.

There have been reports of up to 25% of missed adenomas during colonoscopy because of poor colon preparation and suboptimal visualization behind mucosal folds. Flat lesions on the right side of the colon can be particularly difficult to detect. Recent studies have aimed to detect more cases using accessory diagnostic devices (cap assistance, third eye retro-scope, endo-cuff) and by improving the endoscope design with a full spectrum endoscopy system, balloon-assisted colonoscopy, and confocal laser endo-microscopy.
