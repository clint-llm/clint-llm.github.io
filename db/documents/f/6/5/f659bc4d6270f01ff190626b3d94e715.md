Detecting errors in bowel formation may occur in-utero in cases such as intestinal atresia or omphalocele, during the early postnatal period in cases such as Hirschsprung disease or may go undetected in cases such as malrotation. Prenatal ultrasound can detect polyhydramnios, which is a condition that can occur when the fetal gastrointestinal tract does not process the amniotic fluid produced by the fetal kidneys.
