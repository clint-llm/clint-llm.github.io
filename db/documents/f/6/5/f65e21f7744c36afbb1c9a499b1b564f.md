The most common ocular adverse reaction following netarsudil ophthalmic solution is conjunctival hyperemia. Conjunctival hyperemia is due to rho kinase-mediated inhibition of calcium sensitization, resulting in blood vessel smooth muscle relaxation on the conjunctiva. Administering netarsudil at night can mitigate this adverse drug reaction. The severity of conjunctival hyperemia may reduce with time.

Other common adverse drug reactions include corneal verticillata. Corneal verticillata occurred in about 20% of the patients in controlled clinical studies. Cornea verticillata, also called vortex keratopathy, is a condition characterized by corneal deposits at the level of the basal epithelium forming a faint golden-brown whorl pattern. Vortex keratopathy usually resolves after cessation of netarsudil treatment.

A subconjunctival hemorrhage is the second most common adverse drug reaction of netarsudil therapy. A subconjunctival hemorrhage is usually a tiny, unilateral petechial micro hemorrhage around the limbus. Subconjunctival hemorrhage was self-limiting in most patients and typically resolved with continued use of netarsudil. Additional adverse drug reactions to netarsudil therapy are mild. These adverse drug reactions include corneal staining, headaches, blurry vision, instillation site pain, and erythema.
