As for any procedure, the patient should be prepared adequately. The first step is to have the patient positioned ideally on the bed. The body should be located just at the head of the bed so that the occiput is supported on the edge. The head is placed in neutral alignment with the vertebral axis, and if the cervical spine is stable, the head is slightly extended to achieve the 'sniffing' position. The bed is then placed at the level of the xiphoid process of the provider.

If time allows, denitrogenation of the lungs should be performed. This is accomplished with 100% oxygen via a facemask for eight vital capacity breaths or threeÂ minutes before administration of an induction dose of either propofol or etomidate

All required equipment should be immediately available at the bedside, and all necessary medications should be drawn up in syringes. Reliable intravenous access should be confirmed prior to intubation.
