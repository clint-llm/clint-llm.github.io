After the reduction of simple dislocations, an early range of motion is permitted, but extension past neutral is restricted by a dorsal extension block splint. While after the reduction of complex dislocations, two weeks of MCP joint immobilization is done in 30 degrees of flexion with a removable dorsal extension block splint. Gentle mobilization and range of motion exercises are started intermittently. Following the removal of the splint, the following activities are started: fist-making, finger lifting, passive stretching, full range of motion, and eccentric exercises to strengthen the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. To ensure that the lateral bands glide smoothly, the distal interphalangeal joint needs to be mobilized immediately.
