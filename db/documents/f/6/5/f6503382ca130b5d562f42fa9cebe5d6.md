The complications of invasive Candida auris infection vary depending on the extent of the infection, host co-morbidities, and resistance patterns. While the most common presentation of Candida auris infection occurs as bloodstream infection (fungemia), it may spread hematogenously to seed differentÂ organs and cause multi-organ dysfunction. Conversely, a localized infection may eventually become an overwhelming bloodstream infection and have further complications such as sepsis, multi-organ system failure involving the kidneys, heart, lungs, eyes, brain, liver, and spleen, and ultimately death.
