Splints are placed to immobilize musculoskeletal injuries, support healing, and to prevent further damage. The indications for splinting are broad, but commonly include:

- Temporary stabilization of acute fractures, sprains, or strains before further evaluation or definitive operative management

- Immobilization of a suspected occult fracture (such as a scaphoid fracture)

- Severe soft tissue injuries requiring immobilization and protection from further injury

- Definitive management of specific stable fractureÂ patterns

- Peripheral neuropathy requiring extremity protection

- Partial immobilization for minor soft tissue injuries

- Treatment of joint instability, including dislocation
