Post-myocardial infarction VSR occurs in 1% to 3% of patients with STEMI in the absence of reperfusion therapy and in 0.2% to 0.34% of patients who receiveÂ fibrinolytic therapy. Among those who have received reperfusion therapy, it occurs more commonly in those who have received fibrinolytic therapy rather than percutaneous coronary intervention. The incidence of VSR increases to 3.9% in patients with cardiogenic shock as a complication of STEMI.
