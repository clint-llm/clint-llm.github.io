The optic tract nerve fibers arise from the neural ectoderm, which also gives rise to several other ocular structures, including the neural retina, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), optic nerve and chiasm fibers, neuroglia, ciliary body epithelium iris epithelium, and the iris sphincter and dilator muscles. The inner surface of the neural tube indent into bilateral optic pits before the closure of the neural tube. By day 25 of gestation, after neural tube closure, expansion of these optic pits form sac-shaped extensions referred to as optic vesicles, which are continuous with the neural tube lumen. The optic vesicle continues to evaginate while tissue connecting the optic vesicles to the neural tube constricts, forming the optic stalk, which is continuous with space that will form the third ventricle. The optic vesicle wall will thicken and flatten to form the retinal disc. Invagination of the lower wall of the optic vesicle and stalk create the optic fissure, which pulls inferiorly on the retinal disc to place it approximately in the location of the future retina.

The optic fissure fuses at seven weeks of gestation, resulting in two layers of the optic cup and stalk, both derived from neural ectoderm. The outer layer of the cup spawns the RPE, outer pigmented ciliary body epithelium, and the anterior iris epithelium. The inner optic cup layer becomes the neural retina, inner non-pigmented epithelium of the ciliary body, and the posterior iris epithelium. After approximately week seven, the inner layer of the optic cup is composed of inner and outer neuroblastic layers as a result of neural retinal cells proliferating and migrating; both layers are complete at three months, with differentiation beginning in the central retina followed by the periphery. Retinal ganglion cells and supporting amacrine cells differentiate within the inner neuroblastic layers and send out axonal processes beginning in week eight. Programmed cell death within the inner layer of the optic stalk allows for the passage of RGC axon growth and development. RGC axonal processes continue through the optic stalk and terminate in the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus with contributions from MÃ¼ller cells and several biomolecular agents to guide directional axonal growth. Continued apoptosis of optic nerve ganglion cells continues from month 2 to month 8, as axon numbers decreased from approximately 2.6 million to 1.1 million, respectively; this allows for increases in supporting neuroglial and connective tissue cells within the optic nerve.
