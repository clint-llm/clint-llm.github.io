Anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome is a relatively rare condition that is mainly treated by podiatrists, orthopedic surgeons, and physical therapists. If surgeryÂ is the chosen therapeutic course, then other healthcare providers will join the team, such as perioperative nurses, anesthesia staff, and pharmacists. The literature is scarce, with only citations of level V case reports.

The nurses assist with coordination of care and followup. They should also assist the interprofessional team in providing patient and family education. The pharmacist should assist with providing medication reconciliation and the success of pain medication. Both the foot and nail care nurse and pharmacist should work with the clinician in making sure pain is relieved while avoiding opioid addiction. Patients may experience side effects of medications used to relieve pain, and the interprofessional team should work together to identify these side effects and offer viable alternatives. The best outcomes are achieved by a coordinated interprofessional team effort to evaluate and treat patients with anterior tarsal tunnel syndrome. [Level V]
