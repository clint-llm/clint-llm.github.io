Hand and wrist injuries afflict a wide range of the adult and pediatric general population groups.  Further, they can potentially impact patients of all ages and activity levels.  Thus, not only do these injuries occur in high-level, professional athletes, but they can occur secondary to low-energy trauma (e.g., ground level falls in the elderly) during normal daily activities.

Splinting about the wrist, in general, serves a potential role in the initial (or definitive) stabilization of the wrist and periarticular joint injuries.  Splinting can be effective as a temporary immobilization measure and provides adequate protection from further soft tissue injury secondary to the structural support when the technique is performed correctly.  Acute injuries are akin to this modality as splinting (as opposed to casting) accommodates for the anticipation of swelling.

Thumb spica splinting is an important technique for clinicians and healthcare providers at all levels and specialties given the potential utility it can have for the temporary or definitive immobilization depending on the specific type of injury under consideration.
