Almost always, women who are experiencing early pregnancy problems, such as vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain, will come to the clinic to receive a consultation. The clinician may administer a progesterone test, and progesterone levels could be indicative of numerous things.

To ensure ovulation has occurred, progesterone can be measured in the serum, or its metabolite can be measured in urine. A serum progesterone level of >3 ng/ml in the luteal phase indicates that ovulation has occurred.

Finally, another test completed with progesterone is called the progestin-challenge test. In this test, exogenous progesterone (such as medroxyprogesterone) is administered to the patient. The progesterone is then stopped, and in normal conditions, withdrawal bleeding should occur. However, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, three possible causes could be at the root: there is not enough estrogen to allow the endometrium to grow, the endometrium has suffered an injury, or the outflow of the blood is blocked.
