These children will present with multiple days of fever and generalized malaise. On physical exam, one will often find one or more of the diagnostic criteria listed below. It is important to get a full history because meeting any of the diagnostic criteria at any point during the illness count toward the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease, even if not present at the time of evaluation.  There are three principal stages of the disease process: acute, subacute, and convalescent.

A variety of less common manifestations include abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea in 20%; hepatitis; parotitis; intussusception; joint pain in between 15-50%, especially the larger weight-bearing joints

In 2014, the American Heart Association (AHA) published the criteria needed to establish a diagnosis.must have fevers for five or more days, with at least four of the following criteria (either all at once or over a series of days):

- Bilateral painless bulbar conjunctival injection without exudate

- Erythematous mouth and pharynx, strawberry tongue or red, cracked lips

- Polymorphous exanthem (morbilliform, maculopapular, or scarlatiniform)

- Swelling of hands and feet with erythema of the palms and soles

- Cervical lymphadenopathy (over 1.5 cm in diameter)

Patients will typically have a patchy generalized macular erythematous rash over the trunk and extremities that appears within 5 days of the fever, and mocks a viral exanthem or drug eruption, but will lack pruritus.
