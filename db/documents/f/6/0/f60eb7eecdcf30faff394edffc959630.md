Reported side effects in a meta-analysis of other random, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies versus placebo are as follows

- Headache

- Epistaxis

- Upper respiratory complaints include infection, sore throat, cough, and sinusitis.

- Rash

- Asthma

- Infection

- GI symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea

- Leukopenia

- Back pain

- Weakness

- Sedation/drowsiness

- Dry mouth

The most frequently occurring side effects are drowsiness, fatigue, and dry mouth, which may occur in larger doses.

Post-marketing surveillance has reported rare cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis induced by fexofenadine.

**Drug-Drug and Drug-Food Interactions**

- It is essential to note that taking fexofenadine(regardless of the route of administration) with grapefruit, apple, or orange juice decreases bioavailability. This reduced bioavailability is because of the inhibition of the P-glycoprotein transporter (P-gp). Patients should be advised to separate the administration of fexofenadine and any of these juices by at least 4 hours.

- Green tea can decrease the bioavailability of fexofenadine by inhibiting OATP1A2-mediated intestinal absorption of fexofenadine and reducing the efficacy of fexofenadine.

- Betahistine is an antagonist of histamine H3 receptors, a weak agonist of H1 receptors; consequently can decrease the therapeutic potential of fexofenadine.

- Pilolisant is a histamine-3 receptor antagonist and inverse agonist approved for narcolepsy. Concurrent use of antihistamines should be avoided.

- Concurrent administration of apalutamide with transporter substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), i.e., fexofenadine, decreases the AUC of fexofenadine by 30%, which may result in loss of efficacy of fexofenadine.
