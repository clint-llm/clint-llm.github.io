Nitrates increase cGMP formation, while sildenafil inhibits cGMP degradation causing the combination to produce severe life-threatening hypotension synergistically; coadministration of sildenafil with nitrates is contraindicated.[

Similarly, severe hypotension from other causes (e.g., volume depletion) contraindicates using sildenafil. Other contraindications include hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation, pulmonary veno-occlusion, left ventricular outflow obstruction, PAH associated with sickle cell anemia, and multiple system atrophy.

Ischemic optic neuropathy and inherited degenerative retinal disorders contraindicate sildenafil use; discontinuation of sildenafil is recommended if sudden vision loss occurs.
