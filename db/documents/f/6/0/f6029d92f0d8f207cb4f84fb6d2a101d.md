PRES has been a syndrome that has been underdiagnosed, perhaps due to limited awareness; however, given the increasing availability and improvement in the quality of imaging, awareness of PRES has improved, and an understanding of the epidemiology of PRES has been emerging. Based on several reports and studies, PRES affects people of all ages but mostly middle-aged females.

In a retrospective study involving the review of demographics, risk factors, and clinical presentation of 113 patients with PRES, Fugate and colleagues found that 51 individuals (45%) had an autoimmune disease.
