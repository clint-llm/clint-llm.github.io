Hepatic diseases, such as liver cirrhosis, affect drugs eliminated via the liver. Compromise of phase I and II metabolic pathways could lead to increased half-lives of long-acting drugs, contributing to toxicity.  The decline in plasma protein in the setting of liver disease can lead to an increase in unbound drug fraction in plasma.  As liver disease increases in severity, the dose of a drug must be reduced to obtain the same effect. Changes in liver perfusion can also affect the metabolism of drugs. States of decreased blood flow to the liver, such as shock, hypovolemia, or hypotension, can lead to a decline in metabolic rate.

Renal disorders, such as chronic kidney disease, can reduce renal function, hindering drug excretion. As kidney function declines with age, drug excretion becomes less efficient, and dosing adjustments may be needed.  Other than direct renal dysfunction, pathologies that impact renal blood flow or urine flow can affect drug elimination as well. Examples of such disorders are congestive heart failure, liver disease, and pathologies affecting antidiuretic hormone release.
