One may consider a consultation with the medical specialty appropriate to the etiology of the postmenopausal bleeding. An obstetrician-gynecologist is necessary to evaluate and manage many vulvar, vaginal, cervical, and uterine etiologies. A urologist may be more appropriate; on the other hand, if the bladder or urethra is the cause of bleeding.

Consultation with a gynecologic oncologist should be done for patients with a gynecologic malignancy as the etiology of postmenopausal bleeding. Ovarian, fallopian tube cancers, and uterine sarcomas require subspecialist care. It is generally acknowledged that the prognosis is better for patients with gynecologic malignancies who are cared for by gynecologic oncologists.

Gynecologic oncology referral is especially recommended for the following clinical scenarios:

- At the patientâ€™s initial procedure, the option to adequately surgically stage is not available.

- Histology preoperatively is a high risk for extrauterine spread (grade 3, clear cell, papillary serous, carcinosarcoma).

- Unexpected endometrial cancer is found after hysterectomy.

- Evidence is present of endometrial cancer spread to the cervix or outside the uterus (lymph nodes, ovary).

- Recurrent disease.

- The patient is considering non-surgical management
