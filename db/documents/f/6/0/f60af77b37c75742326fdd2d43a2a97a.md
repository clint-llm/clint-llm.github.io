Duplex ultrasound is highly sensitive and specific and is the only preoperative imaging required in most cases.

Arteriography (conventional or CT) is reserved for cases involving restenosis, a history of radiation or prior neck dissection, or atypical findings on duplex ultrasonography.

**Patient Positioning**

The patient should be in a semi-seated position with a small roll across the shoulder blades. This allows for gentle extension and external rotation of the head to the contralateral side.

The ipsilateral arm is tucked, padding the elbow and wrist.

Care should be taken not to over-rotate or extend the head to avoid kinking of the vertebral arteries or contralateral carotid artery.

Landmarks such as the ear lobe, angle of the mandible, mastoid process, sternal notch, and clavicle must be included in the prepared area.
