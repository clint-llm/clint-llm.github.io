Antibiotic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for pinna perichondritis. The management pathway is dependent on the presence or absence of abscess formation.

If an abscess is present, the patient should be admitted to the hospital for definitive treatment. This consists of admission blood tests and preparing the patient for theatre, considering an incision and drainage of the pinna to remove the collection of pus or hematoma.

If there is no abscess present, the patient should be started on both oral and topical antibiotics. Considering the casual organisms, clinicians should initiate an antibiotic regime that provides adequate coverage for both pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus. Clinicians should follow their local antimicrobial prescribing guidelines and seek microbiology advice if unsure.

Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are readily available in both oral and topical forms and provide excellent staphylococcal and pseudomonal cover. However, historically they are avoided in the pediatric population due to side effects of arthralgias and tendon rupture.

Fluoroquinolone antibiotics are well absorbed with good bioavailability, eliminating the need to use intravenous antibiotics unless the patient is nil by mouth or concerned about an unsafe swallow. However, clinicians should not forget this is a painful condition, and therefore adequate analgesia should be prescribed alongside treatment.
