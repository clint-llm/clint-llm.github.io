The lumbar plexus is an essential collection of nerves that arise from mostly the lumbar spinal cord. The term plexus refers to a “web” of nerves that is created just lateral to where T12-L5 exit the spinal cord via intervertebral foramina.  The plexus exists bilaterally and allows nerves to combine with different levels to create multiple functioning nerves that serve to innervate various structures.  This type of nerve web is significant for the formation of larger, longer nerves that target peripheral tissues that altogether primarily help to innervate the portions of lower extremities.  The primary functions of these nerves are motor innervation and sensory nerves to the skin mainly in the lower extremities, although the superior nerves in the plexus do contribute to the lower abdomen and pelvis.  The nerves arising from the lumbar plexus are vital for the functioning of the lower extremity and maintaining the ability to extend the knee, flex the hip, adduct the thigh, and more.
