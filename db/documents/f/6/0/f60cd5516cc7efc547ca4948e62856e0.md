Patients who experience asymptomatic PVCs rarely require any treatment. This is especially true for isolated PVCs. In the emergency room, hypoxic patients need to be provided with oxygen, the electrolyte imbalance should be corrected and drug toxicity should be ruled out. At the same time, an acute MI must be ruled out.

Routine use of lidocaine and other antiarrhythmic medications in the presence of an acute MI is not recommended.

Those experiencing frequent PVCs or symptomatic PVCs should be evaluated to identify the etiology. In many cases, excess intake of stimulants and/or lower levels of potassium and magnesium is the cause of the PVCs. These patients can be easily managed via minimization of stimulants and/or repletion of electrolytes. As well, these management options are viable for those who have asymptomatic and infrequent PVCs but still find them bothersome. Both types of patients also benefit from the minimization of stress.

The medication classes used to treat frequent and/or symptomatic PVCs include antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers. Commonly used antiarrhythmics include amiodarone and flecainide.

Some patients who have very frequent PVCs (e.g., several thousand per day) or symptomatic PVCs refractory to pharmacologic treatment, may be candidates for radiofrequency catheter ablation. This type of procedure is performed by an electrophysiologist who will eliminate the specific area of heart tissue that is causing the ectopic beats. Successful treatment has been shown to reverse PVC-induced cardiomyopathy.
