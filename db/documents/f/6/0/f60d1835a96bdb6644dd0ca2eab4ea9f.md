Chondroblastoma is mostly a benign bone tumor, and patients and their families need education on how to recognize the early signs and symptoms of bone tumors. Patients with signs of bone pain, swelling of bones or joints, any palpable mass found on the bones, fractures not associated with trauma should seek early intervention. Treatment for chondroblastoma is predominantly surgical. Prognosis is usually good once treated. Local recurrence can occur after surgery, and rarely malignant transformation has been reported. Long term follow-up is necessary to monitor these patients closely. The interdisciplinary team includes orthopedics, oncologists, and specialty care nurses. Prompt diagnosis by primary providers with a referral for treatment is paramount. Specialty trained nurses in orthopedics assist in coordinating care, monitoring patients, arrange for follow up, and report problems to the team.
