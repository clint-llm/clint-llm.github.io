Sacroiliac joint pain like most mechanical low back pain has a good prognosis. Patients should avoid bed rest and continue mobilization. Stabilization and stretching exercises are beneficial. Pregnancy-induced sacroiliac joint dysfunction is usually self-limiting and resolves within 12 months postpartum. Expert and specialist advice is required if the pain persists. However, any neurological deficit, bowel or bladder involvement, severe pain even at rest, or pain that disturbs sleep requires urgent medical attention for assessment.
