The serratus anterior muscle, known as the “boxer’s muscle,” receives its innervation solely from the long thoracic nerve, which when damaged results in paralysis of the muscle, a phenomenon known as a winged scapula. The serratus anterior is primarily responsible for protraction of the scapula, a movement occurring when throwing a punch. The serratus anterior works in conjunction with the trapezius muscle to allow for sustained upward rotation of the scapula, which is essential for overhead lifting.

Located deep to the subscapularis, the serratus anterior muscle is subdivided into three components depending upon their origins and points of insertion: serratus anterior superior, serratus anterior intermediate, and serratus anterior inferior. Consequently, the innervation of the serratus anterior varies according to the part of the muscle. The superior segment is innervated by both an independent branch unrelated to the main trunk of the long thoracic nerve as well as by the actual long thoracic nerve. Interestingly, the course of the independent branch mirrors that of the nerves charged with innervation of the levator scapulae muscle, thereby suggesting a relation between the serratus anterior superior and the levator scapulae muscle. The serratus anterior intermediate is innervated by the long thoracic nerve, while the inferior segment receives innervation from two sources, namely the long thoracic nerve and a branch of the intercostal nerve.
