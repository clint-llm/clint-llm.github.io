Lactational mastitis is often preceded by either engorgement or a focally blocked duct. Patients may give a history of these associated symptoms before the development of the classic features of mastitis. Lactational mastitis is characterized by a focal, firm, erythematous, swollen, and painful area of one breast, plus a fever (higher than or equal to 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit). Patients often experience systemic symptoms such as chills, myalgias, and malaise.

Features of periductal mastitis include a periareolar or subareolar mass, that may be associated with pain and erythema. Patients may present with nipple inversion, thick nipple discharge, breast abscess, or draining fistulas.

IGM most often presents with a firm, unilateral breast mass. Other findings can include nipple retraction, skin thickening, axillary adenopathy, ulceration, and abscess formation.
