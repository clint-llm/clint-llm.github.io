The natural course of Graves orbitopathy is varied. Some patients have stable mild orbitopathy, while others may develop either worsening or improvement of the disease after many years. One study showed that the development of moderate-to-severe orbitopathy over 18 months appeared in an average of 2.5% of patients. That same study showed 58% of patients with mild disease went into complete remission.

Regarding the prognosis after treatment with glucocorticoids, which is the mainstay of therapy for active moderate-to-severe disease, a systematic review demonstrated that IV steroids were better than oral with an outcome measurement of symptom reduction. An 82% reduction occurred with IV vs. a 53% reduction with oral therapy.
