Patients with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia may present with jaundice or other signs, or the condition may be noticed in the asymptomatic patient by the finding of high levels of bilirubin in the serum during routine blood testing. As far as the differential diagnosis of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is involved, it requires a detailed history and physical examination of patients for the evaluation. The assessment of the patientâ€™s clinical history includes; age at the disease manifestation, ethnic origin/race, hereditary disorder, family history of anemia or jaundice, recently used medications, diet history, and history of liver disease.

Approximately 50% of neonates present with physiologic jaundice during the first five days after birth. Nonphysiologic, Lucey-Driscoll syndrome, or maternal serum jaundice in neonates results from maternal serum during the initial four days after delivery.
