After the treatment of AKA, it is important to counsel the patients on alcohol abuse disorder and to refer them to alcohol abuse rehabilitation programs. Due to the limited community resources, often patients find themselves without adequate rehabilitation options as well. It is important for inpatient providers to communicate the diagnosis of AKA and associated alcohol abuse disorder with outpatient primary care providers for the patient to ensure the patient is linked with all available resources to help him/her with their alcohol abuse disorder.
