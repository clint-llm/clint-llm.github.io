The most common causes of Brown- Séquard Syndrome can be divided into traumatic and non-traumatic injuries. Traumatic injuries are far more common. Gunshot wounds, stabbings, motor vehicle accidents, blunt trauma or a fractured vertebra from a fall could be among the causes. To a lesser extent, Brown-Séquard Syndrome can result from a vast variety of non-traumatic causes including vertebral disc herniation, cysts, cervical spondylosis, tumors, multiple sclerosis, and cystic disease, radiation, decompression sickness. Other miscellaneous vascular reasons include hemorrhage or ischemia. There could be infectious causes like tuberculosis, transverse myelitis, herpes zoster, empyema, and meningitis.
