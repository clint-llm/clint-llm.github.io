The thyrohyoid membrane has been suggested as a target for an ultrasound-guided block of the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve. Ultrasound-guided in-plane injections have been shown using the thyrohyoid membrane as a target plane for local anesthetic injection. This can provide anesthesia to the base of the tongue, posterior surface of the epiglottis, arytenoids, and aryepiglottic folds and can assist in airway management.
