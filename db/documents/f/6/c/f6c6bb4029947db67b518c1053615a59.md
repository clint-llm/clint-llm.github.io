The domain of primary health care is not only for appropriate screening and apt history, but also abilities to know and find the inherent risk factors which may cause an imbalance in the benefit obtained from screening. Keeping the age and density of breasts into consideration, proper counseling for genetic and familially predisposed patients, a shared opinion approach has to be sought.
