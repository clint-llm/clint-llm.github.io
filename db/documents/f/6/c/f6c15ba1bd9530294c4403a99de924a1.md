Sinusitis is one of the most common health complaints leading to a physician visit in the United States, as well as one of the leading causes of antibiotic prescriptions. In 1 year, there were up to 73 million restricted activity days in patients with sinusitis and total direct medical costs of almost $2.4 billion (not including surgery or radiographic imaging). In addition, up to 14.7% of people in one National Health Interview Survey had sinusitis the preceding year. The newer term is rhinosinusitis because purulent sinus disease without similar rhinitis is rare.

Four classifications:

- Acute rhinosinusitis: Sudden onset, lasting less than 4 weeks with complete resolution.

- Subacute rhinosinusitis: A continuum of acute rhinosinusitis but less than 12 weeks.

- Recurrent acute rhinosinusitis: Four or more episodes of acute, lasting at least 7 days each, in any 1-year period.

- Chronic rhinosinusitis: Signs of symptoms persist 12 weeks or longer.
