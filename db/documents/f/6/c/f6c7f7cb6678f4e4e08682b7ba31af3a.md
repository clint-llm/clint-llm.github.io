The most common complication for anemias with varying MCV is the lack of treatment and increased mortality. Patients with iron-deficient anemia without supplementation can develop high output heart failure. In addition, lead poisoning can also be fatal without the chelation and removal of the causal agent. Patients with diseases such as SLE can suffer from renal insufficiency without treatment, which is the most common cause of death in these patients. Patients with beta-thalassemia major are the most likely to undergo complications from treatment, such as acquired hemochromatosis. Without chronic chelation, these patients can die from iron intoxication as well as restrictive pericarditis secondary to iron deposition in the pericardium.

As previously stated, folate deficiency can be complicated in pregnant patients causing neural tube defects. Patients with vitamin B12 deficiency can have complications of subacute combined degeneration. Unfortunately, without supplementation, orotic aciduria and Diamond Blackfan anemia are fatal.Â Patients with hepatic insufficiency or cirrhosis can incur a large number of complications ranging from hyperammonemia, ascites, portal hypertension, cardiomegaly, esophageal varices with rupture and hemorrhage, internal hemorrhoids, hepatorenal syndrome, and hepatic encephalopathy. Chronic alcoholism can also lead to these complications due to alcoholic cirrhosis in addition to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome from thiamine deficiency.

Patients with normocytic anemia can have complications ranging from hemoglobinuria, hematuria, syncope, petechial rashes, high fevers, and death. These patients must be treated to avoid complications.
