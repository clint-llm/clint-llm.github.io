Common postoperative complications for osteonecrosis include surgical site infections, prosthesis malfunctions, and neurovascular compromise.

Patient comorbidities greatly influence complication rates as well. For example, patients with sickle cell disease undergoing total joint replacement for AVN had more extended hospital stays, increased likelihood of acute kidney injury, implant failure, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and an overall higher mortality rate.
