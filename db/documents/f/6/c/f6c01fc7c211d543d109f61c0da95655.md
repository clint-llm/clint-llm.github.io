Clinical diagnosis of alkaptonuria can be confirmed with quantitative HGA level analyses and genetic testing. Gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry can be used to detect elevated levels of HGA in urine and serum. Molecular genetic testing for HGD pathogenic variants can also be used for confirmatory diagnosis and genetic counseling for family and future progeny.

After the diagnosis is made, multi-system evaluations for occult manifestations of the disease may be beneficial. This includes radiography, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and renal ultrasound.
