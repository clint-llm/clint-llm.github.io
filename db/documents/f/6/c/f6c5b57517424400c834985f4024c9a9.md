Hair cells are specialized cells that play an essential role in cochlear function. Hair cells are found within the organ of Corti and are divided into inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs). IHCsÂ are the true auditory receptor cells that synapse with bipolar spiral ganglion neurons to send afferent nerve impulses back to the brain via the cochlear nerve. Actin filaments connect the stereocilia at the tips of the IHCs, and mechanically gated potassium channels open in response to vibration leading to afferent cochlear nerve signaling.

Approximately 95% of spiral ganglion neurons synapse on IHCs. The remaining 5-10% of spiral ganglion neurons innervate the OHCs. The OHCs increase the maximum amplitude of the traveling wave of vibration. Efferent nerve fibers from the brain synapse on OHCs and decrease their ability to enhance the amplitude of the vibrational wave.
