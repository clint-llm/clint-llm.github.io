Eumycetoma frequently poses a diagnostic and treatment dilemma. Eumycetoma occurs after a traumatic inoculation of filamentous fungi in barefoot walkers in endemic areas. Physical exam reveals nonhealing, chronic nodules and sinus tracts on the legs of many years duration. Access to health care in regions where eumycetoma is prevalent largely dictates the speed at which it is diagnosed and treatment is initiated.

While a dermatologist, infectious disease specialist, if accessible, are involved in the care of patients with eumycetoma, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a general surgeon or foot surgeon for debulking of lesions. A pharmacist may also ensure oral antifungals are dosed appropriately in the early stages of treatment. Dermatopathologist is involved in the histopathological exam of biopsy specimens and determining an accurate diagnosis. Additional radiologic exams may be needed for long-standing, widespread infections. There are no definitive guidelines for the management of eumycetoma, but rather treatment regimens are based on case series and an exhaustive review of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals.

The outcomes of eumycetoma depend onÂ a swift diagnosis and timely management. However, to improve outcomes, prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended.
