All patients with suspected TCA overdose should be immediately evaluated, and a 12 lead EKG should be obtained. The therapeutic index of TCAs is narrow, and therefore, the ingestion of 10 to 20 mg/kg is potentially life-threatening. Symptoms usually start in 30 to 40 minutes, and signs of toxicity are usually clinically apparent within 2 hours, but delayed toxicity may occur. History of co-ingestion or access to other medications, including acetaminophen and aspirin, is essential. Close attention to the patientâ€™s vital signs and repeated physical examination for evidence of an anticholinergic toxidrome, cardiac toxicity, and neurologic toxicity should be done and will help guide proper management.
