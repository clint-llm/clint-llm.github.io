Child neurologists must work in a timely manner to facilitate early screening and diagnosis. Management of patients in ICU requires a multidisciplinary approach from a team comprising of neurologists, psychiatrists, nutritionists, and physical therapists. Arrangements should be made for social workers, pastoral care, and child life experts to be actively involved in care as children and families find that helpful.

Anti NMDAR encephalitis can be easily diagnosed using serum or CSF sample testing. An index of suspicion should be raised in children, presenting with personality changes, abnormal movements or postures, seizures, autonomic instability, or hypoventilation. It poses considerable difficulty in early diagnosis and treatment. Management may also prove to be clinically challenging as it involves treating both the cause and the symptoms.

The recovery is slow; hence, long-term monitoring is required by an interprofessional team consisting of doctors, and social workers would help decreasing morbidity tremendously. A continuous follow-up by the rehabilitation and neurology team is essential. A psychiatry consultation might be needed for both patients and family members in order to cope during the recovery. Interdisciplinary communication and collaboration are quintessential to good patient outcomes with this condition.
