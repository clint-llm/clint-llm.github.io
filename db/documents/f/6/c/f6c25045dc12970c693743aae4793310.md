Opioids are often prescribed for cancer-related pain and moderate-to-severe chronic pain, especially pain that is inadequately controlled with non-opioid therapies. Clinicians can improve the lives of patients living with pain by applying knowledge regarding opioid equivalent dosing for opioid-tolerant patients eligible for opioid rotation. This activity reviews the importance of establishing and calculating opioid equivalence between various agents when making a therapeutic switch and the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring therapeutic and analgesic efficacy while simultaneously minimizing adverse events.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the concept of opioid equivalence.
- Outline the steps to take to establish opioid equivalence when changing agents.
- Review the monitoring necessary after establishing therapy using opioid equivalence.
- Summarize the importance of having all interprofessional team members coordinating their activities regarding opioid equivalence, pain control therapy, and preventing opioid misuse.
