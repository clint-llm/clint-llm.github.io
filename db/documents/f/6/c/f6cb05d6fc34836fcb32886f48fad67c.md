Patients should receive education about the possible side effects profile associated with imipramine and other tricyclics.; this will help patients make better decisions that fit their health. Before initiating imipramine, it is imperative to discuss with the patient regarding its clinical use and side effects of imipramine and other tricyclic antidepressants. Patient education about warning signs and symptoms that warrant a visit to the emergency department, such as suicidal thoughts, confusion, dizziness, severe palpitations, and vision changes, is vital before initiating therapy as well. Additionally, imipramine should be prescribed within the therapeutic dose with gradual titration as it can be fatal in overdose and require close monitoring. Special precautions merit consideration for anyone on this medication. Parents should be urged to keep the drug in a locked cabinet away from the reach of children.

Managing imipramine therapy requires the efforts of an interprofessional team that includes clinicians, specialists, mid-level practitioners, pharmacists, and psychology professionals, all collaborating and communicating as a cohesive unit and engaging the patient in their own care. Psychoeducation and good interprofessional communication skills between mental and other health providers and patients are of paramount importance for a better outcome. [Level 5]
