Over one-quarter of United States citizens suffer from chronic pain.

How a patient's chronic pain gets managed can have profound and long-lasting effects on a patient's quality of life. The definition of chronic pain is any pain lasting longer than three months. There are multiple sources of chronic pain. Combination therapy for pain includes both pharmacological therapies and nonpharmacological treatment options. There is a more significant reduction in pain with combination therapy compared to a single treatment alone. Escalation of pharmacological therapy is in a stepwise approach. Comorbid depression and anxiety are widespread in patients with chronic pain. Patients with chronic pain are also at an increased risk of suicide. Chronic pain can impact every facet of a patient's life. Thus the diagnosis and appropriate management of patients experiencing chronic pain are critical.
