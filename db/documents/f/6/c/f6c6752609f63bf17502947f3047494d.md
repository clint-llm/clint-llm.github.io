Histopathologic light microscopy in the cases of tubulointerstitial nephritis reveals interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration and edema, regardless of etiology. Inflammatory cells are most commonly lymphocytes, neutrophils, and plasma cells, but drug-induced TIN involves eosinophil infiltration. Esopisnophil's presence is not diagnostic of drug-indued TIN as NSAIDs do not involve eosinophils due to their anti-inflammatory nature. The presence of dominant neutrophils and plasma cells suggests a bacterial infection.

Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy have fewer features and so are not helpful in diagnosis because it is usually negative in patients with drug-induced TIN, and only rarely methicillin-induced TIN shows immunoglobulins at the tubular basement membrane. The granular or linear deposition pattern in immunofluorescence usually indicates autoimmune diseases and minimal change disease treated with NSAIDs.
