An important consideration when evaluating the elbow dislocation is the “terrible triad” when a posterior dislocation occurs with associated radial head and coronoid process fractures. This injury pattern is due to a particularly forceful mechanism that disrupts the LCL and other soft tissues of the elbow joint. Historically, this pattern had very poor outcomes, but newer surgical techniques are proving to lead to more favorable results.
