Sezary syndrome and mycosis fungoides are the most common forms of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). This can be a diagnostic challenge to clinicians as it can mimic benign skin disorders. It is hypothesized that Sezary syndrome can evolve gradually from mycosis fungoides or occur spontaneously. Patients with this condition have skin involvement characterized by erythematous plaques or flat patches which may be single or multiple. The patients need a skin biopsy to evaluate this condition, along with an excisional lymph node biopsy and peripheral smear. This activity describes the presentation of Sezary syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing this malignancy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Sezary syndrome.
- Review the pathophysiology of Sezary syndrome.
- Describe the workup of a patient suspected of having Sezary syndrome.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to educate patients on the management of their severe pruritis and prescribe medications to relieve the itch which will enhance the delivery of care for those with Sezary syndrome.
