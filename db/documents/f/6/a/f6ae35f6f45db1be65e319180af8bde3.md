The long-term prognosis of idiopathic Horner syndrome appears to be benign. Clinically, patients do not generally become worse, and in fact, half of the patients no longer experience anisocoria. Almost a third of patients with ptosis notice spontaneous improvement or complete resolution in a mean duration of 7.9 years after Horner syndrome is diagnosed. In unilateral cases, the oculo-sympathetic defect does not progress to become bilateral. It is possible that new medical disorders later develop between 3 and 20 years after the diagnosis of Horner syndrome; none are usually related to Horner syndrome.
