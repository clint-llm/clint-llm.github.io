The evaluation of a patient with SS includes a biopsy of the mass and radiographic tests. Usually, lab tests are unremarkable, even in patients where SS arises from unusual organs. For example, in patients with prostate involvement of SS, the PSA was reported to be normal. Radiographic tests include computed tomography (CT) scans, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) scans.

**Biopsy of the Mass**

**Pretreatment Biopsy**

- To establish the diagnosis, multidisciplinary and interprofessional planning must be pursued to obtain a pretreatment biopsy. A team of musculoskeletal radiologists and interventional radiologists trained in MSK procedures must perform the procedure. Alternatively, an experienced surgeon (preferably with training in orthopedic procedures) can also perform the procedure. Preferably, the surgeon performing the biopsy will also perform the resection.

- Excisional biopsy is avoided, as it usually results in positive margins and compromises the management of the disease.

- Open biopsy has fallen out of favor for core needle biopsy in the extremity, as the amount of tissue excised is minimized when the biopsy tract is resected during surgery.

- Retroperitoneal synovial sarcoma is diagnosed via a core needle biopsy. However, if the core biopsy is not sufficient, then the resection of the mass may be performed.

**Radiographic Features**

- CT scans show a well-circumscribed mass, usually with punctate and peripheral calcifications.

- CT chest is needed to stage the disease appropriately.

- MRI is useful in diagnosing and initial staging of synovial sarcoma

- Generally, T1-weighted images are dark, and T2-weighted images are bright.
- T2 weighted images often show hypo-, iso-, or hyperintense fat areas. Areas of high T1 signal intensity represent hemorrhage. 
- Smaller lesions (less than 5cm) are usually peripheral and often benign appearing (smooth contours, non-infiltrative, homogenous characteristics)
- Gadolinium-enhanced sequences help in identifying primary cystic synovial sarcoma by demonstrating the solid nodular enhancing component (helps differentiate from periarticular cyst and hematoma)
- MRI can help identify aggressive features like the involvement of adjacent bone, neurovascular encasement, and muscular invasion. 
- Resectability of the tumor is also best determined with MRI

- PET/CT scans are usually ordered to rule out metastatic disease.
