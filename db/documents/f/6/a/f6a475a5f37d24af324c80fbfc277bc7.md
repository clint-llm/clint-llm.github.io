Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is supplementing women with hormones that are lost during the menopausal transition. To relieve the symptoms associated with menopause, conventional HRT includes an estrogen and progesterone component to mimic hormones created by the human ovary. Estrogen therapies are numerous, and include those indigenous to the human ovary, for example, estradiol and estriol. Other estrogenic compounds include conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), the most commonly prescribed estrogen in the United States. They are not identical in their effect on the human body but share the same FDA indications. This activity describes the indications for hormonal replacement therapy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with postmenopausal symptoms.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the different formulas of hormones for replacement therapy.
- Describe the adverse effects and contraindications of hormonal replacement therapy.
- Summarize the indications of hormone replacement therapy.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to ensure the safe use of hormonal replacement therapy and improve outcomes.
