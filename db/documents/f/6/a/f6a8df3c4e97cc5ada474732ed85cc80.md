Initially described by Hildebrand in 1895, Warthin tumor (also known as cystadenolymphoma), is a benign and frequent salivary gland neoplasm. It represents about 2% to 15% of all primary epithelial tumors of the parotid gland. Extra-parotid Warthin tumor is very rare and may occur in the periparotid lymph node, nasopharynx, eyelid, and oral cavity.  Warthin tumor is histologically characterized by a dense lymphoid stroma and a double layer of oncocytic epithelium with a papillary and cystic architectural pattern. Its etiology remains controversial.
