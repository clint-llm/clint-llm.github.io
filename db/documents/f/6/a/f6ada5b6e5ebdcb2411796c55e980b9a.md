Non-ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is usually asymptomatic. However, non-ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm can lead to cardiac arrhythmias; atrial fibrillation and complete heart block have both been described. Non-ruptured Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm thrombosis can lead to coronary ostia occlusion. These patients frequently present with acute coronary syndrome. Non-ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is associated with significant aortic valve regurgitation in 30% to 50% of cases.

Ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm is a feared complication of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. Consequences of rupture typically depend on the anatomical location of the aneurysm. Rupture of the right and noncoronary sinuses typically results in communication between the aorta and either the right atrium or the right ventricular outflow tract, thus creating a left to right shunt, which can lead to right ventricular overload and right-sided heart failure. Left sinus of Valsalva aneurysm rupture is clinically less significant, causing communication to the left atrium or left ventricular outflow tract.
