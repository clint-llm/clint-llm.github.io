The genetic silencing of the 3p25 genetic locus, which houses the Von Hippel landau tumor suppressor gene through various mechanisms that involve a point mutation, insertion, deletion, and epigenetic silencing (via promoter methylation), is the most frequently identified driving event in clear cell carcinoma.

Despite this underlying mechanism, which might lead one to attribute oncogenesis in clear cell carcinoma to a mutation in the VHL tumor suppressor gene only, it is essential to understand that this single event does not have the potential to lead to oncogenesis, as is evidenced by the long latent period, that precedes the development of tumors.

The presence of mutations in BAP 1 (histone deubiquitinase), PBRM1(involved in chromatin remodeling), SETD2 (histone methyltransferase), and KDM 5C and their association with prognosis has led to a proposal to classify renal cell carcinoma based on molecular pathogenesis.
