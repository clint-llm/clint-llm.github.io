Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus have a high burden of renal failure and cardiovascular diseases. They often require a personalized approach based on their genetic predisposition and clinical presentation for glucose control. Further, patients are becoming increasingly resistant to monotherapy with metformin and sulfonylureas. Incretin based therapy can be administered as an alternative and/or combination therapy to standard guidelines.
