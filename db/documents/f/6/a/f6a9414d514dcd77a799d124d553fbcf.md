The safety of the active drug was similar to placebo. Compared with placebo,Â fewer patients receiving angiotensin II required discontinuation of the drug due to serious adverse events. The rates of anticipated adverse events such as tachyarrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, and distal ischemia were similar between the two groups.
