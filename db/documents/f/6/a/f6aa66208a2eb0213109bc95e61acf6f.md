The symptoms of enchondroma are often nonspecific and found as a result of a pathologic fracture/trauma or localized versus radiating pain. The most common presenting symptoms are pain, swelling, and deformity. Pathologic fractures can be seen in 40-60% of patients at presentation.

Nail plate deformity may also be seen in distal phalangeal enchondromas.

A thorough examination of the hand and wrist is necessary for patients with hand enchondromas. Passive movements of the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints need to be evaluated. Specifically, the functions of the flexor and the extensor tendons need to be assessed, as the distal phalangeal tumors can cause avulsion of the flexor tendons.
