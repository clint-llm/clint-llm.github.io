Asthma is not a benign illness and accounts for 1 death per 100,000 people in some countries. The mortality is related to lung function and is exacerbated by smoking. Factors that affect mortality include age more than 40 years, cigarette smoking more than 20 pack-years, blood eosinophilia, FEV1 of 40-70% of predicted, and greater reversibility.
