**Macroscopic findings:**

Gross examination of mucinous carcinoma of the breast shows a glistening gelatinous lesion with pushing margins and a soft consistency that is readily recognizable. The tumors range in size from less than 1 cm to more than 20 cm (mean = 3 cm).

**Microscopic findings:**

Histologically, mucinous carcinoma is characterized by nests of cells floating in lakes of mucin partitioned by delicate fibrous septae containing capillary blood vessels. The cell clusters are variable in shape and size with an occasional tubular arrangement. Nuclear atypia is generally low in classic mucinous carcinoma, but in rare cases, atypia and mitoses may prevail

**Immunohistochemistry:**

Typically, mucinous carcinoma is positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors
