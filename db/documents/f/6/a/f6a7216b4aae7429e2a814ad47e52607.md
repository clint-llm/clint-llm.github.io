Patients with Fuchs uveitis syndrome should be informed about the alarming symptoms of sudden increased IOP. Both pain and a decrease in visual acuity should lead the patient to seek medical care immediately to prevent permanent vision loss. If the patient is diagnosed with FUS early in the disease process, they should become aware of the high probability of acquiring a cataract, the likely need for cataract removal, and prompt surgical treatment for refractory glaucoma.
