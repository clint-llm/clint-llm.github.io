Management and control of tobacco use is four-fold:  1) cessation programs, 2) preventing children and adolescents from smoking, 3) preventing exposure to second-hand smoke, and 4) advocacy to change attitudes toward smoking.  Nurses in various roles, such as school nursing, occupational health, community health, obstetrics, medical-surgical, and research are responsible to assess and intervene to decrease the negative health impact of tobacco.

Tobacco smoking is directly associated with multiple serious health problems that endanger and shorten the life of smokers and those subjected to cigarette smoke.  Special attention must be paid to pregnant tobacco users. Risks for both mom and baby include preterm labor, small for gestational age infants, and a risk for childhood cancers. For an active smoker, quitting smoking has proven to reduce the chances of developing a smoking-related illness.

Daily cigarette smokers keep smoking because they are physically addicted to nicotine, a substance that is naturally found in tobacco leaves. Because nicotine is one of the most addictive substances known to man, TS is often very difficult to quit, often requiring repeated attempts at quitting involving various cessation methods. Five nicotine-based medications (gum, lozenges, inhaler, nasal spray, patch) and 2 non-nicotine-based medications (varenicline and bupropion SR) have been shown to aid in long-term smoking cessation. Recent evidence includes a potential role for cytisine and naltrexone. For patients willing to quit, a combination of counseling and one or more the medications has proven more effective than just counseling or medication alone.
