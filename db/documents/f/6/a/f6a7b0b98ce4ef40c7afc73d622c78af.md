The key regulatory enzymes of glycogenolysis are phosphorylase kinase and glycogen phosphorylase, both activated by phosphorylation. These will predominantly express in the liver, muscle, and brain.

The process of glycogenolysis starts in the muscle due to the activity of the enzyme adenyl cyclase and cAMP. cAMP then binds to phosphorylase kinase and converts it to its active form, which then converts phosphorylase b to phosphorylase a, which finally catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen.

The process of glycogen breakdown can occur either in the cytosol or in the lysosomes. In the cytosol, the enzyme glycogen phosphorylase catalyzes the release of glucose-1-phosphate from the ends of glycogen branches with the use of inorganic phosphate to cleave α-1,4 bonds.

Since the enzyme phosphorylase can only cleave until it is four units from a branch point, when glycogen phosphorylase reaches a branch point that is four glucose residues away, the enzyme glycogen debranching enzyme transfers one of the branches to another chain, forming a new α-1,4 bond and leaving a single glucose unit at the branch point, which is later hydrolyzed by α-1,6-glucosidase, forming free glucose.
