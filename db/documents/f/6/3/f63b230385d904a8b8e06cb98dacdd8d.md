Tofacitinib treatment may also increase the risk for new primary malignancy and opportunistic infections. Severe adverse events include serious infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr Virus (EBV), BK virus(BKV), and tuberculosis(TB), malignancy, lymphoproliferative disorder, and abnormal lab changes(anemia and leukopenia).

Tofacitinib can cause hyperlipidemia. Dose-dependent increases in the levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and total cholesterol have been reported in patients receiving tofacitinib. Long-term safety data showed higher rates of pulmonary embolism and death when using higher-dose tofacitinib (10 mg bid) in RA patients compared to those treated with a TNF inhibitor.
