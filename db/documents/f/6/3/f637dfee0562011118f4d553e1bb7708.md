Clinicians must evaluate all patients who experience acute or progressive back pain, fever, and local spine tenderness for the possibility of the SEA. Despite its sometimes subtle and variable presentation, the diagnosis needs to be considered promptly. Not all symptoms and signs classically attributed to an epidural abscess are present in every patient; especially children may exhibit only atypical features. In patients with a chronic course, fever and systemic complaints may be minimal. Research series have noted that half of the patients with SEA are diagnosed as something else during early evaluations.

IEA can mimic any intracranial mass lesions such as primary or secondary brain tumors, abscesses, hematomas, or subdural empyema. Also in the differential diagnosis is meningitis, vascular inflammations, and giant cell arteritis.
