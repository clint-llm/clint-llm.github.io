Although some clinicians distinguish imperforate hymen from the other Mullerian anomalies due to its unique embryologic origin, urinary tract abnormalities may still be associated with imperforate hymen on presentation due to the effect of the pelvic mass that causes a mechanical obstruction of the urinary tract, leading to urinary retention, hydronephrosis, or acute kidney injury. Ultrasound is a low-cost modality for the detection of urinary tract obstruction and pelvic masses. During the newborn period, caretakers may be advised to notice perineal bulges during hygienic care and to review with a pediatrician or specialist, as appropriate.
