**Prerequisites For Good Anastomosis**

- Adequate blood supply: consider patient factors during surgery (functional like blood pressure or inotropes; organic like peripheral vascular disease, calcified vessels, or thrombosis, plaques)

- Other colonic pathology (diverticulosis, proximal dilatation in obstructed cases)

- Tension-free (adequate length of the bowel, adequate length of the mesentery)

Adequate length of the colonic conduit for anterior resection:

- Divide the IMV as high as possible (landmark is the DJ flexure, divide cephalad to last visible tributary, divide the peritoneum taking care not to injure the marginal artery

- Full mobilization of the splenic flexure. Check that the conduit reaches the symphysis pubis – then it will reach the pelvis for a colorectal anastomosis

- Check that the conduit reaches the symphysis pubis, then it will reach the pelvis for a colorectal anastomosis
