Cavernous angioma may not be diagnosed when it presents as acute intracerebral hematoma on nonenhanced CT or MRI images. Post-contrast enhancement scan reveals cavernous angiomas as areas of nodular enhancement adjacent to the hematoma. Elliptical rather than round shape and loss of brain volume are evidence supporting pure intracerebral hematoma from the underlying cavernoma.

The differential, when cavernous venous malformations are numerous, is that of other causes of cerebral microhemorrhages:

- Cerebral amyloid angiopathy: older adults, usually numerous small foci located in brain periphery

- Chronic hypertensive encephalopathy: hemorrhagic foci  more common in the basal ganglia

- Diffuse axonal injury (DAI): a history of trauma, unconsciousness

- Cerebral vasculitis

- Radiation-induced vasculopathy

- Hemorrhagic metastases: metastatic melanoma, thyroid, renal cell, choriocarcinoma

- Multiple hemorrhages associated with blood dyscrasia (disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, leukemia)

- Occult vascular malformation (thrombosed AVM/aneurysm, capillary telangiectasia)

- Hemorrhagic primary neoplasm
