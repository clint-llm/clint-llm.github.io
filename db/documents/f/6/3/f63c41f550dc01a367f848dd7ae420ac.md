Absolute contraindications for an electrophysiology study are:

- Bloodstream infection or sepsis

- Acute decompensation heart failure that is not precipitated by an arrhythmia, as this may induce an arrhythmia

- Risk of Major bleeding (E.g. supratherapeutic INR, DIC)

- Local infection or thrombosis of access site vessel ( femoral DVT or lower limb cellulitis)
