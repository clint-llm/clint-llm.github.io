The primary complications concerning RBD are the risk of injury and the potential prodromal symptoms linking neurodegenerative alpha-synucleinopathies. The injuries sustained during an event may require immediate medical attention and/or involve sleeping partners causing legal implications. Management for RBD primarily involves injury risk mitigation through behavioral changes and/or pharmacologically. Early diagnosis and management of RBD provide a therapeutic window to treat the potential underlying neurodegenerative disorder.
