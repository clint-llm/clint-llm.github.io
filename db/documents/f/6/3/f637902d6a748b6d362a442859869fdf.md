Dornase alfa ampules should be stored in their provided foil pouch in a refrigerator, away from light. The ampules should remain refrigerated during transport and not left at room temperature for a total of 24 hours.

Prior to administration, the ampule should be squeezed to check for leakage. If the solution appears discolored or cloudy, it should be discarded. The entire ampule should be used or discarded once it has been opened.

For adults:

- Inhale 2.5 mg once a day daily via a selected nebulizer system.

- Patients older than 21 years and/or with FVC more than 85% may benefit from 2.5 mg via oral inhalation twice daily.

For pediatrics:

- For infants and children under 2: inhale 2.5 mg once a day daily via a selected nebulizer system.

- For children 2 to 5: inhale 2.5 mg once a day daily via a selected nebulizer system.

- For children over five and adolescents: inhale 2.5 mg once a day daily via a selected jet nebulizer and a compressor system or a nebulizer system.

Inhaling nebulized dornase alfa for most outcomes 30 minutes prior to airway clearance techniques is recommended. The drug should not be combined or mixed with other nebulized medications.

Patients who are unable to inhale and exhale for the duration of the entire treatment period can use a specialized baby nebulizer.
