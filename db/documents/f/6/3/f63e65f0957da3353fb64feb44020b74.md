While there is potential for physiological variants of the vallecula, there is little documentation of such findings; this might be because any variants or malformations in this region are potentially incompatible with life. Malformations of the third branchial arch are exceedingly rare, and branchial arch malformations most commonly occurÂ in arch two and commonly manifest as fistulas or cysts.

While variants of the epiglottic vallecula are uncommon, variations in the location of blood supply and nerves are rather common in the human body.
