Complications arising from M-plasty parallel those seen with any other wound closure technique. In addition to pain, bleeding, infection, and need for revision surgery, there remains the possibility of cosmetically unsatisfactory scarring. Patients may find that the forked nature of the final scar is noticeable, or the scar itself may ultimately become wide, raised, depressed, pigmented, pale, or erythematous. Standing cutaneous deformities may also arise if the M-plasty is not designed appropriately or if healing does not occur as expected. Management of unsightly scarring may include topical therapies, such as silicone gel or hydroquinone, skin resurfacing, ablative or non-ablative laser treatments, intense pulsed light treatments, and surgical revision.
