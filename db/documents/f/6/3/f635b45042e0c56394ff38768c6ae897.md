Patient education requires counsel about the bleeding risk; this should include advice regarding drugs to avoid, including antiplatelet drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). They should also understand that certain high-risk activities (e.g., contact sports) will be off-limits for them. While patients need to be cognizant of their risk, they should also receive reassurance that minor bleeding issues, such as nosebleeds or bruising, may not necessitate any specific treatment.
