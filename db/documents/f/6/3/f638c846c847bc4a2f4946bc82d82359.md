- Diphyllobothriasis is caused by the fish tapeworm D. latumÂ and is a zoonotic infection mostly attributed to the consumption of raw or undercooked fish.

- Diagnosis relies on thorough patient history, asking about occupational history, hobbies, travel history, eating habits, as well as maintaining a high index of suspicion.

- Most infected individuals present with a mild illness characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort, diarrhea, and malaise.

- Laboratory testing is largely non-specific but may reveal eosinophilia as well as vitamin B12 deficiency, megaloblastic anemia, and/or pernicious anemia.

- Diagnosis is clinical, but confirmation via stool testing is an option.

- Treatment is with a single dose of praziquantel, which is safe in pregnancy.
