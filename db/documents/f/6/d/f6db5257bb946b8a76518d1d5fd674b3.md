Perimenopausal patients should be counseled regarding expectations for the menopausal transition years. Doctors can discuss with them how their bodies may change as their hormones change. This counseling can include how to manage menopausal symptoms, vaginal dryness, changes in metabolism, osteoporosis prevention, etc. Patients should also be counseled regarding expectations for their menses, including what is concerning during the menopausal transition and that any bleeding after menopause is considered abnormal. Patients should be encouraged to get medical attention if their perimenopausal bleeding is abnormal or if they experience postmenopausal bleeding. Providers should ask postmenopausal patients about bleeding at their routine appointments, rather than depending on them to volunteer the information.
