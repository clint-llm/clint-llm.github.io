The diagnosis and management of hypotension are best managed with an interprofessional team that consists of an internist, intensivist, endocrinologist, emergency department physician, and nurse practitioner. Outpatients with asymptomatic hypotension do not need treatment. However, if symptoms are present, the treatment of hypotension should focus on reversing the underlying etiology. Some patients may need vasopressor support in addition to intravenous fluids to reverse the hypotension. If bleeding is the cause, then blood transfusions may be required. Vasopressors may be indicated if the mean arterial pressure is less than 65 mm Hg. If sepsis is suspected, serial blood cultures and early antibiotics are essential. If anaphylaxis is suspected, intramuscular epinephrine is essential. Adding steroids for treatment of distributive shock when a patient's vasopressor requirement is continually increasing, and appropriate fluid resuscitation has been done will assist in maintaining blood pressure as well. The outcomes for outpatients with asymptomatic hypotension are good but in the hospital, the prognosis depends on the cause.
