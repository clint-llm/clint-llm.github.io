The diagnosis of Mycoplasma infection is usually made clinically.  Given the prolonged turnaround time, cost, and limited availability, clinical laboratory findings are rarely the primary diagnostic tools. One may use culture, serology, or PCR to confirm and support the diagnosis.

Culture is used to type organisms and have high specificity; however, the technique is time-consuming and rarely used to guide treatment. M. genitalium may take as much as 8 weeks to grow in culture. Serum antibody tests for Mycoplasma pneumoniae are most frequently used in the hospital setting because the turnaround time is short; IgM increases within 1 week of symptom onset and IgG increases 2 weeks later. One disadvantage to antibody tests is the slow decline which may take up to 1 year to resolve and lead to false-positive results. PCR testing of nasopharyngeal aspirates, urethral and vaginal swabs have the advantage of specificity; however, its disadvantages are price and delayed turnaround time.

Radiological imaging may be useful if atypical pneumonia is suspected, but radiological findings may be variable. The four most common findings seen on chest x-rays are peribronchial and perivascular interstitial infiltrates (49%), airspace consolidation (38%), reticulonodular opacification (8%), and nodular or mass- like opacification (5%).
