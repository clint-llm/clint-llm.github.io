As mentioned in the introduction, METs take advantage of the physiologic mechanisms of post-isometric relaxation and reciprocal inhibition, primarily, to improve musculoskeletal function and to reduce pain. For a given joint, MET is performable in a “direct” or “indirect” fashion based on the indication of treatment.

**Indirect (reciprocal inhibition)**

- The elbow is extended to the pathologic barrier - limited by the hypertonicity of the biceps.

- The patient is instructed to contract the triceps against the provider’s counterforce. This action stimulates muscle spindles of the triceps, which activate Ia efferents that project to the spine and activate the inhibitory interneuron that synapses onto the α-motor neurons that project to the biceps, thus producing relaxation of the intra- and extrafusal fibers.

- The patient is instructed to relax the triceps.

- The patient’s arm is passively extended as permitted by the biceps muscle. This action is facilitated by the reciprocal inhibition produced in step 2.

- Repeat steps 1 through 4 until achieving the full range of motion, or the procedure is intolerable.

**Direct (post-isometric relaxation)**

- The elbow is extended to the pathologic barrier - limited by the hypertonicity of the biceps.

- The patient is instructed to contract the biceps against the provider’s counterforce. This action activates the GTOs of the triceps, which activate Ib efferents that project to the spine and activate the inhibitory interneuron that synapses onto the α-motor neurons that project to the biceps, thus producing relaxation.

- The patient is instructed to relax the biceps.

- The patient’s arm is passively extended as permitted by the biceps muscle. This action is facilitated by the post-isometric relaxation produced in step 2.

- Repeat steps 1 through 4 until achieving the full range of motion, or the procedure is intolerable. This technique is limited by pain in the affected joint and/or muscle.
