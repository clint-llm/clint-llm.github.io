The human hand is made up of skin, soft tissues, bones, tendons, ligaments, and muscles, which work together to enable the fine motor function required to carry out daily tasks such as writing, dressing, and washing, as well as highly skilled tasks such as operating machinery and playing musical instruments. ItÂ is this highly precise function that means even minor injuries to the hand can risk causing significant handicap to the individual.

Following trauma to the hand, developing stiffness is a common finding and can have a significant effect on a patient's ability to work and overall quality of life. Evaluating and treating the stiff hand requires an understanding of the anatomy of the hand as well as the mechanism of the injury. These together with an understanding of the different modalities and timings of treatment can lead to successful management of the stiff hand. This article reviews the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of post-traumatic hand stiffness.
