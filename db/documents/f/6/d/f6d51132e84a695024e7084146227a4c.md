In a patient with unstable atrial tachycardia, all healthcare staff must work together effectively for optimal care for the patient. Communication, proper training and clear team roles are essential in any rapid response team or code blue situation. Â A study at Vancouver General Hospital showed that nurses felt the team performed better after training and with assigned team roles. Before practice, many nurses noted that it was unclear who the team leader was and who had which functions. It is essential to have these skills and roles established at any institution caring for patients with conditions, such as atrial tachycardia, who could become unstable. An interprofessional team approach, with a preassigned team leader and roles for the nurses, pharmacist, respiratory therapist, and clinician will improve outcomes. [Level 5]
