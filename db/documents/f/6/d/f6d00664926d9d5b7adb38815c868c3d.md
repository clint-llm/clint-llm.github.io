The osteotomy allows both horizontal and vertical movement and, when performed as a segmental osteotomy allows for transverse expansion. This activity outlines and reviews the origins, indications, limitations/contraindications, potential complications, and clinical significance for the LeFort I osteotomy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with dentofacial abnormalities.

**Objectives:**
