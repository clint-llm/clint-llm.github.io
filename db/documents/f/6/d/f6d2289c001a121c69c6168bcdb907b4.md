When caring for a patient with hereditary angioedema, the ABCs of resuscitation should be first and foremost. Assigning team roles and frequently assessing the patient for airway compromise is paramount. Having the appropriate tools for intubation, such as visual laryngoscopes and backup airway devices, is part of the key to success. Patients with even concern for airway compromise should be monitored closely in the intensive care setting.
