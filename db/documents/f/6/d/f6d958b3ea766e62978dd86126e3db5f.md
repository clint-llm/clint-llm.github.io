Since the first successful heart-lung transplant in 1981, nearly 4000 patients have been transplanted.

This median survival must be seen in the context of extremely sick dual organ failure patients for whom any survival without transplant is virtually unthinkable. Many of these patients are young and would otherwise be in the prime of life, 68% to 78% of whom are under age 50, and 30% to 35% of whom are between age 18 and 34 in North America and Europe, respectively.
