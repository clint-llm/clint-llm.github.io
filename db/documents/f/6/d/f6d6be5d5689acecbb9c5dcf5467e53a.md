**Echocardiogram:**

Echocardiography is the primary and essential diagnostic test for the diagnosis and assessment of mitral regurgitation (American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) [Class I recommendation].

Vena contracta is the width of the regurgitant jet as it escapes the regurgitant orifice. It reflects the regurgitant orifice area. Vena contracta greater than 7 mm is consistent with severe MR. Doppler volumetric method is also an option for the quantification of MR. In this method, the regurgitant volume is measured as the difference between the mitral and aortic stroke volumes. Regurgitant volume can be calculated as the product of effective regurgitant orifice (ERO) and MR velocity time integral (VTI). ERO greater than or equal to 0.2 cm^2, regurgitant volume greater than or equal to 30 mL, regurgitant fraction of 50% or higher quantifies as severe MR.

Tenting height is the greatest mid-systolic distance from leaflet tips to the annular plane of the mitral valve. The tenting area is defined as the area bounded by the mitral annular plane and the anterior and posterior leaflets at mid-systole. Normal values are a tenting height of less than 0.5 cm, tenting area of 0 cm^2, and anterior and posterior mitral leaflet angles less than 3 degrees. Poor outcomes after mitral valve repair define as a tenting height of greater than or equal to 1 cm, tenting area of greater than 2.5 to 3 cm^2, complex jets, or posterolateral angle of over 45 degrees.

The sphericity index is the ratio between the LV end-diastolic volume and the volume of an imaginary sphere, with its diameter extending from the midpoint of the annular plane to the apex. End-diastolic diameter exceeding 65 millimeters (mm), end-systolic diameter over 51 mm, and systolic sphericity index greater than 0.7 predict unfavorable outcomes of MV repair.

An interpapillary distance over 20 mm, posterior papillary fibrosa distance of more than 40 mm, and lateral wall motion abnormality are associated with poor outcome after MV repair surgery.

After the initial echocardiographic evaluation, repeat echocardiography is indicated for patients with moderate or greater MR with or without symptoms, every 6 to 12 months for severe MR, every 1 to 2 years for moderate MR, and every 3 to 5 years for mild MR. Repeat echocardiography is also a recommendation for patients with any degree of MR and a change in clinical status or physical examination findings.

**Chest Radiography:**

In patients with chronic MR, cardiomegaly due to left atrial or right-sided heart enlargement is visible.

**Electrocardiogram (ECG):**

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common ECG finding in patients with MR.

**Exercise Stress Testing:**

In patients with severe, asymptomatic, primary MR, exercise treadmill testing may provide information regarding the patient’s symptom status and exercise tolerance. Exercise echocardiography is useful to assess changes in MR severity and/or pulmonary artery pressure in symptomatic patients with non-severe MR at rest.

**Cardiac Catheterization:**

Cardiac catheterization has a role in the assessment of MR when clinical findings are not consistent with noninvasive test results and can be used to quantify MR volume with high accuracy.

**Cardiac MRI:**

Cardiac MRI is an important and complementary tool for assessing the severity of MR. Cardiac MRI provides an accurate assessment of quantitative measurements, including regurgitant volume and regurgitant fraction. MRI determination of severe MR demonstrates a stronger correlation with left ventricular remodeling (specifically, smaller left ventricular end-diastolic volume following the elimination of MR) than echocardiography. Clinically, cardiac MRI should help to differentiate severe from non-severe MR in patients whose echocardiographic evaluation is not conclusive, particularly if contemplating surgery.

**Biomarkers:**

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is released by ventricular myocytes in response to increased wall stress and correlates with the severity of symptoms and provides prognostic information in patients with MR. A BNP level may be normal in severe, compensated MR in the absence of symptoms or adverse hemodynamic effects. An elevated BNP level is associated with the composite endpoint of the New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure (HF) symptoms, LV dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 60%), or death during follow-up of patients with asymptomatic, severe MR.

The patient's history and physical examination should guide the ordering of diagnostic tests.
