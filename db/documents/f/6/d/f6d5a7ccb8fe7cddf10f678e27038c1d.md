Dural arteriovenous fistulas (dAVF) are vascular abnormalities in which arteries arising from branches of the carotid or vertebral arteries drain directly into the dural leaflets of the venous sinuses. They are sometimes referred to as dural arteriovenous malformations. Their location is more commonly supratentorial than infratentorial. The transverse-sigmoid junction is the most common location, with a slight left-sided predominance. They can also be found at tentorial, petrosal, ethmoidal, Sylvian, cavernous sinus, spinal dura, and superior sagittal sinus locations. When located in the cavernous sinus, they are referred to as carotid-cavernous fistulas.

The clinical behavior of dAVFs, including the risk of intracranial hypertension and hemorrhage, predominantly depends on the venous drainage patterns. Cortical venous drainage predisposes to a more aggressive clinical course. Tentorial location is associated with most aggressive behavior, followed by Sylvian/middle fossa and ethmoidal/anterior fossa locations.
