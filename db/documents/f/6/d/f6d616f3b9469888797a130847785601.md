The ECMO circuit can be applied in two configurations which are chosen based on clinical indication.

Veno-venous (VV) ECMO is usually initiated by cannulating the femoral vein with a large-bore cannula. The size will vary depending on the age and size of the patient. A venous return cannula is then placed in the internal jugular vein and should seat at the atrial-caval junction. The use of bedside ultrasonography facilitates placement. Another method for initiating VV-ECMO involves the use of a double-lumen cannula. The double lumen cannula contains 3 ports and is designed to drain deoxygenated blood from the SVC and IVC and return it to the right atrium with the port facing the tricuspid valve. The major advantage of using this cannulation technique is a lower rate of bleeding due to the need for single vessel cannulation. It also facilitates relative ease of ambulation and patient movement due to the single cannulation site. Due to the ability to ambulate, patients with VV ECMO can be potentially extubated and can participate in physical therapy to prevent ICU-acquired weakness.

Veno-arterial ECMO utilizes the femoral, axillary, or carotid artery to return oxygenated blood and provide circulatory support. Placing a patient on veno-arterial ECMO, the heart and lungs are bypassed, and the ECMO device provides complete cardiorespiratory support.

Central ECMO cannulation is infrequently used due to its invasive nature and inherent risks of bleeding and infection. Initiation of central ECMO cannulation requires a sternotomy. In this configuration, the right atrium and aorta are cannulated directly. The resulting cannulas are securely fixated to the patient to prevent the risk of inadvertent decannulation. Advantages of central ECMO cannulation include improved venous drainage and antegrade arterial flow, thus fully decompressing the left ventricle.

The ECMO circuit consists of an oxygenator, heat exchanger, pump, and various cannulas/tubing. The oxygenator tends to be more prone to thrombosis and must be checked frequently by the perfusionist. Extensive clot burden is usually alleviated only by switching the entire circuit. Thromboembolism formation is the product of blood exposure to the non-endothelial surfaces of the circuit and oxygenator. The degree of coagulation is due to several factors, including patient characteristics, type of material used in the circuit, type of anticoagulation, and therapy duration. Contact of blood with the ECMO circuit's artificial surfaces causes a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which induces a prothrombotic state. Roller pumps also induce shear stress on RBCs resulting in hemolysis. However, these pumps have largely been replaced by centrifugal pumps.
