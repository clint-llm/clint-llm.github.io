Treatment for man in a barrel syndrome varies dependent upon the location and type of neurologic injury.

- For patients with watershed stroke, treatment includes maintaining adequate blood pressure to prevent extension of stroke, evaluation for any arterial stenosis which may have predisposed to hypoperfusion, initiation of antithrombotic medication, and correction of the underlying abnormality causing hypotension.

- For compressive cervical spine lesions, emergent surgical decompression should be considered. Intrinsic cervical spinal inflammatory conditions can be treated with steroids. Physical therapy and occupational therapy treatment are important to help improve functional recovery in man in a barrel syndrome.
