The epidemiology of gallstones must first be understood. Most gallstones are asymptomatic. In the United States, approximately 14 million men and 6 million women with an age range of 20 to 74 have gallstones. The prevalence increases as a person ages. Obesity increases the likelihood of gallstones, especially in women, due to increases in the biliary secretion of cholesterol. On the other hand, patients with drastic weight loss or fasting have a higher chance of gallstones secondary to biliary stasis. Furthermore, there is also a hormonal association with gallstones. Estrogen has been shown to result in an increase in bile cholesterol and a decrease in gallbladder contractility. Women of reproductive age or on birth control medication that have estrogen have a 2-fold increase in gallstone formation compared to males. People with chronic illnesses such as diabetes also have an increase in gallstone formation and reduced gallbladder wall contractility due to neuropathy.

Mirizzi syndrome is relatively uncommon. Only 0.1% of patients with gallstones will develop this condition, and it has been found in 0.7% to 25% of patients who have undergone cholecystectomies. There may be an increased occurrence in the older populations, but there has not been a predilection for either male or female patients with gallstones. There also appears to be no prevalence for any particular ethnic population.
