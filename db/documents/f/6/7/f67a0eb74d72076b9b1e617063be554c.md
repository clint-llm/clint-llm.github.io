Understanding the various causes of enophthalmos is invaluable in ensuring patients receive the correct care by the relevant specialist teams. Enophthalmos is detectable to casual examination by a physician if there is more than 2 mm of difference in the globe position. In social life, cosmetic concern usually arises only if there is a larger degree of enophthalmos. Because of the large number of underlying conditions that can cause enophthalmos, appropriate referral, examination, and assessment are vital.

The care of patients with enophthalmos will require ophthalmologists (often to first clinically diagnose non-traumatic enophthalmos), oculoplastic surgeons, and maxillofacial surgeons to reconstruct orbital fractures and to improve the aesthetic and functional outcomes. Close interaction with radiologists is vital to assess the appropriate imaging and to allow for any surgical planning to be undertaken.
