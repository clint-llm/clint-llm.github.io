These organisms are ubiquitous. They are found outdoors in soil and vegetation. They are also a common mold found in homes. One study from Denmark showed that it was present in 98% of samples taken from house dust. Studies have also shown the mold to be present on molded bread, other foods, dirty carpets, and vacuum cleaner systems.
