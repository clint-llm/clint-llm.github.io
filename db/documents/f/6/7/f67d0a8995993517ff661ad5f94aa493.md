An interprofessional team compromising of nursing staff, home health caregivers, and primary care physicians should have an integrated postoperative care plan from the operating cardiologist. In all patients, dual antiplatelet therapy is indicated to prevent stent thrombosis. Medication compliance is of utmost importance.

Patients with bare-metal stent need at least 1 month of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)) versus drug-eluting stent need 6 to 12 months and in patients with a low risk of bleeding complications 18 to 24 months is recommended. In a recently published study, 1 to 3 months of use of DAPT did not increase odds of postoperative stent-related complications but reduced odds of any bleeding by 30%. The risk of stent thrombosis is a lethal complication of coronary artery stent placement. A major adverse cardiac event such as cardiac death, MI, or stroke diminishes with the use of DAPT.

Pharmacy consultation–medication safety directions, educating the importance of patient compliance, and home health care counseling on diet and exercise modification.

Primary care physicians should be updated, performing accurate medication reconciliation on discharge, medical records, and plan of care should be sent over to primary care physician for continuity of care. Schedule the patient for follow-up within 3 days. Cardiology follow-up in 1 to 2 weeks.
