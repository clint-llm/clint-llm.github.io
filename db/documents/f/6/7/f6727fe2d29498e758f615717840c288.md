Before labor is fully underway, place the mother in the dorsal lithotomy position. To achieve this position, the patient will lay on her back (supine) with her feet/lower legs above her hips. Ideally, the patient would be able to rest her heels in stirrups, but these are rarely available. An assistant or two can instead help hold the patient's legs up. Prior to delivery the vulva/perineum should be cleaned with a sterile saline solution. It is also a useful to tuck a chuck or sterile towel under the mother's buttock as this with help contain products of conception and make for easier cleanup.
