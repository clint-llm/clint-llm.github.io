Water flows from a compartment of low osmolality to a compartment with high osmolality; this can only occur if the membrane in between the two compartments is permeable to water. An example of this is when comparing plasma osmolality and intracellular fluid osmolality.

For example, if a cell is in a relatively hyperosmolar solution, fluid will diffuse out of the cell towards the highly concentrated environment to reach homeostasis. As a result, the cell will shrivel.
