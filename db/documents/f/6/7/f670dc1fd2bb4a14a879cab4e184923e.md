Tumor lysis syndrome is the most common oncologic emergency. This condition is prevalent in both adult and pediatric oncology patients undergoing chemotherapy, though it can also occur spontaneously. Most of the symptoms seen in patients with tumor lysis syndrome are related to the release of intracellular chemical substances that cause impairment in the functions of target organs. This can lead to acute kidney injury (AKI), fatal arrhythmia, and even death. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tumor lysis syndrome and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the electrolyte abnormalities associated with tumor lysis syndrome.
- Describe how tumor lysis syndrome can lead to end-organ failure.
- Explain how to stratify tumors based on the risk of developing tumor lysis syndrome.
- Outline how an interprofessional approach is imperative to the effective management of patients with tumor lysis syndrome.
