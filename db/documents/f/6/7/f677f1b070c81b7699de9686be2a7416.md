**Absolute Contraindications**

- **Hypersensitivity reactions-**ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in a patient with a history of hypersensitivity to any ACE inhibitor or component of the formulation, angioedema related to previous treatment with ACE inhibitor, idiopathic or hereditary angioedema, or current use of aliskiren in a patient with diabetes mellitus. Also, consider drugs with cross-reactivity with ACE inhibitors.

- **Pregnancy -**The use of drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system correlates with teratogenic effects such as oligohydramnios, decreased fetal renal function, anuria, renal failure, skull hypoplasia, and death. The proposed mechanism behind oligohydramnios is evident at the level of the fetal kidney. The low-pressure hemodynamics of the fetus becomes easily disrupted with a decreased amount of angiotensin II. Fetal renal pressure becomes lower, reducing the ability to maintain GFR, leading to oligohydramnios and anuria.

**Relative Contraindications**

Use with great caution in the following situations:

- **Patients with abnormal renal function:**ACE inhibitors can cause elevation of potassium and worsen renal function in patients already on ACE inhibitors. If the patient has an abnormal but stable renal function, close monitoring is required on an ACE inhibitor. If the renal function starts to decline, the clinician should discontinue the ACE inhibitor immediately.

- **Patients with aortic valve stenosis:**ACE inhibitors reduce afterload and lead to severe hypotension, so these patients should not receive ACE inhibitors.

- **Patient with hypovolemia**: ACE inhibitors can worsen dehydration and hypovolemia, so these patients should not receive treatment with ACE inhibitors.
