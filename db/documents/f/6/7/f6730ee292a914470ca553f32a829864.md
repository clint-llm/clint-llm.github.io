Vitreous floaters are a benign condition. However, it is important to know that it can also be associated with retinal pathology. Vitreous floaters are microscopic collagen fibers within the vitreous that tend to clump and cast shadows on the retina, appearing as floaters to the patient. The most common cause of vitreous floaters in ophthalmology is posterior vitreous detachment (PVD), a separation of the posterior hyaloid face from the retina. Often this condition is notÂ visually threatening. The initial evaluation is done by a primary care provider or optometrist. Patients that present with signs and symptoms of vitreous floaters need to be evaluated by an ophthalmologist. Ophthalmology nurses assist with the initial evaluation and patient education. [Level 5]
