Anxiety disorders are very common and can present in diverse ways. When a person has chronic anxiety, the condition can be very debilitating, and hence it is best managed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a mental health nurse, psychiatrist, psychotherapist, social worker, and a primary care provider. The outlook for patients with anxiety is guarded. Data indicate that the high rates of mortality are associated with adverse cardiac events. In those with social phobia, the condition leads to significant functional impairment and a very poor quality of life. The risk of suicides is also high in this population. Patients with anxiety need lifelong follow-up because, despite drug therapy, relapse rates are high.
