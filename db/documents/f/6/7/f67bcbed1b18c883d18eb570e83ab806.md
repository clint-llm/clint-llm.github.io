Microscopic evaluation of NGU reveals polymorphonuclear leukocytes without the presence of intracellular gram-negative diplococci on gram stain.

The most common cause of NGU, C. trachomatis, is an intercellular bacterium. The cell wall in C. trachomatis lacks peptidoglycan. The absence of peptidoglycan makes C. trachomatis not visible on Gram stain and makes beta-lactam antimicrobials ineffective.
