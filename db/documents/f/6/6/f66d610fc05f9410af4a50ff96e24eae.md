The management of resistant staphylococcal infections (such as MRSA) requires a dedicated interprofessional team, relying on the multidisciplinary skill sets of individuals in pharmacology, medicine, nursing, and infectious disease. The rate of iatrogenic disease spread must be contained through team efforts of proper handwashing and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Identifying appropriate treatment modalities that account for resistance mechanisms (such as Efb protein) must be employed by physicians and pharmacologists, while patient monitoring under nursing team members is crucial to the patient and family membersâ€™ safety. Acute hospital care knowledge regarding MRSA management, infection source, and geographic variability of resistant strains is crucial to treatment outcomes.
