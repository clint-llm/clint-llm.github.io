Talipes equinovarus is a disorder that can be treated without surgical intervention in most cases. Management of TEV requires an interprofessional team approach that includes:

- Evaluation by a skilled pediatrician or family medicine provider and referral to a pediatric orthopedic specialist

- Education and follow-up by nursing staff to ensure adherence to the treatment regimen

- Possible geneticist consultation for genetic counseling

- Skilled long leg casting by cast technician

All involved in the patient's care needs to communicate well to optimize outcomes. Improving outcomes includes communication between primary care providers and orthopedists, as well as between nursing staff and clinicians. When an interprofessional team approach and appropriate management is undertaken, the Ponseti method is highly successful for non-operative care of talipes equinovarus.
