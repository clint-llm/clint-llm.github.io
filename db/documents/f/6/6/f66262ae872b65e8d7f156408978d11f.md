No treatment is typically necessary. However, if lesions become painful, conservative management, including behavioral modification, weight loss, avoidance of prolonged standing, and reduced foot trauma, should be considered first. Subsequently, compression stockings, heel cups, and orthotics can be used.Â More invasive techniques should be reserved for refractory cases. Intralesional injections of betamethasone and bupivacaine have been reported with some promise in patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
