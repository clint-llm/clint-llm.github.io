Perhaps the most important role for the interprofessional team during the window of intervention is the application of sequential compression devices in the postoperative care area, and the encouragement of early ambulation as soon as the patient is ready. Furthermore, as with all surgical procedures, the healthcare team must instruct the patient on care once they are discharged.

For liposuction, many surgeons opt for tight compressive dressings in the postoperative recovery phase to minimize edema and ecchymosis. The nursing team in the postoperative area must be adamant in reiterating these instructions to the patient and understanding that the patient is well aware of these instructions and has the capacity to carry out these instructions.

The nursing staff is usually the last healthcare team facet to see the patient prior to discharge, and a sense of interprofessional communication must be maintained throughout the team. Reviewing home medications and those which should be abstained from during the recovery phase and those which should be immediately started must be reviewed. Incision and drain care must be reviewed with the patient as well.
