**Labs**

- The initial workup should include a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum chemistry, liver function tests (LFT), ammonia levels, and blood cultures for suspected bacterial infections.

- Investigating reversible causes of cognitive decline should include thyroid function tests (TFT), vitamin B-12, and folate levels, along with testing for neurosyphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing.

**Polysomnography (PSG)**

- PSG can show a reduction in total sleep time and a dysfunctional transition between sleep stages.

**Electroencephalogram (EEG)**

- Periodic sharp-wave complexes (PSWC) can suggest prion disease but are seen in only a small percentage of patients with genetic forms of prion disease. Pathogenic variants with pronounced spongiform degeneration and CJD-like clinical presentation are more likely to have an abnormal EEG.

- Although non-specific, patients with FFI show generalized slowing without periodic sharp-wave complexes.

**Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Studies**

- CSF studies for biomarkers such as 14-3-3 protein are non-specific and may be seen in a variety of diseases, causing neuronal death.

**Imaging**

- Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have limited value in diagnosing FFI but may help rule out other neurological pathologies.

- Reduced thalamic diffusion may be present on diffusion MRI due to gliosis. Atrophic changes may become evident as the disease progresses.

- Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging can reveal hypometabolism in the thalamic and cingulate regions with a tendency to spare the occipital lobe.

**Molecular Genetic Testing**

- Suspected patients should undergo genetic testing for targeted analysis of the pathogenic variant of PRNP or full gene sequencing.

**Brain Biopsy**

- Brain biopsies, although non-diagnostic for FFI, may be considered to rule out other neurological diseases.
