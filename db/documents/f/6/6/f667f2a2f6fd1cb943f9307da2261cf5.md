The anatomy involved is highly variable, dependant on the position and depth of the wound and foreign body. However, the same principles need to be applied. Firstly, know the anatomy of where you are operating. This seems obvious, but it will guide towards the potential complications and difficulties encountered.

Neurovascular structures will be the main concern. They can either be damaged at the point of injury or at risk of iatrogenic damage through surgical exploration. Being aware of all other structures is also paramount. With any potential surrounding structure being damaged means, these may need primary repair. This, in turn, may require a different specialist to be available; this should be considered when planning any procedure.
