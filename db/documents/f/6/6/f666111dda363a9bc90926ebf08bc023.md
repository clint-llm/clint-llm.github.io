There is no confirmatory imaging or diagnostic test available for CTK, and the diagnosis is clinical. A triad of findings including a non-inflammatory central corneal opacity with or without striae, corneal thinning, and a hyperopic change in visual acuity can lead clinicians to make a diagnosis. In patients who have recently undergone excimer laser ablation and/or presented with DLK in the preceding days, the diagnosis may be more definite. When considering cases without a history of excimer laser ablation, a high index of clinical suspicion is necessary to identify and diagnose these patients correctly.
