Extreme obesity is a worldwide epidemic. It is the second most common cause of preventable death in the United States, second only to smoking. Bariatric surgery, the surgical management of obesity, has demonstrated a substantial reduction in overall mortality in extremely obese individuals, according to multiple long-term studies. Bariatric surgery was first conducted in the 1960s as the jejunoileal bypass procedure. This procedure showed good weight loss results but involved numerous complications, particularly issues about malabsorption. This activity describes the technique, indications, and complications of laparoscopic band surgery and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of obese patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for laparoscopic band placement.
- Explain the technique for placing a laparoscopic band.
- Summarize the complications of laparoscopic band placement.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for optimizing care coordination and communication to advance the appropriate and safe use of laparoscopic band surgery and improve clinical outcomes.
