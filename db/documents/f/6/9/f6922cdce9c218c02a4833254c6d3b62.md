The Krebs cycle is also crucial during development. To make an example, the energy obtained from this metabolic pathway is essential for the adequate growth of the endothelial system, which will guide the formation of the blood and lymphatic vessels.

If the different phases of the Krebs cycle are not present in the fetal period, the baby's heart may have problems at birth. The alteration of the cycle causes an increase in cortisol, which alters the metabolism of the placenta and fetal development, including the correct function of the heart of the future child. These alterations can lead to death.
