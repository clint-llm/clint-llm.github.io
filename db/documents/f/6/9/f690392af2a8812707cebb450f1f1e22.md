Intravenous injection of tropicamide and other eye drops is a non-clinical use that has been on the rise in polydrug misusers. A recently published review describes factors such as low cost, easy access, and enhancement of heroin's effects as reasons for its misuse.

There is limited information on interprofessional communication and tropicamide, as the absence of associated adverse events is well established. Nonetheless, coordinated care between the interprofessional healthcare team, including the pharmacist, optician, nurse practitioner, and ophthalmologist, ensures better outcomes. Suggestions for improvement include proper medication documentation and routine patient education. The use of tropicamide in the clinical setting requires an interprofessional approach, including open communication and accurate record keeping, with each caregiver operating in a team structure that leads to optimal patient results and minimizes adverse events.
