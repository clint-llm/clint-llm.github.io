Because physicians cannot accurately diagnose GAS pharyngitis based solely on history and physical exam, the IDSA recommends confirmatory bacterial testing with a rapid antigen detection test.

The treatment of choice for confirmed GAS pharyngitis is either penicillin or amoxicillin. For those with an allergy to penicillin, then clindamycin, clarithromycin, or azithromycin can be used.

A test of cure is only recommended in special patient populations and should not be employed routinely.
