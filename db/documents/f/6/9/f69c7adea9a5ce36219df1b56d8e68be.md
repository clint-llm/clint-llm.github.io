The prognosis for the vast majority of patients with West Nile virus (WNV) is excellent. Â Most infected patients are asymptomatic. Those who develop West Nile fever tend to have symptoms of a viral syndrome. It is a self-limited illness with most symptoms lasting up to 10 days. However, the rare and most serious clinical manifestation, neuroinvasive disease, has a mortality of approximately 10 percent. The geriatric population has the highest risk for neuroinvasive WNV. The neuroinvasive disease includes a wide spectrum of neurologic deficits, and some of these may persist for years or even become permanent.

Severe disease tends to affect the elderly and the greatest risk factor for death is neurological involvement. Anywhere from 1-4% of patients who develop neurological problems may die.
