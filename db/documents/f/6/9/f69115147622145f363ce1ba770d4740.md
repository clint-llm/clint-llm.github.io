Laboratory studies are generally not indicated in pediatric patients with isolated facial injuries and may cause more pain and anxiety in the younger population.

The initial radiographic study for the evaluation of suspected facial fractures is a computerized tomography (CT). Plain film X-rays can be valuable for dental evaluation. However, if only soft tissue injuries present, there is no indication for further imaging. Similarly, if an isolated nasal fracture is suspected, there is no role for either plain film or urgent CT imaging.

Deep or complex lacerations may warrant consultation with a facial surgical specialist such as plastic surgery, otolaryngology, or maxillofacial surgery.

For patients with any eye complaints or abnormalities on the exam, if there is any concern for globe rupture, no pressure (such as tonometry) should be applied to the eye.

Point of care ocular ultrasound, when performed by an experienced operator, can evaluate for the presence of orbital lens dislocation, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and elevated intracranial pressure.
