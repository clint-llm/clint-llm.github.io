About 30% of patients face pulmonary autograft dilatation after the Ross procedure. After the Ross procedure, patients with age < 25years almost always require autograft reintervention at some time in life. For older patients, there is a risk of 32% to 68% for reintervention due to graft valve-related complications. Younger age is also associated with right ventricular outflow tract conduit degeneration. Ross procedure is associated with a comparatively lower number of bleeding, thrombosis, and endocarditis related complications as compared to other types of graft replacements. Lesser number of early and late mortality is associated with this procedure.

Homograft aortic valve replacement may lead to early mortality, but the incidence is low. Structural deterioration of graft may occur in about 20 years due to the rupture of graft leaflet, calcification of graft valve, or poor coaptation of leaflets. Early reinfection rate is low, but late infections may occur in 4 months to 5 years. Valve deterioration and reinfections may lead to reinterventions.
