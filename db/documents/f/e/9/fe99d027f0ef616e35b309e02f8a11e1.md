CGD is due to a failure of the patient’s phagocytic leucocytes to kill various pathogens due to defective NADPH oxidase. This ultimately leads to poor ROS formation, which is a key molecule in the destruction of microbes. Most commonly, patients with CGD present with pneumonia typically due to catalase-positive organisms. Catalase is an enzyme that can inactivate the hydrogen peroxide that is produced by some bacteria and fungi. It is believed that patients with CGD can use hydrogen peroxide produced by catalase-negative microbes to form reactive oxidants and, consequentially, bypass the intrinsic CGD defect. However, catalase-positive organisms have a greater propensity to infect patients with CGD since phagocytes cannot hijack microbial hydrogen peroxide production.
