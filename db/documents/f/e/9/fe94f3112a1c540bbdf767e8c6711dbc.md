Sickle cell disease was discovered more than a century ago as a genetic disorder. Approximately 8% of the population has this disease. There have been advances in how we screen and treat these patients, but there is still more to do regarding management. Apart from helping to improve patients’ quality of life, finding a definitive cure can help reduce the costs spent annually on the management of patients with sickle cell disease. An estimated $900,000,000 is spent annually on healthcare expenditure.[9] Finding a cure would also help reduce the opioid epidemic caused by the over-prescription of opioid medications for pain control. Bone marrow transplantation is an excellent start to finding this cure. The newer gene therapy studies in pre-clinical and clinical trials have shown favorable outcomes in patients with sickle cell. Although bone marrow transplantation is not yet perfect because of the complications involved, it still serves as a hope for patients with severe sickle cell disease as the benefit outweighs the risks.
