The anatomical and physiological integrity of the lower eyelid is important for both functional and aesthetic purposes. It helps in the protection of the cornea and maintenance of the lacrimal drainage system. Surgeons must understand the different techniques that can be used to assess lower eyelid position and laxity. This applies to assessment before cosmetic procedures, e.g., lower blepharoplasty or reconstructive procedure such as facial reanimation after facial nerve palsy. Accurate analysis and diagnosis of the site and the degree of lower eyelid laxity are paramount before any lower eyelid surgical procedure.

**Conditions When Lower Eyelid Laxity Assessment Is Essential**

- Before upper and lower blepharoplasty

- After a trauma to the lower eyelid and periorbital region

- When assessing skin cancer in the lower eyelid or lid-cheek junction or adnexal tumors

- Dry eye or epiphora

- Lagophthalmos

- Exposure keratopathy

- Thyroid orbitopathy

- Facial palsy
