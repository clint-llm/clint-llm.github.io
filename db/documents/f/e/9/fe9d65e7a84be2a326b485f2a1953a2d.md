Analogous to the arterial blood supply, the ITB shares the innervation of the TFL and gluteus maximus via the superior gluteal nerve (SGN) and inferior gluteal nerve (IGN), respectively.

The SGN arises from the ventral rami of nerve roots L4-S1 and originates from the lumbosacral nerve plexus.  Like the SGA, the SGN exits the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen to innervate the TFL as well as the gluteus minimus and medius (both hip abductors and medial rotators). The IGN is comprised of the ventral rami of L5-S2 and provides innervation of the gluteus maximus muscle.
