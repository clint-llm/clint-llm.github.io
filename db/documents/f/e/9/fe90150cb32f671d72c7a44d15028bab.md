**Hemodynamic Stability.**Under normal circumstances, there exists a fine balance between the procoagulant and anticoagulant pathway. This mechanism ensures control of hemorrhage as needed and cessation of pro-coagulant pathway activation beyond the injury site/or without any bleeding. When this equilibrium becomes compromised under any condition, this may lead to thrombotic/bleeding complications.

**Cardiovascular System.**PGA1 and PGA2 cause peripheral arteriolar dilation. Prostacyclin produces vasodilation, and thromboxane A2 causes vasoconstriction. Prostacyclin inhibits platelet aggregation and produces vasodilation whereas thromboxane A2 and endoperoxides promote platelet aggregation and cause vasoconstriction. The balance between the prostacyclin and thrombox­ane A2 determines the degree of platelet plug forma­tion. Thus, prostaglandins greatly influence temporary hemostasis.
