Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide. In the United States, it is the most common cancer (excluding skin cancer) among women. Approximately 250,000 cases of invasive breast cancer are diagnosed each year, with about 40,000 breast cancer deaths. Breast cancer deaths have been declining, likely as a result of a combination of increased awareness, early detection through screening, and modern improvement in cancer therapy over the past couple of decades. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of breast cancer and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the population in which breast cancer typically occurs.
- Summarize physical exam findings that should prompt further evaluation for breast cancer.
- Describe the treatment considerations for breast cancer. 
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with breast cancer.
