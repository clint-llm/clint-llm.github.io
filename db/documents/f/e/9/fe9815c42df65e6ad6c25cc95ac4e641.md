The most common complications from foreign bodies in the EAC and attempts to remove them include excoriations and lacerations of the EAC skin. As a result, it is important to document a pre-removal and post-removal examination, noting the presence of any pre-removal injuries. The EAC skin typically heals rapidly if kept clean and dry. Antibiotic eardrops can be considered as well. Less frequent and more serious foreign body removal complications include tympanic membrane perforation or ossicular chain damage.
