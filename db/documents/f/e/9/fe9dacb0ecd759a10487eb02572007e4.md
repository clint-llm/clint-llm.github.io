**Prevention**

Effective prevention of C. difficile infection includes several generalized strategies and certain targeted strategies. General strategies such as early detection of the disease, placing the patient under isolation with a dedicated toilet and contact precautions, promoting hygiene measures such as improved hand hygiene, and environmental cleaning are effective measures in preventing infections from C. difficile infections. These general strategies are important not only in the hospital setting but also at the community level. Targeted strategies include the use of antibiotics which are least associated with the causation of C. difficile infection.

**Ongoing Research**

Drugs such as ridinilazole are being studied in the effective treatment of Clostridioides difficile infection. Ribaxamasean oral beta-lactamase can maintain gut bacteria and is being studied for the prevention of C. difficile infection and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Microbiome therapies are also being investigated as an alternative approach to preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. Pharmaceutical companies are developing a vaccine to prevent C. difficile infection.
