Patients frequently present to the emergency department with a variety of external ear complaints ranging from traumatic injuries (lacerations and avulsions) to auricular collections that require drainage (hematomas and abscesses) and embedded foreign bodies (earrings and earring backings). Typically, oral and parenteral medications do not provide adequate pain relief for such local procedures, and procedural sedation has a sizeable risk burden, particularly in pediatric patients. Injections directly into the external ear are painful and have a high risk of provider needlestick.

On the other hand, if a larger area of analgesia for the ear is needed, a peripheral nerve block is typically a well-tolerated method. Multiple nerves innervate the external ear and originate from both cranial nerves and the cervical plexus. Historically, the ring block was the most common method of peripheral nerve block used to anesthetize the external ear. With the increased availability and use of ultrasound in the emergency department, the literature shows that ultrasound can help localize the great auricular nerve and the lesser occipital nerve for nerve block.
