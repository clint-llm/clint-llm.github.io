When evaluating patients with suspected endometriomas, it is essential to consider all possible conditions. Given the ambiguous presentation of endometriomas and endometriosis, it can present similarly to other conditions.

Often, these patients present with vague pelvic pain. Therefore, important conditions to keep on your differential are other sources of pelvic pain. These include:

- Ectopic pregnancy

- Appendicitis

- Pelvic inflammatory disease

- Ovarian torsion

- Diverticulitis

- Urinary tract infection

- An ovarian cyst (other than endometrioma)

- Sexually transmittedÂ infections (gonorrhea, chlamydia)

If an adnexal mass is present and known from imaging, there are characteristics of the mass that can indicate what kind of adnexal mass it is. As discussed in the evaluation section above, endometriomas have a characteristic ground glass appearance on ultrasound. These findings are also similarly seen in hemorrhagic cysts, and often the diagnosis between the two is not made until the time of surgery. Therefore, when dealing with imaging evidence of endometriomas, it is vital to consider hemorrhagic cysts in the differential diagnosis.

Also, when a patient presents with an acute abdomen, and there is a concern for a ruptured endometrioma, the most important things to keep in mind are ruptured ectopic pregnancy and ovarian torsion. These are all surgical emergencies that must be taken to the operating room as soon as possible.
