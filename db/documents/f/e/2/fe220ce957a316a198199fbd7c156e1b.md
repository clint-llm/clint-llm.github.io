As noted above, patient education is vital in the management of SLE. Better education of patients about the potential signs and symptoms of organ involvement may lead to early recognition and intervention, which may prevent organ damage. Further, patients shall be educated about the importance of compliance with medications. Dietary and lifestyle modification, including photoprotection and smoking cessation, is important. Patients with SLE suffer from significant stress related to the disease and complications and have higher rates of anxiety and depression. Support groups, behavioral therapy, and sometimes the involvement of psychiatry may help.
