Zoon balanitis is considered a benign entity, although isolated cases have been found in association with squamous cell carcinoma. In 1999, a case of penile carcinoma arising in a patient with Zoon balanitis was described by Joshi. In 2001, Bunker claimed that there were zoonoid changes in clinical and histological features in some cases of lichen sclerosus, lichen planus, Bowenoid papulosis, and penile cancer. These zoonoid changes could suggest that Zoon balanitis could be a premalignant condition. Further studies are necessary to establish this association.
