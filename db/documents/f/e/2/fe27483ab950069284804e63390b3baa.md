Although most of the pregnancies associated with a vanishing twin will end up uncomplicated, it is, however, necessary to relieve the anxiety of the parents regarding the outcomes of the pregnancy and the health of the twin whose co-twin was lost during the pregnancy. Routine prenatal follow-up throughout gestation is advisable to keep a check on the surviving twin.

No special medical care is necessary if the co-twin was lost during the first trimester of pregnancy. The chances of survival of the co-twin are excellent if the co-twin is lost during the first trimester and the health of the mother and the baby is most likely to be not affected. If the twin is lost during the second or third trimester, the survival of the co-twin is risked, and there are high chances of fetal malformations and anomalies in the surviving twin, for example, cerebral palsy.
