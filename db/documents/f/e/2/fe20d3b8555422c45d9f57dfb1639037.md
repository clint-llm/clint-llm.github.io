Irukandji syndrome was originally thought to occur along Australia's northern coastline from Fraser Island in Queensland, across the Northern Territory to Broome in north Western Australia. However, the incidence of similar syndromes has been reported worldwide, including Thailand, the Caribbean, and the United States in the states of Florida and Hawaii. Despite these reports, not all cases have identified causative species.

In Australia, the reported hospitalizations from stings range from 50-100 annually.

Stings also appear to occur in brief, epidemic, outbreaks. For example, 36 stings occurred during Christmas day of 1985. These attacks also appear to be well localized, in as many as forty victims can be stung within a period of a few hours at a single beach, while a nearby beach might have no such events. It is not clear if this pattern of outbreaks represents swarming by the organisms or simply passive aggregation. It is this pattern of mass sting events that catch the attention of the public.
