Vitamin K deficiency can present with a history of bleeding at venipuncture sites or with minor trauma. The patient may also have a history of antibiotic, anticonvulsant, or other prescription drug use. Additionally, during a physical exam, ecchymosis or petechiae may be found.

In VKDB, the neonate will present with bleeding. Early VKDB often presents with intracranial, intrathoracic, intra-abdominal and other severe bleeding conditions. Early VKDB is also often associated with maternal drugs that inhibit vitamin K metabolism. Classis VKDB typically occurs with less severe bleeding such as that of the umbilicus, gastrointestinal tract, and post-circumcision. Late VKDB often presents with severe intracranial bleed. All forms of VKDB have a high incidence of the refusal of vitamin K prophylaxis. Late VKDB has a higher association with exclusively breastfed infants due to the lower dietary intake of vitamin K found in human milk versus formula.

VKCFD presents in the newborn period in severe cases similar to VKDB but can present later in life in milder cases. Common presentation occurs with severe spontaneous or surgical bleeding events. History of easy bruising and mucosal bleeding is frequent, and there can be developmental and skeletal abnormalities.
