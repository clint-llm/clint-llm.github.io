Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited disease with almost exclusively neurological manifestations, primarily consisting of migraines and premature onset of small vessel ischemic disease. It has a relatively characteristic appearance on magnetic resonance imaging. Diagnosis is made via genetic testing or skin biopsy. No disease-modifying therapies are yet available, and treatment is targeted mainly at cardiovascular risk reduction. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiologyof cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
- Summarize the clinical symptoms of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
- Identify the typical imaging findings of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.
