The treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity should involve an interprofessional team, including a primary care provider (MD, DO, NP, or PA), diabetes educator (nurse or pharmacist), pharmacist, and possibly an endocrinologist. Providers and pharmacists n collaborate on the decision to try a GLP-1 agonist and include a complete medication review in their decision. The interprofessional approach will maximize positive outcomes and minimize adverse events. [Level 5]

Clinicians, pharmacists, dieticians, and nursing should all educate patients on potential side effects and drug interactions of GLP-1 agonist therapy, and patients should have regular follow-up appointments with their primary care provider to monitor blood glucose levels, weight, and kidney function, as well as for signs and symptoms consistent with pancreatitis. Nursing can be beneficial in this by monitoring and reporting any concerns to the prescriber and/or pharmacist. A registered dietitian nutritionist should work with the patient to make appropriate food choices. A cohesive interprofessional team approach that can further the goal of GLP-1 therapy should highlight maximizing blood sugar control and weight loss while minimizing potential adverse reactions.
