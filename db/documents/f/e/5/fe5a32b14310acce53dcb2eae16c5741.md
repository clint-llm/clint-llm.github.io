A detailed history should include any diagnosed syndromes, history of cleft palate, history of recurrent ear infections, neurologic abnormalities, prior surgical intervention within the oral cavity or pharynx, episodes of nasal regurgitation during eating, and risk for obstructive sleep apnea.

The physical examination should focus on the oral and nasal cavities with attention to the soft palate height, mobility, and symmetry, tonsil size, tongue mobility and symmetry, oral competence, nasal mucosa, nasal turbinates, and septum. Inspection for any anatomical abnormalities such as a submucosal cleft palate, bifid uvula, zona pellucida, posterior palatal notching, or neuromuscular weakness and asymmetry is recommended. Mobility of the soft palate is inspected by asking the patient to maintain a sustained phonation of the vowel sounds “e” or “i”. The clinician should also perform an otoscopic exam to assess for otitis media with effusion or tympanic membrane retraction, as VPD can be associated with Eustachian tube dysfunction.
