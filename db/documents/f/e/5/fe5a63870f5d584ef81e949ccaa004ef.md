Incorporating task trainers into global assessments of a novice’s abilities allows the educator to ensure both retention and expertise in the procedure(s) being taught. Miller’s pyramid, an educational theory developed in the 90s, takes this a step further.

Let’s take an example to illustrate. If I were teaching a novice about central lines on a task trainer, the base of the pyramid would be assessed by True/False questions, for example. The application component could be evaluated by a case presentation (discussing indications for central line placement in patients). The demonstration level would occur in a simulation lab on a task trainer to ensure an understanding of the steps/indications of the procedure. Then, to assess mastery, the learner would be supervised in a patient encounter, where a central line is placed on a live patient. Through this pyramid of learning, incorporating the task trainer, we can watch the learner evolve from a novice to a skilled provider.
