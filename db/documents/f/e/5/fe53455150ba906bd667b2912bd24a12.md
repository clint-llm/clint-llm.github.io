Magnesium sulfate can administration can be oral (PO), intramuscular (IM), intraosseous (IO), or intravenous (IV). For every 1 gram of magnesium sulfate, it contains 98.6 mg or 8.12Eq of elemental magnesium. Magnesium sulfate can be combined with dextrose 5% or water to make intravenous solutions.

- Oral: Magnesium sulfate is available as a capsule or powder (EpsomÂ salt), which can be combined with water to form an oral solution.

- Intramuscular: If diluted, magnesium sulfate can be administered IM in children and adults.

- Intraosseous: Magnesium sulfate can be administered through an adequately placed IO if no other access is available.

- Intravenous: Magnesium sulfate can be administered as an IV push, infusion, or additive to TPN.

Magnesium given orally leads to osmotic shifts of fluid, which can help alleviate constipation. If given parenterally, magnesium sulfate will be broken down into elemental magnesium and used to replete and maintain circulating magnesium stores, thus changing the serum concentration of magnesium. When given to patients, the route of administration will ultimately determine the overall mechanism of action.
