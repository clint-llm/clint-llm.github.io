Traditionally PNH was characterized by recurrent episodes of intravascular hemolysis, venous thrombosis, and cytopenias associated with bone marrow failure. However, after extensive research on PNH, we know that most patients present with nonspecific and variable signs that do not fit any specific syndrome. Most commonly, patients present with constitutional symptoms like fatigue, generalized malaise, dyspnea, dark urine due to marked hemoglobinuria, renal insufficiency from hemosiderin deposition leading to tubulointerstitial inflammation, dysphagia or esophageal spasms, abdominal pain, back pain and erectile dysfunction which all occur due to smooth muscle dystonia.
