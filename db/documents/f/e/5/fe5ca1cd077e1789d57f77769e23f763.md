The thyroid has two lobes, a right and left connected by an isthmus. Besides the production of T3 and T4, the thyroid produces calcitonin. This hormone is made and secreted by the parafollicular cells or C-cells. Calcitonin ultimately opposes the parathyroid hormone produced by the parathyroid gland. Calcitonin decreases serum calcium concentration, while parathyroid hormone increases serum calcium concentration.
