Phenytoin has become one of the most well-studied anticonvulsants. With an average monthly cost of $30, it has also become one of the most widely used anticonvulsants, listed on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines. However, with its narrow therapeutic index and its pervasive daily use, considering potential phenytoin overdose or toxicity from chronic use is key to early management and prevention of further toxicity. This activity outlines the medical team evaluation and management of phenytoin toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Review the frequency of phenytoin use.
- Describe the signs and symptoms of phenytoin toxicity.
- Outline the evaluation of phenytoin toxicity.
- Summarize the interprofessional teams coordinated management of phenytoin toxicity and the patient education necessary to avoid toxicity.
