Patients should be educated regarding anticoagulation and the range of international normalized ratio (INR) maintenance. Those developing repeated infarcts, even with anticoagulant therapy, must be educated regarding medication compliance. Drug interactions and reactivity with certain food items must also be considered in the case of subtherapeutic INR in patients taking warfarin. If these considerations did not contribute to the recurrence of renal infarct, an adjustment in dosage or choosing another anticoagulant should be considered.
