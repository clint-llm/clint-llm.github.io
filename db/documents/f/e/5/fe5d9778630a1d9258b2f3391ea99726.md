White centered retinal hemorrhages, also known as Roth spots, were first described by Moritz Roth, a Swiss physician in 1872. However, it was not until 1878 that this condition was assigned the name "Roth spot" by Moritz Litten. Litten reported that these white-centered retinal hemorrhages had been detected in 80% of cases associated with subacute bacterial endocarditis. Roth spots are most commonly associated with infective endocarditis. However, they can be seen in a wide variety of medical conditions including leukemia, anemia, hypertensive retinopathy, pre-eclampsia, diabetic retinopathy, and anoxia.
