Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons of the hypothalamus control the initiation of puberty. The pulsatile secretion of GnRH by these neurons brings about the physiologic changes associated with puberty. Currently, there are increasing amounts of evidence showing that kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus release neurokinin B and dynorphin to generate the pulsatile secretion of GnRH.
