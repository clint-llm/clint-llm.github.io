In fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), when a probe binds to a chromosome, its fluorescent tag provides information on chromosomal abnormalities.

- **Positive (Pathogenic and likely pathogenic):**A positive result indicates that a gene deletion or duplication has been associated with the disease phenotype under study.

- **Negative:**A negative result indicates that no disease-causing deletions or duplications are identified in the test performed. It does not guarantee that theÂ person will be healthy or free from other genetic disorders or medical conditions. Additionally, a negative result does not rule out a genetic cause of the disease nor eliminates the risk for future offspring. However, if a negative test result is obtained and the variant in question is known to be present in affected family members, this then rules out a diagnosis of that genetic disorder in the proband. Several causes may explain a negative result, including limited genetic knowledge and limitations associated with the methodology.

The presence of heteroduplexes on a DHPLC indicates the presence of a mutation relative to the reference genome used in the same sample.
