The primary source of blood supply to the spinal cord is from a single anterior spinal artery and the two posterior spinal arteries. These two arteries are the branches of the vertebral artery. Posterior arteries supply the posterior part of the spinal cord, and the anterior portion receives supply from the anterior spinal artery.

The radicular spinal arteries supply the dorsal and ventral parts of the spinal cord. The drainage of blood from the spinal cord takes place with the help of anterior and posterior spinal veins. These veins drain into the internal and external venous plexus. Through these plexus, the blood drains into the main venous system with the help of azygous veins, lumbar veins, and hemizygous veins.
