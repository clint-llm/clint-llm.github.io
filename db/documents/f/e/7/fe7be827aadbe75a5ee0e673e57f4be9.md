In 1975, ablation was initially used to treat chronic back pain and sciatica of unknown etiology as an alternative to the prior treatment of severing the dorsal rami via the intertransverse ligaments. It is a minimally invasive procedure that involves coagulation necrosis of afferent nociceptive signals via high-frequency waves (300 to 500 Hz).

Currently, ablation is most commonly used to destroy the medial branches of the dorsal rami, which areÂ responsible for facet-joint-mediated back pain. Ablative nerve blocks are commonly used in the treatment of chronic low back pain. However, their efficacy is mixed at best. The most benefit is the short term within the first four weeks following the procedure.

However, the ablation of peripheral nerves that have a primary role in nociception for the treatment of pain is supported by the recent literature, particularly when symptomatology has been refractory to conservative management but is relieved with targeted blocks using short-acting anesthetic agents.
