The rate of progression from one stage to another is highly variable**.**

There has been a consensus that surgical drainage, together with systemic antibiotics, is the treatment of choice. Surgery, comprised of decompressive laminectomy and débridement, is recommended as early as possible.

**Surgical modalities:**

The first successful decompressive laminectomy for a SEA was performed by Barth for a thoracic abscess in 1901. Urgent surgical intervention with systemic antibiotics has been the gold standard of SEA treatment for patients with:

- Evolving neurological deterioration

- Spinal instability

- Persistence of infection despite antibiotic treatment.

Decompressive laminectomy and debridement combined with antibiotics is the method of choice.

**Element of antibiotic stewardship during management pending culture reports:**

- Staphylococci-Penicillin and first or second-generation cephalosporins

- Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) - vancomycin

- Gram-negative bacilli - Third or fourth-generation cephalosporins

**Medical management**is indicated among patients wherein:

- The patient has no or minimal neurological deficits

- The causative organism is clearly specified through blood culture of CT-guided aspiration

- The patient is stringently monitored.

This is also advocated for patients despite requiring decompressive laminectomy among cohorts with:

- Lack of consent for surgery

- High operative risks

- Late presentation with paralysis of more than 24 to 36 hours with minimal chances of recovery

- Impracticality due to panspinal infection

A significantly higher percentage of patients do receive medical management (40% vs. 12.7%) currently compared to historical data due to earlier diagnoses, with most of the patients presenting only with back pain and fever with absent or minimal neurological deficits.

The standard duration of antibiotics is at least four to eight weeks to cover the concurrent risk of osteomyelitis among these cohorts.

Medical management alone has high failure rates (more than 40%), increased morbidity (up to 22% permanent paralysis), and high mortality.

Computed tomography (CT) guided aspiration is an option in patients in neurologically intact and frail patients.

The most significant marker of an outcome includes the presenting neurologic status of the patient.

The risk variables predicting failed treatment include:

- Associated neurological deficits

- Age over 65

- Concurrent diabetes
