Oral ingestions of hydrazine may cause caustic injury and liquefactive necrosis due to its alkali properties.

The patient's mental status may range from CNS depression to CNS excitation, and seizures refractory to standard treatment with benzodiazepines, barbituates, and propofol may occur. Fingerstick blood glucose level should be obtained as hydrazine is associated with hypoglycemia.

The pulmonary exam and chest radiography may show signs of pleural effusion to pulmonary edema. Blood gas oximetry may show methemoglobinemia. A complete blood count may show hemolytic anemia, and a blood smear may show Heinz bodies.

Chronic exposures to hydrazine in the occupational setting should also be evaluated for certain cancers, as hydrazine is carcinogenic. Cancers of the colon, skin, nasal epithelium, lung, and liver have all been described but may be confounded due to exposures to other toxins in these studies.
