Cardiac pheochromocytomas are catecholamine secreting tumors that arise from chromaffin cells of the sympathetic paraganglia in the heart. They are often characterized by excessive, episodic catecholamine production and/or secretion (like epinephrine, dopamine, and norepinephrine) that can lead to different signs and symptoms including hypertension, sweating, headache, dizziness, perspiration, palpitations, and tachycardia.
