Due to the ability to diagnose dyslexia as early as preschool, early intervention is possible. One study found that if there is a familial risk, but the child develops the early ability to letter-name, then the risk of having dyslexia dramatically decreases.

These children should first be screened for hearing and vision impairment. Laboratory or imaging testing is not typically necessary for these children unless there are other factors influencing this decision that was found in their history and physical examination. fMRI is used for research purposes and not for a diagnosis.

Children suspected of dyslexia should be referred for evaluation by the school system. Their reading ability, executive function, and intelligence quotient (IQ) will be tested. This testing, in the United States, is free and is typically required before services can be rendered.
