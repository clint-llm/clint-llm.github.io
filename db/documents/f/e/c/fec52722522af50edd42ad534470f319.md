The prognosis for Blount's disease varies greatly between the infantile and adolescent forms. The infantile Blount disease has a good prognosis, and deformity recurrence rates are low when the condition is treated at an early stage. Without therapy, the disease has progressive characteristics.Â Partial or complete regression is possible in early adequately treated forms, while the advanced forms untreated can worsen in the varus deformity over time. These patients may eventually develop significant joint misalignments.
