Central sensitization of pain occurs when the patient's nervous system is persistently in a high-activity state. This state decreases sensitivity to fire action potentials. When this happens, though the peripheral nervous system provides limited input, the central nervous system responds as if there have been many painful stimuli. Central pain syndrome is also known as centralized pain, central pain, central sensitization, and widespread or diffuse pain. It is relatively common and has genetic and environmental influences predisposing patients. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of central pain syndrome and highlights the healthcare team's role in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of central pain syndrome.
- Review the appropriate physical exam elements to evaluate central pain syndrome properly.
- Outline the management options available for central pain syndrome.
- Describe some inter-professional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients with central pain syndrome.
