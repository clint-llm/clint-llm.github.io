After making the diagnosis of acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, intravenous access should be obtained, and cardiac monitoring started.  Patients that are hypoxemic or at risk for hypoxemia benefit from oxygen therapy; however, recent studies show possible deleterious effects in normoxic patients.

All patients with an acute myocardial infarction should be started on a beta blocker, high intensity statin, aspirin, and a P2Y12 inhibitor as soon as possible, with certain exceptions.  Nitroglycerin administration can reduce anginal pain however it should be avoided in patients who have used phosphodiesterase inhibiting medication within the last 24 hours and in cases of right ventricular infarction. Further pain relief with morphine can be given for patients that continue report discomfort after nitroglycerin administration however judicious use is not recommended as it may adversely affect outcomes.

Anticoagulation should also be started aongside with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, bivalirudin, or fondaparinux
