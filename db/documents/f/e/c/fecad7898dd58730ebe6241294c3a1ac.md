Anisocoria has a variety of causes, many of which are benign. The two entities causing anisocoria that are the most significant to the clinician and require prompt and accurate diagnosis are TNP and Horner syndrome. TNP is potentially life-threatening if caused by an aneurysm, and Horner syndrome can indicate carotid dissection, among many other possibilities. A comprehensive radiological workup may be required in these cases. The final point is that an accurate examination is essential in evaluating anisocoria; this can only be done in a room where the light can be turned on and then dimmed, with the patient focusing on a distant object.
