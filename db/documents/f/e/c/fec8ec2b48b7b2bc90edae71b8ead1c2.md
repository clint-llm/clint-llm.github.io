For resectable disease, surgical options include either pleurectomy/decortication (P/D) in early stages, or extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP; resection of pleura, lung, pericardium, and diaphragm) when attempting curative resection. This choice is controversial as limited evidence is available. EPP is associated with high mortality compared with P/D, though this may be due to the patient population selected to undergo each. High-dose adjuvant radiotherapy is used after EPP to improve local control. There have been some attempts to use prophylactic radiotherapy, but this remains controversial with no clear benefit established. Systemic chemotherapy can be given as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and is usually platinum-based. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may increase survival if there is a response, but overall efficacy is unproven. Adjuvant chemotherapy is difficult because of the toxicities of the medications after the stress of extensive surgery.
