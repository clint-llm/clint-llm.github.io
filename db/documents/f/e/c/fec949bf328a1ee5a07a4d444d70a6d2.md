The vagus nerve's embryological origins can be traced back toÂ special visceral, as well as general visceral afferent and efferent nuclei, that arise from the myelencephalon.

From the sixth week, it is possible to distinguish the cranial nerves, among which is the tenth cranial nerve. There is a close relationship between the development of the vagus nerve and the enteric system. The embryological leaflet involved is the ectoderm.
