Several factors have been implicated as triggers for erythroderma and can be grouped into several general categories, including preexisting dermatoses, drugs, and malignancies, while some cases of erythroderma are idiopathic.

The most common cause of erythroderma is preexisting cutaneous conditions, and multiple analyses implicate psoriasis as the most common causal dermatosis accounting for roughly half of erythroderma cases in certain analyses.

Exfoliative dermatitis may also be elicited by certain drugs and heralded by a more typical morbilliform, lichenoid, or urticarial eruption.

1% of patients with erythroderma have an underlying malignancy.
