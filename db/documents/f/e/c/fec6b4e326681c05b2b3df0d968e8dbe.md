Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a stroke of the eye. The central retinal artery is an end artery; hence, its occlusion presents with sudden, painless monocular vision loss. CRAO is an ophthalmologic emergency. Individuals with carotid artery disease and atherosclerotic plaque deposition are at highest risk. Emboli are the most common etiology of CRAO. On ocular examination, patients may have a cherry-red spot (90%), retinal opacity in the posterior pole (58%), optic disk pallor (39%), retinal arterial attenuation (32%), optic disk edema (22%), intra-arterial emboli (20%), and/or cattle trucking (19%).

The definition of amaurosis fugax is transient vision loss, often monocular and painless. The pathophysiology is similar to that of CRAO: occlusion or stenosis within the internal carotid circulation. Similar to CRAO, on ocular examination one may find cholesterol plaques (Hollenhorst plaques). Amaurosis fugax is also a manifestation of fibromuscular dysplasia and may be suggestive of brain ischemia in patients with this diagnosis.

Retinoblastoma is a childhood ocular tumor. One treatment method is intra-arterial chemotherapy.

Ocular manifestations of hypertension, aptly named hypertensive retinopathy, are seen as progressive microvascular changes. In its mild form, examination reveals mild arteriolar narrowing and arteriovenous nicking.
