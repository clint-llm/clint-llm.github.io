Outside of congenital lysosomal storage disease diagnostics, lipofuscin has no traditional histological purpose or clinical value other than indicating oxidative dyshomeostasis and aging cellular machinery. For over a century its main histological utility was the identification of cellular senescence, inversely correlating with longevity.

As previously mentioned, recent discoveries have led to a greater understanding of lipofuscin’s function as a potentiator, rather than bystander, of apoptosis and intracellular dysregulation. While the exact details of lipofuscin’s effect on the cell are still hypothetical, there is agreement on several areas of research.. Sequelae include the release of toxic lipofuscin and excess iron into the cytosol, restarting the cycle as another lysosome attempts to degrade the nondegradable.

There are reports of other mechanisms of collateral damage. Cross-linked lipofuscin proteins such as 4-hydroxynonenal are very weak proteasomal substrates and limit proteasome efficacy.
