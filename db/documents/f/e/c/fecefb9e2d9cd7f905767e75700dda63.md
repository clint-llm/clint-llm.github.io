The majority of patients with asteatotic eczema first present to the primary care clinicians, including nurses, which is why an interprofessional team approach is the best means by which to address the condition. There is low awareness of this skin condition among nurses and pharmacists, which leads to undertreatment, causing a reduction in the well-being of the patients. This phenomenon is particularly noticed in the setting of long term care nursing facilities. For an accurate and efficient technique to detect asteatotic eczema, education should be provided, including a simple visual assessment method for dry skin. Clinicians and nurses should be in constant communication about the resident's/patient's rashes and skin lesions.

It is crucial to educate the patient on the importance of hydration and apply oil-based moisturizers. The pharmacist should assess the medications and ensure that none is worsening the condition. If there are any questions regarding the treatment, a dermatologist consult is necessary. Close communication between interprofessional team members can help improve not only the patient's quality of life but improve outcomes. [Level 5]
