Golimumab is classified as a human monoclonal antibody tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) blocker indicated for the management of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with a moderate to severe disease course in sequence with methotrexate (MTX), active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), active ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and ulcerative colitis (UC) in adult subjects with a moderate to severe disease course that did not achieve an adequate response to previous therapy, or subjects requiring ongoing steroid treatment.

Golimumab's indication for PsA can be used as monotherapy or concomitantly with MTX. The agent has also received approval in 2020 for its use in active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) and PsA in subjects aged two years and older.
