Staging of mucinous breast carcinoma is determined clinically by physical examination and imaging studies. The stage is determined pathologically by histological examination of the tumor and lymph nodes after surgery. The TNM classification system is used to classify mucinous breast carcinoma based on:

- Primary tumor size (T)

- Regional lymph nodes status (N)

- Distant metastasis (M)

The system that is most recently used is that of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (8th edition).
