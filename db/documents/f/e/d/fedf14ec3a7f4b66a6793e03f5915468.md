The impairment of the function of the SSADH enzyme leads to a disruption of the metabolism of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is a naturally occurring amino acid that functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. SSADH deficiency leads to an abnormal accumulation of the compound succinic semialdehyde, which in turn is converted to 4-hydroxybutyric acid (4-HBA), which is also known as gamma-hydroxybutyric (GHB). Both GABA and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid contribute to pathophysiology. However, the relative contribution of each of these compounds to the pathophysiology remains unknown.

Both experiments in murine knockout models and humans have suggested a role for down-regulated gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor (GABAAR) and gamma-aminobutyrate type-B receptor (GABABR) function in epileptogenesis in SSADH deficiency.

In SSADH deficiency, mitochondrial dysfunction may take place as GABA degradation is coupled to the Krebs cycle. Thus, it is linked to the respiratory chain through succinate and alpha-ketoglutarate.
