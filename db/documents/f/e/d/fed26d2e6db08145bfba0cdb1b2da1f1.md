Ketogenesis is a metabolic pathway that produces ketone bodies, which provide an alternative form of energy for the body. The body is constantly producing small amounts of ketone bodies that can make 22 ATP each in normal circumstances, and it is regulated mainly by insulin. In a state of ketosis, ketone body production is increased when there are decreased carbohydrates or increased fatty acids. However, ketoacidosis can occur if too many ketone bodies accumulate, such as in cases of uncontrolled diabetes.
