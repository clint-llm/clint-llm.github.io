Mycobacterium marinumÂ infections are on the rise as more people take to water activities. The infection is not easy to diagnose, and its management can sometimes be challenging. The infection predominantly affects the extremities and is best managed by an interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists to optimize clinical outcomes. To diagnose the condition early and accurately, the clinician must maintain a high degree of suspicion for the disease in patients exposed to aquatic environments.

The clinician must communicate with the clinical laboratory technicians and pathologists to ensure appropriate culture mediums and the correct duration of observation are set. The specialized wound care nurse is vital in assisting the medical team with treating the disease. The nurse helps educate the patient on proper wound care to ensure wound healing and decrease the risk of superimposed infections. The pharmacists assist the interprofessional team by educating the patient on the potential side effects of therapy and the need for compliance with the long duration of therapy. The pharmacist can help identify adverse reactions and decreased compliance with therapy and recommend the optimal treatment regimen for the patient based on their comorbidities. A collaborative interprofessional team can help decrease patient morbidity and mortality with this disease. [Level 5]
