There are no specific contraindications to assessing a pregnant patient's gestational age. However, the modality utilized to assess gestational age may not be appropriate for certain patients. A transvaginal ultrasound exam should not be performed in a pregnant patient with vaginal bleeding and known placenta previa, a pregnant patient with premature rupture of membranes, and a patientÂ who refuses exam despite informed discussion. There are no specific contraindications to transabdominal ultrasound; however, scanning over an open wound would be suboptimal for patient care and image acquisition.
