Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive study for retained organic material. Like CT imaging, it provides information regarding the three-dimensional location of the foreign body as well as the surrounding structures such as ligaments, tendons, vessels, and nerves. One study found the sensitivity and specificity to be 58% and 100% for various types of foreign bodies inserted into the forefoot. It is, however, ineffective at imaging gravel or metallic foreign bodies due to ferromagnetic streak artifacts in addition to the inherent danger of movement or dislodgement of magnetic materials as they are attracted to the strong static magnetic field. It also comes at a significant monetary and time cost, making it frequently ineffective for imaging foreign bodies.
