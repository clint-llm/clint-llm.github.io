If a patient with biliary colic chooses nonoperative management of their condition then it is imperative to educate them on the warning signs of cholecystitis. They should be told to present to the hospital promptly if their abdominal pain persists longer than a few hours, becomes much greater than usual, or if they develop an accompanying fever. These patients should be made aware they are at high risk for developing an impacted stone which can lead to dangerous infectious processes such as cholecystitis or cholangitis. They should also be educated that fatty meals cause gallbladder contraction and can precipitate their symptoms.
