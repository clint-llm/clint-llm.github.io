Aprepitant is a highly selective antagonist of the G-protein coupled neurokinin-1 receptor.

Central neurokinin-1 receptors are found throughout these regions, allowing widespread binding of aprepitant in these critical regions. By acting as a competitive antagonist in these regions, aprepitant is thought to attenuate the likelihood of the complex vomiting reflex initiation significantly.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Aprepitant shows nonlinear pharmacokinetics. The bioavailability of the aprepitant decreases with increasing dose, with the mean oral bioavailability of the aprepitant being 67% for the 80 mg aprepitant and 59% for the 125 mg aprepitant capsules. The time to peak plasma concentration(Tmax) is approximately four hours.

**Distribution:**Aprepitant has high plasma protein binding (approximately 95%) and a high volume of distribution at a steady state(Vss) of 70 L.

**Metabolism:**Aprepitant undergoes hepatic metabolism by P450 CYP3A4 and CYP2C9  and CYP1A2 (minor), CYP2C19 (minor). Major metabolites are  N- and O-dealkylation products which are pharmacologically inactive. It is important to recognize that aprepitant is a dose-dependent inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4.

**Excretion:**Metabolites of aprepitant are excreted approximately 50% in urine and 50% in feces. There is minimal renal excretion of the parent drug.
