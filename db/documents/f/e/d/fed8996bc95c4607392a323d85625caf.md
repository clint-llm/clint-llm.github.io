Patient education is mandatory as after total thyroidectomy patients need lifelong thyroxine. Patients are also advised to get physical examination twice yearly for the first two years and then yearly thereafter. Serum calcitonin and CEA level should be monitored twice yearly for two years and then yearly thereafter to identify the recurrence or distant metastasis. Neck ultrasound and other investigations like CT should be advised if calcitonin is high.
