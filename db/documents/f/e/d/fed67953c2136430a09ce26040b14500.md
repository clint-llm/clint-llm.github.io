The mechanisms of gonadal dysgenesis and specifically turner syndrome, 46 XX, 46 XY, and mosaic forms of gonadal dysgenesis have been discussed above. Although many genes have links with gonadal development and sexual differentiation, as well as a multitude of possible mutations, deletions, polymorphisms, and translocations associated with Turner syndrome, 46 XX, 46 XY, and mosaic forms the exact mechanisms and genetic causes behind these disorders evades complete elucidation. DNA sequencing technologies have allowed investigations into specific genetic causes of these disorders. However, the particular pathway the genetic alterations go down to cause the phenotype we see are often unclear. The advancement of functional assays, including in vivo, in vitro, and mouse models, have allowed for a better understanding of pathologic pathways to show the causal relationship between a change in a gene and the patient presentation
