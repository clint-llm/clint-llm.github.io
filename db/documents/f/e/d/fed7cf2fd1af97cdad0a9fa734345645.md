Given the low occurrence of K. pneumoniae in the community, the treatment of pneumonia should follow standard guidelines for antibiotic therapy. Once infection with K. pneumoniae is either suspected or confirmed, antibiotic treatment should be tailored to local antibiotic sensitivities. Current regimens for community-acquired K. pneumoniae pneumonia include a 14-day treatment with either a third or fourth-generation cephalosporin as monotherapy or a respiratory quinolone as monotherapy or either of the previous regimes in conjunction with an aminoglycoside. If the patient is penicillin-allergic, then a course of aztreonam or a respiratory quinolone should be undertaken. For nosocomial infections, a carbapenem can be used as monotherapy until sensitivities are reported.

When ESBL is diagnosed, carbapenem therapy should be initiated due to its rate of sensitivity across the globe. When CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) is diagnosed, infectious disease consultation should be obtained to guide treatment. Several antibiotic options to treat CRE include antibiotics from the polymyxin class, tigecycline, fosfomycin, aminoglycosides, or dual therapy carbapenems. Combination therapy of two or more of the agents, as mentioned earlier, may decrease mortality as compared to monotherapy alone.
