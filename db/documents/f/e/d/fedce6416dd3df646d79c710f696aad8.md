Branchial cleft cysts are usually managed by a head and neck or general surgeon. But since most of these lesions occur in young children, the nurse can play a vital role in education of the public. The parents have to be told that these lesions are benign and usually cause no complications. However, if surgery is undertaken, the child should be followed up to ensure that there is no recurrence. The nurse should educate the parent on symptoms of recurrence and when to seek medical help.

**Outcomes**

The majority of branchial cleft cysts are asymptomatic. The few that become inflamed or infected may present with pain, sinus tracks or fluctuant abscess. Spontaneous rupture of a cyst is not uncommon. The small cysts usually do not cause symptoms but larger ones, depending on their location may cause dysphagia, dyspnea or stridor. When surgically excised, recurrence is rare. However, if the wall of the cyst is not excised, recurrence rates of 10-20% have been reported.
