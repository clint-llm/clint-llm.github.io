Microvascular complications are the most common finding in individuals with CFRD. A study by Schwarzenberg et al. looked at 285 individuals with CFRD with fasting hyperglycemia. They reported neuropathy in 55% of subjects, gastropathy in 50% of subjects, retinopathy in 16% of subjects, and microalbuminuria in 14%. Complications rarely occur in patients who have had CFRD with fasting hyperglycemia for less than ten years. There are no reports of microvascular complications in individuals with CFRD without fasting hyperglycemia. Unlike type 1 and type 2 diabetes, macrovascular complications rarely present in CFRD.
