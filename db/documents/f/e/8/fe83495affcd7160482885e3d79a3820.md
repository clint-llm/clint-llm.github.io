Phase I reactions are mainly catalyzed by the cytochrome P450 system, which is a family of membrane-bound enzymes found within the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. The unique protein structures that make up the P450 enzymes will exhibit significant differences in their substrate and product selectivity. Both constitutive and inducible regulations control these enzymes. For example, there are mechanisms of transcriptional gene activation, such as those that are stimulated by drugs or other exogenous substances.

Similar gene sequences classify cytochrome P450 pathways; they are assigned a family number and a subfamily letter and then become differentiated by a number for the isoform or individual enzyme. CYP subtypes include CYP1A1/2, CYP1B1, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5/7. The most common pathways involve CYP3A4/5, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19, where CYP3A4 is the most abundant isoenzyme in the human liver and accounts for about 50% of all CYP450 activity.
