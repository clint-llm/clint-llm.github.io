Embryologically, the pleura derives from a layer of mesothelial cells, which envelops the outer surface of the lungs as well as the inner surface of the thoracic cavity, thereby creating the pleural space.

Below the layer of the mesothelial cells is a matrix of elastic fibers, collagen, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels, which allow movement of the chest wall and lung with minimal friction due to the presence of pleural fluid and the lubricating properties of the mesothelial cells.
