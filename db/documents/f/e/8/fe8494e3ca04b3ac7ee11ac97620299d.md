Imaging: radiograph - AP and lateral of the tibia, recommend imaging the joint above and below of the knee and ankle.

CT scans are not needed routinely on tibial shaft fractures. However, a CT scan is often used to assess intra-articular injuries that extend into the tibial plafond or plateau.

Medical assessment for all surgical patients should include basic labs (CBC, BMP, and PT/INR are applicable) as well as a chest radiograph and EKG.

Elderly patients with diagnosed or suspected cardiac disease may benefit from preoperative cardiology evaluation.

The tibia can be formally classified using the AO/OTA classification. The tibial shaft denotes as bone segment 4. The fracture is considered A-simple fracture, B-wedge fracture, C-complex. There are other subclassifications of the AO/OTA classification system based on the location and presence of associated fibula fracture. This classification is used more for research purposes.

Fractures can also be classified descriptively. The fracture can open or closed. Location can be proximal, mid-shaft, or distal, or categorized based on the patternÂ - transverse, oblique, spiral, or comminuted.
