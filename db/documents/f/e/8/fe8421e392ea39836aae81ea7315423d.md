Optimal management of maple syrup urine disease requires an interprofessional team consisting of an internist, pediatrician, geneticist, metabolic specialist, pediatric nutritionist, social worker, and pediatric nurse. The mainstay of therapy is medical, nutritional therapy. The healthcare team must collaborate to assess caloric needs and execute dietary treatment strategies such as BCAA restriction, BCAA-free amino acid supplementation, and valine and isoleucine supplementation. The pediatric nutritionist must educate the patient never to exceed the daily intake of amino acids. They should also educate the patient to adhere to a lifelong restricted diet. The geneticist must counsel the patient or their parents about their inherited disorder's implications to help them make informed medical and personal decisions. Outcomes of the patient depend upon biochemical findings, clinical severity, and molecular testing. A combination of early diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and controlling plasma leucine levels help improve neurological outcomes.
