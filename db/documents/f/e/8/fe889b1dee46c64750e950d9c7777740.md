Ventilation is the manner by which air enters the lungs. There are two equations needed to calculate the volume that enters the lungs and the volume that reaches the alveoli. The volume that enters the lung per minute is known as minute ventilation (VE). The equation states VE equals tidal volume (VT) multiplied by respiratory rate (RR). This equation demonstrates that the total volume entering the lung is not equivalent to the total volume of gas reaching the alveoli because it does not factor in the gas in the anatomical dead space resting in the conductive airway. Thus, to know the volume of gas that reaches the alveoli per unit time we use the alveolar ventilation equation which states; alveolar ventilation (VA) equals VT minus physiologic dead space (VD) multiplied by RR. From this equation, clinicians can determine that the total volume gas inspired is not being fully utilized in the gas exchange due to the constant anatomical dead space.
