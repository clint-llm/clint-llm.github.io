Testing for the grasp reflex is relatively simple, involving stimulating the palmar surface of the hand in a distal direction. All members of the health care team can be trained to perform this test. As such, patients can be monitored for the presence of the grasp reflex by various healthcare team members. The new onset of a grasp reflex or a strengthened response of a preexisting grasp reflex may indicate the progression of underlying pathology. Members of the health care team should be cognizant of this finding’s significance.
