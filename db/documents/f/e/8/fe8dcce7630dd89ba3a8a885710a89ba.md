A skin tag may twist on its pedicle and become inflamed; in many cases, obese individuals exhibit an increased risk of inflammation.

**Complications of Removal**

- Scarring can occur with improper removal of the skin tag.

- Sometimes normal skin tissue can be removed, which can lead to changes in cosmesis. Thus, the need to seek assistance from an experienced clinician.

- Mild irritation and even irritant dermatitis may occur in the area where the skin tag removal took place.

- Rarely, a neuroma may result if a nerve growth in the skin tag gets cut, resulting in chronic pain for some weeks or even months.
