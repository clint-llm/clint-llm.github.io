Though multiple formulations of polio vaccines exist, only the trivalent inactivated polio vaccine is currently used in the United States. This single-disease immunization is called poliovirus vaccine inactivated. The virus for this formulation is grown on monkey kidney tissue culture and is inactivated by formaldehyde before its incorporation into the vaccine. The vaccine does contain a preservative as well as trace amounts of polymyxin B, streptomycin, and neomycin.

Inactivated vaccines provide immunity by supplying the body's immune system with a dose of inactivated antigen. Because this antigen is not alive, it cannot replicate in the host. Inactivated vaccines cannot cause disease; thus, they may be administered to an immunocompromised host. However, their inability to replicate also confers a lesser level of immunity, necessitating multiple vaccine doses. Like all other inactivated vaccines, the inactivated polio vaccine is administered in series.

In contrast, the oral poliovirus vaccine used in other regions of the world is a live attenuated virus. The three strains of the wild-type virus are weakened in a laboratory setting prior to their incorporation into the oral vaccine. This formulation allows the body's immune system to encounter the virus in a less threatening manner and to mount a humoral immune response to protect the recipient from harm with potential future exposures.
