The management of Charcot joint is an interprofessional; any error in the diagnosis or failure to treat it can lead to the progression of damage and amputation. The aim of treatment is to prevent progression of the neuropathic joint and avoid amputation. Acutely, immobilization may help. Later the patient may be asked to limit weight bearing. Most of these patients may benefit from an ambulatory device. Total contact casts (TCC) with a controlled ankle motion (CAM) walker can provide protected weight bearing. TCC redistribute and reduce pressures on the plantar foot while allowing ambulation. The hyperemic phase of the Eichenholtz classification can last for weeks. By using these types of protective measures, the foot may heal the fractures in a stable position if the stress does not exceed the rate of healing.

Pharmacological treatments also exist to control the osteoclastic activity including bisphosphonates and calcitonin supplements.
