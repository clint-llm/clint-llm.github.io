According to WHO recommendations and guidelines, a complete checklist assessment should be performedÂ before performing a medical procedure on the patient. In addition, a review of the patient's morbidity and mortality should be performed before. This evaluation should include medical history, physical examination, airway assessment, and analysis of preoperative tests.

The patient should be informed of the risks and benefits of regional anesthesia and the possible complications before obtaining informed consent.

The procedure should be performed in a clinic specializing in regional anesthesia. Patient monitoring is mandatory and should monitor pulse oximetry, electrocardiography, and blood pressure, as described in the American Society of Anesthesiologist's standards for basic anesthetic monitoring.
