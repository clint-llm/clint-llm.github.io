Topical quinolones are the treatment of choice for chronic suppurative otitis media; they are equally or more effective as aminoglycosides and lack the risk of ototoxicity. Quinolones are effective in resolving otorrhoea and eliminating the microorganism.Pseudomonas sp. and S. aureus.

The formation of biofilm has been linked to the pathogenesis of the infection and resistance to antibiotic treatment.

If the patient does not respond to the initial treatment regimen and/or a cholesteatoma or any other mass develops, it is imperative to refer the patient to otolaryngology. When cholesteatoma is present, intervention from the otolaryngology team is required for mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty.

It is also very important to always assess hearing function and provide appropriate follow-up in all patients presenting with chronic otitis media.
