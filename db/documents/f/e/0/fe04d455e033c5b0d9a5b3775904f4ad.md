Infliximab (IFX) is a biologic agent that specifically targets an immune mediator, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), involved in a pathological process. Anti TNFa agents have enjoyed use as therapeutic modalities since 1998; however, their first use in dermatology dates back to 2002 when they first saw use in the treatment of psoriasis. FDA-Approved indications include Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This activity describes the mode of action of infliximab-abda, including adverse event profiles, and other key factors e.g. dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of infliximab-abda.
- Describe the adverse effects of infliximab-abda.
- Review appropriate monitoring and toxicity management of infliximab-abda.
- Summarize complications of infliximab-abda and improve outcomes.
