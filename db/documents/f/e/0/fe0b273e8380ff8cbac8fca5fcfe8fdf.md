Exposure to reduced barometric pressure shortly after diving can increase a diver's risk of decompression sickness (DCS). Before flying, a diver should remain at sea level long enough to allow the elimination of excess inert gas, mainly nitrogen, from tissues. If a diver flies too soon, then the inert gas can come out of solution, form bubbles in tissues, and result in decompression illness. Preflight surface intervals vary and depend on the type of diving done before the flight. This activity describes the pathophysiology of decompression sickness and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients who want to fly after diving.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the issues of concern for divers who want to fly after diving.
- Describe the pathology of decompression sickness and how it may affect a flyer.
- Review current guidelines for divers who want to travel by air soon after diving.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the education of divers who want to fly and improve outcomes.
