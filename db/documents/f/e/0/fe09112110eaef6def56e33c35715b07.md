The toxicokinetics that are pertinent to the diagnosis of AKA include the rate of alcohol oxidation in the body. Ethyl alcohol oxidizes at a rate of 20 to 25 mg/dL per hour in most individuals. The accompanying lack of alcohol in the patient's body and the fact that for some time, the only source of calories that a patient has is ethanol both contribute to the clinical syndrome that we see.
