The **extrinsic**compressive theory of SIS supports the inciting factors leading to SIS being anatomic and/or mechanical in nature. These structures result in increased pressures and pathologic contact, leading to a susceptible and tendinopathic cuff.  Extrinsic mechanisms include:

- Subacromial impingement syndrome

- Internal impingement

The **intrinsic**theory of SIS cites the predisposition for a weakened cuff that degenerates over time. Age, hand-dominance, vascular changes, and repetitive eccentric forces cause the cuff to weaken over time, compromising the dynamic stability of the shoulder. Consequently, the humeral head migrates proximally and decreases the acromiohumeral interval, predisposing the cuff to further injury and degeneration.  Intrinsic mechanisms include:

- Tendon vascularity (the anterior critical zone of the supraspinatus tendon)

- Tendon biology

- Tendon mechanical properties

- Tendon morphology

- Genetic predisposition
