Shoulder pain is the third most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in outpatient clinics. A systematic approach to diagnosis is essential to exclude life-threatening presentations of shoulder pain such as myocardial infarction or aortic dissection. Tears of the glenoid labrum fibrocartilage, also known as superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions, are suspected clinically or noted on magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging. This activity will review the pathophysiology, classification, and treatment options for SLAP lesions and examine the role of physicians, physician assistants, nurses, physical therapy teams, and medical assistants in optimizing collaboration to ensure patients receive high-quality care, which will lead to enhanced outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the population(s) most at risk for superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions. 
- Explain how to diagnose a superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesion. 
- Describe treatment considerations for patients with superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions. 
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by superior labral anterior to posterior (SLAP) lesions.
