For the first 10 weeks, the human fetus has the potential to become either female or male. The final phenotype depends on genetic information that influences differentiation in the embryonic structures. A female fetus will classically develop if there is the presence of a XX genotype. For a male fetus to develop there must be the presence of a Y chromosome that codes for SRY protein that enables testicular, epididymis, ductus deferens, ejaculatory duct, and seminal vesicles differentiation and secretion of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) from the Sertoli cells which will inhibit the further differentiation of paramesonephric ducts and condition their regression. In cases where this characteristic does not occur, an immature female fetus, or an intersex fetus will develop.
