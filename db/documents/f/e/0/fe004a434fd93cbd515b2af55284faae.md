Antioxidants can be small organic molecules such as ascorbate and urate, or enzymes such as superoxide dismutase. Organic antioxidants can be either lipid soluble (vitamin E) or water soluble such as glutathione (GSH), ascorbate, and urate.  Vitamin E is not a single organic molecule but refers to at least eight naturally occurring compounds, four tocopherols (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and -delta), and four tocotrienols (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and -delta) which are all lipid soluble and associated with lipid-protein complexes such as biomembranes and lipoproteins

The terms “ROS” and “free radicals” are often used interchangeably, but they are not equivalent. The term “ROS” refers to reactive oxygen species whether or not they are free radicals. Some ROS are not free radicals yet are reactive. For example, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a ROS but is not a free radical. Moreover, not all “free radicals” are very reactive. Ground state oxygen is a diradical (two unpaired electrons) yet is fairly stable. The superoxide radical (O2*-), where * is an electron, is a free radical but is only mildly reactive and can act as a reducing agent.  However, the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical yields the hydroxyl radical (*OH ) which is highly reactive and damaging to most biomolecules. Reaction 1 is the Haber-Weiss reaction catalyzed by iron ions. Both catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) help prevent the Haber-Weiss reaction by lowering cellular levels of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radicals, respectively.

(1) H2O2  + O2*-    -->  O2 + *OH  +  -OH

SOD

(2) O2*-    +  O2*-     + 2H    -->  O2 + H2O2

CAT

(3) 2H2O2   -->  O2  +  2H2O

SOD is a metalloprotein with one form having Cu and Zn (Cu/Zn-SOD1) and another having Mn (Mn-SOD2). Mn-SOD2 is present in mitochondria. In addition to CAT, glutathione peroxidase (GPX1) can reduce H2O2 levels (reaction 4) and also utilizes reduced glutathione (GSH) as a substrate. In contrast to the GPX1 form of glutathione peroxidase which has a preference for H2O2 as a substrate, the GPX4 form prefers a lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) substrate (reaction 5). The oxidized glutathione (GSSG) produced by reaction 4 or 5 must undergo reduction as indicated in reaction 6.

GPX1

(4) 2GSH + H2O2   --> GSSG + 2H2O

GPX4

(5) 2GSH + LOOH --> GSSG + 2H2O

(6) GSSG + NADPH + H+ → 2 GSH + NADP+

The various isoforms of vitamin E are the main lipid-soluble antioxidants and they inhibit the damaging process of lipid peroxidation by quenching the lipid peroxyl radicals (LOO*) formed during the propagation phase of lipid peroxidation (the cycling of reactions 7 and 8). In reaction 9, TOH is any isoform of free tocopherol, and TQ is the resultant tocopheryl quinone. These reactions take place in biomembranes and lipoproteins.

(7) LH  +  LOO*  -->   L* +  LOOH

(8) L*   +   O-->   LOO*

(9) LOO*  +  TOH  --> LOOH + TQ
