If a primary ACTH secreting tumor is found, first-line treatment is surgical resection of the adenoma via trans-sphenoidal surgery (TSS).

Alternatively, pituitary radiation therapy can be used after an unsuccessful TSS.

Lastly, bilateral adrenalectomy can be used to provide an immediate reduction of cortisol levels in patients with Cushing disease.

Post-treatment testing with 24-hour urine and blood samples are used to detect the level of cortisol.
