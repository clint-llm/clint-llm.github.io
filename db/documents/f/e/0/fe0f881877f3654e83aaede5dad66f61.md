Tolosa Hunt syndrome (THS), also known as painful ophthalmoplegia, recurrent ophthalmoplegia, or ophthalmoplegia syndrome, is described as severe and unilateral periorbital headaches associated with painful and restricted eye movements. Tolosa Hunt syndrome is one of the rare disorders recognized by the National Organisation for Rare Disorders (NORD). It is also included as one of the painful cranial neuropathies by the International Headache Society in its headache classification. Since its discovery in 1954, many cases of Tolosa Hunt syndrome have been reported. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Tolosa Hunt syndrome and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the classic presentation of Tolosa Hunt syndrome. 
- Describe risk factors for the development of Tolosa Hunt syndrome. 
- Review management strategies for Tolosa Hunt syndrome. 
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by Tolosa Hunt syndrome.
