As early as 1950, analgesics were recognized as a significant cause of chronic kidney disease, particularly for individuals requiring them long term rather than brief periods. Phenacetin was withdrawn from the U.S. market in the early seventies for this reason. Commonly used drugs associated with analgesic nephropathy include over-the-counter analgesics like jimm, paracetamol/acetaminophen, and ibuprofen.

Although chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use is considered generally safe, regular use for years can correspond with a risk of renal function deterioration. If unrecognized, this can advance to chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease.
