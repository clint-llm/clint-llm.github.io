Fractures of the patella may be due to direct or indirect forces, and the mechanism of injury often determines the fracture pattern. The patella most commonly fails indirectly under tension. Eccentric forces from the extensor mechanism may overpower the mechanical properties of the bone.

With the demand for primary total knee arthroplasty projected to grow to 3.48 million procedures performed in 2030, a 673% increase from 2005, a rise in periprosthetic patella fractures is expected to increase.
