To deploy the intracoronary sent while observing the coronary artery via fluoroscopic guidance, the sent is advanced over the coronary wire and placed into position covering the lesion in question with the goal of landing the sent proximally and distally within a healthy portion of the vessel. Again, this technique can be facilitated with intravascular ultrasound or optical coherence tomography to assess better lesion length and type of lesion morphology being treated. Once the appropriate size and length stent has been positionedÂ under constant fluoroscopic guidance, the insufflator device is connected to the stent delivery balloon catheter and is insufflated to high atmospheric pressures to deploy the stent. After the stent is deployed, further intravascular imaging may be performed to confirm adequate stent expansion and rule out any significant edge dissections.
