Opsoclonus is oculomotor dyskinesia characterized by rapid, repetitive conjugate eye movements that are involuntary, arrhythmic, chaotic, and multidirectional (horizontal, vertical, and torsional components) without intersaccadic intervals.

Opsoclonus differs from opsochoria, which involves disconjugate eye movementsÂ and ocular flutter, which is also an ocular dyskinesia that is restricted to the horizontal plane of eye movements.
