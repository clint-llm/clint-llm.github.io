Mediastinal germ cell tumors can be found incidentally on imaging studies andÂ might be asymptomatic. However, larger-sized mediastinal germ cell tumors cause symptoms when compressing or obstructing nearby structures. A few cases have reported an infectious process within the tumor.

Bronchial obstruction can present as post-obstructive pneumonia or hemoptysis if erosion is present. Non-seminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumors have more propensity for symptoms with a greater chance of lymph node metastasis, unlike seminomas and teratomas. They can be associated with weight loss, fever, cough, dyspnea, and chest pain and can also lead to superior vena cava syndrome.
