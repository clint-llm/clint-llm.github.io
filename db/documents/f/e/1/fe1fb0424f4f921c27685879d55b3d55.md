The presentation can be early, delayed, or late as outlined previously. Virulent pathogens typically cause **early**infections, most of which are acquired around the time of surgery and usually present acutely with swelling, erythema, induration at the incision site, and wound drainage.**Delayed**infections may also be acquired around the time of surgery, but low virulent organisms typically cause them.**Late**infections, however, are mostly hematogenous and often without fever, draining wounds, or local signs of infection. Overall, symptoms are veryÂ non-specific, and most patients present with joint swelling or persistent pain that worsens progressively. Other common clinical presentations include wound dehiscence, purulence around the prosthesis, sinus tract communicating with the joint cavity, joint instability, and ambulation difficulties.
