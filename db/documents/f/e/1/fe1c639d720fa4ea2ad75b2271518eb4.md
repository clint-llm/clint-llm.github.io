Communication among bedside nurses and nursing leadership is a critical area for successfully implementing a healthy, shared governance structure. Frequent check-ins and clarification meetings may need to take place early during the planning phase. Communication allows for addressing concerns and suggestions first and consensus to occur through each step of the process. Clear and consistent communication is necessary within the healthcare setting for promoting collegiality, patient safety, and building trust.

Interprofessional involvement enhances a healthcare organizationâ€™s shared governance structure. This type of collaboration brings all healthcare providers to the table to make positive and meaningful changes to policies, procedures, and projects. This collaborative focus again impacts patient outcomes among providers. An interprofessional shared governance structure is more complicated than one who is nursing centric. Bringing together these many disciplines requires great care and planning, with the Performance Improvement Committee being an ideal hub to form this process.
