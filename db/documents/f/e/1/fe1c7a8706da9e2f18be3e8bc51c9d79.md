Every member of the interprofessional team should observe patients' rights. Allied health providers are often the first to have contact with patients and their families. They must maintain patient confidentiality and observe the right to refuse treatment. Nurses should also be involved in informed consent, medical treatment in an emergency, and continuity of care. Physicians are ultimately responsible for ensuring ethical care and for adherence to hospital policies and legal requirements.
