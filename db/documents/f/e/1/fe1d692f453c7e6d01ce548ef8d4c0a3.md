Injuries to the larynx account for less than 1% of all traumatic injuries. They are rare but can be very severe. It is a distant second-most common cause of death in patients with head and neck trauma after intracranial injuries. The Schaefer classification system is used to grade the severity of laryngeal injuries in some academic studies. This can provide a useful framework for the otolaryngologist or other physician evaluating an acute laryngeal injury.

**Schaefer Classification**

- Minor endolarygeal hematoma or laceration without fracture

- Severe edema, hematoma, non-displaced fracture or minor mucosal disruption without exposed cartilage

- Massive edema, large mucosal lacerations, displaced fractures or vocal cord immobilization, with exposed cartilage

- Severe disruption of the anterior larynx, unstable fractures, 2 or more fracture lines, and extensive mucosal injuries

- Complete laryngotracheal separation.

In clinical practice, most providers sort patients into stable or unstable airway categories, as this has immediate implications regarding subsequent workup and examination. Unstable patients should have a definitive airway secured, usually via emergent tracheostomy or cricothyrotomy, prior to any additional workup. Stable patients may be further assessed via fiberoptic examination and/or imaging.
