The treatment of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee includes both conservative and surgical approaches. The approach depends on severity, age, and location of the disease.

Conservative approaches to treatment can be considered in juvenile patients with stage I to III disease and asymptomatic adults with stage I disease. Conservative therapy is preferred if the lesions are stable with no loose bodies or there are open physes.  If osteochondritis dissecans of the knee is diagnosed incidentally in an asymptomatic patient, no treatment is necessary, but the patient should be followed until documented radiographic healing occurs.

A surgical approach to osteochondritis dissecans of the knee is used if conservative therapy is not appropriate or if conservative therapy fails after 3 to 6 months. A surgical approach is a primary treatment in adults with any symptoms related to osteochondritis dissecans, or in patients who have at least stage II disease. Juveniles start with surgery if the lesion is unstable, if there are loose bodies, or if physes have closed.
