Modafinil is known to be a weak inhibitor of dopamine reuptake, which may be its primary clinically important property. It has little to no in vivo affinity for the serotonin (5HT) or norepinephrine (NE) transporters. However, elevated concentrations of NE and 5HT in the prefrontal cortex and hypothalamus have been observed following modafinil administration, possibly as an indirect effect of increased extracellular dopamine. Modafinil exists as a racemic mixture of S- and R-enantiomers. The R-enantiomer is thought to be the source of modafinil’s psychotropic properties and is marketed independently as armodafinil.

Additionally, modafinil has been postulated to increase signaling in the hypothalamic orexin and histamine neurotransmitter pathways,

**Pharmacokinetics**

Absorption: Modafinil is readily absorbed after oral administration. It is insoluble in an aqueous solution and therefore cannot be administered intravenously. Maximum plasma concentration is reached 2-4 hours after administration.

Metabolism: Modafinil undergoes hepatic metabolism via multiple pathways, including CYP3A4. 80% of the dose is recovered in the urine in the form of metabolites.

Elimination: The elimination half-life of a single dose in healthy subjects is approximately 15 hours.
