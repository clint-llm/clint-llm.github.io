The rhomboid muscles primarily receive their vascular supply via the dorsal scapular artery (DSA), which generallyÂ arises from either the second or the third portion of the subclavian artery. Some studies have also shown variations where the DSA stems from the thyrocervical trunk. Regardless of its site of origin, the DSA passes through the brachial plexus, where it joins and runs parallel to the dorsal scapular nerve. Together both the nerve and artery course inferiorly to supply the rhomboid muscles.
