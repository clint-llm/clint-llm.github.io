Neurofibromatosis and McCune-Albright syndrome both can present with café-au-lait macules. The café-au-lait macules of neurofibromatosis typically have smooth borders,  while the macules of McCune-Albright are midline and have a jagged or irregular appearance.  Additionally, neurofibromatosis characteristically presents with neurofibromas, which are lacking in McCune-Albright syndrome.

Fibrous dysplasia is common as an isolated finding of single or multiple lesions.  While some lesions are caused by the same GNAS mutation as McCune-Albright, in the absence of endocrinopathy and café-au-lait macules, the diagnosis of isolated fibrous dysplasia is more likely.

Precocious puberty may be central or peripheral and in females is often idiopathic. Hormonally active tumors and congenital adrenal hyperplasia are other diagnostic considerations in patients presenting with precocious puberty. Patients presenting with precocious puberty should undergo skeletal survey to rule out McCune-Albright syndrome.
