Given the list of adverse effects that may come with foscarnet administration/therapy, it is important to monitor specific parameters. The three main components to monitor are 24-hour creatinine clearance, EKG, and baseline electrolyte measurements. It is also important to get a baseline complete blood count to monitor hematocrit, hemoglobin, and WBC count. The different electrolytes to keep track of are calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, and phosphorus weekly during maintenance therapy. Certain symptoms such as muscle twitching and anxiety warrant earlier monitoring of electrolyte levels.

Depending on the patient’s specific medical history and treatment course, the frequency of monitoring may vary. It is also essential to check the hydration status before initiating the infusion of foscarnet to avoid symptoms like nausea. Lastly, both the patient and the healthcare provider should monitor for signs of hypersensitivity reactions with foscarnet to prevent complications. It is crucial to bear in mind the importance of dosing the drug appropriately depending on the patient’s medical history and current drug tolerance status.
