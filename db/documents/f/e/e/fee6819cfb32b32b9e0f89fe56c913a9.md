With quick surgical intervention and resuscitation, most women survive a uterine rupture. The maternal mortality rate associated with the rupture of an unscarred uterus is higher (10%) than the mortality rate associated with the rupture of a scarred uterus (0.1%).

The risk of recurrent rupture after the uterine repair is not well described.
