Gallstones usually form from sluggishly emptying of bile from the gallbladder. When bile is not fully drained from the gallbladder, it can precipitate as sludge, which in turn can develop into gallstones. Biliary obstruction from various causes such as strictures in the bile duct or neoplasms may also lead to gallstones. The most common cause of cholelithiasis is the precipitation of cholesterol from cholesterol-rich bile. The second most common form of gallstones is pigmented gallstones. These form from the breakdown of red blood cells and are black. The third type of gallstones is mixed pigmented stones, a combination of calcium substrates such as calcium carbonate or calcium phosphate, cholesterol, and bile. The fourth type of stone is calcium stones. These may be due to the precipitation of serum calcium in patients with hypercalcemia. Often these patients will have concurrent kidney stones.

Risk factors for gallstones include:

- In pregnancy, progesterone decreases the contractility of the gallbladder leading to stasis.

- Obesity

- Genes

- Certain medications (estrogens, fibrates, somatostatin analogs)

- Stasis of the gallbladder

- Female gender

- Metabolic syndrome

- Rapid weight loss

- Prolonged fasting

- Bariatric surgery

- Crohn disease, ileal resection
