The presence of acute iliofemoral DVT with the symptoms of a painful, edematous, and cyanotic extremity is consistent with the diagnosis of phlegmasia alba dolens or cerulea dolens. Given its ability to rapidly progress to tissue necrosis and venous gangrene, this is an emergency. It is generally managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including a vascular surgeon, aÂ hospitalist, a hematologist if the DVT is unprovoked, and depending on severity, a critical care specialist. Clinically, this is an easily recognized entity, and the diagnosis can be confirmed with venous duplex ultrasound imaging. If diagnosed early, DVT can often be managed conservatively. However, patients who present with signs of phlegmasia cerulea dolens frequently require more invasive surgical intervention. If there is progression to venous gangrene, this can ultimately lead to limb loss and even death. Given this risk, early diagnosis is vital, and patient and provider awareness and recognition are critical. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient should promptly be placed on bed rest, fluid resuscitation should be undertaken, the affected extremity should be elevated, and intravenous heparin bolus followed by infusion should be initiated.

Institutional resources and specialist expertise should be a consideration when determining the management of PCD and venous gangrene. Ideally, vascular surgery or interventional radiology consultation should be obtained to assess and evaluate the extremity to determine if further intervention is required. The use of systemic thrombolytic therapy was initially trialed but is not recommended for the treatment of DVT and its sequela due to an increased risk of major bleeding. [Level 1] In the appropriate patients, catheter-based thrombolytic therapy or mechanical thrombectomy in combination with systemic anticoagulation has proven to improve treatment outcomes for patients who have failed to respond to systemic anticoagulation therapy alone.

In patients with progressive venous gangrene, open surgical thrombectomy may be considered as a first-line intervention to allow rapid removal of thrombus and restoration of peripheral circulation, particularly if they are not a candidate for lysis or endovascular intervention. [Level 3]
