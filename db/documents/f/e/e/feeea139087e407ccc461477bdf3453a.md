Vascular trauma can come in three forms: blunt, penetrating, or combination. These injuries can occur in a civilian or military setting. Fortunately, in the civilian setting, it is uncommon for a patient to present with this type of injury. It is estimated that penetrating injuries to the extremities account for 5 to 15 percent of traumas and that vascular injuries account for 1 percent of all traumatic injuries to the extremities. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of vascular extremity trauma and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of vascular extremity trauma.
- Review the presentation of a patient with vascular extremity trauma.
- Outline the treatment options available for vascular trauma to the extremities.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with vascular extremity trauma.
