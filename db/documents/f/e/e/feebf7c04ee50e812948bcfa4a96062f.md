The skeleton is the third most common site of metastatic disease after lung and liver. Most bone metastases originate from the breast, prostate or lung although kidney and thyroid tumors can metastasize to bone as well. Carcinoma travels to bone via hematogenous spread or direct invasion of bone leading to severe pain and increased risk of pathologic fracture. This review outlines the etiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of bone metastasis and shows the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to patient care.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of bone metastasis.
- Outline the clinical presentation of patients with bone metastasis.
- Explain the management and rehabilitation strategies for patients with bone metastasis.
- Describe how an interprofessional team can collaborate to improve the diagnosis, evaluation, pain control, and management of bone metastasis.
