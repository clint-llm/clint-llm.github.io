Cardioactive steroids (CAS) are medically important compounds historically used for conditions like edema and "dropsy." They are available in several plants including oleander, foxglove, lily of the valley, red squill, dogbane, common milkweed plant, etc. Leaves of Digitalis lanata contain digoxin while seeds of Digitalis purpurea may contain digitalin. Several Chinese herbal medications and aphrodisiacs may also contain cardioactive steroids. Historians believe the selection of yellow contrast in Van Gogh's painting was likely secondary to digitalis toxicity. Digoxin is the most well known cardioactive steroid with application in the treatment of congestive heart failure and for the control of ventricular rate in atrial tachyarrhythmias. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of cardioactive steroid toxicity and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cardioactive steroid toxicity.
- Outline the various presenting signs and symptoms that would accompany contrast agent toxicity.
- Summarize the management strategies available for cardioactive steroid toxicity.
- Review the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with cardioactive steroid toxicity.
