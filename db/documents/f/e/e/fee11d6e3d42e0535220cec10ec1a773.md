Inamrinone is a medication used in the short-term management and treatment of congestive heart failure. It is a phosphodiesterase-III inhibitor, which increases cardiac inotropy. It is prescribed for short-term management to relieve symptoms of CHF, such as fatigue, weakness, edema, dyspnea, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. This activity outlines the indications, action, and contraindications for this drug as a valuable agent in managing acute congestive heart failure. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with inamrinone therapy.
- Explain the importance of monitoring patients given inamrinone.
- Identify the indications for the use of inamrinone.
- Outline the importance of improving collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected with acute congestive heart failure exacerbation resistant to commonly used medications.
