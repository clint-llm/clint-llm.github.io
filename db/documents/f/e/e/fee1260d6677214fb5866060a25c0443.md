**Watershed Areas**

These are regions of the body that receive dual blood supply from the most distal branches of 2 or more arteries. Circumstances where one artery is compromised (atherosclerosis) allow these regions to remain viable due to their multiple blood supplies. However, in times of global hypoperfusion (i.e., shock, heart failure), these areas are especially vulnerable to ischemia because they are supplied by the most distal branches of their arteries, lowering the ability to provide sufficient blood to those tissues.

- Splenic Flexure: The transition area between the transverse colon and descending colon supplied by the superior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric artery

- Rectosigmoid Junction: The distal area of transverse colon supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery and hypogastric arteries
