The increasing rates of type 2 diabetes and the relative paucity of endocrinologists mean that initiating glucose control in uncomplicated type 2 diabetes should be part of the routine practice of interprofessional healthcare teams. Ideally, these teams would be composed of clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), practice nurses, pharmacists, and certified diabetes educators. Some obstacles to implementing such care within a primary interprofessional team include ambiguity of roles, uncertainty of competency, and poor communication. For example, there is some ambiguity in the role of the primary care versus specialist clinician in the initiation of insulin and determining which patients do or do not meet the criteria of 'complicated.' Furthermore, there are misunderstandings as to the ability to administer, educate, and adjust insulin between clinicians, practice nurses, and diabetes nurse educators.

Finally,  poor communication between professional categories can lead to inadequate care, such that physicians communicate better with other physicians than with practice nurses, etc. Overcoming the obstacles listed above can lead to better patient outcomes and improved safety. [Level 4-5] This study has some limitations due to its use of a convenience sample of providers. Also, the study focused on provider factors alone that affect patient outcomes and did not consider any patient factors that may have impacted patient outcomes.
