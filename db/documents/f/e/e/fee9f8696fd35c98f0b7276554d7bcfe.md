There are no specific contraindications for the ffERG. Patients with seizure disorders can safely undergo the ffERG as the stimulus frequency is outside of the range, responsible for inducing most epileptic seizures. Patients who report photosensitive seizures should be evaluated with caution if the frequency which induces their seizures is around 30 Hz or is unknown.
