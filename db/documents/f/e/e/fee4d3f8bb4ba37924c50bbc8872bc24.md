Complications are based on treatment selection. General complications of surgical excision include infection, bleeding, and scarring. Topical treatments can irritate the skin or cause skin atrophy, pruritus, xerosis, or pigmentation changes. Complications can also be related to a lack of early diagnosis with a biopsy and a lack of treatment leading to the potential for malignant transformation.
