The pudendal nerve innervates the external urethral sphincter from the S2 to S4 nerve roots. When stimulated, it leads to constriction of the urethra. The external urethral sphincter is made of skeletal muscle and is under voluntary control via the pudendal nerve and nicotinic receptors. The internal urethral sphincter is composed of smooth muscle. Thus it is controlled by the autonomic nervous system via the hypogastric nerves and alpha one receptors. When the bladder is full, the parasympathetic response increases and sympathetic activity decreases, which leads to relaxation of the internal sphincter muscle.
