**Blood Pressure and Brachial Pulse**

During blood pressure measurements, the stethoscope is placed over the brachial artery in the cubital fossa. The artery runs medial to the biceps tendon. The brachial pulse may be palpated in the cubital fossa just medial to the tendon.

**Venipuncture**

The area just superficial to the cubital fossa is often used for venous access (phlebotomy). One of the most common sites for venipuncture is the superficial veins in the cubital fossa of upper limbs which include the cephalic, basilic, median cubital, and antebrachial veins and their tributaries. Many superficial veins can cross this region. Median cubital vein connects the basilic and cephalic veins and can be accessed easily. This makes it a common site for venipuncture. It may also be used for the insertion of a peripherally inserted central catheter.

**Supracondylar Fracture**

This is a  common fracture in young patients and usually, occurs when a person falls onto a hyper-extended elbow. It is a transverse fracture, spanning between the two epicondyles. It can also happen by falling onto a flexed elbow, but this accounts for less than 5% of cases.The displaced fracture fragments may impinge and damage the contents of the cubital fossa. Direct damage or post-fracture swelling can cause interference to the blood supply of the forearm from the brachial artery. The resulting ischemia can cause**Volkmann’s ischaemic contracture.**Cubital tunnel syndrome is the second most common nerve compression syndrome in peripheral nerve compression disease. Although potential ulnar nerve entrapment can occur at multiple points along its course, for example, the Arcade of Struthers, the medial intermuscular septum, the medial epicondyle, the cubital tunnel, and the deep flexor pronator aponeurosis, the most common site of entrapment is the cubital tunnel. The uncontrolled flexion of the hand, as flexors muscles become fibrotic and short.

**Cubital Tunnel Syndrome**

A condition that involves pressure or stretching of the ulnar nerve which can cause numbness or tingling in the ring and small fingers, pain in the forearm, and/or weakness in the hand. These symptoms are often felt when the elbow is bent for an extended period of time, such as while holding a phone or while sleeping. Sometimes nerve testing (EMG/NCS) may be needed to see how much the nerve and muscle are being affected. The first treatment is to avoid actions that cause symptoms. Wrapping a pillow or towel loosely around the elbow or wearing a splint at night to keep the elbow from bending can help. Avoiding pressure on the “funny bone” can also help.

Historically, when (venous) blood-letting was practiced, the bicipital aponeurosis (the ceiling of the cubital fossa) was known as the "grace of God" tendon because it protected the more important contents of the fossa (i.e., the brachial artery and the median nerve).
