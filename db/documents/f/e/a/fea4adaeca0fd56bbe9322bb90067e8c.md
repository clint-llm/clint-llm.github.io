There are different ways to apply cervical traction to the cervical neck.

**Manual Cervical Traction**

Manual traction is mainly for diagnostic purposes, with the ability to confirm a suspected diagnosis after successful relief of symptoms.

- The head and neck are held in the hands of the practitioner, and then gentle traction of a pulling force is applied.

- Intermittent periods of traction can be applied, holding each position for about 10 seconds.

It also allows the performer to apply controlled pressure on pressure points, which helps alleviate the patient's pain. Ideally, it is done at a 20-degree angle of flexion, but the examiner must explore all angles, including the extension of the neck and chin rotation, with a thorough assessment of each position.

**Mechanical Cervical Traction**

Mechanical traction includes pinning, with the placement of a Halo device around the head; where anterior pins are placed 1 cm above each of the eyebrows, and two posterior pins are placed on the opposite end of the skull. The addition of pins can be essential if further stabilization is required.

- A harness attaches to the head and neck of the patient while he is laying down on his/her back.

- The harness is itself attached to a machine that applies a traction force, which can be regulated through a control panel.

Other shorter-term traction devices comprise the Gardner-Wells tongs, which constitute two pins, pointing upward (towards the vertex of the head), to be placed below the temporal ridge, bilaterally. In both cases, careful pinning is to be applied with a torque pressure of 2 lb (0.9 kg) to 4 lb (1.8 kg) in the pediatric population, and up to 8 lb (3.6 kg) in adults.

Mechanical traction requires a 0-degree angle pull for C1 and C2 pathologies, and a 20-degree angle flexion for below C2 cases. Moreover, the force applied during pull tension must not exceed 10 lb (4.5 kg) in cases of C1-C2 subluxation, but can otherwise increase up to 45 lb (20.4 kg). Some practices require a gradual increase of the pull tension, while others prefer choosing the lowest weight inciting an effective response.

**Over-the-Door Traction**

This is a more practical way of applying cervical traction, that is more accessible to outpatient practices.

- Over-the-door traction entails strapping a harness to the head and neck of the patient that is in a seated position.

- The harness is connected to a rope in a pulley system over a door. The force is applied using weights (a sandbar or a waterbag) attached to the other end of the rope.

Furthermore, intermittent traction is another modality where a repeated sequence of rest and traction is applied. It is believed to increase blood flow to the nerve roots and spine parenchyma. One must understand that during the rest phase, tension is not entirely released. As a general rule, intermittent traction is the method of choice for degenerative disc disease and/or joint hypomobility. On the other hand, sustained traction is most often used for neck pain of muscle or soft tissue etiology, and/or disc herniations. Cervical traction can be applied while the patient is supine or seated. The supine position is preferred, allowing for more posterior pressure loading. This will ensure cervical muscle relaxation and transmit less pressure on the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The sitting position is favored only for patients who cannot lay supine for a prolonged period of time, as in cases of patients suffering from reflux esophagitis.
