The etiology of femoroacetabular impingement is still under investigation; however, studies suggest that genetic factors may contribute to abnormal hip pathology. Multiple studies have investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) such as GDF5, FRZB, DIO2, and HOX9.FRZB has been found by one study to contribute to a specific shape of proximal femur morphology on X-ray and increased development of osteoarthritis of the hip.DIO2 has also correlated with specific proximal femur morphology and the increased development of hip osteoarthritis.HOX9 was looked at in a Japanese population and found to contribute to pincer lesion formation of the acetabulum.

There is also evidence to suggest an increased incidence of FAI in athletes due to cam deformity formation.

The formation of FAI has also occurred in patients with a history of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). When this primary insult happens during childhood, the epiphysis of the femoral head slips posterior and medial respective to the metaphysis, leading to a prominent metaphysis anterior and laterally. Even after surgical in situ fixation of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis, there is a residual deformity, and this can cause impingement.
