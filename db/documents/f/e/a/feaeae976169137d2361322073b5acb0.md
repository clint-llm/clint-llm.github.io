HIV-1-associated progressive polyradiculopathy is a commonly misdiagnosed neurological complication in patients suffering from HIV infection. Progressive polyradiculopathy in HIV infection presents with gradual sensory, motor, reflexive, and sphincter disturbances in a radicular pattern. Progressive flaccid paraparesis, areflexia, and sphincter involvement are the cardinal features of this disorder; however, since the co-existence of other forms of peripheral neuropathy is common in HIV patients, this complication usually goes unaddressed and may lead to permanent neurologic deficits. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of HIV-1-associated progressive polyradiculopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various etiologies of HIV-1-associated progressive polyradiculopathy.
- Review appropriate evaluation of HIV-1-associated progressive polyradiculopathy.
- Describe the management options available for HIV-1-associated progressive polyradiculopathy.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance HIV-1-associated progressive polyradiculopathy and improve outcomes.
