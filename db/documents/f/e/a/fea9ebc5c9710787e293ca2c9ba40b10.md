WNV infection is challenging to diagnose and can quickly progress to neurologically devastating and even fatal disease. This condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an emergency medicine physician, an internist for inpatient management, a critical care physician if needing ICU management, an infectious disease physician, along with pharmacy and nursing support. The care is primarily supportive, and the diagnosis is often difficult to make due to the variable presentation and overall rarity of the disease. The patient’s primary care doctor, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner should dispense preventative education; this includes protecting exposed skin, the use of insect repellants, and avoiding high-risk areas.

Current methods of deterrence consist of two main components, personal protective measures and mosquito control. Insect repellants containing DEET or picaridin, permethrin-treated clothing, and avoiding exposure to endemic or high-risk areas with mosquitoes are the mainstays of personal protection. Mosquito control programs may also help decrease exposure along with reducing high-risk conditions, such as standing water around the home.

To summarize, West Nile virus infection requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level V]
