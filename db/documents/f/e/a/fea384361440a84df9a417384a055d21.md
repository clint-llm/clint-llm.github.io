Patients diagnosed with atrial myxoma should receive an overview of the pathophysiology of the disease and its complications. Patients should be educated to watch out for signs and symptoms that need immediate medical care, such as:

- Weakness or numbness, especially on one side of the body that is concerning for stroke (systemic embolization)

- Chest pain, shortness of breath, leg swelling (congested heart failure, pulmonary embolism)

- Fever, chills, night sweats, unusual skin change (endocarditis)

Patients need to be aware that surgical resection is the treatment of choice with a good prognosis. The primary team needs to help patients set up a coordinated interdisciplinary team to treat the disease.
