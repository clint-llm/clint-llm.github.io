Infection with the human parainfluenza virus in immunocompromised patients and the elderly are generally associated with a range of diseases, from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to more severe diseases in the lower respiratory tract, which might require mechanical ventilation and can lead to death.

Early childhood infection with the Paramyxoviridae family of viruses (especially respiratory syncytial virus and human parainfluenza virus) is strongly associated with the development of asthma and COPD later in life.
