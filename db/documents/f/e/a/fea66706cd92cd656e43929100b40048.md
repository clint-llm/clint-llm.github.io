Polycythemia vera (PV) may initially present with vague symptoms including headache, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, GI complaints, pruritus, etc., and patients may initially bring this to the attention of the general practitioner. A combination of these symptoms, along with abnormal hematologic labs, warrants a referral to a hematologist for further workup for the underlying condition. Early diagnosis and treatment of PV can increase survival by decreasing morbidity from disease complications. The role of the interprofessional team to achieve correct diagnosis and management to improve outcomes in patients with polycythemia vera is crucial. This interprofessional team is comprised of clinicians, specialists, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists, all working collaboratively and exercising open communication to achieve optimal patient results.
