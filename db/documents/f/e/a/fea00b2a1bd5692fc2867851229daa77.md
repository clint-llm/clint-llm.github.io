Researchers have shown that posterior aortic root enlargement techniques, including the Nicks procedure, can be easily applied without additional risks. Aortic root enlargement patients have a statistically significant higher risk for perioperative mortality compared to those without ARE. However, when patients who underwent concomitant procedures were excluded, despite the presence of a higher risk, the difference was statistically non-significant. It was also observed that, despite longer CPB time and aortic cross-clamp time, patients who underwent AVR with ARE did not experience higher rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, complete heart block/permanent pacemaker implantation, or reoperation for bleeding. On the contrary, patients who underwent AVR with ARE had a higher overall mean of iEOA and a lower overall rate of PPM.
