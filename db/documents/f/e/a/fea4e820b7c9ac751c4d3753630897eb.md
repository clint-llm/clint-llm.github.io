Ventilator-induced lung injury is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Complications of ventilatory induced lung injury include pulmonary edema, barotrauma, worsening hypoxemia resulting in prolongation of mechanical ventilation. Though higher tidal volumes are proved to increase mortality, multiorgan failure resulting from biotrauma is a major contributor. If extensively inflamed & injured areas get fibrosed, there is a potential for long-term respiratory disability and cor-pulmonale in survivors. Recurrent infections are also common in fibrosed pulmonary tissue.
