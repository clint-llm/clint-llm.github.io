Ventral cord syndrome shares similar complications to other spinal cord injuries and diseases. With that said, spinal cord injury increases the risk of many medical complications and morbidities most of which result from the resulting paralysis and extreme inactivity. Physical inactivity itself is responsible for insulin resistance, carbohydrate metabolism disorders, and dyslipidemia. Calcifications in the coronary arteries are more prevalent in spinal cord injury patients as compared to their able-bodied counterparts. Patients are at increased risk for fractures and osteoporosis because of immobility. There is a reduction in circulating growth hormone and testosterone. The lifetime risk of pressure ulcers is estimated to be around 50% in patients with spinal cord injury. There are also adverse changes to soft tissue body composition with increased adiposity and a reduction in skeletal muscle. Diffuse gastrointestinal tract dysmotility often brings about other problems such as gastrointestinal reflux and difficulty in evacuations. Respiratory dysfunction can arise depending on the level and completeness of the injury. Patients with spinal cord injury above the sixth thoracic vertebra have deficits in both cardiac and peripheral vascular mechanisms which are needed to maintain blood pressure; thus they are often hypotensive. Persistent and orthostatic hypotension can predispose to cognitive impairments.
