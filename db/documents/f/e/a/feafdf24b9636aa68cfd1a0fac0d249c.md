With treatment, the prognosis for most types of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is excellent. In those with delayed or inadequate treatment, bilirubin encephalopathy may ensue.Â The burden of bilirubin encephalopathy is significantly higher in developing and resource-limited nations.

The prognosis for conjugated hyperbilirubinemia depends on the etiology. The outcome and prognosis of patients with biliary atresia are significantly improved by early diagnosis and surgery within 60 days of life. Similarly, patients with bile acid synthesis disorder (BASD) have an excellent prognosis as they respond very well to medical treatment. Historically, the prognosis for gestational alloimmune liver disease (GALD) was poor, with up to 80% mortality without liver transplantation. However, with the advent of IVIG use and double volume exchange transfusion, the prognosis for this disease has greatly improved in recent years.
