Neurotmesis is a complete transection of a peripheral nerve. The severity of peripheral nerve injury can be classified as neurapraxia, axonotmesis, or neurotmesis. Neurotmesis will produce complete sensory and motor deficits to the skin and muscles innervated by the injured nerve. Spontaneous recovery of function is extremely suboptimal without surgical intervention. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of neurotmesis, and explains the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of neurotmesis.
- Describe the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of neurotmesis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for neurotmesis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients with neurotmesis and improve outcomes.
