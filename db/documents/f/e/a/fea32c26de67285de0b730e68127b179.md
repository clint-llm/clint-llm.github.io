Based on a prognostic model, wound area and chronicity are raw determinants for healing.

A multicenter study found that VLUs with a ≥ 3% increase within the first month of treatment had a 68% healing failure probability by the sixth month.

Healed ulcers have high recurrence rates, which considerably decrease with sustained compression therapy and vascular surgery.
