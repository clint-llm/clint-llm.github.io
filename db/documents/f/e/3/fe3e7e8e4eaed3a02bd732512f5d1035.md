Krabbe disease is due to the GALC enzyme deficiency, present in the lysosomes of microglial cells of the brain and the spinal cord. Microglia cells are responsible for the physiological turnover of myelin components and the elimination of toxic compounds. GALC metabolizes two galactolipids, galactosylceramide and psychosine. Galactosylceramide is present in high concentrations in Schwann cells and oligodendroglial cells. GALC degrades galactosylceramide; its deficiency leads to building up of galactosylceramide in the central and peripheral nervous system. Psychosine is a cytotoxic sphingosine lipid formed as a byproduct during myelin synthesis.

The mechanism of how the accumulation of psychosine manifests its cytotoxic effect on oligodendroglia is unclear. Multiple hypotheses like the microglia hypothesis and the psychosine hypothesis have been formulated. The accumulation of these two compounds in the oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells leads to apoptosis of these cells and hence demyelination. In turn, the apoptosis leads to secondary activation of microglial cells and its transformation into multinucleated giant cells known as globoid cells, which are pathognomic of Krabbe disease.
