The exact etiology is unknown, but researchers have considered infection elsewhere besides the orbit and autoimmune disorders. Among infections, the presence of Streptococcal pharyngitis or viral upper respiratory infection has reportedly correlated with the occurrence of orbital pseudotumor. Molecular mimicry of the foreign antigen with self-antigens is one theory to explain IOI after infection.

Various rheumatologic disorders such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly called Wegener granulomatosis), giant cell arteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, multifocal fibrosclerosis (now categorized as IgG4-related disease), Crohn disease, and ulcerative colitis are associated with orbital inflammation.

There are several theories proposed to explain the inflammation that causes orbital pseudotumor. Reports exist of high levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins, interferon (IFN), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in histopathological specimens, as well as increased expression of CD20 and CD25.
