**History**

The principal symptom of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis is an itch. Patients report a rash, most typically over the extensor surfaces of the elbows, knees, buttocks, and scalp. There also may be symptoms of associated disorders, such as GSE, with bloating, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal complaints or of other autoimmune diseases including hypothyroidism.

**Presentation**

The characteristic lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis are grouped erythematous papules and vesicles located over extensor sites. Because the condition is so pruritic, intact vesicles are rarely seen and the patient may simply present with excoriations. Lesions tend to be symmetrical and heal without scarring. Patients may develop punctate purpura on the palms and soles. Mucosal change may occur, and dental abnormalities have been reported, particularly enamel pits. Interestingly, first-degree relatives of a patient with GSE may also show enamel defects.
