Intraductal papilloma can be mammographically occult. When seen mammographically, it may present as a round or oval mass with a well-circumscribed or indistinct margin. It may be associated with microcalcifications. Under ultrasound, the mass is commonly found near the nipple. The tumor will be in a dilated duct and will often show flow on color or power Doppler. On galactography, intraductal papilloma appears as an intraluminal filling defect with ductal dilation leading up to the mass with an abrupt ductal cutoff. MRI findings include an enhancing round or ovoid intraductal mass with likely either washout or plateau kinetics.
