The diagnosis of anemia and its management is interprofessional. Anemia is a sign that needs to evaluated to determine its underlying etiology and must be appreciated for both its primary medical impact on the patient and its secondary impact on the patient's comorbidities. Thorough patient history and physical exam are necessary to direct diagnostic testing and subsequent treatment. In the case of obvious cues on history or physical exam, the workup can be streamlined and focused on clear therapeutic choices. Interprofessional healthcare team members that suspect a patient has anemia should further evaluate for it and in some cases, seek consultation from a hematologist.
