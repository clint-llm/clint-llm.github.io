There are no specific monitoring parameters for those undergoing general anesthesia with isoflurane compared to other volatile anesthetics.Â All patients undergoing general anesthesia should have all basic monitoring devices placed before induction of general anesthesia to include:

- Continuous pulse oximetry

- Non-invasive blood pressure monitoring

- Continuous electrocardiography

- Inspired and expired oxygen, carbon dioxide, and volatile anesthetic monitoring

- Airway pressure

- Peripheral nerve stimulation (if neuromuscular blocking drugs are used)

- Body temperature
