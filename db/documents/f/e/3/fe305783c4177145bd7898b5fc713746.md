Organ transplantation has quickly developed into a dynamic field in medicine that involves a large multidisciplinary team to manage patients care in the pre and post-transplantation stages. One more recently developing field is that of multi-visceral transplantation (MVT) in the setting of intestinal failure and/or accompanying multisystem organ failure. This activity describes and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo intestinal multi-visceral transplantation.

**Objectives:**
- Review the treatment considerations for patients with end-organ dysfunction requiring workup for transplantation.
- Describe the indications for multi-visceral transplantation.
- Identify the most common techniques for organ transplantation.
