The patient presents with pain, tingling, paresthesias over the dorsolateral aspect of the hand, wrist, and fingers.

**Physical Exam**

**Visual**

- Masses, scars, signs of external compression

- Skin changes

**Sensation**

- The first dorsal web space is specific to the superficial branch of the radial nerve

**Light Touch**

- May be abnormal

- Up to 100% of patients

**2-point Discrimination**

- May be abnormal

- 4 to 5 mm greater than the contralateral side or more than 15mm 

- Up to 80% of patients

**Vibration (256 Hz)**

- May be abnormal 

- Up to 100% of patients

**Muscle Strength**

- No motor weakness or signs of atrophy

- May see a decrease in pinch and grip strength due to pain with these activities 

- Up to 80% of patients

**Tinel Test**

- Most common finding

- Must test course of the superficial branch of the radial nerve and lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve

- Identify the nerve segment with maximal Tinel response

**Hoffman Test**

- Evaluate for upper motor neuron pathology

**Finkelstein Test**

- May yield a false positive in up to 96% of patients

- Neuropathy may coexist with de Quervain tenosynovitis

**Dellon Test**

- Active, forceful hyperpronation of the forearm and ulnar deviation and flexion of the wrist with the elbow extended by the side

**Wartenburg's Neuritis Compression Test**

- Direct pressure at the insertion of the brachioradialis

**Superficial Branch of the Radial Nerve Compression Test**

- Direct pressure at junction of brachioradialis and extensor carpi radialis longus causes symptoms

**Optional Examination with Nerve Block**

Superficial branch of the radial nerve block with a local anesthetic

- Inject local anesthetic subcutaneously near the area of maximal Tinel Test

- Ultrasound guidance preferred to avoid nerve injury

- Finkelstein Test should become negative

- Measured pinch and grip strength should improve
