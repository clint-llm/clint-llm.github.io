The prognosis of ECC depends on the stage at which it is found, the involvement of the parents, and the capacity to maintain appropriate hygiene and dietary habits in the long term. If the disease is diagnosed in the early stages, the caries process can be stopped in time through preventive measures and education, reversing the carious lesions, and protecting the unaffected teeth. By contrast, severe cases of ECC that remain untreated have a poor prognosis: impaired nutrition, chronic anemia, and growth retardation, affecting the child's quality of life and general health.
