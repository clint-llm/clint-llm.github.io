Coronary sinus thrombosis is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes pharmacists. Despite the known complications, there are no clear guidelines or recommendations to assist physicians in the long-term management of such patients. The role of anticoagulation remains unclear and warrants further investigation. A systematic study of the incidence and sequelae of coronary sinus thrombosis in patients who undergo manipulation of the coronary sinus is certainly warranted.

Case reports indicate poor outcomes in symptomatic patients.
