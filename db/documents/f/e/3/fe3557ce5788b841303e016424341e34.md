Patients with the signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis rarely initially present to a surgeon trained to perform temporal artery biopsies. The referring healthcare professional needs to communicate the indications for the procedure to the surgeon, including when any corticosteroid therapy was initiated; corticosteroid therapy may be a contraindication to the procedure. Pathologists should communicate the interpretive results of the biopsy to the surgeon of record, the referring healthcare practitioner, and the primary care practitioner to facilitate proper treatment.

Patients should be informed that temporal artery biopsy is a diagnostic procedure only, as they sometimes believe it will improve or cure their underlying condition. The patient must be informed to continue any initiated oral corticosteroid therapy until the biopsy results are finalized and communicated to the interprofessional team.
