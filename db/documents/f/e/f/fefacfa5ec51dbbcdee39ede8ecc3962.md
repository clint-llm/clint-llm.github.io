Even with the appropriate dietary therapy, most patients survive with at least 1-2 long-term complications. Almost all females with classic galactosemia present with hypergonadotropic hypogonadism/primary ovarian insufficiency (POI).

Severely ill infants with galactosemia (e.g., those with sepsis, coagulopathy, liver dysfunction) may develop permanent liver, brain, and/or eye damage (although cataracts are often completely reversible).

Most patients with severe galactosemia often do not survive the newborn period if treatment is not initiated.
