The procedure must be explained to the patient, preferably with illustrations or with actual patient photos. They must understand that the flap will appear as a trunk connecting the medial brow to the nose/face, for three weeks or more, and a second surgical stage is required to separate the flap. Also, one or more additional stages may be required to revise the flap. The patient must be able and willing to leave the flap undisturbed until it is time for division and inset. Bleeding is common in the first 24 to 48 hours, especially at the base of the flap pedicle, and the patient should be prepared for this occurrence with gauze to reinforce the dressing. Phone numbers should be given to contact in case the bleeding is heavy or cannot be stopped. Smoking should be stopped as long as possible prior to surgery and for the duration of healing. Patients should also be asked about any upcoming events or trips, as it is not uncommon to forget to divulge this information until after surgery. They should also be prepared to avoid any strenuous or other activities that would increase the risk of bleeding. We do not routinely discontinue anticoagulants that have been prescribed, but this is at the discretion of the operating surgeon and the prescribing physician. The risk of adverse events by stopping anticoagulants potentially more serious than that due to the effects of those agents on the surgery.
