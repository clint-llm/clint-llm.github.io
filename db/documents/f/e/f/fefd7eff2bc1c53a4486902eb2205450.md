Opioids are administered abundantly by the medical fraternity around the world due to their excellent analgesic and other related uses, namely cough, diarrhea, mood disorders. Nonetheless, accompanying their therapeutic utility are adverse effects that limit their use in different settings. The recent opioid crisis has propelled researchers to search for innovative strategies to counter the rising epidemic by accelerating the development of new analogs with minimal tolerance, dependence, and other harmful effects. Comprehending the diversity of signaling at different types of opioid receptors and how intracellular mechanics lead to the regulation of pain and reward could reveal new and useful opioid receptor drug candidates. Further genetic research needs to be undertaken to recognize specific genetic variants associated with increased addiction potential to opioids.
