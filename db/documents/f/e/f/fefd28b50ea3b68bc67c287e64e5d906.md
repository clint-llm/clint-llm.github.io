The average size and hemoglobin content of the RBCs are within the normal range in typical normocytic normochromic anemia cases. Under microscopic examination, RBCs usually appear similar to normal cells. However, in some other cases, remarkable variations in each cell size and shape may be detectable, causing normal average values.

Bone marrow morphology can help us differentiate various types of anemia:

- Normal morphology: Secondary anemia (inflammation, renal disease, renal disease, endocrine deficiency, etc.)

- Hypoplastic: Aplastic anemia

- Infiltration/fibrosis: Leukemia, myelofibrosis, metastases

- Dyserythropoetic: Myelodysplasia
