The proper management of gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina requires the combined efforts of pediatricians, ophthalmologists, neurologists, geneticists, dieticians, and other health professionals. Only effective interprofessional communication between these health care providers across a wide range of disciplines, and with patients and their parents, can ensure that proper care is delivered to these patients. The currently most effective approach in the management of GA is the early diagnosis of the condition followed by dietary modifications, specifically the restriction of arginine in the diet, and treatment of complications.
