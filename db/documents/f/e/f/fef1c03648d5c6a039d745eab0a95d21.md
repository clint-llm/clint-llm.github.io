The lateral femoral circumflex artery and its many anatomical variants are important to keep mind when approaching the hip for surgical intervention. Procedures such as total arthroplasty of the hip, trochanteric/intertrochanteric osteotomies, hip arthroscopy, and injections to the hip joint may put the artery at risk.

The branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery course along the anterior femoral neck and are at risk of injury during surgery of the femoral neck.

The lateral circumflex femoral artery can also suffer damage during vascular interventional procedures such as catheterization, stenting, embolectomy, angiography, and angioplasty.

The lateral circumflex artery has also been used for bypass grafting in the heart, brain, and neck.
