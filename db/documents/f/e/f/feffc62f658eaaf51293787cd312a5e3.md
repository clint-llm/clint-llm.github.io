Both of these procedures are in the scope of practice of any prehospital provider with the equipment present to perform the procedure. The majority of prehospital systems should have protocols in place for who can perform these procedures and when they should be performed. Provider familiarity with these protocols is paramount.

With ever-improving technology, there may be roles for in-hospital approaches to be adapted to the prehospital setting to improve diagnostic accuracy as well as improve time to diagnosis. Ultrasound has been demonstrated many times in the emergency department literature to be a quick and effective tool in the rapid diagnosis of pneumothorax and is now considered part of the standard approach to the traumatically injured patient. What was once a large, cumbersome technology is rapidly becoming more portable and accessible and perhaps a future tool in the arsenal of prehospital workers. Ultrasound probes can connect to portable electronic devices, allowing for a mobile tool to be used in the field to help assess patients. In time this may become the new standard of care for prehospital providers, but more research will be needed to demonstrate the effect on patient outcomes.
