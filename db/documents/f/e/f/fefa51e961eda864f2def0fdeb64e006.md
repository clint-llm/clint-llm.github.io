The cerebral venous system is a network most commonly described as two essential systems working in conjunction with one another: the superficial system and the deep system. The superficial cerebral system, which is typically more relevant in clinical scenarios, is made up of the sagittal sinuses and cortical veins, which drain the superficial surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres. The deep cerebral system is comprised of the straight, lateral, and sigmoid sinuses and functions to drain the deeper surfaces of the cerebral hemispheres.

Significant differentiation between the cerebral venous system and the rest of the body is the cerebral venous system contains both no valves or muscular layer, making it susceptible to ruptures and, ultimately, subdural hematomas. Both the superficial and deep venous systems eventually drain into the internal jugular veins, and ultimately the brachiocephalic vein followed by the right atrium via the superior vena cava.
