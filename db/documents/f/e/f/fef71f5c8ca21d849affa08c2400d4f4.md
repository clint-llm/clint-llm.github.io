The management of neurofibromatosis is best done with an interprofessional team, including dermatologists, neurologists, pediatricians, and genetic counselors. The key is to monitor the patient for CNS tumors, which, if detected late, have a poor prognosis. Genetic counseling should be available to patients with an affected child. The dermatologist, ophthalmologist, neurosurgeon, neurologist, and general surgeon should regularly follow up with these patients to ensure that no mass lesions are developing in the body.
