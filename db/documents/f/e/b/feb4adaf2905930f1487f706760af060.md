Periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage is a disease process that primarily affects the premature newborn infant born at less than 33 weeks of gestation. Hemorrhage occurs when vessels of the germinal matrix in the periventricular area rupture and extend into the intraventricular space. When bleeding extends into the intraparenchymal space adjacent to the ventricle, it is termed periventricular hemorrhage. In severe cases, bleeding occupies a significant portion of the ventricle, in which case it is described as intraventricular hemorrhage. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage in newborns and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the infant population at risk for periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage.
- Explain how to evaluate periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage.
- Review management strategies for newborn periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage. 
- Identify interprofessional team actions to improve detection and management of newborn periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage.
