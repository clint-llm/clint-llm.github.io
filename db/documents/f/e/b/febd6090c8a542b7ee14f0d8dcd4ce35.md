Becker muscular dystrophy is a rare disease almost exclusively in males due to X-linked inheritance. The worldwide prevalence of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy ranges from 0.1 to 1.8 per 10000 male individuals. According to research conducted in the United States in 2010, the prevalence of BMD for all age groups was 0.26 per 10000 male individuals, and it was found more common among non-Hispanic whites than non-Hispanic blacks. The study of Becker muscular dystrophy (per 10000 males) suggests the prevalence of 0.01 in South Africa, 0.1 to 0.2 in Asia, and 0.1 to 0.7 in European countries. Isolated data shows Becker muscular dystrophy is three times less common than Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
