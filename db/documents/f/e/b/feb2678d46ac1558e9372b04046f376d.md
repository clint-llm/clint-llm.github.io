Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn is a red blood cell mismatch between mothers and their fetuses that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Fortunately, fatal consequences from this disorder have become rare with the appropriate use of immunoprophylaxis. However, to avoid the fatal consequences of this disorder, prompt recognition and treatment are vital. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and prevention of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and epidemiology of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.
- Review the pathophysiology of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.
- Outline the management of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn and improve outcomes.
