Arthrocentesis is a valuable procedure for determining the etiology of joint effusion. Evaluation of the aspirated fluid can serve to classify the effusion into non-inflammatory, inflammatory, septic, and hemorrhagic. Septic arthritis is typically mono-microbial and broken down into two categories, gonococcal and non-gonococcal, based on age and history. Adults < 35 years old have infections from N. gonorrhea. Adults > 35 years old are most likely to present with S. aureus infections. History, such as recent travel and immunocompromised states, can clue the provider into other causative organisms, including Strep. spp, aerobic gram-negative, anaerobic gram-negative, brucellosis, Mycobacteria spp, fungal, and Mycoplasma hominis. Crystalline arthritis and autoimmune disease can cause an inflammatory joint effusion. Trauma is the most common cause of hemorrhagic joint effusion, but there are case reports of supratherapeutic INRs associated with spontaneous hemarthrosis.
