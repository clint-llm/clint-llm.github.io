Ileus refers to the intolerance of oral intake due to inhibition of the gastrointestinal propulsion without signs of mechanical obstruction. The diagnosis is often associated with surgery, medications, trauma, peritonitis, or severe illness. Mechanical obstruction has to be ruled out, and the diagnosis of ileus is dependent on radiographic evidence, usually on a CT scan or small bowel series. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of an Ileus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of ileus.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with ileus.
- Review the management options available for ileus.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with ileus.
