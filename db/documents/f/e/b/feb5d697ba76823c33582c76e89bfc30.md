For treatment-resistant MDD and PTSD, depressive symptoms likely improve or may go away entirely, although it may take a few weeks of rTMS sessions. After the rTMS treatment series, standard care for depression such as psychotherapy or medication can be recommended as an ongoing treatment to prevent relapse. However, the use of maintenance rTMS sessions is still under research. Still, studies have shown the beneficial effect of rTMS if depressive symptoms occur later on in patients where this treatment was initially successful. This is known as re-induction.

Studies have shown that rTMS is safe and effective for stroke complications as well and accelerates their recovery. Improvements in Parkinson's disease, functional tremors, focal epilepsy, cortical myoclonus, dysarthria, aphasia have also been studied.
