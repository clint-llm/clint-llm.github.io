Mavacamten is a novel, first-in-class molecule used to manage and treat patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). It is currently indicated for treating adults with symptomatic heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II and III) secondary to obstructive HCM to improve functional capacity and symptoms. Mavacamten is a selective and reversible inhibitor of the cardiac myosin ATPase. This activity reviews the indications, mechanism of action, adverse effects, and monitoring protocol of mavacamten as a novel agent in treating symptomatic heart failure patients secondary to obstructive HCM.

**Objectives:**
- Identify and review the mechanism of action of mavacamten.
- Outline the indications for mavacamten.
- Review the adverse events associated with mavacamten utilization.
- Describe the monitoring protocol for patients on mavacamten.
