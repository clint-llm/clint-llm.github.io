DJS comes from mutations of the ATP binding cassette subfamily C member (ABCC2) gene. The ABCC2 gene provides instructions for producing a protein called multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) that works as a transporter protein. The MRP2 protein is involved in the transport of substances out of cells and is essential for the secretion of conjugated bilirubin out of the hepatocytes into the bile duct system for excretion. Mutation of the ABCC2 gene causes a deficiency of canalicular MRP2 expression and impairs the transport of conjugated bilirubin into the bile duct system. Conjugated bilirubin accumulates in hepatocytes, and conjugated bilirubin levels rise in the blood.

A classic feature of DJS is the reversal of the ratio of the byproducts generated during heme synthesis. The levels of urinary coproporphyrin l levels are greater than coproporphyrin lll. In otherwise healthy people, the ratio of coproporphyrin lll to coproporphyrin l is about 3.5:1.
