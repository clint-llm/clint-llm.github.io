Neuronal damage often progresses rapidly in PNS. Treatment should be started immediately without waiting for antibody analysis results.

**Tumor removal:**Once the tumor is identified, a prompt, complete removal is recommended so as to eliminate the ectopically produced antigen present on it.

**Immunosuppression/Immunomodulation:**Classic paraneoplastic encephalitis is hard to treat because the neuronal damage is cell-mediated. Hence, antibody directed therapies like IVIG and plasmapheresis are ineffective. On the other hand, T cell-directed therapies such as cyclophosphamide, rituximab, steroids, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus have been shown to have a modest effect in some cases.

Therapy in PNS is often delayed, and substantial irreversible neuronal cell damage has already occurred at the time of presentation.  After 3 to 6 months of therapy, repeat brain imaging is recommended.  If the disease has progressed, immunotherapy should be stopped.

**Symptomatic:**Anti-epileptic drugs are to be used for seizures. Muscle rigidity and spasms can be managed with muscle relaxants such as baclofen, tizanidine, and benzodiazepines.

**Stop**immune checkpoint inhibitors promptly if suspected to be causing PNS.
