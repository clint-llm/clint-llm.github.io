Pulmonary function testing is the standard for emphysema evaluation. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity**(**FVC) ratios will typically be <0.7.  FVC decreases because of loss of elastic recoil of the lung. There will be an increase in total lung capacity, residual volume, and functional residual capacity, as well as a decrease in vital capacity.  A decrease in diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) will often be present because of the destruction of lung interstitium. In a young patient who presents with emphysema, it may be beneficial to test for alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency. A chest x-ray will many times show flattening of the diaphragm because of hyperinflation.  EKG may show right axis deviation, right ventricular hypertrophy or right atrial hypertrophy.  Complete blood count may show increased hemoglobin and hematocrit because of reactive erythrocytosis from chronic hypoxia.  Blood chemistry panels will show increased serum bicarbonate because of metabolic compensation for respiratory acidosis.
