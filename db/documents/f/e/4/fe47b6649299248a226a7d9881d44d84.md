# Continuing Education Activity

Fluorocarbons are fluorinated carbon chain polymers that are used in an assortment of household and commercial products as waterproofing agents, lubricants, sealants, and leather conditioners. These products have been implicated in sporadic outbreaks of respiratory illness characterized by dyspnea, cough, and chest pain. Though typically self-limited, more severe exposure may lead to respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and even death. Studies investigating the mechanism of fluoropolymer-related respiratory illness in humans have been difficult to perform for the following reasons: chemical formulation of these products is proprietary, chemical formulations are intermittently reformulated, product labels and safety data sheets (SDS) may not report fluorocarbon presence if present only in small amounts. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of fluoride/fluorocarbon toxicity, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the basic pathophysiology and toxicokinetics of fluorocarbon exposure toxicity.
- Identify the common presenting features of fluoride and fluorocarbon toxicity on an examination/evaluation.
- Outline the treatment and management strategies available for patients with fluoride/fluorocarbon toxicity.
- Summarize how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients suffering from fluorocarbon toxicity.

# Introduction

Fluorocarbons are fluorinated carbon chain polymers that are used in an assortment of household and commercial products as waterproofing agents, lubricants, sealants, and leather conditioners

These products have been implicated in sporadic outbreaks of respiratory illness characterized by dyspnea, cough, and chest pain

# Etiology

Fluoropolymers, also called fluorocarbons or perfluorocarbons, can be found in a variety of household and commercial products.  They are most commonly encountered as components of waterproofing agents. Other uses include lubricants, sealants, and leather conditioners. Fluoropolymers are defined by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) as molecules consisting solely of carbon and fluorine. However, compounds that contain molecules other than carbon and fluorine (described as fluorocarbon derivatives) are often referred to as fluoropolymers as well.

# Epidemiology

Fluoropolymer-related respiratory illness has become a public health concern due to multiple occurrences of large population exposure

The onset of symptoms is rapid, within minutes to hours of exposure

# Pathophysiology

Fluoropolymers are ultrafine particles ranging in size from 0.02-0.2 µm

The compounds used in waterproofing products reportedly underwent a formulation change after the passage of Title IV of the Clean Air Act amendments and transitioned from a fluoroalkane structure to the more toxic fluoroalkene structure

Fluoroalkanes contain only single bonds and are more chemically stable and therefore of lower toxicity than fluoroalkenes, which contain double bonds

Because these products have been associated with multiple occurrences of respiratory illness, with hundreds of victims involved in some outbreaks, fluoropolymer-related respiratory illness has become a public health concern. Despite this, a review of the literature on this topic fails to yield a clearly elucidated mechanism to explain why illness develops after exposure to some products and not others.

The most convincing evidence to date regarding a mechanism of disease is the change in fluoropolymer structure (from fluoroalkane to fluoroalkene)

# History and Physical

Fluoropolymer-related respiratory illness often resembles polymer fume fever, with acute respiratory signs and symptoms often accompanied by flu-like symptoms

# Evaluation

Abnormal laboratory studies are often limited to those indicating inflammatory reactions, such as leukocytosis and elevated c-reactive protein (CRP)

# Treatment / Management

Basic supportive measures, such as removal of the exposure, fresh air, and supplemental oxygen, are adequate in many cases

# Differential Diagnosis

- Arsenic toxicity

- Cardiac glycoside plant poisoning

- Chlorine toxicity

- Cough, Cold and Allergy preparation toxicity

- Disulfiram like mushroom toxicity

- Gyromitra mushroom toxicity

- Hallucinogenic mushroom toxicity

- Heavy metal toxicity

- Herb poisoning

- Hydrofluoric acid burns

- Liquorice poisoning

- Orellanine mushroom toxicity

- Scombroid toxicity

- Vitamin toxicity

# Prognosis

Most patients recover within 24 hours

Pulmonary symptoms may last longer than other symptoms, such as nausea and fever.  In more severe cases, there have been reports of respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and rarely death

# Complications

While most patients experience a full recovery, chronic lung abnormalities and the development of pulmonary fibrosis have been reported

# Consultations

Poison centers have played a crucial role in the recognition of these disease outbreaks, with voluntary recalls beginning the first few days after the first reported illness in many cases and therefore, consultation with poison control is strongly recommended.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

General hygiene, such as the use of personal protective equipment, use in well-ventilated areas (outdoors if possible), frequent hand washing, and avoidance of smoking to avoid exposure to pyrolysis products, should be encouraged

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Patients should be educated about the association of these products with respiratory illness and reminded to use these products only as directed to help avoid future breakouts. Additionally, patients should be made aware of the fact that many products do not list the presence of a fluorocarbon on the SDS since it comprises less than 1% of the total ingredients.
