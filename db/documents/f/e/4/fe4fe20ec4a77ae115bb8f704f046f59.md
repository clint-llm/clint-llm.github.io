The incidence of prosthetic joint infection in primary arthroplasties is 1 - 2 % and in revision arthroplasties 4%

The implicated pathogens of prosthetic joint infection are best categorized into three groups based on when they are likely to be isolated from culture materials in relation to the duration of the implant.

**Early infection,**which is within the first four weeks after the primary procedure. This is typically caused by highly virulent organisms includingStaphylococcus aureus, aerobic gram-negative Bacilli, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, and enterococci.

**Delayed infection,**from 3 months to 1 year, is typically caused by low virulent organisms including coagulase-negativeStaphylococcus, Propionibacterium acnes, and Enterococci. To a lesser extent, S. aureus may also be implicated.

**Late infection**(over one year; some authors use over 2 years) are typically hematogenous and often caused byStaphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, viridans streptococcus, Enterococci, and occasionally gram-negative bacilli. See figure.

In summary, Staphylococci account for more than 50% of total prosthetic joint infections. Approximately 20% may be polymicrobial, 15% caused by gram-negative, and about 10% are culture negative.
