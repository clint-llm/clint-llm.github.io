Elevation in the markers of coagulation activation is substantially more in polycythemia vera as compared to secondary polycythemia.

As secondary polycythemia is a rare disease, it may be a clinically challenging condition. Because this disease can be difficult to manage, patients should be referred to a specialized center in order to be managed by an interprofessional team. Secondary polycythemia lacks specific management recommendations as opposed to polycythemia vera. Many of the recommendations have been extrapolated from those of polycythemia vera due to a lack of high-level evidence.
