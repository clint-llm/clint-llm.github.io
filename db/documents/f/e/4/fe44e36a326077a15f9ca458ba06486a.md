Brain herniation can be labeled as “brain code” to connate the emergent need to timely counteract such disastrous brain processes.

The brain is encased within the skull, any rise in intracranial pressure is limited to some extent by the compensatory displacement of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and changes in cerebral blood volume as evident by the Monro-Kellie doctrine.

When it overrides these compensatory mechanisms, certain parts of the brain start herniating through specific foramina formed by the falx and the tentorial incisura within the skull, thereby propagating progressive herniation syndromes.

Brain herniation is a life-threatening event and needs urgent attention. The five types of brain herniations include:

- Subfalcine involves the cingulate gyrus, which is pushed against the falx cerebri.

- Transtenorial (uncal) involves the medial temporal lobe, which is often squeezed by a mass under and across the tentorium.

- Central involves herniation of both temporal lobes through the tentorial notch.

- A tonsillar herniation is caused by an infratentorial mass, forcing the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum.

- Upward herniation occurs when an infratentorial mass compressed the brainstem.
