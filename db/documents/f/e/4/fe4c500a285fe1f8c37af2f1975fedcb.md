Several staging systems have been proposed for PTC and continue to evolve.

For patients less than 45 years:

- Stage l: any Tm, any N, M0 (cancer localized to the thyroid)

- Stage ll: Any T, any N, M1 (cancer spread to cervical nodes or distant organs)

For patients older than 45 years:

- Stage l: T1, N0, M0 (cancer less than 2 cm)

- Stage ll: T2, N0, M0, and T3 (cancer localized to the thyroid that is between 2Â to 4 cm)

- Stage lll: T4, N0, M0, and any T, N1, M0 (lesion more than 4 cm and spread limited to the neck)

- Stage lV: Any T, any N, M1 (cancer spread outside the neck and to distant organs)
