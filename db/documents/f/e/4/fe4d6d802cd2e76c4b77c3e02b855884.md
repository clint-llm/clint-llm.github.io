The spectrum of clinical features of ichthyosis vulgaris varies from mild xerosis to large adherent scales (lizard skin). Heterozygous FLG mutations usually present in infancy or early childhood. Fine, whitish, scales with predominant extensor distribution is the hallmark manifestation. The flexural areas are typically spared, due to the presence of humidity in these areas. In homozygous individuals, the manifestations are much more severe with large, centrally adherent scales, especially on the lower limbs and trunk and palmoplantar fissuring and hyperkeratosis. Severe cases may show facial involvement with mild ectropion and perioral fissuring. The scalp shows extensive scaling. Nails and mucosa are usually unaffected.

The scaling shows a seasonal exacerbation in winter and is relatively improved in the summer and in humid climates. Even though it persists lifelong, ichthyosis vulgaris tends to improve with age.

About 25%Â to 50% of patients of ichthyosis vulgaris show associated atopic dermatitis, asthma, and hay fever, with filaggrin deficiency being the major predisposing factor. Keratosis pilaris and palmoplantar hyperlinearity are other associated features.
