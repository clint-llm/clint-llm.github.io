Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal fistulas between arteries and veins without an intervening capillary bed. High arterial flow directly into venous structures can lead to disruption of the venous walls and ultimately cause fatal hemorrhage.

Cerebral AVMs are heterogeneous entities that differ significantly in size, location, feeding, and draining vessels. The most well-known classification system to describe them is the Spetzler-Martin grading scale.
