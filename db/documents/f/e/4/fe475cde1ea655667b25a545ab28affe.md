As a sulfonamide-derived medication, the prescribing clinician needs to review relevant allergies when prescribing chlorthalidone. An interprofessional team approach, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), specialists, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists, can help to maintain updated allergies. A review of allergies can start upon reception by asking patients to review their previous chart and update relevant sections, including allergies. While in a hospital setting, it can be prompted before administration by the nurse. In a pharmacy setting, the pharmacist can inquire before the dispersal of the medication. Additionally, EMR now allows an additional barrier with risk-advisory when prescribing medication to which patients are allergic.

In addition to allergies, clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists are responsible for counseling the patient, verifying dosing, and monitoring for adverse events. Pharmacists must also perform medication reconciliation to preclude any possible drug-drug interactions and notify the other interprofessional healthcare team members when concerns arise.

Updating the type of adverse reaction occurring with the allergy is vital to avoid and characterize the true allergy. Deciphering whether a true allergy or previous side-effect from a medication is crucial as it changes therapeutic options for the patient.
