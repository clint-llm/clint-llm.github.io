Tropheryma whipplei was described in 1992. It was named Tropheryma whippelii until 2001, when its name was modified to conform with the proper spelling of Dr. George Hoyt Whipple's name. It is a gram-positive bacillus, periodic acid-Schiff-positive (PAS), and acid-fast negative. Electron microscopy showed that the bacillus core is enclosed within a plasma membrane, which is surrounded by a three-layered cell wall. The inner layer contains polysaccharides that stain positive with PAS. The outer layer resembles a plasma membrane and may be of host origin, which possibly accounts for the failure of the host to mount a humoral antibody response to the infection.
