Once a patient has been diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis, the nurse practitioner and primary care provider should educate the patient on potential complications and the course of the illness. The patient should be told to avoid all physical activity for at least 4-6 weeks to minimize the risk of splenic rupture. The patient should be told about the signs and symptoms of splenic rupture and when to return to the hospital. All patients should be told about the need to follow up until the symptoms subside and permission to return to physical activity.  The nurse should educate the patient on supportive care, the need to remain hydrated, and assist in educating the patient and family on precautions to take to avoid the spread of the infection as well as when to return for further evaluation. Finally, all clinicians looking after patients with mononucleosis should be aware of the potential complications, and make the appropriate referral to the specialist when symptoms arise.

**Outcomes**

The majority of individuals who develop mononucleosis have an excellent outcome. The disorder is self-limited and recovery is common in 2-4 weeks. The rare patient may develop a splenic rupture but even these cases are now managed conservatively as long as the patient remains hemodynamically stable.
