Following correct patient identification, assessment should begin with history and examination to ascertain indications for intervention. Informed consent must be obtained following a discussion of the risks and benefits of aspiration. Significant risks include pain, infection, the need for future procedures, and damage to surrounding structures.

Other than possible damage to nerves, blood vessels, and tendons, this includes implant damage in periprosthetic seromas and pneumothorax in chest wall seromas.

A clean trolley should be used, and a sterile field should be set up with the equipment required. The aseptic non-touch technique must be adhered to throughout the procedure to minimize the risk of introducing infection. The clinician should use personal protective equipment, including gloves, an apron, a mask, and a visor, to minimize exposure to bodily fluids.
