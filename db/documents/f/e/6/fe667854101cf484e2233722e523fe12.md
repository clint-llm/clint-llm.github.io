An inferior shoulder dislocation is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the orthopedic nurses and therapists. While the diagnosis of an inferior shoulder dislocation is relatively simple, clinicians should assess for any distal neurovascular injuries, including assessment of the axillary nerve along with the radial and ulnar distributions of the brachial plexus, as these tend to occur in inferior dislocations. The patient will not be able to adduct the arm without significant pain, if at all. The examiner may be able to palpate the humeral head in the axilla or on the lateral chest wall. Keep in mind that a high index of suspicion must be maintained for other serious traumatic injuries to the thorax or abdomen if the dislocation involved high forces. To ensure proper long term healing and to mitigate any associated disability, orthopedicÂ referral should be recommended for all patients that have been dislocated and reduced. The outcomes in most patients are fair but recurrence is a common problem.
