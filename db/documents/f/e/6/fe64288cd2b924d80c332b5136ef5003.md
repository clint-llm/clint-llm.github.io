Ventricular non-compaction is a distinct genetic heterogeneous disease, that may affect both ventricles. The disorder may be isolated or be associated with other congenital cardiac malformation. It may present as dilated cardiomyopathy or less commonly with restrictive physiology. The prognosis for these patients is generally poor. LVNC patients can die suddenly to arrhythmia, thromboembolic events and left ventricular dysfunction. Some symptomatic patients may benefit from cardiac transplantation.  Because of the rarity of the disorder and its diverse presentation, management of the condition is best with an interprofessional team.
