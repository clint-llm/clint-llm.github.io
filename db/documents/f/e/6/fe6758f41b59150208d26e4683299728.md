Skin biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing CADASIL in cases where no genetic mutation is found. Accumulation of granular osmiophilic material (GOM) around smooth muscle in small arteries is the characteristic appearance. These findings are most prevalent in the brain, but can also be seen in skin and muscle samples throughout the body, thus the diagnosis via skin biopsy. On histopathology, the appearance is typical of any small vessel disease, with degeneration of vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelium, and basal lamina. Notably, atherosclerosis is absent. Again, changes are most prominent in small cerebral vessels as opposed to elsewhere in the body.
