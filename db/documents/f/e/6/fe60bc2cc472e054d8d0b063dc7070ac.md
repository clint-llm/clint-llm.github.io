The basic pieces of equipment involved in the synthesizing of an electroencephalograph are electrodes, amplifiers, and plotting equipment. Until recently, electrolytic gel and salts were used to improve the conductivity from the scalp, through the electrodes. The advent of the 'dry electrodes' hastens the scalp preparation, by obviating the need for gels and salts. This results in a more accurate EEG recording but is yet to be used in a widespread manner. As of today, the EEG electrode caps are well-tolerated by all age groups. The amplifier and plotting equipment historically was a mechanical pen and paper recording device. This has been replaced by innovative digital EEG systems that allow for faster sampling rates and simultaneously record from an increasing number of channels. These days, a standard commercially available EEG system used in clinical practice can readily obtain data from at least 128 channels, with over 10 kHz sampling rate by all channels and a 24-bit resolution at each amplifier.

Interpreting an EEG involves understanding of the electrical wave progression over the brain. The basic electrode placement follows the universal 10 to 20 system and is set to the required montages. Montages are EEG electrode settings used to specifically record the endplate polysynaptic potentials (EPSP), from a focused point of interest.

These fit broadly under three headings:

- Referential montages

- Bipolar montages

- Laplacian montages

Referential montages: A referential montage plots the waveforms from the suspected point of focus on the head (known as an active electrode) to a reference point elsewhere on the body, including the scalp. However, the virtue of neutrality is not guaranteed in this reference electrode.

- Central reference - A high signal to noise ratio (SNR) is favorable for a successful EEG recording. It is a virtue of the intensity and frequency of the stimulus, as well as the active and the reference electrode. Historically, the potential at midline electrode (‘Cz') or the average potential at all electrodes, was selected as the reference.

- Average reference - The average of all potentials across the brain is taken as reference.

- Localized reference - The average of only the surrounding potentials of a particular electrode is taken to calculate the average.

Today, a dynamic selection method for the reference electrode is proposed, which allows all electrodes to be looked upon as active electrodes. In contrast, an electrode is statistically chosen, based on the highest estimated SNR, as the reference electrode for that specific frequency stimulus.

Bipolar montages: The term 'bipolar' is derived from the mechanism of recordings in this electrode placement. There exist two electrodes, both placed along an anteroposterior or in a left-over-right position in such a way, that the difference plotted is between two set regions over the brain. Hence, this is also known as differential montages.

Laplacian montages: This a different type of montage, where the second derivative is a combined weighted average of the voltages surrounding the particular electrode of interest. It is estimated using relatively complex computation in practice, and the net result depends on the particular electrode involved in the montage. It is best applicable when the focal discharges transmit a minimal field.

Various types of montage settings are used for evaluation based on the suspected lobular involvement, to accurately isolate the epileptic focus.
