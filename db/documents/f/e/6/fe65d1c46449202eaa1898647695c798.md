**Principles of Tendon Transfer to Avoid Complications**

- Choose a tendon donor for transfer that minimizes functional loss. The donor tendon must be expendable.

- The muscle strength of the donor's tendon must be near normal as it will lose a function grade with the transfer (a tendon with 5/5 strength will decrease to 4/5 strength after transfer).

- Excursion of donor's tendon should be similar to an excursion of recipient's tendon, wrist extension and flexion tendons have 33 mm excursion, finger extensors 50 mm of excursion, and finger flexors 70 mm of excursion (Smith 3-5-7 rule). Utilizing the tenodesis effect of the wrist can compensate for an additional 20 mm to 30 mm of finger tendon excurison.

- The donor tendon should be routed in the direction of pull that is line with the recipient's tendon.

- A singe tendon transfer should aim to restore one function.

- Soft tissue adjacent to transfer site should be stable and pliable to allow for tendon gliding.

- The full passive range of motion of the joint controlled by the transferred tendon should be achieved before surgery.

- Donor tendons should be in the same phase as recipient's tendons if possible (finger extensor act in phase with wrist flexors and finger flexors act in phase with wrist extensors).
