Expecting mothers should be counseled on the avoidance of the modifiable risk factors for miscarriage. However, there is limited evidence to support the use of any single prevention strategy. Pelvic rest, tocolytics, anticoagulants, and supplemental beta-hCG have not been shown to decrease the risk of early pregnancy loss. Aspirin has only been shown to reduce the rate of spontaneous abortion in women with anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. Likewise, supplemental progesterone has only been shown to prevent early pregnancy loss in women with recurrent spontaneous abortion. Also, genetic testing for maternal and fetal chromosomal abnormalities or anti-phospholipid syndrome is only recommended in the setting of recurrent miscarriage.
