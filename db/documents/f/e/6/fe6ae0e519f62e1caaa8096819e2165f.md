As mentioned above, SC has its origin in sebaceous cells. When occurring in the periocular region, the most frequent, SC usually arise from Meibomian glands, which are modified sebaceous glands, but also from the sebaceous glands of Zeiss, and the sebaceous glands in the ocular caruncle.

The majority of sebaceous carcinomas arise from de novo mutations. They may also develop from benign sebaceous neoplasms, although this appears to be relatively uncommon. Sebaceous carcinomas associated with Muir-Torre syndrome have a loss of mismatch repair gene expression and exhibit microsatellite instability.
