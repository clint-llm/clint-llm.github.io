High-quality imaging is essential in the evaluation of suspected liver metastasis. It can confirm the diagnosis as well as aid in identifying the primary disease. The most common imaging modalities include triple-phase CT and MRI scans. The triple-phase CT scan consists of a non-contrast phase, arterial phase, and venous phase. Liver metastasis and primary liver tumors tend to have the strongest attenuation in the arterial phase and tend to be hypo attenuating in non-contrast studies. CT is particularly advantageous as it can aid in tumor localization which can be used during the planning of liver-directed therapies. CT imaging evaluates metastatic tumor size, morphology, degree of liver disease, and the predicted future liver remnant. It is critical to determine the potential resectability of liver tumors, as lesions near major vascular structures may be inoperable. MRI is another modality that can be utilized if there is difficulty characterizing a liver lesion. Liver metastasis on T1 weighted imaging appears hypo-intense and hyperintense on T2 imaging. Gadolinium contrast-enhanced T1 weighted images can show total or rim enhancement depending on the size.

Other contrast agents such as gadoxetate disodium (Eovist) and gadobenate dimeglumine (Multihance) have been designed to enhance the sensitivity of MRI. The challenge is that there exist several benign conditions that can mimic liver metastasis on imaging. Fluorodeoxyglucose-18 (FDG) PET/CT can aid in the detection of hepatic metastasis and may assist in identifying primary and extrahepatic metastasis. However, it has poorer anatomic resolution than CT and is insensitive in detecting lesions smaller than 1cm in size. Despite this, there are instances where PET/CT has been useful specifically in detecting metastatic neuroendocrine carcinomas, namely gallium-68 DOTATATE PET imaging. Ultrasonography has poorer sensitivity and is not routinely used in diagnostic workups. The workup should also include basic liver function tests, complete blood count, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), and colonoscopy.
