Endovascular papillary angioendothelioma (EPA), also known as Dabska tumor (DT) and papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma (PILA), represents a borderline entity between hemangioma and angiosarcoma. EPA has an overall favorable prognosis. However, it does have the potential for local recurrence and low-grade metastasis. It most frequently presents in children in various skin locations, subcutaneous tissue, and in deeper areas of the body. However, there have been reports of EPA in adults and internal organs.

Lesions are typically two to three centimeters in size at the time of presentation. A biopsy is diagnostic, and treatment is wide surgical excision.
