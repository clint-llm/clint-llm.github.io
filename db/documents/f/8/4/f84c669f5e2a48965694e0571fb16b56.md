Providing general anesthesia for ECT is essential in every case and is only done without anesthesia in developing countries where proper equipment and personnel are not available. ECT is a first-line treatment for several disorders. When psychotic features and suicide risk are high, ECT is a useful initial treatment.  If a patient's depression has caused catatonia or psychomotor retardation involving the inability to eat or drink, then ECT is a viable treatment. It can provide fast relief if it is effective. One report indicates that for severe psychomotor depression, ECT provides up to 90% relief within two weeks.

ECT as a second-line treatment is mainly used when pharmacotherapy is ineffective or the patient's symptoms worsen.
