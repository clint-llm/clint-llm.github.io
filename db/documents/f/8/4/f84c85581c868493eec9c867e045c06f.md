Corneal transplants divide into two main types: penetrating (full-thickness) keratoplasty and partial thickness corneal transplants. The type of corneal transplant performed is primarily determined by the condition of the cornea in the receiving eye. In Descemet's-stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK), Descemet's membrane and the endothelium are replaced with a corneal graft including some stroma while the superficial layers of the recipient cornea are left intact. Some physicians roughen the peripheral stroma with a scraping device to aid adherence of the graft. Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) is the least aggressive type of corneal transplant as only Descemet's membrane, and the endothelium is replaced with donor tissue that does not include a stromal component.

Phototherapeutic keratectomy uses an excimer laser to remove the diseased part of the superficial cornea. This procedure may involve scar removal, smoothing of the cornea, epithelial erosion treatment, and the changing of corneal shape.
