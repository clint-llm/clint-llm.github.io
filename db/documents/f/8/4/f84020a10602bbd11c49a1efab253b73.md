The principal defense against early-onset GBS infection is the administration of antibiotic prophylaxis to mothers during labor and delivery. Identification of patients who will benefit from intrapartum prophylaxis is an important aspect of routine prenatal care

GBS bacteriuria is another marker of genital tract colonization

If GBS status is unknown, antibiotic prophylaxis should be initiated in patients with preterm labor (less than 37 weeks gestation), maternal fever during labor (greater than 100.4 F or 38 C), membranes ruptured greater than 18 hours, and/or in patients with a history of a previous child with invasive early-onset GBS infection
