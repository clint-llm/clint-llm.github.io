The clinical presentation of Takotsubo syndrome is the same as that of a patient with an acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndrome. Chest pain and dyspnea are common symptoms, but others may also present with nausea, palpitations, syncope, and vomiting. In many cases, the patient may describe a physical or an emotionally stressful event before the onset of symptoms. Unlike acute coronary syndrome, which presents during the early morning hours, Takotsubo syndrome tends to present in the mid-afternoon. The history will also reveal that patients with Takotsubo syndrome have a lower incidence of traditional coronary disease risk factors.

The physical exam is nonspecific and may be normal. However, some patients may be diaphoretic and have palpitations. Murmurs and rales may be present if pulmonary edema and left heart failure are present.
