Babesiosis is a rare tick-borne infection with a varied presentation. The organism can affect many organ systems and is best managed by an interprofessional team. The diagnosis is not easy and can be confused with malaria or other tick-borne disorder. Asymptomatic patients do not need treatment but must be followed because treatment is required if the parasitemia persists for more than 3 months.

As soon as the infection is diagnosed, it has to be reported to the local public health authority and the infectious disease expert should be consulted on management.

The pharmacist should educate the patient on the need for antibiotic compliance. In addition, the nurse should instruct the patient on preventive methods when traveling to certain parts of the USA. Avoidance of tick bite is the key. This can be done by wearing appropriate garments.

Delayed diagnosis can lead to high morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with no spleen. Interprofessional teamwork is key in the diagnosis and management of this condition.
