Tourette syndrome referred to as Tourette disorder in the recently updated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5), is a common neurodevelopmental disorder affecting up to 1% of the population. It is characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics and starts in childhood. Children with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) sometimes experience physical pain, social isolation, emotional disturbance, and are at risk for underachievement. It is difficult to distinguish whether these experiences are the result of the tics themselves or the fact that most children with Tourette syndrome also have other comorbid neuropsychiatric conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorder, or oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). The pathophysiology and genetic basis for GTS are not well understood despite many in-depth studies. Pharmacological treatment is not usually indicated, as children respond well to comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT). Teacher and caregiver education can have a positive impact on the social experience of a child struggling with Tourette syndrome. The prognosis is variable, as tics typically remit by adulthood, but the other neuropsychiatric conditions may persist.
