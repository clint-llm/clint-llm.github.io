Patients with LADA have mortality as high as T2DM despite having more favorable metabolic parameters. In the HUNT study, which is to date the largest population-based data on mortality in autoimmune diabetes (LADA), it was shown that hyperglycemia was the only significant influencing factor, and not the components of the metabolic syndrome, in determining mortality that was chiefly due to cardiovascular disease.

It, therefore, goes without saying that strict glycemic control is the key to improving the prognosis in LADA.
