Hemoglobin C is caused due to mutation in the beta-globin chain in which glutamate (acidic) is replaced by lysine (basic) in the sixth position of the beta-globin chain. This mutation makes Hb C less soluble than Hb A, forming hexagonal crystals (HbC crystals as seen in the peripheral smear).

Hemoglobin C is a hemoglobinopathy that is hereditary. It is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from the biparental inheritance of the allele that codes for Hemoglobin C. If both the parents are carriers of hemoglobin C, there is a 25% chance of having hemoglobin C disease in a child, 50% chance of having a child who is a carrier, and 25% chance of having a child who is neither a carrier nor have hemoglobin C disease.

The mutation present in some of the hemoglobinopathies (Hb S, Hb C, Hb E) may be an evolutionary modification due to the effect of some selective external forces like malaria as in the heterozygous form, these mutations protect carriers fromÂ dying of malarial infection. The cohort study was done on three hundred children in Bandiagara, Mali, found out that both HbC and HbS traits provide protection from clinical falciparum malaria.Plasmodium falciparum infected erythrocytes. This provides a mechanistic explanation for reduced disease mediating cytoadherence of parasitized hemoglobinopathic erythrocytes.

A retrospective study performed on all sickle cell disease patients who underwent red cell exchange transfusions (RBCEx) at the University of Arkansas found out the presence of other Hemoglobin variants too in the recipients. This new hemoglobin variant present in the patients was acquired as a result of RBCEx. The most commonly acquired hemoglobin variant was hemoglobin C (64/66 occurrences).
