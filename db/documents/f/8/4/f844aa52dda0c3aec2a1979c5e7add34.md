CA 125 plays a significant role as a tumor marker. It is an essential component in the pre-operative assessment of patients with an adnexal mass suspected to have an ovarian malignancy.

Current guidelines suggest using formal risk assessment tests such as the risk of malignancy index or the risk of ovarian malignancy algorithm (ROMA) while assessing the need for gynecological referral in premenopausal women.

CA 125 levels also indicate the tumor status, wherein most patients with levels > 35 U/mL demonstrate disease recurrence on second-look surgery, and those with levels < 35 U/mL have minimal residual disease among half of the patients.

CA 125 may also have a role in monitoring chemotherapy. Serial measurements of CA 125 correlated with clinical disease outcomes in 89% of 531 patients.

Pre- and post-operative CA 125 concentrations may be of prognostic significance.
