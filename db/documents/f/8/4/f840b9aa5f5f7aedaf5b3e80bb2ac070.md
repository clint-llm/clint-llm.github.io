The appearance of an azygos lobe on plain film or computed tomography (CT) scan may cause it to be confused with an abscess, bulla, or pneumothorax. The fine, convex line that crosses the apex may mimic the appearance of the wall of a bulla or the pleural line seen in a pneumothorax. In addition, consolidation of an azygos lobe has been reported and may mimic a lung mass. However, there have been no reported adverse events or outcomes attributed to such confusion.
