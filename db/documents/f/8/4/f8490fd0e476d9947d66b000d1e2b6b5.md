The common cause of portal hypertension is cirrhosis in Western countries. Noncirrhotic portal hypertension due to hepatic schistosomiasis and portal vein thrombosis is, however, the common cause in other parts of the world. Portal hypertension can remain asymptomatic until complications develop. Estimation of the hepatic venous pressure gradient and abdominal imaging studies can help determine the presence and etiology of portal hypertension in most cases.
