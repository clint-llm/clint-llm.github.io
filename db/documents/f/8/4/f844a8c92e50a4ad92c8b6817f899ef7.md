Hookworm infection tends to cause morbidity rather than mortality. In adults, anemia and malnourishment lead to reduced productivity with subsequently increased poverty.

In pregnancy, demand increases for iron, and subsequently, the risk is higher in this class of patients with an effect on both the mother and her fetus's wellbeing. School children are at risk of a decline in cognitive function and school achievement. In contrast, preschool children suffer less from the threat of anemia and malnutrition.

There are growing concerns regarding treatment failure, especially after mass drug administration campaigns. There is no sufficient data to illustrate the effect of deworming interventions on quality of life. Additionally, there is a need to develop a new generation of broad-spectrum agents and further assess the efficacy of combination therapy on the outcome.

Reinfection is another challenge in the treatment of hookworms. Moderate reinfection rates post-treatment support the concept of repeated drug regimens in highly endemic areas. A study of 405 school children, at 18 weeks follow-up post-treatment, showed that the reinfection rate was 25.0 % for hookworms (95 % CI: 15.5–36.6).
