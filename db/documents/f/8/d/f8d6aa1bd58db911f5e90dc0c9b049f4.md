- Uroporphyrinogen III is a chemical intermediateÂ in the biosynthesis of heme

- Uroporphyrinogen synthase is an essential enzyme in the production of uroporphyrinogen III; uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase is the enzyme involved in the metabolization of uroporphyrinogen III to further the process of heme production

- Uroporphyrinogen I is a byproduct in heme biosynthesis and has no known useful function in humans- it forms in the presence of decreased UROS activity
