The use of ABI for patient care requires knowledgeable individuals who are trained to do so. Training is necessary for the full team of providers from the clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and ultrasonographers. One randomized control trial evaluated the optimal way to teach the ABI procedure to medical students. The study compared didactic versus experiential learning. Results showed that experiential learning significantly improved the ability to perform the test correctly accurately.

Performance, application, and interpretation of ABIÂ require an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and ultrasound techs, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
