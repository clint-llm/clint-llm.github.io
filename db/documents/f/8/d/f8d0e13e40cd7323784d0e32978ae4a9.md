Endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) is an endogenous vasodilator that endothelial cells produce and subsequently release in response to various changes in normal physiologic as well as pathophysiologic changes. EDRF causes vascular smooth muscle to relax, as it activates soluble guanylate cyclase and subsequently increases cyclic guanylate monophosphate in vascular smooth muscle. EDRF is structurally in the form of nitric oxide (NO) or a compound that contains nitrogen oxide. EDRF is formed from L-arginine by an enzyme that is dependant on calcium-calmodulin and NADPH. EDRF serves as an inhibitor of aggregation and adhesion of platelets and is a vasodilator. EDRF also serves as a second messenger for guanylyl cyclase activation and cyclic GMP production. EDRF’s function, pathophysiology, and it's clinical significance will be the subject in this review.
