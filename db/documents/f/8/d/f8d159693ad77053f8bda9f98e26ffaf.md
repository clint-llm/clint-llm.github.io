As the human body ages, myriad changes occur within the face. Gravity causes descent of the facial soft tissues and creates unflattering folds and shadows (e.g., nasolabial folds, tear troughs, marionette lines, etc.), contributing to an aged appearance. Furthermore, with age, patients experience decreased facial volume secondary to a combination of dermal thinning, muscular atrophy, fat volume loss, and reduction in bone thickness.

The harvested fat, often taken from the flank, inner thigh, or abdomen, is injected into the recipient sites only after careful planning. Identifying the proper location and depth of the fat compartments to receive the grafts is critical. The major fat compartments of the face are the superficial and deep fat spaces, which are separated by the superficial musculoaponeurotic system.
