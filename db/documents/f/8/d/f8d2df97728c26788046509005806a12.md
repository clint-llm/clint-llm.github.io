The classic PDA murmur is a continuous, “machinery” murmur below the clavicle, radiating to the back, although it can also manifest as a systolic or holosystolic murmur. The infant will have a prominent precordial impulse, tachycardia, and bounding peripheral pulses due to increased cardiac output. Hypotension is most prominent in infants < 1000g grams. A widened pulse pressure (> 30mmHg) occurs both because of a mild increase in systolic blood pressure to overcome the decrease in distal blood flow due to run-off through the PDA during diastole, in addition to a lower diastolic blood pressure from the run-off. The increase in respiratory distress and hypoxia occur with pulmonary edema. Hepatomegaly can be appreciated when there is congestive heart failure.
