Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is used by less than 7 percent of dialysis patients in the United States. In Canada, more than 50 percent of dialysis patients use peritoneal dialysis. Several observational studies, including national registries from different parts of the world, have reported improved early survival of patients using peritoneal dialysis compared to those using hemodialysis. Furthermore, hemodialysis costs significantly more than peritoneal dialysis; in 2011, the average hemodialysis cost per patient per year was 87,945 dollars, whereas the average peritoneal dialysis cost per patient per year was 71,630 dollars. This activity describes the indications and contraindications for peritoneal dialysis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with chronic renal failure.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for peritoneal dialysis.
- Describe the equipment needed for insertion of a peritoneal dialysis catheter.
- Outline the complications of peritoneal dialysis.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the safe use of peritoneal dialysis in patients with renal failure.
