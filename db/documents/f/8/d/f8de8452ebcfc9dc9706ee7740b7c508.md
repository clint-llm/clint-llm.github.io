In individuals with halitosis, the posterior dorsum of the tongue is the main source of malodor. Smears taken from this biofilm or scrapings would show desquamated epithelial cells, leucocytes from periodontal pockets, blood metabolites, different food residues, and bacteria. Some bacteria associated with this condition are:

- Oral cavity: Gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria

- Nasal mucosa: K. ozaenae

- Pharynx, sinuses: Streptococcus species

- Respiratory system (bronchitis, bronchiectasis, lung diseases): P. aeruginosa

- Stomach: H. pylori

- GI tract: E. faecalis
