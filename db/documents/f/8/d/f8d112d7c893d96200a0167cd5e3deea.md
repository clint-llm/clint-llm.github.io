According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are approximately 285 million people with a visual impairment. Of those, 39 million are blind, and 246 million have low vision. Of those who are blind, 90% live in developing countries. For each blind person worldwide, an average of 3.4 people has low vision, with the country and regional variation ranging from 2.4 to 5.5 people.

More than 82% of all people who are blind are 50 years of age and older. Due to the expected number of years lived in blindness, childhood blindness is aÂ significant problem, with an estimated 1.4 million blind children below age 15. Females have a significantly higher risk of being visually impaired than males.
