Splints may be used to effectively immobilize an injury, including a sprain, fracture, or soft tissue injury. In specific scenarios, splints may be used as definitive management to treat these injuries. Educating patients regarding splint care and return precautions aids in a successful outcome.

A splint must be differentiated from a cast, to determine the best form of immobilization based on the clinical scenario. A splint is a non-circumferential application of plaster or fiberglass that is particularly useful in the acute post-injury setting. A splint's supportive and forgiving structure allows physiologic swelling common to the acute inflammatory phase. In contrast, a cast is a circumferential application of plaster that rigidly immobilizes a particular joint or fracture. Because of the circumferential nature, casts are commonly not placed in the acute post-injury setting.

Splint application is not a completely benign treatment, and improper placement may result in adverse outcomes. One study found that 40% of patients splinted in the emergency department developed soft tissue complications, including skin ulceration in 6% of patients.
