Complications for the most common causes of urethritis, including those from Neisseria gonorrhea, have shown associations with some rare complications, including penile edema, periurethral abscesses, post-inflammatory urethral strictures, and penile lymphangitis.Â Conditions associated with Chlamydia trachomatis complications include pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, proctitis, and reactive arthritis. A complete reactive arthritis triad, also known as Reiter syndrome, includes urethritis, uveitis, and arthritis. This is a rare disease that may be caused by Chlamydia trachomatis and involve acute epididymitis, orchitis, and prostatitis.
