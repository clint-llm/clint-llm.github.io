Both closed and open reductions of mandibular body fractures lead to favorable results in terms of bony union. The treatment of dental injuries should be done concurrently with the fracture as the fractured teeth may become infected and jeopardize bone union. Hence, they require removal. As mandibular canines help to determine the occlusion, the clinician should preserve them, if possible. The management and prognosis of edentulous body fractures are often challenging due to advanced age and multiple comorbidities.
