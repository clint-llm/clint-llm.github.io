The development of the cardiovascular system begins in the mesoderm as early as the third week of life, and fetal circulation begins through the vasculature system around the eighth week. Hematopoietic stem cells evolved into the vascular system to enable immune surveillance, supply oxygen and nutrients, and dispose of waste. Although most apparent near the early forming heart, vascular development begins in both the intra- and extraembryonic mesoderm. During their development, hematopoietic stem cells give rise to angioblasts, which eventually aggregate and line up to form tubes or sinuses. This process is calledÂ vasculogenesis. The term for establishing new vessels from already developed vasculature is angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is an essential mechanism of arteriole development as it is the terminal branch of the arterial side of the vascular tree.

There are three mechanisms of angiogenesis: sprouting, intussusception, and splitting

In contrast, intussusception and splitting do not depend on cell proliferation. Intussusception begins with endothelial invagination outside the vascular wall or lumen, where the intraluminal protrusion of endothelial cells is the pre-representations of splitting
