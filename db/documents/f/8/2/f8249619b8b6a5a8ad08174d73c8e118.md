Nursing staff plays a fundamental role in the care after redo cardiac surgery:

Some units recruit specialized nursing staff for preoperative clinical and social assessment.

Postoperative care requires a high degree of experience and diligence by the nursing staff to be able to foresee possible complications early during the course of treatment.

Advanced practitioners such as advanced nurse practitioners and surgical care practitioners are involved deeper in patients' care than before, and the subspecialization in cardiac surgery provides continuity of care to the patients.

Allied healthcare professionals such as physiotherapists and social care provide the patient with means of fast recovery and advice clinicians on the safety of patients to be discharged.
