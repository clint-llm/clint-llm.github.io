Q fever is a zoonotic febrile disease affecting workers involved in farming livestock. It is an underreported disease with lesser recognition. Q fever, an acute zoonotic febrile illness with a worldwide distribution, was discovered first in Queensland, Australia, in 1935 among meat workers. As a cause could not be identified, it was labeled "Q (query) fever." This disease has occurred as outbreaks among livestock and farm workers handling ungulates. Clinical presentation is often a self-limited febrile illness, but severe manifestations can occur. It is reportable in the United States, and its agent, C. burnetii, is considered a potential bioterrorism agent. This activity will help understand its causes, epidemiology, evaluation, and management of the condition by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Q fever.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of Q fever.
- Review the management options available for Q fever.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance Q fever diagnosis and improve outcomes.
