**Boston KPro Type I**

The absence of a blink reflex, tear production, posterior segment pathologies such as retinal detachment, vision worse than light perception, abnormal lid anatomy, and forniceal shortening with the inability to retain a soft contact lens e.g. from forniceal shortening are all contraindications. Patients with no light perception vision, phthisis bulbi, or who have unrealistic expectations are not suitable for either type I or type II KPros. Patients with lagophthalmos require an oculoplasticÂ consultation to minimize exposure risks.

Boston KPro implantation has been previously performed in the pediatric age group due to the perceived advantages over penetrating keratoplasty of reduced rejection, rapid visual recovery (lack of postoperative suture-related astigmatism), fewer examinations under anesthesia. However, recently published experience demonstrated high complication rates and progression to phthisis, hence it is no longer recommended.

**OOKP**

Patients with advanced glaucoma will be a relative contraindication.
