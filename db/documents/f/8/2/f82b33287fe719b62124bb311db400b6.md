Somnambulism is the medical term used for sleepwalking that includes undesirable actions such as walking, that occur during abrupt but limited arousals from deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) slow-wave sleep.

Somnambulism is characterized by:

- Incomplete arousal occurring during NREM sleep, usually during the earlier third of the night

- The ability or inability to recall dream content

- Simple or complex movements that are in congruence with a dream

- Diminished awareness of the environment

- Impaired decision-making ability, planning, and problem-solving skills

Somnambulism has been associated with various other sleep disorders such as confusional arousals, rhythmic movement disorders, night terrors in children, somniloquy (sleep talking), and bruxism (teeth grinding), as well as daytime fatigue, and emotional and behavioral issues in children.
