- The primary adverse effects of ACE inhibitors include hyperkalemia, dry cough, angioedema, hypotension, dizziness, headache, and renal insufficiency.

- The AHA/ACCF recommends careful use in patients with cardiomyopathy with outflow obstruction, as they may lead to exacerbation of symptoms.

- Historically, ACE inhibitors have correlated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with aortic stenosis. However, recent randomized and placebo-controlled trials suggest that ACE inhibitors might be safe and might even provide some benefits in certain patients.

- ACE inhibitor-induced cough is a dry, nonproductive, hacking cough. It usually begins in the first few months of treatment and resolves within 1 to 4 weeks after discontinuing the medication.

- Deterioration of renal functions can occur in patients whose glomerular function is dependent on event arteriolar vasoconstriction by angiotensin II. A benign increase in serum creatinine may occur at the beginning of therapy, but medication should only be discontinued if there is a progressive or significant elevation of BUN/creatinine.

**Drug Interactions**

- **Diuretics:**When initiating lisinopril in patients on diuretics may result in further reduction of blood pressure and may lead to hypotension. When coadministered with thiazide-type diuretics and/or potassium-sparing diuretics (amiloride, spironolactone,  triamterene, etc.), it might increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if coadministration of such agents is indicated, monitor the patient’s serum potassium frequently.

- **Antidiabetics:**Concomitant administration of antidiabetic medicines (e.g., insulins, oral hypoglycemic agents) and lisinopril can increase the blood-glucose-lowering effect of antidiabetic medicine can increase the risk of hypoglycemia.

- **Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents:**Coadministration of NSAIDs and lisinopril in patients who are volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), elderly,  or with impaired renal function may result in further worsening of renal function, including possible acute renal injury(AKI). This is usually reversible but monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving lisinopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors can be decreased by NSAIDs.

- **Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Blockers:**Dual blockade of the RAS with ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or aliskiren is associated with higher risks of hyperkalemia, hypotension, and changes in renal function, including AKI, compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, electrolytes, and renal function in these patients.

- **Lithium:**Lithium toxicity is reported in patients taking ACE inhibitors and lithium, usually reversible. Monitor serum lithium levels if concurrent use is recommended.

- **mTOR Inhibitors:**Patients using concomitant mTOR inhibitors (e.g., sirolimus, temsirolimus, everolimus) are at increased risk for angioedema.
