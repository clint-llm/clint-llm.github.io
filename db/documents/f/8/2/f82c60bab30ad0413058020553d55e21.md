The TTMPB should be performed by an individual qualified in regional anesthesia who routinely performs peripheral nerve blocks in practice. This is most often an anesthesiologist. A second provider or nurse must perform the universal timeout or equivalent before proceeding with the block.

This additional provider would also assist the anesthesiologist during the block, holding the local anesthetic solution and injecting when the correct fascial plane is reached, as determined by the anesthesiologist guiding the needle via ultrasonography.
