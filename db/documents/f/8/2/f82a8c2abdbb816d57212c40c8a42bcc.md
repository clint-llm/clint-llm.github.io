Erythema elevatum diutinum is a rare, chronic dermatosis characterized by red–violet to red–brown papules, plaques, and nodules that favor extensor surfaces. Lesions often are asymptomatic, though some patients may experience pain or a burning sensation. Non-cutaneous symptoms include constitutional symptoms such as arthralgia and fever. Although erythema elevatum diutinum is benign, it can occur in association with infections, hematologic abnormalities, autoimmune diseases, or other conditions. Spontaneous resolution commonly occurs after 5 to 10 years. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of erythema elevatum diutinum and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of erythema elevatum diutinum.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with erythema elevatum diutinum.
- Outline the management options available for erythema elevatum diutinum.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of erythema elevatum diutinum and improve outcomes.
