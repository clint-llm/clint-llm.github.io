Because of the relatively low incidence and low mortality rate, little information describing the pathogenesis of S. moniliformis exists. The organism is capable of producing morphological findings not associated with bacterial infections. An autopsy of rat bite fever victims demonstrates erythrophagocytosis, hepatosplenomegaly, interstitial pneumonia, lymph node sinus hyperplasia, endocarditis, and myocarditis along with degenerative changes in the kidneys and liver. Radiological data suggest that rat-bite fever might cause damage to physes and acrophyses of bones, similar to frostbite induced damage. Biopsy of skin lesions in rat bite fever has demonstrated leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
