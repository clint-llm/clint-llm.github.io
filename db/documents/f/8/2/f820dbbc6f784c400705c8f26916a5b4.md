Beyond the possibility of airway obstruction, with subsequent atelectasis or recurrent pneumonia, pulmonary hamartomas have in rare cases been noted to bear potential for sarcomatous transformation. Common signs of malignant alteration are the rapid growth of the lesion and systemic symptoms like weight loss, weakness or fatigue. Histologically, this malignant change may not always be apparent, however macroscopic signs, like an invasion of adjacent tissue or distant metastases may be present. In some cases, a possible relationship between the presence of genomic abnormalities of 12q14 and 6q21, encoding the high mobility group A (HMGA), and the occurrence of pulmonary hamartoma has been observed. Also, incidence rates of lung cancer have been reported to be six times higher in patients with pulmonary hamartomas than in healthy subjects, making genetic predisposition to either malignant change or subsequent development of malignancy a possibility.
