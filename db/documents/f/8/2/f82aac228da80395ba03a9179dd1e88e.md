Psoriatic arthritis is considered an aggressive disease with the potential for significant morbidity and poor quality of life in patients. Some features are harbingers of a severe disease course and poor prognosis. These include a large number of actively inflamed joints or polyarticular presentation, elevated ESR, clinical or radiographic damage, loss of function, and diminished quality of life.
