Blood supply to the tongue comes predominantly from the **lingual artery**, a branch of the external carotid artery.**lingual vein**.

The lingual artery arises from the external carotid artery at the tip of the hyoid bone's greater horn, between the facial and superior thyroid arteries.

- The**suprahyoid artery**supplies the omohyoid, sternothyroid, and thyrohyoid muscles. They anastomose with the corresponding vessels from the opposite side.

- The **dorsal lingual artery**arises beneath the hyoglossus muscle and passes to the posterior part of the dorsum of the tongue. It supplies the mucous membrane of this region as well as the glossopalatine arch, lingual tonsils, soft palate, and epiglottis.

- The **sublingual artery**branches at the anterior border of the hyoglossus muscle before passing between the genioglossus muscle and mylohyoid muscle to the sublingual gland. It supplies the sublingual gland before giving branches to the mylohyoid muscle.

- The **deep lingual artery**, which is the termination of the lingual artery, passes between the genioglossus muscle and inferior longitudinal muscle, supplying the apex of the tongue.

The lymphatic vessels from the body of the tongue are divided into marginal and central. The **marginal vessels**drain the tongue's apex, marginal surface, and sublingual region into the submental and submandibular nodes.**central vessels**are located at the tip of the tongue, travel through the mylohyoid muscle, and drain into the jugulo-omohyoid or jugulodigastric nodes.

The **dorsal vessels**collect lymphatic drainage from the area posterior to the sulcus and drain into the jugulo-omohyoid and jugulodigastric nodes.
