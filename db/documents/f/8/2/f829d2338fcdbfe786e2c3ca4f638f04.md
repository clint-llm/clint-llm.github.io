Healthcare workers including the nurse practitioner should be familiar with the diagnosis of diabetes.****Fructosamine and GA can be utilized as alternate markers in those patients where the HbA1c assay is unreliable. Also, they can identify poor glucose control more rapidly than HbA1c, i.e., short-term hyperglycemia. A major promise of the tests is their ability to predict those pre-diabetic patients who progress to clinical diabetes since this could lead to major lifestyle and pharmacological interventions to prevent the onset of diabetes and its complications. Finally, they may also have a role in the management of diabetes during pregnancy since pregnant patients need frequent glucose monitoring. They can provide a measure of glycemia over 2 to 3 weeks rather than 8 to 12 weeks as is with HbA1c.

Glycated albumin has been reported to be a better marker than HbA1cÂ  for the assessment of glucose control in people with diabetes with chronic kidney disease and those on hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
