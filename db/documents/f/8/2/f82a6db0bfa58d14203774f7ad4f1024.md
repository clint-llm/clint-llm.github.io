Adverse effects of nonselective alpha-blockers include hypotension, weakness, tachycardia, and tremulousness. Hypotension is due to inhibition of the alpha-1 receptors, which causes vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. The remaining adverse effects occur due to the increased release of norepinephrine when alpha-2 receptors become simultaneously antagonized. This release results in the stimulation of beta receptors due to the spillover of norepinephrine and results in tremulousness and tachycardia.

Adverse systemic effects such as tachycardia and tremulousness are less common with selective alpha-1 blockers. Although it can cause first-dose hypotension, syncope, dizziness, and headache due to vasodilation and vascular smooth muscle relaxation. Reflex tachycardia may occur due to a sudden decrease in blood pressure. These adverse effects tend to occur more often in the elderly and increase the risk of falls. To best avoid these adverse effects, the patient should take the medication at night.
