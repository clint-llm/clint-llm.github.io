A hand x-ray or computed tomogram (CT) scan can be used to evaluate for fractures (especially hamate fracture).

Magnetic resonance imaging of the hand can show anatomical variations within the Guyon canal and evaluate for structures responsible for mechanical compression of the ulnar nerve (e.g., lipomas, ganglion cyst, aberrant muscle).

Doppler ultrasound is used to evaluate for ulnar artery thrombosis.

Angiography can be used for the evaluation of ulnar artery aneurysm or thrombosis.

Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) are used to assess peripheral nerve compromise and localize the level at which nerve is affected (i.e., differentiate between ulnar nerve entrapment within Guyon canal at the wrist vs. cubital tunnel at the elbow vs. C8-T1 radiculopathy).
