Left heart failure occurs when there is dysfunction of the left ventricle, resulting insufficient delivery of blood to vital organs. Left ventricular failure can be further subdivided into heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) with ejection fraction over 50 percent, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with ejection fraction less than 40 percent, or heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction, with ejection fraction between 41 and 49 percent. This activity describes the evaluation and management of left heart failure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors for developing left heart failure.
- Review the clinical manifestations of left heart failure.
- Identify the latest treatment options for left heart failure.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to decrease mortality of patients with left heart failure.
