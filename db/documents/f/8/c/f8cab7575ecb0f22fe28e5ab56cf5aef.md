Cheiralgia paresthetica can be treated well with straightforward nonoperative interventions. The key to treatment is an accurate diagnosis and identification of the cause of the compression. Once the cause is determined, patients should be educated on techniques to remove the compression and to avoid activities that will aggravate the symptoms. These conservative measures will lead to symptom resolution in the majority of patients.
