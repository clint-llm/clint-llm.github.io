Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of relative insulin deficiency affecting primarily type-1 diabetes mellitus (DM). DKA can occur in type-2 DM when insulin levels fall far behind the body's needs. DKA is so named due to high levels of water-soluble ketone bodies (KBs), leading to an acidotic physiologic state.

According to the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes, DKA is defined by the presence of **all**of the following in a patient with diabetes:

- **Hyperglycemia**– Blood glucose >200 mg/dL (11 mmol/L)

- **Metabolic acidosis**– Venous pH <7.3 or serum bicarbonate <15 mEq/L (15 mmol/L)

- **Ketosis**– Presence of ketones in the blood (>3 mmol/L beta-hydroxybutyrate) or urine ("moderate or large" urine ketones)

Produced by the liver during fatty acid metabolism, KBs can be utilized by the brain, cardiac, and skeletal muscle tissues as a fuel when the body is deficient in or cannot effectively import glucose.
