Information about the time since death is an essential feature of postmortem reports issued by forensic pathologists. The estimation of post-mortem interval provides useful information regarding the time of death, and hence, the same is argued upon by the defense in the court of law. Clinical expertise is warranted to ensure that the postmortem changes are well-interpreted and inferences get drawn correctly. The estimated time since death or the PMI may range in hours and sometimes in days when much time has elapsed after death, which may not always be helpful to law enforcement, who would require a narrower range of estimates to help in the investigation. The need for further research is, thus, emphasized.
