Endovascular papillary angioendothelioma is within a borderline area between benign lesions such as hemangioma and malignant ones like angiosarcoma. There have been cases of these tumors arising within preexisting vascular lesions such as cavernous hemangiomas. Morphologic similarity has also been observed with retiform hemangioendothelioma and may represent the spectrum of the same lesion. Based on the literature review, currently, the diagnosis of EPA is limited to low-grade sarcoma, demonstrating characteristic histopathological and immunohistochemistry features.
