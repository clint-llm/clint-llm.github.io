Asking the patient about recent ingestion or their handling of crustaceans or mollusks will help narrow etiologic agents. Most allergic reactions begin within minutes to a few hours after the ingestion of the food. The severity of symptoms can vary widely from one individual to another. Mild allergies will manifest with pruritus and urticaria, while severe cases can have true anaphylaxis with respiratory compromises such as angioedema or wheezing and hypotension. Other signs and symptoms associated with shellfish allergies are atopic dermatitis (eczema), coughing or sneezing, coryza, circumoral paresthesias, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, dizziness, and fainting.
