The tectospinal tract is not associated with any particular muscle or muscle group but has associations with sudden auditory stimuli. The tectospinal tract plays a part in the auditory startle reflex. Typically, the sternocleidomastoid muscle is the largest neck muscle that contributes to the startle reflex. The afferent sound is detected by the brainstem, which processes the sound and instinctually reacts with innervated cervical muscles and following, muscles of the limbs controlled by other motor neurons.
