Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) refers to a group of conditions involving the orofacial region divided into those affecting the masticatory muscles and those affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). The typical features include pain in TMJ, restriction of mandibular movement, and TMJ sounds.

**Temporomandibular Joint Anatomy**

The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a ginglymoarthrodial joint formed by the glenoid fossa of the temporal bone and the mandibular condyle.

The muscles involved in temporomandibular disorders are the muscles of the mastication: temporalis, masseter, medial and lateral pterygoid muscles.

The primary blood supply of the TMJ comes from the superficial temporal and maxillary branches of the external carotid artery.

Other contributing branches include the anterior tympanic, deep auricular, and ascending pharyngeal arteries. The TMJ receives its sensory innervation from the auriculotemporal and masseteric branches of the mandibular nerve (V3), a branch of the trigeminal nerve.
