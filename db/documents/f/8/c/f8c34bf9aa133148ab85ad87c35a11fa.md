There are multiple causes of orthostatic hypotension which could lead to syncope including neurally mediated (neurogenic) and non-neurally mediated causes.

Neurally mediated causes include conditions that cause either primary or secondary failure of the autonomic system:

- Peripheral neuropathy as seen in diabetes mellitus, alcoholics, nutritional (vitamin B12 deficiency), amyloidosis

- Idiopathic postural hypotension

- Multisystem atrophies (parkinsonism, progressive cerebellar degeneration, dementia with Lewy bodies)

- Acute dysautonomia (seen in a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome)

- Toxin, drug or infection-induced neuropathy

Non-neurally mediated causes include:

- Medications (antihypertensives, vasodilators)

- Decreased blood volume (adrenal insufficiency, blood loss, dehydration, hypovolemia or decreased effective intravascular volume)

- Physical deconditioning

- Sympathectomy
