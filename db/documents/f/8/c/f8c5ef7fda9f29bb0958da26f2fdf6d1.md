Many providers lack thorough knowledge of the effects of inhaled anesthetics on the cardiovascular system. This can lead to significant intra-operative morbidity and mortality. To decrease associated morbidity and mortality, interprofessional team members must enhance their knowledge regarding the effects of inhaled anesthetics on the cardiovascular system. This activity reviews the physiologic response of the cardiovascular system to various inhaled anesthetics and concludes by discussing the development of anesthetic care teams and the increasing importance of clear and consistent open communication amongst interprofessional teams.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the anticipated effects of inhaled anesthetics on heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output in a healthy individual.
- Review how the different inhaled anesthetics may vary in terms of the magnitude of their effect on each cardiovascular parameter discussed.
- Explain how cardiovascular responses to inhaled anesthetics may change in patients at extremes of age, comorbidities, or taking additional medications.
- Summarize the importance of consistent open communication among the anesthesia care team when choosing the appropriate inhalation anesthetic agent for each case and when monitoring the patient during and after anesthesia administration.
