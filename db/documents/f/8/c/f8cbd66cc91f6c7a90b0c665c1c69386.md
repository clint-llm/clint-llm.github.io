Ziconotide is a newer, intrathecal analgesic medication used for the treatment of chronic pain. Its FDA indication is for treating chronic severe pain in patients intolerant or refractory to systemic analgesics or intrathecal morphine. Ziconotide can only be administered intrathecally as it does not cross the blood-brain barrier well. It shows efficacy in treating intractable, severe, chronic pain secondary to cancer and non-malignant pain. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of ziconotide, so providers can direct patient therapy where it is indicated for pain relief as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pain-relieving mechanism of ziconotide.
- Review methods of administration for ziconotide.
- Outline the contraindications for ziconotide therapy.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team and enhance patient care with ziconotide to improve patient outcomes where pain relief is indicated, especially in light of the opioid crisis.
