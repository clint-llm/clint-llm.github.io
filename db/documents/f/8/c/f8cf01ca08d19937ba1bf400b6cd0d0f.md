There are no specific antidotes available for meclizine overdose. Treatment is primarily supportive and focused on symptoms.

Symptoms of an overdose may include signs of CNS depression such as drowsiness, seizures, and/or coma.  Hypotension can occur, but it is more likely to be seen in the elderly.  The anticholinergic effects and CNS stimulation of an overdose in children can present with hallucinations, seizures, and/or issues sleeping.

With recent ingestion, induce emesis or perform gastric lavage to prevent further drug absorption. Activated charcoal is also an option. There is no known antidote for meclizine, but physostigmine can help to counter the systemic anticholinergic effects of meclizine.
