Patients with AVNRT will present with an increased heart rate (over150 bpm) and supraventricular tachycardia on ECG. Treatment modalities include performing the Valsalva maneuver and pharmacologic intervention with non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and adenosine. For individuals with arrhythmias that are recurrent, minimally invasive procedures are available, including catheter ablation of the middle or inferior portion of the triangle of Koch.
