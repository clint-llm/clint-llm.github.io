Diffuse blistering may lead to the development of contractures. Physical therapy and rehabilitation may be warranted in such patients to regain function and movement.Â Ulcerated skin and mucosal lesions should be cleaned with sterile warm water compresses twice daily, and kept moist with emollients and low adhesive wound dressings, such as petroleum jelly-impregnated gauze. The use of silver dressings is advantageous as they reduce the incidence of infection and also require less frequent dressing changes.
