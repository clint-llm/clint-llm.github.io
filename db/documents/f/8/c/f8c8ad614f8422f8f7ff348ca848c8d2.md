Recommendations for the management of reflux esophagitis include the following:

- Weight loss, particularly in overweight patients and patients with obesity, will help in reducing the severity and frequency of symptoms.

- Elevating the head of the bed during sleep and avoiding meals two to three hours before sleep will reduce reflux at night.

- Avoiding certain foods such as chocolate, caffeine, alcohol, and spicy food may help.

- Treatment of patients with a proton pump inhibitor for eight weeks is recommended. Usually, initiated once daily before the first meal of the day. If there is a partial response, the dose should be increased to twice daily. PPIs are safe in pregnant women if clinically indicated.

- Maintain PPI therapy for patients who continue to have symptoms and patients with erosive esophagitis and Barrett esophagus.

- Patients who need PPI therapy for longer durations or life because of recurrence of symptoms should be placed on the lowest dose required for maintenance. Chronic use of PPI is associated with complications, including increased risk of bone fractures, electrolyte deficiencies, and renal insufficiency.

- Patients not responding to PPIs treatment should be evaluated by the provider. In addition, other disorders should be considered, including eosinophilic esophagitis, delayed gastric emptying, irritable bowel syndrome, achalasia, and psychological disorders.

- Surgical therapy is as effective as medical therapy in patients with chronic reflux esophagitis. It offers long-term treatment. Patients should be investigated (preoperative manometry) for surgery to rule out achalasia and scleroderma-like esophagus.

- Vonoprazan fumarate tablet (a new synthesized potassium-competitive acid blocker), used on-demand, is an effective alternative maintenance therapy for mild reflux esophagitis.

- In patients with obesity, bariatric surgery- gastric bypass is usually recommended.

- Management of reflux complications such as Schatzki rings by esophageal dilatation followed with PPI treatment; esophageal adenocarcinoma; laryngitis; and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
