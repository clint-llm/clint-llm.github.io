Pylephlebitis is a rare disease process that is associated with a high rate of morbidity and mortality, especially if it is not recognized early in the course of care. It is crucial to have an understanding of the common conditions associated with pylephlebitis. Additionally, the foundation of management is antibiotic therapy, but it is imperative to realize that further additions to the treatment paradigm, including anticoagulation, must be individualized on a case by case basis. This activity reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of pylephlebitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of pylephlebitis.
- Explain the role of anticoagulation in a patient diagnosed with pylephlebitis.
- Outline the appropriate management for a patient with pylephlebitis.
