The prognosis of a retinal detachment varies greatly on the type of detachment and patient presentation. For a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, one of the most important prognosticating factors is whether or not the macula remains attached. If the macula is attached, one study showed that 83% of patients had a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better.

Tractional retinal detachments have a varied visual prognosis. The final visual outcome depends on the underlying cause of the tractional detachment and if there are confounding issues affecting the vision.Â Exudative retinal detachments also have variable visual prognosis based on the underlying condition.
