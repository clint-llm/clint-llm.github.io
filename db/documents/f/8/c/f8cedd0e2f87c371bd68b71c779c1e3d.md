- LADA is a form of DM that has features common to both T1DM and T2DM.

- Early diagnosis is paramount to initiating appropriate treatment and preventing complications.

- New insights into the pathophysiology of LADA explain the slow progression of beta-cell destruction.

- Genetic similarities with both T1DM and T2DM have been revealed in GWAS.

- A C-peptide test, basal or after a mixed-meal, may be used as an initial, cost-effective test to screen patients with LADA to identify which patients need confirmatory testing for islet autoantibodies.

- Sulfonylureas are a poor choice for LADA as it results in beta-cell failure and faster progression to insulin.

- Insulin, DPP4 inhibitors alone and in combination with insulin, thiazolidinediones, and GLP1 receptor agonists have shown promise in achieving glycemic control and preserving beta-cell function.

- Novel immunomodulatory therapies like GAD65 injected into lymph nodes are undergoing trials and appear promising.
