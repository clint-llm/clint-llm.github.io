- Latrodectus envenomations are 1 of 2 clinically relevant spider bites in North America and most cases, even when symptomatic, are self-limiting.

- Mild symptoms of black widow envenomation include local pain and skin irritation.

- Severe symptoms, also known as “latrodectism,” include systemic toxicity with diffuse pain, muscle spasm, and autonomic dysfunction.

- Treatment modalities target pain (NSAIDs, opioids), muscle spasm (benzodiazepines) and systemic symptoms (supportive, anti-venom if necessary).

- Latrodectus antivenom is a safe and highly effective treatment for most patients, provided they are properly risk-stratified.

- Consultation with a medical toxicologist is recommended.
