Once the bleeding is controlled, it is important to arrange timely follow-up (within one week) with their primary care physician or an otolaryngologist. If any packing has been placed, this must remain undisturbed for 3-5 days before removal. Patients should begin an anti-staphylococcal antibiotic to prevent toxic shock syndrome. Underlying causes must be addressed before discharge (tight blood pressure control with goal SBP <120 mm Hg, reveral of any coagulopathy, etc.), and patients should use topical nasal saline in both nares to keep the packs moist and facilitate removal.
