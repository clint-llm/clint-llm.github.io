Gram-negative and/or anaerobic organisms are the usual suspects responsible for infection when perforation is the mechanism of inoculation. Gut flora (E. coli, K. pneumoniae, etc.) then release endotoxins that are responsible for the overreactive inflammatory cascade that causes sepsis.

Decreased fibrinolysis mediated through increased plasminogen activator inhibitor activity which results in an increase of fibrin exudates facilitates large bacterial loads being sequestered in the fibrin matrix. The host's logic behind this process is to retard the spread of bacteria beyond the local nidus, but this actionÂ also results in creating a physical barrier to advancing host defense mechanisms, thereby in some cases, prolonging the initial infection and/or abscess formation.
