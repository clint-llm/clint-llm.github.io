If the clinical status permits history taking, it is important to determine the amount of metformin ingested, and the time it was ingested. In addition, determine any coingestants that may have been taken. A comprehensive medication history should be performed to identify any other anti-hyperglycemic medications. Certain formulations of metformin are combined with other anti-hyperglycemic agents; most concerning are sulfonylureas. Intentional overdose of these medications can present with both MALA and hypoglycemia. Psychiatric history and intent of the ingestion should also be pursued to determine the need for psychiatric consultation and intervention after medical stabilization and clearance.

Patients often present with vague signs and symptoms. They may initially complain of gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and/or diarrhea, which are commonly seen with metformin use and toxicity. The patient may also complain of dyspnea, dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue, or general malaise in the setting of acidosis.

Physical exam should begin with overall visual assessment and evaluation of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABCs). Signs of MALA are non-specific but can be similar to acidemia from other conditions, which may include tachypnea, hyperpnea, and tachycardia.
