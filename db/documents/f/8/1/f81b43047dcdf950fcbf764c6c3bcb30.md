Root et al. divided HV deformity into four stages, as outlined below:

- Stage 1: Lateral displacement of the hallux at the MTP joint

- Stage 2: Progression of the hallux abduction (hallux pressing against the second toe)

- Stage 3: Increased intermetatarsal angle, possible associatedÂ second hammertoe deformity

- Stage 4: Partial/Complete hallux dislocation at the MTP joint
