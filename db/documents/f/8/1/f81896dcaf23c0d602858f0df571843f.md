Neuroleptic drugs are beneficial for the management of behavioral disorders. The newer generation is safer, but they still can cause adverse effects that include weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. All interprofessional healthcare team members should encourage the patient to eat a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and avoid smoking. Frequent measurement of body weight, ECG, and lipids is necessary. Because of the disease and side effects, compliance with medication is not high.

While prescribing high-risk drugs, the patient should always closely follow up with the psychiatrist and continuous involvement of internists to look for any signs of serious adverse effects (agranulocytosis, metabolic syndrome, extrapyramidal syndrome, QT interval prolongation).
