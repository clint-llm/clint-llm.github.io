Blepharochalasis syndrome (BS) is an uncommon condition characterized by recurrent episodes of periocular edema in young patients. The first report of this syndrome was by the Austrian ophthalmologist Joseph Beer in 1807. However, Ernst Fuchs was the first to useÂ the term "blepharochalasis" (from Greek "eyelid slackening") in 1896.
