There are three clinically significant genera of mosquitoes, Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes, which are usually responsible for human bites. Mosquitoes are generally found near standing bodies of water as this environment is necessary for the completion of their life cycle. Only the larger female mosquitoes actually bite, as they need blood nourishment for egg production. Each genus of mosquito has its distinctive patterns of feeding. Daytime feeders are attracted by dark-colored clothing, but as they near their host, they use olfactory cues, carbon dioxide, and lactic acid, to hone in. The consensus is that certain sweat glands, fragrances, and even alcohol make people more attractive to mosquitoes. One small study showed that individuals who drank alcohol attracted more mosquitoes.
