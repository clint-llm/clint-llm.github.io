Several perioperative risk tools have undergone development. Each tool assesses the risk of developing a perioperative cardiac complication during a specific procedure. The GRI and the RCRI are useful tools for evaluating risk, although clinicians should not use them to indicate for or against the intervention. The patient, surgeon, and surgical staff should discuss, in detail, the individual risk and situation to determine if surgery is appropriate or not.
