Although antibiotic prophylaxis remains controversial, the AHA/ACC continues to recommend certain individuals undergoing high-risk procedures receive pharmacological prophylaxis. As detailed in the 2017 AHA/ACC focused update, patients with prosthetic cardiac valves, prosthetic material used for valve repair, previous infective endocarditis, unrepaired cyanotic congenital heart disease, repaired congenital heart disease with persistent valvular insufficiency, or cardiac transplants with structurally dysfunctional valves should be considered for antibiotic prophylaxis before any dental procedures requiring mucosal perforation or manipulation of gingival or periapical tissue.
