The etiology of ectopia lentis is broadly grouped as congenital, traumatic, metabolic/syndromic, and consecutive/spontaneous.

**Trauma**

Ectopia lentis can be a manifestation of trauma, ocular pathology, or systemic disease. The most common cause is trauma. It can occur secondary to blunt trauma to the head and eye or directly impact the eye. Traumatic ectopia lentis can be present at birth or manifest at any age. In case of minor traumatic injury, other causes and associations of ectopia lentis should be ruled out.

**Ocular Disease and Associations of Ectopia Lentis**

**Simple Ectopia Lentis**

It can be congenital or acquired later spontaneously. Both can be autosomal dominant or recessive. Autosomal recessive inheritance is rare and is reported in families with a history of consanguineous marriage. In simple ectopia lentis, the lens displacement is usually bilateral and supero-temporal, and the degree of displacement varies between the two eyes. In autosomal recessive inheritance, a mutation in the ADAMTSL4 gene on chromosome 1 has been reported. In autosomal dominant inheritance, a mutation in the FBN1 gene located on chromosome 15 has been reported.

FBN1 gene mutation has also been reported in Marfan syndrome. Hence there occurs a significant genetic overlap between simple ectopia lentis and systemic diseases like Marfan syndrome. Spontaneous, simple ectopia lentis is usually reported in the age group of 20 to 65 years. The congenital and spontaneous variety can be associated with cataracts, retinal detachment, or secondary glaucoma. With lens dislocation, there also occur vitreous prolapse through weak zonular fibers.

**Ectopia Lentis Et Pupillae**

This is a rare and congenital autosomal recessive condition. In this, the pupil and lens are displaced in opposite directions. The pupil becomes asymmetric, eccentric, oval, and ectopic. There is minimal pupillary dilatation, and the lens displacement is usually bilateral and asymmetric. The iris atrophy is evident and appears as a transillumination defect on the slit lamp. Microspherophakia may be present.

- Dominantly inherited blepharoptosis and high myopia

**Ectopia Lentis- Systemic Associations**

**Marfan Syndrome**

Marfan syndrome is the most common syndrome associated with ectopia lentis. It is seen in approximately 80% of the patients with Marfan syndrome. The syndrome is autosomal dominant with fibrillin-1 gene mutation located on chromosome 15.

Ectopia lentis in Marfan syndrome is linked to alteration of fibrillin microfibers leading to deficient zonules and structural alteration in the lenticular capsule. The accommodation is usually retained, and rarely can the lens dislocate into the anterior chamber or vitreous cavity. A bilateral supero-temporal lens displacement is seen in Marfan syndrome. It can also be seen in other directions. The various systemic manifestations of Marfan syndrome can be remembered as the MASS phenotype (myopia, mitral valve prolapse, aortic root dilatation, skin, and skeletal involvement).

- **Cardiovascular**
- Aortic root dilatation, aneurysms of the aorta, and mitral valve prolapse.

- **Musculoskeletal**
- Lean, thin and tall stature, disproportionate arm and limb ratio, usually the arm span is greater than height, fingers and toes are relatively long leading to arachnodactyly, and a high arched palate also called as the gothic palate is seen. The other musculoskeletal features are kyphosis, Shprintzen–Goldberg syndrome, scoliosis, sternal bone abnormalities, hypermobile joints, muscular atrophy, hiatus, and inguinal hernia.
- Other features- Secondary glaucoma, lattice retinal degeneration, retinal detachment, microspherophakic lens, strabismus, and hypoplasia of dilator pupillae.

**Weill–Marchesani Syndrome**

It is the reverse of Marfan's syndrome, in which the primary defect is in the connective tissue. The gene involved is FBN1 (polymorphisms), and it can be autosomal dominant or recessive. Ectopia lentis is seen in approximately 50% with inferior lens subluxation. It can be seen in adolescence or early adulthood. The other common ocular manifestations can be microspherophakic and pupillary block glaucoma. The systemic features can be short stature, short fingers of hands and toes, brachydactyly, and delayed milestones resulting in learning difficulty.

**Homocystinuria**

This is the second most common etiology for inheritable ectopia lentis. The condition is autosomal recessive, and there is a deficiency of enzyme cystathionine b- synthetase. There occurs systemic accumulation of methionine and homocysteine. It is often characterized by mental handicap, osteoporosis, chest abnormalities, atherosclerosis, and increased incidence of thrombosis.

The other features include blue iris, coarse blonde hair, marfanoid habitus, and malar flush. Ectopia lentis is seen in nearly 90%, probably due to deficient zonules secondary to enzymatic deficiency. Ectopia lentis is bilateral, and in 60%, inferonasal dislocation is seen. Ectopia lentis is observed in nearly 100% of cases by 25 years. The treatment includes oral vitamin B6, B12, and folic acid to alleviate plasma homocysteine and methionine levels. The other ocular complications can be iris transillumination defects, optic atrophy, cataract, retinal detachment, and myopia.
