History and physical examination guide the evaluation. The House-Brackmann Facial Nerve Grading System can be used to describe the degree of facial nerve weakness. This grading system goes from a grade of I (no weakness) to VI (complete weakness). If the presentation is consistent with Bell's palsy, there are no required lab or radiographic tests. If there are atypical features, patients may need to be evaluated for a central cause of their symptoms. Likewise, Lyme disease testing is based on a history of possible tick-borne illness. The routine testing for Lyme disease is not recommended without other findings of the disease such as a history of tick bite, skin rash or arthritis. Diabetic testing should not be performed as facial nerve palsy is not considered diabetic neuropathy. There is no consensus on the optimal timing of imaging for Lyme disease, but most sources recommend after 2 months of no improvement of the facial palsy. MRI is the imaging modality of choice. MRI can detect facial nerve inflammation as well as ruling out other conditions such as schwannoma, hemangioma or a space-occupying lesion.

There is a grading system for clinical evaluation of Bell palsy. The grading system ranges from mild to severe dysfunction.
