For patients suspect for EoE, esophageal biopsies usually should be taken from the proximal, mid, and distal esophagus. During the endoscopy, biopsies also should be taken from the antrum and duodenum to rule out other possible causes of eosinophilia.

Histopathology is an important aspect of making a diagnosis of EoE. The histopathology reveals extensive eosinophils infiltrated esophageal mucosa, in addition to mast cells, basophils, basal cell hyperplasia, elongated papillae, superficial layering of eosinophils, extracellular eosinophilic granules, and fibrosis of sub-epithelium.
