SVC syndrome saw a dramatic decrease throughout the twentieth century. Today, the majority of SVC syndromes are the result of mediastinal malignancies, primary among which are small cell bronchogenic carcinoma. The second most commonly associated malignancy is non-Hodgkins lymphoma, followed by metastatic tumors. In addition, benign or nonmalignant causes of superior vena cava syndrome now comprise at least 40% of cases. Iatrogenic thrombus formation or SVC stenosis is a growing etiology due to pacemaker wires and semipermanent intravascular catheters used for hemodialysis, long-term antibiotics, or chemotherapy.
