- Women with a Bartholin gland cyst are usually first seen by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner or internist. Because of the extensive differential, it is important to involve the gynecologist in the care of these patients.

- Antibiotic therapy should be considered for those who have failed initial I&D with Word catheter placement, patients with systemic symptoms including fever, patients who have suspected sepsis, and those considered at high risk for recurrence.

- Women who are pregnant and have Bartholin abscesses should be treated in the same mannerÂ as nonpregnant women, with the exception of Bartholin gland excision due to the increased risk of bleeding.
