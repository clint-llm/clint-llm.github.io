The fasciocutaneous flaps include the deep fascia and the perifascial vascular network, which improves their vascularization compared to skin flaps in specific anatomical regions, especially the legs. Raising of fasciocutaneous flaps is quick and straightforward. These flaps are reliable, thin, and readily mobilized. They are particularly beneficial in the case of resurfacing areas of cutaneous mobility and coverage of tissues such as tendons, bone, and joints. The development of microsurgical techniques and perforating flaps was done at the expense of pedicled fasciocutaneous flaps, which nevertheless keep indications given their simplicity of realization.
