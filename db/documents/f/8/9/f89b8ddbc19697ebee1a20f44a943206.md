Tarantula toxicity is a rare occurrence. There are over 900 species of tarantula, and they are popular as pets. While tarantulas do possess venom, the vast majority of tarantula-related injuries occur as a result of urticating hairs. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of tarantula-related injuries and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients injured by tarantulas.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of tarantula toxicity.
- Explain the pathophysiology of tarantula injuries.
- Summarize the potential long-term complications associated with tarantula toxicity.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for prevention of injuries, early treatment, and follow-up to prevent long-term complications.
