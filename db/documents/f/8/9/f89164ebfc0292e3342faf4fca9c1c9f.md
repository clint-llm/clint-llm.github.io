Renal cysts are often detected incidentally during a CT scan or ultrasound. The sonographic features of a simple cyst are as follows: anechoic, thin imperceptible wall, and no internal septations or debris.

On non-contrast, unenhanced CT scan, a simple cyst can be confidently diagnosedÂ if the cyst measures simple fluid of 20 Hounsfield units or less, has no septations, and has no central or peripheral calcification, and has a thin wall. On a contrast-enhanced CT Scan, a simple cyst is diagnosed if there is no enhancement, it measures the simple fluid, has a thin wall, and contains no calcifications.

MRI features of a simple cyst are as follows: homogeneously low signal intensity on T1 weighted imaged, homogeneously high signal intensity on T2 weighted images, and no demonstrable enhancement after IV contrast. Subtraction images can be helpful in difficult cases of questionable enhancement.
