A goniometer can evaluate both active as well as passive range of motion.

Positioning plays a vital part in goniometry because it helps to place the joints in a zero starting position or a neutral position and helps to stabilize the proximal joint segment. The examiner stabilizes the proximal joint component and then carefully moves the distal component of the joint through its entire available range of motion until reaching the end feel.

- After estimating the available range of motion and the examiner returns the distal component to the starting position. The examiner palpates the relevant bony landmarks and aligns the goniometer.

- The examiner records the starting measurement and removes the goniometer, and the patient moves the joint through the available range of motion.

- Once the joint has run through the available range of motion, the examiner replaces and realigns the goniometer and reads and records the measurement.

- The examiner repeats the measurement three times and calculates the average; this is the active range of motion measurement.

- The examiner compares the reading with the contralateral side.

-  The joint is then moved passively through its passive range of motion (PROM), and the steps mentioned above are repeated to measure PROM accurately.

- Care is necessary to make sure the patient does not move his body while moving the joint, thereby ensuring accurate measurement.

Positioning significantly influences the tension in soft tissue structures like capsules, muscles, and ligaments, which envelope a joint. Any position which tenses the soft tissue structures will lead to a limited range of motion compared to a position where the structures are lax.

It is vital to make sure that the same testing position during successive measurements to ensure that the amounts of tension remain constant in the soft tissue as compared to past measurements. This approach assures the obtaining of similar results. Any change in position will lead to erroneous readings.

The range of motion differs from person to person and also by age and joint. Please see the table.
