The coronal suture is a dense and fibrous association of connection tissue located in between the frontal and parietal bones of the skull. At birth, the sutures decrease in size (molding) and allow the skull to become smaller. In children, the suture enables the skull to expand with the rapidly growing brain. The suture will close and fuse around age 24.

The coronal suture is one of the three sutures whose juncture forms the anterior fontanelle. This fontanelle originates at the intersection of the frontal suture, the coronal suture, and the sagittal suture. This fontanelle is open at birth and generally fuses around 18 to 24 months after birth.
