The risk of complications from PACs should be explained in conjunction with underlying etiologies, should they exist. Complications from PACs, independent of other conditions, include:

- Atrial fibrillation

- Ischemic stroke

- Increased cardiac-related and all-cause mortality

Isolated PACs (without premature ventricular complexes) are not associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death.
