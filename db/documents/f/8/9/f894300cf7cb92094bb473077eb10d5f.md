Exposure to organophosphates can be life-threatening. To improve patients outcomes and enhance patient safety, early recognition of the toxidromes associated with organophosphate poisoning is important. Coordination and transfer of care from the Emergency Room to the Intensive Care Unit should be facilitated promptly. An interprofessional approach with the active participation of all the health care providers, including clinicians, specialists (particularly a toxicologist), mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists, is essential for a good clinical outcome. A good resource to use is the Poison Control Center, available nationwide in the USA at 1-800-222-1222.
