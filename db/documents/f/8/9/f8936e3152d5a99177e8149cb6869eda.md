TheÂ flexor retinaculum is best known for sheltering the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. The median nerve originates from the cervical spinal cord roots C5-C7 and C8-T1.

Fracture of the hook of the hamate can damage the ulnar nerve, causing loss of function of the abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi, and opponens digiti minimi. In addition, the palmar and dorsal interossei will be denervated. Guyon's canal is located superficial to the flexor retinaculum on its medial edge.

The ulnar nerve has suffered damage if the patient cannot oppose the little finger. If one cannot oppose the thumb, the median nerve or its recurrent branch has been damaged. A good test for the dorsal interossei is to hold the patient's fingers and have the patient attempt to abduct them. Loss of strength of the dorsal interossei is caused by a lesion of the ulnar nerve. Because it is sheltered in the forearm, the ulnar nerve is usually subject to damage only as it passes around the medial epicondyle or in Guyon's canal, or in deep puncture wounds of the hand.
