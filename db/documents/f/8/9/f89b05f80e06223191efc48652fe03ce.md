The 4 parathyroid glands develop from the endoderm of the 3 and 4 pharyngeal pouches around the 6 weeks of gestation. Recent studies have posited that there may be some ectodermal and neural crest contribution to the glandsâ€™ formation as well. Interestingly, the inferior parathyroid glands develop from the 3 pharyngeal pouches while the superior glands develop from the 4 pharyngeal pouches. This is due to the additional formation of the thymus by these pharyngeal pouches that migrates caudally later in gestation. The parathyroid glands are functional during gestation, acting to control calcium balance in the fetus.
