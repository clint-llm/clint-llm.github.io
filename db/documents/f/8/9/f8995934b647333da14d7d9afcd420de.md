The retinal structural architecture includes 10 layers constituting various cell types along with their synaptic connections for visual processing. The inner retina comprises nerve fiber layer axons, ganglion cells and their dendritic synaptic connections, and amacrine cells. The outer retina comprises the rod and cone photoreceptors, which transfer visual information to second-order bipolar cells found in the middle retina.Â Cones are found in the highest concentrations in the central macula or fovea, the area of the retina responsible for visual acuity. Following phototransduction from the outer retina, the inner retinal ganglion cells then transmit this electrical information to the brain via the optic nerve for visual information processing.
