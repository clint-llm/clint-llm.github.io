The womenâ€™s health initiative (WHI) trial reported increased risks of cardiovascular disease (0.6/1000), stroke (0.9/1000), venous thromboembolism (VTE), and breast cancer with the use of hormone replacement therapy. The increased risk of breast cancer was noted at four years with combination therapy and increased risk of endometrial neoplasia with estrogen therapy. All doses and routes of administration for estrogen and progestogen products have a boxed warning to use the lowest dose, and the shortest duration possible was based on the above trial.
