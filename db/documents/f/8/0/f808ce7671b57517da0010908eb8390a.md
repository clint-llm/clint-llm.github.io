The conjoined twins that survive until birth can be broadly categorized into two categories, those who can be surgically separated and those who cannot. The determination of which set of conjoined twins can be separated is an interprofessional effort employing imaging modalities and multiple reviews. The conjoined twins that extensively share vital organs can generally not be separated as separation might lead to the death of one or both twins. This presents some ethical dilemmas in the surgical management of conjoined twins, but the overall decision still lies with the parents. Some cases might need the involvement of the hospital ethics committee.

Surgical management requires identification of the anatomic relationship of the conjunction between the twins. Three-dimensional modeling and simulations help the team in making surgical decisions. The use of tissue expansion preoperatively is very helpful due to issues with the closure of the abdominal wall. At least 1 simulation of the separation event is recommended preoperatively as that helps with the outcome of conjoined twins.

During medical management, some pharmacokinetic considerations must be kept in mind as the shared circulation of the conjoined twins may have a variable volume of distribution and clearance.
