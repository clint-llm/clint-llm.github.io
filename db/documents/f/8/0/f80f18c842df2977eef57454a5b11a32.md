The diagnosis of lichen nitidus can be made clinically. Skin biopsy does provide a definitive diagnosis and has distinct histopathological features as mentioned above.

**Dermoscopy**

Dermoscopy can be a useful tool when clinically diagnosing lichenÂ nitidus. Smooth, white, well-circumscribed 1-2mm circular areas are seen with a brown shadow reflected. The well-circumscribed white circles can correlate with the epidermal acanthosis seen on histopathology. The brownish shadow reflected off of the white circles is the underlying epithelioid cells and lymphocytes in the dermal papilla. Dermoscopy can be helpful well differentiating between other cutaneous conditions.

In patients who have palmoplantar involvement, hyperkeratotic pits and well-defined depressions with thin scales have been noted on dermoscopic assessment.
