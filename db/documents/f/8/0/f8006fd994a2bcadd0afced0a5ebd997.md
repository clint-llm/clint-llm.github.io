**Medical Treatment**

Treatment of renal involvement is focused on slowing the progression of proteinuria by achieving blockage of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Two classes of drugs that target theÂ RAAS and are well studied in patients with genetic or acquired proteinuria are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The literature is lacking robust evidence to support any particular medical treatment, although the authors of a case report involving an infant girl with NPS and proteinuria described complete remission of the patient's proteinuria using a combination therapy of an ACEi and ARB.

**Surgical Treatment**

Patellofemoral pain and patellar dislocation are common symptoms of NPS, which may be initially treated with conservative measures. Multiple surgical techniques and approaches have been described for the correction of patellar instability.

**Patient Management**

No specific management guidelines have been proposed by any large medical organization. Sweeney et al. put forth recommendations that aim to maintain quality of life, provide genetic counseling for patients and their families, and provide screening measures to prevent NPS complications associated with elevated morbidity and mortality such as glaucoma and renal failure.
