Due to the high volume of open-heart operations involving the right atrium, surgeons need to be familiar with the arrangement of the atrial arteries. The ARAA are considered major arteries of the right atrium and are therefore of surgical significance. Surgeons must be aware of the nature and variations of the ARAA when working around the atrial chambers. It is crucial to avoid them during procedures to prevent postoperative atrial arrhythmias or other atrial dysfunction.
