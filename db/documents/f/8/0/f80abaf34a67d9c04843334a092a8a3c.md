Repetitive microtrauma on the tendons causes microscopic changes. Histologic studies of specimens reveal degeneration, fibrinoid necrosis, pseudocyst change, randomized collagen with neovascularization, tenocyte infiltration, micro-tears of the tendinous tissue, focal degeneration near the bone-tendon insertion, hyaline degeneration, and metaplasia.
