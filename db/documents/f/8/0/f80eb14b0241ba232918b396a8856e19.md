The treatment for bursitis depends largely on whether it is infective or noninfective. Acute noninfective bursitis is self-limited. It can be managed conservatively with rest, ice, and the use of NSAIDs. Application of elastic bandage has also been shown to help prevent swelling. Some studies have suggested that corticosteroid injection can result in an early reduction in symptoms of olecranon bursitis, but this treatment carries up to a 10% risk of iatrogenic infection. Up to 25% of patients treated with aspiration will have persistent or recurrent swelling at eight weeks, and up to 10% will continue to have persistent symptoms at 6 months. In those with repeated episodes, bursectomy can be considered. The presence of an underlying bone spur is indicative of risk for repetitive recurrence. Patients with a known spur and more than one recurrence should, therefore, be considered for surgical excision of the offending spur. Persistently recurring bursitis without a spur present may benefit from surgical excision of the bursa.

Infective bursitis requires treatment with antibiotics, particularly with antimicrobials targeted against streptococcal and staphylococcal organisms. Aspiration and drainage are highly recommended including disruption of any present loculations. Oral antibiotics are sufficient with no benefit of any dose of intravenous (IV) antibiotics noted. Treatment with oral antibiotics for 7 days is sufficient as there is no evidence of decreased recurrence with longer courses of treatment. Bursectomy is considered for those with recurrent infections or failure to clinically progress despite other treatments. Evidence of systemic infection should include further evaluation of severe sepsis or septic shock with the appropriate up-to-date treatment for either.
