Almost any clinician, including the nurse practitioner, can prescribe vitamin C. However, unless there is a deficiency, the emphasis should be on eating a healthy diet that consists of fruits and veggies. Supplements of vitamin C are relatively safe but can be expensive in the long run. Plus, because there is no oversight on supplements, product quality can be an issue. There is very little good evidence to support using vitamin C to prevent most chronic disorders like heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer.

Whether prescribed by the clinician or taken as an OTC supplement, the entire interprofessional healthcare team, including all clinicians, nursing staff, and pharmacist, should know that the patient is taking vitamin C and be able to offer counsel, signs of deficiency and/or excessive intake, and offer counsel on how to optimize the use of this vitamin to achieve optimal outcomes.
