The left ventricle pumps blood at higher pressures compared to the rest of the other heart chambers, as it faces a much higher workload and mechanical afterload. In comparison to that of the right ventricle, the free wall of the left ventricle is much thicker.

The electrophysiology of the left ventricle starts at the sinoatrial (SA) node which initiates an action potential. This action potential is carried across the atria, causing contraction, to the atrioventricular (AV) node. The AV node delays the electrical current by about 100ms before transmitting the impulse to the atrioventricular bundle of His. The electrical impulse then travels down the right and left bundle branches to the Purkinje fibers. When the action potential reaches the ventricular contractile fibers, excitation-contraction coupling induces calcium influx causing synchronized contraction starting at the heart apex and progressing upwards.
