The frequency of rectovaginal fistula varies according to the cause. They are typically classified by etiology, location, and size, which affects the treatment and prognosis.

Rectovaginal fistulas are divided into 2 groups by location:

- Low RVFs are located in the lower third of the rectum and the lower half of the vagina. They are closest to the anus and are repaired with a perineal surgical approach.

- High RVFs are located between the middle third of the rectum and the posterior vaginal fornix. They require a transabdominal surgical repair approach.

- Most RVFs are less than 2 cm in diameter and are stratified by size:

- Small: Less than 0.5 cm in diameter
- Medium-sized: 0.5 to 2.5 cm in diameter
- Large RVFs: Exceed 2.5 cm in diameter
