The ideal method to evaluate atrioventricular reentry tachycardia is to obtain a 12 leads EKG during the time of arrhythmia, enabling one to differentiate between orthodromic vs. antidromic types of atrioventricular reentry tachycardia.

In orthodromic AVRT the QRS complexes would be narrow with an RR rate between 150 to 250 beats per minutes, and a retrograde P wave would follow the QRS complexes as the activation of the atria would be reversed, and the duration of the RP interval will be less than half of the RR intervals.

In antidromic AVRT, the QRS complexes should be wide, as the impulse is traveling to the ventricles through the accessory pathway making the QRS complexes fully pre-excitable, the rate is usually between 150 to 250, with a retrograde P wave following the QRS complexes. The duration of the RP intervals will be more than half of those of RR intervals.

Surface EKG when the individual is not in the tachyarrhythmia might demonstrate the characteristic delta wave with a short PR interval that results from the early depolarization of the ventricles through the accessory pathway.
