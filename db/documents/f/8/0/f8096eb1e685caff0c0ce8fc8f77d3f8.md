Dementia describes an overall decline in memory and other cognitive skills severe enough to reduce a person's ability to perform everyday activities. It is characterized by the progressive and persistent deterioration of cognitive function. Affected patients often have memory loss and a partial or significant lack of insight into their deficits. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of dementia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition. It also reviews risk factors, pathophysiology, and challenges in diagnosing and managing this spectrum of cognitive disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Describe risk factors associated with dementia and related conditions. 
- Review the evaluation required for patients presenting with cognitive decline.
- Summarize the commonly available management options available for patients with various cognitive decline syndromes.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients affected by dementia.
