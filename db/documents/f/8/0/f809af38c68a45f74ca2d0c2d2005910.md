Bertolotti syndrome is a congenital disorder leading to back pain associated with a lumbosacral transitional vertebra (LSTV). It most frequently occurs via an articulation of the L5 vertebra transverse process(es) with the sacrum, leading to irregular spinal mobility and pain. This disorder affects up to 8% of the population and must be accurately diagnosed to be managed appropriately. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of Bertolotti syndrome and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Bertolotti syndrome.
- Explain the pathophysiology of lumbosacral transitional vertebrae and its association with low back pain.
- Review the physical exam and imaging findings of patients with Bertolotti syndrome.
- Outline the treatment considerations for patients with Bertolotti syndrome.
