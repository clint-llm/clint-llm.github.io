Hypocarbia or hypocapnia is a decrease in alveolar and blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels below the normal reference range of 35 mmHg. Aberrations lead to hypocarbia, typically resulting in respiratory alkalosis. It is important for the interprofessional team to recognize this condition and report to the team leader so that appropriate adjustments in care can be made. This will improve patient outcomes.
