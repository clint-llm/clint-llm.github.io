**U.S. Boxed Warning for Anaphylaxis for Omalizumab**

Typically omalizumab is characterized by a very good safety profile; the major side-effect concerns with omalizumab are in four categories: systemic reactions, the potential effect on malignancy, risk of parasite disease, and immunological effects including serum sickness and Churg-Strauss vasculitis.

Subjects in clinical trials generally tolerate the drug well, with most adverse events being mild or moderate and reported with a similar frequency to those in control or placebo groups. The most commonly reported adverse events with omalizumab in clinical trials were injection-site reactions (45%), viral infection (23%), upper respiratory tract infection (20%), sinusitis (16%), headache (15%), and pharyngitis (11%). There are reports of anaphylactic reactions occurring with omalizumab, usually within 2 hours of the first or subsequent doses, although the incidence is low (0.1 to 0.2%). t merits noting these reports have been in asthmatics and not chronic urticaria patients.

Regarding anaphylaxis, the Omalizumab Joint Task Force, formed by two American institutions specializing in asthma, allergy, and immunology, reviewed the omalizumab clinical trials and the post-marketing surveillance data. ey concluded that out of the 39510 patients who received omalizumab from June 2003 and December 2005, 35 patients had 41 episodes, which corresponds to an anaphylaxis reporting rate of 0.09%; as a result of the data, recommendations were implemented, which included a 2-hour observation following the initial three injections and the provision of epinephrine pens to patients.

Immunoglobulin E is classically the primary antibody in combatting parasitic disease; there are concerns that omalizumab therapy puts patients at increased risk of helminth infections. Some data demonstrates that in areas with an increased risk of helminth infection, omalizumab treatment slightly raises the patient's risk compared to placebo.

Cases of Churg-Strauss in omalizumab treatment do appear in the literature.

There are two case reports of transient hair loss in chronic urticaria patients treated with omalizumab.
