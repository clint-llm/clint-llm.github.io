An aortopulmonary or septal defect/aortopulmonary window is one of the rarest congenital heart defects. This defect develops embryologically when there is incomplete septation of the great arteries. It can occur in isolation or as part of a greater syndrome involving multiple cardiac defects. Untreated aortopulmonary septal defects commonly cause morbidity and mortality from a large left to right shunt and pulmonary hypertension. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of aortopulmonary septal defects and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of aortopulmonary septal defects as the cause of congestive heart failure in infants.
- Review the epidemiology of patients diagnosed with aortopulmonary septal defects.
- Outline the evaluation of a patient with a probable aortopulmonary septal defect.
- Explain the treatment and management necessary for patients with aortopulmonary septal defects.
