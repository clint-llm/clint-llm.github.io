Osteopenia and osteoporosis and its associated complications constitute a significant source of patient morbidity and mortality, and the treatment of its complications provide an enormous financial and resource burden to the healthcare system

All postmenopausal women should undergo bone densitometry and understand the benefits of this test.

Healthcare providers must all coordinate to ensure that patients initially diagnosed with a fragility fracture receive early follow-up with an appropriate provider experienced in managing low bone mineral density conditions.  The latter has been receiving significant attention in the literature over the last few decades, as followup rates have been documented to be extremely low (i.e., in the range of 5% to 15%).  The goal is to enhance interprofessional care and prevent further fracture, surgery, morbidity, and associated mortality. Evidence level: Level 2 and Level 3.
