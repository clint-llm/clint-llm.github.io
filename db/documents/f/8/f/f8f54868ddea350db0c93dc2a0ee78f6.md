Overall good to excellent results can be expected in over 80% of patients regardingÂ a range of motion, strength, and outcomes scoring with open-reduction internal fixation and volar plating. Studies comparing volar fixation to other forms of fixation have revealed similar if not superior results. Results appear to be superior in the early recovery period with the outcome yielding equivalent results among all fixation groups. Some studies suggest better maintenance with volar plating in overall reduction compared to other forms of fixation.
