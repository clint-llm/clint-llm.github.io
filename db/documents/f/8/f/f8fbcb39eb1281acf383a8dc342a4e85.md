Managing the administration and usage of ketoconazole requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including nurses, laboratory technologists, pharmacists, and several physicians in different specialties. Since the usage of ketoconazole can result in adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity and adrenal insufficiency, it is important to monitor liver and adrenal function in patients considered for ketoconazole treatment. This monitoring requires that each member of theÂ healthcare team monitor patient for signs of acute liver failure not only with laboratory evidence but also clinically by recognizing the signs of liver dysfunction. In addition, since there are off-label and over-the-counter uses of ketoconazole, it is important to educate patients about the adverse effects of this drug and the proper use of the medication. Therefore, the interprofessional model for patient care when using ketoconazole therapy is crucial to driving optimal patient outcomes while reducing the potential for adverse effects. [Level 5]
