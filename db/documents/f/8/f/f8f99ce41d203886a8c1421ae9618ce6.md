Isotretinoin is an oral prescription medication that affects sebaceous glands and is used to treat severe acne. The drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1982 to treat severe, resistant, nodular acne that is unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics.

Isotretinoin has been used for moderate acne, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, neuroblastoma, and the prevention of squamous cell carcinoma in high-risk patients. Clinicians have also utilized isotretinoin in the treatment of rosacea, folliculitis, and pyoderma faciale.
