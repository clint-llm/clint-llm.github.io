The most important indication for leaving the abdomen open is the patient who is continuing to decline during the stress of the operation. The decline could be indicated by increasing lactate, which is indicative of worsening shock, increasing acidosis or coagulopathy, or an ongoing transfusion or vasopressor requirement.  Once bleeding and contamination are controlled (damage control), the decision must be made whether the patient will be able to tolerate further operative intervention and communicated to the rest of the team urgently.

Occasionally, a patient may have too much edema or intraabdominal hypertension, which precludes fascial closure. In the slightly more stable patient, the surgeon may desire a “second-look” operation to remove the surgical packing used to achieve hemostasis, confirm the viability of intraabdominal organs, or to perform a bowel anastomoses under better conditions. The surgeon should exercise caution in prescribing the need for a second-look operation, as the best opportunity for primary fascial closure is at the index operation prior to the unopposed force of the lateral abdominal wall muscular retraction.
