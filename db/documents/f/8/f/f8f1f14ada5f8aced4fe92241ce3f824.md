Stenotrophomonas maltophilia easily grows on standard culture media, either as a single isolate or mixed with other culture growths like Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Pseudomonas in having opaque flat surfaces with uneven borders. Selective media were shown to be better in isolating Stenotrophomonas maltophilia from non-sterile samples and usually contain imipenem, vancomycin, amphotericin-B, and mannitol/bromothymol blue as an indicator.

For in vitro laboratory identification, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a strict aerobe that is usually oxidase negative, though it was shown that up to 20% could show positive oxidase activity.Burkholderia cepacia-complex, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bordetella bronchisepticaÂ an identification challenge.

Another diagnostic challenge involves antibiotic susceptibility testing due to difficulties in setting standard minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia through different methods.

Nucleic-acid amplification testing (NAAT) and species-specific 23S rRNA-directed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques are also well used for identification successfully with almost 100% sensitivity and specificity when available.

Chest x-rays may reveal lobar or lobular infiltrates in pneumonia cases, either unilateral or bilateral, with uncommon pleural effusions or cavitary lesions on rare occasions.
