Organized diving training includes instruction on avoiding pulmonary overinflation by not holding the breath, controlling ascent rate and buoyancy, and carefully monitoring breathing gas consumption and quantity to avoid depletion of breathing gas while under water.Â  Once the acute phase of the injury is over, the physician should discuss the dive history with the patient to try to determine whether a precipitating event (e.g. loss of buoyancy control, sudden depth change, or rapid or panic ascent) can be isolated. If so, the physician should discuss preventive measures with the diver if he or she plans to return to diving.
