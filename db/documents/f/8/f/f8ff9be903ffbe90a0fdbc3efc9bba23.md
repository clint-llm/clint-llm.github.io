The average age of menopause is fifty-one years. Menopause occurs when the ovaries cease making estrogen, and the patient is no longer ovulatory. The level of the follicle-stimulating hormone is elevated after menopause, as the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis attempts to stimulate ovulation despite the ovaries no longer being able. A woman is labeled menopausal if she has gone twelve months without menses.

After a woman is postmenopausal, further vaginal bleeding is no longer considered normal. The differential diagnosis of postmenopausal bleeding includes many benign and malignant conditions, the most common of which is atrophy, but the most concerning possible etiology is endometrial cancer. As with most malignancies, early diagnosis may lead to a better prognosis. Therefore, a postmenopausal woman with vaginal bleeding should be promptly and appropriately evaluated.
