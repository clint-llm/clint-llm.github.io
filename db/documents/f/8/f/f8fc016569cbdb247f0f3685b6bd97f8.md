Mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate) is a detoxifying medicine used to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis in patients receiving chemotherapy with either high-dose cyclophosphamide or ifosfamide. Mesna initially becomes inactivated to dimesna (mensa disulfide) in the bloodstream; however, once it is filtered through the kidneys and excreted into the bladder, it is reactivated. As reactivated mesna concentrates in the bladder, mesna detoxifies acrolein, a urotoxic breakdown product of ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide that accumulates in the bladder. This activity outlines the indications, action, and contraindications for mesna as a valuable agent in conjunction with the ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide administration. In addition, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other vital factors pertinent for interprofessional team members in the care of patients receiving chemotherapy at risk for hemorrhagic cystitis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of mesna in preventing hemorrhagic cystitis.
- Summarize the adverse effects associated with mesna administration.
- Outline various forms of administration of mesna.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance mesna and improve outcomes.
