Although thorough history-taking can uncover the cause of malabsorption in many cases, classic symptoms may not be present, and diseases can mimic each other. Diagnostic testing can include imaging studies, serology, and stimulation tests; however, workup will be driven by the clinical presentation.

Often, testing begins with routine labs when working up malabsorption. Labs typically include a complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), iron studies, urinalysis, and coagulation panel. These blood tests can help support or discard specific diagnoses. Further diagnostic testing for suspected problems with absorption should be utilized based on individual patient presentation. These tests may include a combination of the following: qualitative and quantitative stool fat assessment, abdominal ultrasound, serologic markers for specific diseases such as celiac and Crohn disease, and colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, or sigmoidoscopy when warranted. Additional imaging of the small intestine with barium studies or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected pancreatic etiologies of malabsorption may be necessary in individual cases.

When considering carbohydrate malabsorption, tests such as the lactose tolerance test and D-xylose test (measuring the capacity of small bowel absorption and aiding in mucosal etiologies) may be used.
