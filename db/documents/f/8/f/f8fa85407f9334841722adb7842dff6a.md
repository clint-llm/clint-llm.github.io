- For basilar artery infarction, currently available data is inadequate and needs further extensive randomized prospective clinical trials to study pathophysiology. A better scoring system must be developed dedicated to posterior circulation strokes for prognostication of ischemic strokes secondary to BAO. Also, educational programs and campaigns should be done regarding BAO for both healthcare providers and patients to improve the outcomes of this devastating disease process.

- Other emerging therapies include the MRI-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) technique, which uses thermal heating for sonothrombolysis and ablation.

- A small number of strokes occur after cardiac and cardiovascular bypass grafting surgeries. Using perioperative epiaortic ultrasound is potentially useful to detect thrombus during surgery to prevent perioperative ischemic strokes.

- Elevated levels of cytokines like interleukin-37 are associated with an acute ischemic stroke, and further studies are being conducted to determine the role of these chemokines and cytokines in the CRISP trial (NCT03297827).
