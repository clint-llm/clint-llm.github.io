There are no special preparations required to perform a routine slit lamp examination. For fundus evaluation, the surgeon needs to dilate the patient's eye; for applanation, tonometry, and gonioscopy, topical anesthetic should be put in the eye, and the procedure should be explained to the patient. The patient should also explain visual blurring post-dilatation and the need to wear sunglasses.

**Slit Lamp Maintenance**

A cloth that is free of lint can be moistened with alcohol and is used to clean the chin rest, head rest, hand holder, and adjustable table. The paper strips used at chin res should be replaced after each examination. The fundus lenses, gonio lenses, and prisms should be cleaned with water, soap, or alcohol-based solution and air dried.
