In the setting of a confirmed and asymptomatic hemangioma, a patient can be reassured that this is a benign entity. However, the patient should return to the clinic in the setting of pain or neurologic deficits of any kind. A thorough evaluation can then be performed to understand the etiology of the symptoms and to confirm whether the new onset of symptoms is secondary to a now symptomatic hemangioma or a different etiology.
