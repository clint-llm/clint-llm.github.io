Muscle strain is the primary injury among athletes, accounting for up to 31% of visits. Among European soccer players, adductor muscle injuries were the second most commonly injured muscle group (23%) behind hamstrings (37%).

In another study of soccer players, adductor pain/strain represents anywhere from 9% to 18% of all injuries. In sub-elite, male soccer players, adductor strain accounted for 51% of all groin pain.
