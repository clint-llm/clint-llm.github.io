Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is a nonspecific diagnosis representing many conditions that involve the compression of the neurovascular structures that pass through the thoracic outlet. TOS was first reported by Rogers in 1949 and more precisely characterized by Rob and Standeven in 1958.

The first rib, scalene muscles, and the clavicle comprise the thoracic outlet. Patients present with a wide range of symptoms, from minor complaints to debilitating manifestations. Imaging of the musculature and vasculature can help identify this condition. Electrodiagnostic studies can also be useful if the condition is neurologic in origin. Both nonsurgical and surgical treatment methods are options for patients in managing this condition. Patients who are treated appropriately generally fair well, with the vast majority having their symptoms resolve completely.
