Frey’s (auriculotemporal) syndrome occurs following surgery, trauma, or any pathology to the parotid gland or the auriculotemporal nerve that, in turn, damages the postganglionic parasympathetic, sympathetic and sensory nerves within them. Very rarely, Frey’s syndrome can occur following herpes infection.

Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers projecting to the otic ganglion may be damaged by traumatic injury or inflammation involving foramen ovale, causing dysfunction of the parotid gland and other areas in which the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers innervate.

Recent studies have shown the presence of neuropeptide, pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PAC-AP) in the otic ganglion, which plays a significant role in primary headache.
