Various vessels surround the hepatoduodenal ligament that may contribute to the blood supply of this ligament. Aside from the hepatic artery proper and the portal vein that runs through the ligament, other vessels are adjacent to this structure. The right gastric artery, which derives from the left hepatic artery, the common hepatic artery, and part of the gastroduodenal artery seems to be associated with the blood supply of the hepatoduodenal ligament, and blood is typically drained by the right gastric vein.
