Complications of urethral catheterization include:

- Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common complication that occurs as a result of long term catheterization.

- A chronic bladder infection can occur from urinary (10-100 ml) stasis at the base of the bladder, which is obstructed by the balloon of the catheter.

- Pain due to traction on the drainage bag.

- A transitory stinging sensation is common in men that often occurs during lubrication and can be minimized by cooling the gel to 4°C.

- Paraphimosis

- Urethral injury

- Catheter obstruction can occur due to the sediment buildup in patients with subclinical bacteriuria. Flushing can often relieve the blockage. If unsuccessful catheter replacement may be required.

- Urine leakage from the urethral meatus extrinsic to the catheter may occur as a result of bladder spasms. These spasms can be painful and can be alleviated with anticholinergic medications like oxybutynin.

- A negative effect on the quality of life, especially for patients with longterm indwelling catheters.

Due to these complications, indications for the bladder catheterization must be carefully reviewed before the procedure.
