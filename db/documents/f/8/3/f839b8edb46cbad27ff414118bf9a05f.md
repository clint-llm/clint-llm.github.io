Symptoms of angioedema include angioedema of the face, laryngeal edema leading to difficulty with breathing, edema of the extremities and genitalia. Abdominal pain and bloating may occur together with hypotension.

Angioedema in the absence of urticaria indicates a bradykinin-mediated mechanism, most commonly C1-INH deficiency and may be hereditary or acquired.

Acquired angioedema may have underlying autoimmune connective tissue disease or a lymphoproliferative disorder.
