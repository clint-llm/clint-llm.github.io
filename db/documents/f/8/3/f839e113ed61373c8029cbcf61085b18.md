A histopathologic examination can help and is usually necessary to distinguish autoimmune pancreatitis from pancreatic cancer.

A histopathologic picture of sclerosing pancreatitis or a presence of IgG4 positive cells along with periductal lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, acinar fibrosis, or obliterative phlebitis can establish a diagnosis of AIP type 1. AIP type 2 is characterized by IgG4 positive cells in pancreatic parenchyma and granulocytic epithelial lesions in the pancreatic duct.
