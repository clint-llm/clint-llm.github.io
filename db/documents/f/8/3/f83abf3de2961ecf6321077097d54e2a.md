Holmes tremor is significantly incapacitating as the patient presents tremor in resting and intention activities, as with posture. This is in addition to the primary insult producing the tremor. There is no specific treatment. Medication and DBS have been the mainstay to control it. However, results can be incomplete. Initial treatment withÂ levetiracetam, trihexyphenidyl, or levodopa should be tested for an adequate response. Those unresponsive patients should be offered DBS, understanding that results may be incomplete and that multiple targets may be required. Patients have to understand that the original neurological deficits will not benefit from the DBS procedure. This is important, so they do not have false expectations from the procedure.
