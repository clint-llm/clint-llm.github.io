JC virus is a DNA virus of the polyomaviridae family. The virus remains latent in most immunocompetent hosts and rarely presents pathologically. In immunosuppressed hosts, however, a combination of poor cellular response of the host along with reactivation of the virus secondary to recombination of genes results in active disease.

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy can occur in the context of immune reconstitution syndrome. In AIDS patients on antiretroviral therapy who present with focal neurological deficits or altered mental status along with non-contrast enhancing lesions, a diagnosis of PML IRIS ought to be considered. This condition can present from 1 week to 26 months after the initiation of HAART.

PML has been known to occur following treatment with monoclonal antibodies, specifically natalizumab, rituximab, efalizumab, and eculizumab.
