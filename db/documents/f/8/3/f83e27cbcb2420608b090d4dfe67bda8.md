The histopathology of CC depends on the patientâ€™s age. In younger patients, lymphocytic infiltration into the wall of the cyst, which is lined by columnar epithelium, is demonstrated. In addition, there is a presence of dense collagenous tissue along with bundles of smooth muscle within the wall, indicating cyst wall fibrosis. In contrast, adult cysts show evidence of mucosal inflammation and hyperplasia.
