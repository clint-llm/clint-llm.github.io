The incidence of PTLD is variable, and it depends mainly on the type of organ transplant received, and immunosuppression used. The reported incidence of PTLD is between 2% to 20%, with a greater number of cases in patients who receive a solid organ transplant compared to allogeneic stem cell transplant recipients. The most important risk factors for PTLD include transplantation status (donor EBV-seropositive/recipient EBV-seronegative), ongoing immunosuppressive therapy, duration of immunosuppression, and status of EBV infection. Most described cases of PTLD arise in the setting of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) seropositivity and reactivation from latent B-cells, as a consequence of immune-suppression. Primary EBV infection occurs when an EBV-seronegative recipient gets an allograft from an EBV-seropositive donor (D+/R-), is known as the most significant risk factor for developing PTLD. Thus, higher rates of PTLD have been reported in pediatric than adult transplant recipients. A higher rate of PTLD is observed in the patients receiving heart, lung, small bowel transplant, or combined heart-lung transplant. The reason for these differences is partly due to the need for a higher dose of immunosuppression medications to prevent allografts' rejection.
