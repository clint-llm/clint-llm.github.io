As with other CNS tumors, the TNM system of classification does not apply to ependymomas as they rarely spread outside of the CNS, and the WHO classification for CNS tumors is the current standard used to classify these ependymomas:

- Grade I, slow-growing tumors which are often considered benign, including subependymomas and myxopapillary ependymomas:

- Subependymomas typically arise in the ventricular walls, most commonly in the fourth or lateral ventricles - they are histologically characterized by a hypocellular tissue presenting clusters of cells with a bland nucleus surrounded by a glial matrix.
- Myxopapillary ependymomas most commonly arise in the cauda equina, filum terminale, or conus medullaris, and present histologically as pseudopapillary structures with mucin-rich microcysts, the cells are cuboidal and radially arranged surrounding a myxoid stroma.

- Grade II are ependymomas presenting with high cellularity and papillary structures. Cells are arranged regularly and present aÂ clear cytoplasm.

- Grade III, are anaplastic ependymomas, presenting with abundant mitotic cells with pseudopalisading necrosis.
