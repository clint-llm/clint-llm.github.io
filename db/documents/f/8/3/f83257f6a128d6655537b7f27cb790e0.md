Inadequate acute pain management has numerous adverse effects on patient health, including but not limited to reduced ability to perform activities of daily living, impaired ability to sleep, low mood, and decreased libido. Not only does poor acute pain management negatively affect patient health, but it may also increase the risk of developing chronic pain.

The use of opioid medication may result in somnolence, sedation, respiratory depression, urinary retention, nausea/vomiting, ileus, or pruritis.

The bleeding risk associated with the use of NSAIDs should be considered among patients in circumstances where they are at increased risk of blood loss, such as those who had surgery on highly vascular structures (ex. tonsillectomy) versus others (ex.  cholecystectomy) when developing an appropriate pain management strategy.

The use of peripheral regional analgesic techniques may result in a transient motor blockade, which could increase the risk of falls.

When administering neuraxial analgesia, patients require close monitoring as respiratory depression, hypotension, and motor weakness from spinal cord compression (due to hematoma or infection) may occur.
