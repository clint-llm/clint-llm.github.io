In patients treated for megaloblastic anemia, hematologic monitoring (i.e., complete blood counts) showing improvement generally indicates efficacy.

In patients treated with folinic acid for methotrexate toxicity, it is recommended to monitor serum creatinine and methotrexate levels at 24-hour intervals.

When used in combination with 5-FU, the recommendation is that providers monitor complete blood counts (with differential), liver function tests, and electrolytes.Â Patients who develop diarrhea should be monitored closely until resolution. The renal function requires monitoring in elderly patients or those with known kidney disease/renal impairment.
