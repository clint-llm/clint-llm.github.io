A pap smear is collected with a brush inserted into the cervical os. It is important to have the brush extend beyond the visualized portion to increase the chance of successfully collecting cells from the transition zone. A similar tool to the brush is a spatula or broom.

The two mechanisms for analyzing the collects cells are liquid-based cytology(Thin prep, sure path) and conventional cytology. There are two subtypes of this cytology.

Liquid-based cytology preserves the cells in a buffered alcoholic solution. It has been suggested that liquid-based can better identify glandular pathology. The conventional cytology method directly transfers the cells collected from the brush onto a slide. This transfer is why this technique is called a pap smear. When transferring the specimen onto the slide, it is important to minimize drying artifact due to prolonged contact with the air. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), both the liquid-based and conventional techniques are equally effective at screening for cervical cancer.
