Initially, the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni was done using clinical criteria based on signs and symptoms the patient and family have. With advanced genetic testing, patients can now know if they carry a copy of the TP53 tumor mutation before showing any signs of LFS. Genetic testing for TP53 mutations is very important. It is important to offer genetic counseling and testing to all relatives at risk of having a familial TP53 pathogenic variant. Genetic testing only detects approximately 70% to 75% of cases. Genetic counseling must be done to consider genetic testing, and if it concludes that a patient is carrying a copy of TP53 mutations, the patient must be counseled about surveillance and continuously screened for LFS related types of cancer.

The decision to do genetic counseling and TP53 mutation testing should be considered for the following patients:

**Diagnostic Criteria**

**Classic Li-Fraumeni syndrome -**It is diagnosed when the person has all the following criteria:

- A sarcoma diagnosed before age 45.

- A first-degree relative, parent, sibling, or child with any cancer before age 45.

- Any cancer before age 45 or a sarcoma at any age in first-degree or second-degree relative (grandparent, aunt/uncle, niece/nephew, or grandchild).

**Chompret Criteria**

This includes brain tumor, adrenocortical cancer, breast cancer in the proband, and also has a lower age cutoff of <31 years. Consider a diagnosis of LFS for anyone with a personal and family history that meets one of the following three criteria.

- A tumor belonging to the LFS spectrum before the age of 46. This includes any of these diseases: premenopausal breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, osteosarcoma, adrenal cortical tumor, brain tumor, leukemia, lung cancer.**AND**

- At least one first- or second-degree relative with an LFS tumor before age 56 years or multiple tumors, except for breast cancer if the proband has breast cancer.

- A person with multiple tumors, except when two belong to the LFS tumor spectrum with the first occurring before age 46.

- A person who is diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinoma or choroid plexus tumor, irrespective of family history.

Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFL) is another term for families who do not meet the set classic criteria.

**LFL-1, Birch Definition**

- A person diagnosed with any brain tumor, adrenocortical tumor, sarcoma, breast cancer before age 45**AND**

- A typical LFS cancer in a first or second-degree relative at any age.**AND**

- A first-degree or second-degree relative with any cancer before age 60.

**LFL-2, ELES Criteria**

Two relatives (first-degree or second-degree) diagnosed with a typical LFS cancer at any age.

- Individuals who have either classical criteria for LFS or the Chompret criteria or who have other combinations of cancer and family history that put them at risk for LFS or LFL syndrome, but in whom there is no known mutation in the family. Negative test results do not rule out LFS and these patients should be managed as if they have LFS.

- Women with early-onset breast cancer (less than 31 years) and without a detectable breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1) or 2 (BRCA2) mutation. It increases the index of suspicion for Li-Fraumeni syndrome if there is a family history of sarcoma, brain tumor, or adrenocortical carcinoma. A negative result in these individuals does not rule out LFS.

- Patients with a family history of known TP53 mutation to test for the known mutation. A negative test in these individuals rules out LFS. Those who choose not to undergo testing should be managed as if they harbor the TP53 mutation, at least until 50 years of age.

Individuals with some cancers irrespective of age or family history should undergo genetic testing for TP53 deleterious gene mutations. These include a) adrenocortical carcinoma b) choroid plexus carcinoma at any age c) rhabdomyosarcoma before age three years d) osteosarcoma before age ten years e) childhood sarcoma (except Ewing sarcoma).

-  Consider prenatal testing for at-risk pregnancies in situations where a specific TP53 mutation has been identified.

**Cancer Surveillance**

Cancer surveillance is required for individuals who are at risk based on the history of LFS malignancy, the patient with known TP53 tumor mutation, or those with increased risk in a family with LFS but without an identifiable mutation or who have not undergone mutation testing.

- Complete annual physical examination and medical evaluation for unexplained symptoms

- Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI) annually

- Abdominal and pelvic ultrasound (US) every 3 to 4 months in children and annually in the adult

- Biochemical markers for adrenocortical functions

- Blood tests every 4 months (complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate)

- Breast cancer monitoring - breast self-examination monthly, biannual clinical breast examination with a healthcare provider, and annual breast imaging beginning at age 20 to 25 years (preferably MRI breast due to radiation exposure from mammography)

- Colonoscopy every 2 to 5 years, beginning at age 25 to 30 or 5 years before the earliest known colon cancer in the family

- Blood test for biochemical markers and brain MRI as per Toronto protocol
