**Neonatal Period**

In the neonatal period, the most characteristic finding is a high-pitched, monotonous cry, which usually disappears within the first few months of life. The cry is not limited to this syndrome alone and is known to accompany a few other neurological disorders. Newborns also exhibit low birthweight and microcephaly as well as asphyxia, muscle hypotonia, and impaired suction. These lead to impaired growth and development during the first few years of life. Reports exist of recurrent respiratory and intestinal infections.
