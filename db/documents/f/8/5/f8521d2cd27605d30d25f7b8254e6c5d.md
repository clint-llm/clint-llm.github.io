Neonates are at higher risk of conjunctivitis due to many predisposing factors, such as:

- Decreased tear production

- Lack of IgA in tears

- Decreased immune function

- Absence of lymphoid tissue in conjunctiva

- Decreased lysozyme activity

Risk factors include premature rupture of membranes, prolonged delivery, prematurity, poor prenatal care, maternal STI, mechanical ventilation, poor hygiene conditions, history of midwife interference, HIV-infected mother.

Neonates at higher risk of congenital lacrimal duct obstruction include those with Down syndrome, Goldenhar Syndrome, clefting syndromes, midline facial anomalies, hemifacial microsomia, and craniosynostosis.
