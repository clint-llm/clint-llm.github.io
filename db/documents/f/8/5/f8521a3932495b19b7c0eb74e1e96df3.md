Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) is unpredictable, with an unknown cause. Risk factors for the development of AFE are advanced maternal age, multiparity, male fetuses, and trauma. It has been found that the induction of labor increases the risk of AFE.

The introduction of amniotic fluid and fetal components into the maternal circulation has been shown to create intense pulmonary vasoconstriction and bronco constriction. These effects are considered to be caused not only by physical obstruction but also by the liberation of intense inflammatory cytokines reactant to the foreign material. These inflammatory mediators are also believed to trip the coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways, creating a form of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) syndrome.
