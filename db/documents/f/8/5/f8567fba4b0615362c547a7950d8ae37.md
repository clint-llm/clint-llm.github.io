Anisocoria is a condition characterized by unequal pupil size. The etiology of anisocoria is complex, ranging from benign to potentially life-threatening causes. Potential etiologies of anisocoria include systemic drug use, topical ophthalmic drug use, headaches, trauma, ophthalmologic diseases, and autonomic ganglion pathology. This activity examines when anisocoria should be considered on differential diagnosis and how to evaluate it properly and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of anisocoria.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with anisocoria.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for anisocoria.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by anisocoria.
