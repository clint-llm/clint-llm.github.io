Primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, internists, andÂ endocrinologists can all prescribe rosiglitazone. The drug is useful for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, healthcare workers, including the pharmacists, must warn the patient about the contraindications of this medication in patients with congestive heart failure with New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. Rosiglitazone causes exacerbation of congestive heart failure, and the pharmacist, nurse, and clinician work as a team to monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of heart failure. Discontinuation is the recommended course if symptoms appear. It is recommended to observe liver function tests in patients using this drug, given its potential hepatic damage.

Rosiglitazone requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, and mid-level practitioners), specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results and prevent complications. [Level 5]
