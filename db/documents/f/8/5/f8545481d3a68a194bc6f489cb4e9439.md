Patients diagnosed with Zellweger syndrome should have interprofessional care with a medical team comprising a metabolic disease specialist, neurology, ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology, and occupational and physical therapists with appropriate follow up arranged before hospital discharge. As ZS affects multiple organs, appropriate care would be possible by teamwork and collaboration among specialists from multiple disciplines. Additionally, the integration of palliative resources plays a key role in improving the quality of life for infants and parents. Genetic counseling is crucial for early diagnosis.
