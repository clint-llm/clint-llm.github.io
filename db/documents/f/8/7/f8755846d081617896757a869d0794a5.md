Estradiol is a hormone made naturally in the human body by the ovaries. It is crucial in regulating the menstrual cycle, cardiovascular system, neurologic system, skeletal system, vascular system, and many more.

When women enter menopause, estrogen synthesis significantly decreases due to lower-functioning ovaries. The decrease in estrogen is the reason most women have postmenopausal symptoms. Postmenopausal symptoms include, but are not limited to: hot flashes, vaginal dryness, vaginal itchiness, dysuria, and dyspareunia. These symptoms can be very discomforting to patients and affect the quality of life, sleep, mood, interpersonal relationships, daily activities, and sexual function. When the ovaries no longer synthesize estradiol, it can then get synthesized by several extragonadal sites.

Before women enter menopause, estradiol protects women from cardiovascular disease due to increased regulation of cholesterol and triglyceride metabolism, thus decreasing the risk for atherosclerotic heart disease.

The majority of studies find that postmenopausal symptoms experience significant improvement with the use of estradiol hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Also, research has shown that estradiol can decrease stress by reducing the release of cortisol in response to a physical stressor. Estradiol increases the amount of corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), thus reducing the free cortisol levels circulating in the body, responding to stress. Less cortisol can act on the body, including areas in the brain that are integral in the stress response.

Estrogen formulations have also served as an off-label treatment option for male-to-female transgender patients. However, the levels of blood estrogen levels require close monitoring to avoid complications of the treatment.

Estrogen has a significant role in bone health. Women in postmenopausal age develop osteoporosis due to decreased levels of estrogen. Estrogen-derived formulations such as raloxifene have received approval for osteoporosis prevention and treatment in a selected patient population.
