The significance and function of infection control are substantial. There are almost 2 million hospital-acquired infections annually, and of these, nearly 100,000 people die annually.

**The state law requires professionals to be familiar with the following elements of infection control in the healthcare setting:**

- Adhere to scientifically accepted principles and practices of infection control and monitor the performance of professionals for whom the health professional is responsible.

- Understand the modes and mechanisms of transmission of pathogenic organisms and strategies for control and prevention.

- Use engineering and work practice controls to reduce the opportunity for patient and worker exposure to potentially infectious material.

- The use and selection of barriers and/or personal protective equipment for preventing patient and healthcare worker contact with potentially infectious material.

- The creation and maintenance of a safe environment for patient care through the application of infection control practices and principles for cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization.

- The prevention and management of infectious or communicable diseases in healthcare workers.

- Sepsis awareness and education.

**Health professionals should take the New York statute seriously as the consequences are potentially severe:**

- Evidence of completion of training must be submitted to the State Department of Health or the Education Department.

- Health professionals with hospital privileges are required to present documentation of training to the hospital during the renewal of hospital privileges.

- Virtually all professionals, including physicians, physician assistants, and podiatrists (including students and residents), nurses, nurse practitioners, dentists, and dental hygienists, must complete and maintain training.

- Exemptions are available from the Department of Health if a health professional has completed equivalent course work or their practice does not require infection control or barrier precautions.

- The statute establishes minimum rules for compliance and consequences for non-compliance for facilities, which includes a possible citation, fine, and other disciplinary action.

- Employee or patient complaints concerning poor infection control practices may result in an investigation by the Department of Education or the Department of Health.

- Healthcare professionals who fail to use appropriate infection control techniques, are aware of violations, or are responsible for lax staff compliance and education may be charged with professional misconduct and receive disciplinary action.
