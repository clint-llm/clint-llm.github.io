Contraindications are for the most part relative and include, abnormal anatomy, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and need for current or future hemodialysis. Although coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia are relative contraindications, it may be prudent to choose a more compressible access site in patients with these conditions. The possible need for current or future hemodialysis access is also a relative contraindication as access to the subclavian vein may affect flow rates needed for hemodialysis (for more distal fistulas or grafts) on that side. A complete assessment of risks versus benefit should be undertaken prior to selection of a site for central venous access.
