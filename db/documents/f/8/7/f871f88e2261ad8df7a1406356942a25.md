Florid vascular proliferation (FVP) is a benign pseudo-neoplastic reactive proliferation of small vessels in the colon, which can mimic other benign or malignant vascular lesions. Clinically, FVP usually presents as a "mass" lesion and is associated with intussusception or colonic obstruction. An accurate diagnosis is only achievable by tissue biopsy with microscopic examination. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice, and no recurrence was reported postoperatively. This activity emphasizes the role of histopathologic examination for the accurate diagnosis, and the coordinated role of the health care team with pathologists for further patient management and treatment, as this is a benign disease but mimics the aggressive tumors with poor prognosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the typical target population for florid vascular proliferation (FVP).
-  Describe the clinical presentation of florid vascular proliferation.
- Review the steps for a definitive diagnosis of florid vascular proliferation (FVP).
- Summarize how communication and collaboration between health care practitioners and pathologists are necessary to avoid the misinterpretation or over-treatment of florid vascular proliferation as a malignant neoplasm.
