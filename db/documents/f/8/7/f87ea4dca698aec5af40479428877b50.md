The optimal treatment for diabetes associated with MODY varies on the gene mutation. Thus knowing the genetic subtype is important in understanding the treatment and prognosis in these patients.

In **MODY 2 (GCK)**, patients tend to have elevated fasting blood glucose but do not usually develop postprandial hyperglycemia as they have sufficient insulin secretion in response to elevated glucose. These patients generally need lifestyle and dietary modification alone.

For **MODY 3 (HNF1A) and MODY 1 (HNF4A),**patients can generally be managed with dietary changes alone in the beginning. These patients do experience postprandial hyperglycemia after carbohydrate-rich food.

Patients with **MODY 5 (HNF1B)**generally do not respond well to sulfonylureas. This may in part be explained by concurrent pancreatic hypoplasia in addition to a degree of hepatic insulin resistance.

In general, guidelines do not exist for many of the subtypes due to the paucity of cases and how rare they are.

**Management of MODY in the Youth**

In most countries, metformin and insulin are approved for use in the youth. Certain countries have approved the use of sulfonylureas in the adolescent population. Otherwise, no other category of oral antidiabetic agents has been approved in those less than 18 years of age.

**Management in Pregnancy**

As mentioned above, GCK MODY generally does not require treatment except during pregnancy. Determining which GCK MODY patients need treatment is determined by the fetal genotype. This is not genetically determined but assessed by the abdominal circumference of the fetus measured during the second trimester. Should this value exceed 75%, this infers that the fetus does not carry the GCK mutation, and thus these mothers should be treated with insulin during pregnancy to help prevent macrosomia. If the fetus has an abdominal circumference less than 75%, this infers the fetus does not carry the gene as they will have the same glucose setpoint as the mother, which is increased, and thus maternal hyperglycemia will be sensed by the fetus as normal and therefore growth will be normal and maternal treatment with insulin is not indicated, and it can even result in growth restriction.
