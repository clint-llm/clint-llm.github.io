The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) directly crosses the blood-brain barrier during the acute phase of infection. However, it is during the chronic inflammation phase that cognitive changes are seen. Monocytes, macrophages, and white matter are all affected in the brain.

- Low nadir CD4 count: Several studies have shown that the severity of HIV disease, which is extrapolated from a low nadir CD4 count, correlates with the risk of developing neurocognitive disorders.

- Advanced age: Although there is an increased prevalence of neurocognitive disorders in patients with HIV who are 50 years or older, it is unclear if this is due to a direct result of HIV infection versus advanced age itself.

- Coexistent cardiovascular disease and obesity: There is a higher risk of dementia in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and/or underlying cardiovascular disease and HIV infection when compared to the general population.

- Coinfection with hepatitis C: There is conflicting data regarding the risk of hepatitis C coinfection in patients with HIV when determining the risk of neurocognitive disorders. Some studies identify clear risk when both infections are present,

- History of toxoplasmosis: A prior history of toxoplasma infection has been associated with an increased risk of neurocognitive deficits, especially in patients with latent toxoplasma infections. This risk was observed independent of CD4 cell counts.

Interestingly, despite multiple studies attempting to identify genetic predisposition for the development of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, there is no evidence to support any particular mutation. A large multicenter trial evaluating more than 1200 patients did not detect an association between any polymorphisms and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders.
