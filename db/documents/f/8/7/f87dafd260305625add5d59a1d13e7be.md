In cardiac muscle, myocytes respond to action potential generated by the SA and AV node by contraction of the atria and ventricles, respectively. Abnormal cardiac myocyte function after myocardial infarction, for example, can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias. The contraction of skeletal muscle fibers is necessary for movement. Importantly, the diaphragm is made of skeletal muscle and is responsible for respiration. Smooth muscle cell contraction is involved in various organs, for example, the walls of the gastrointestinal tract, where smooth muscle contracts to propel food forward in a process called peristalsis. Contraction of vascular smooth muscle is responsible for helping to regulate blood pressure.
