Nucleus solitarius divides into two parts: rostral and caudal. Rostral nucleus solitarius or the gustatory nucleus form the recipient of taste inputs from cranial nerve VII transmitting taste inputs from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, cranial nerve IX transmitting taste signals from the posterior third of the tongue as well as cranial nerve X that tastes the epiglottis. The caudal nucleus plays a role in cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal system control through cranial nerves IX that conveys information from baroreceptors and chemoreceptors in the carotid body and cranial nerve X transmitting inputs from the aortic arch.

Nucleus solitarius controls respiration; it receives inputs pertaining to blood pH, blood oxygen levels, and stretch receptors that are present in the lungs, then it regulates respiratory circuits through its projections. Additionally, it mediates blood pressure and heart rate control effects through its efferents to parasympathetic and sympathetic complexes.

Nucleus solitarius participates in the reflexes of the nerves innervating the nucleus, so it mediates cough reflex, carotid sinus reflex, gag reflex, and vomiting reflex.

The carotid body detects changes in PaCO2 through chemoreceptors, and this information gets conveyed to the nucleus solitarius (NTS) glutamatergic neurons that will target rostral ventrolateral medulla and respiratory pattern generator, leading to increased sympathetic activity. Chemoreceptors modulate changes in autonomic activity in the cardiorespiratory system vai respiratory pattern generator.

Summarizing the functions of the nucleus solitarius:

- Receive taste inputs

- Receive inputs from chemoreceptors and baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid body

- Modulate response to hemostatic changes

- Participates in limbic system activity

- Participates in carotid reflex, gag reflex, cough reflex, and vomiting reflex
