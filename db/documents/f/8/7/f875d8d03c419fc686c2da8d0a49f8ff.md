CA 125 has found great importance as a tumor marker to evaluate patients with suspected ovarian cancer and monitor the disease. It is an important criterion per the guidelines for referring patients with an adnexal mass suspicious of malignancy to a gynecological oncologist. While it has a higher specificity when used amongst postmenopausal women, very high levels amongst premenopausal women indicate referral. It has also been seen that patient outcomes have been better upon being treated by a specialized gynecological oncologist and when done in a hospital with necessary consult services with multidisciplinary collaboration.

Interprofessional team care involves different disciplines, such as primary care physicians, gynecological oncologists, nurses, and pathologists. Each of them has an essential role in providing care for individuals with suspected ovarian cancer or monitoring the disease process in these patients and thus influencing their management. Clinicopathologic meetings involving a meeting between pathologists and clinicians are a suggested approach as a form of interprofessional care. It has been shown to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis, achieve accurate staging and grading of the disease, and thus improve the management of the patient. In addition to improving patient care, it provides a learning opportunity for the team members.

Nurses involved in the care of a patient with ovarian cancer have a unique position to provide information and education to the patient and her family about the disease. They may be able to identify patients needing psychological support and counseling and thus can help improve the quality of life for their patients by coordinating referrals with nutritionists, physiotherapists, and psychologists.
