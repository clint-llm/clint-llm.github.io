Ultrasound (US) is a valuable adjunct for procedural guidance when performing arthrocentesis, allowing the user to identify and aspirate joint effusions reliably. This article outlines the use of US guidance when performing arthrocentesis, highlighting its role with the interprofessional team when using this procedure for both its diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

**Objectives:**
- Review indications and contraindications for performing US-guided arthrocentesis.
- Describe the equipment and technique required for using the US as an adjunct.
- Identify relevant anatomical structures on US imaging.
- Outline proper probe placement and technique by the interprofessional team when evaluating for effusions.
