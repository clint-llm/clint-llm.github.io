The minor heat illnesses are benign and self-limited with no ongoing complications.Â For the more moderate heat illnesses, including heat exhaustion/stress and heat injury, complications are exacerbated by the patient's age, comorbidities, the presence of organ injury, or if severe electrolyte disturbances have occurred. These patients may benefit from admission to a tertiary care center for further stabilization before discharge. Predictive factors for hospitalization include the age of equal to or greater than 65 years, the level of temperature elevation, alterations in mental status, and elevations of creatinine from baseline.
