Kyphoscoliosis may be idiopathic and be noted in otherwise healthy individuals. In children, the finding may be mild and should be followed over time to assess for curve progression. Rather than considering a differential for kyphoscoliosis, it may be more beneficial to consider the underlying cause contributing to its presentation or the constellation of symptoms in which it presents. As mentioned above, skin changes may play a role in identifying concomitant conditions such as neurofibromatosis and myelomeningocele. Some other conditions that should be considered include:

- Osteoporosis

- Scheuermann disease

- Idiopathic kyphoscoliosis

- Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS)

- Infantile idiopathic scoliosis with kyphosis

- Age-related hyperkyphosis

- Vertebral fracture

- infection (such as by Echinococcus granulosus)

- Tumors

- Kniest dysplasia

- Friedreich ataxia
