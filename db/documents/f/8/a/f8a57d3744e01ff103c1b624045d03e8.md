Cockayne syndrome is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder. In about two-thirds of cases, it is due to the mutation of the ERCC6 gene, ERCC6 (10q11) conditions the production of a protein called CSB (for Cockayne syndrome B). The other gene ERCC8 (5q12.1) is responsible for the production of the protein CSA (for Cockayne syndrome A). Little is known about these proteins, but they play a vital role in the repair and "decoding" of DNA, which are normal processes and necessary for the proper functioning of cells.
