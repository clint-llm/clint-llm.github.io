There have been many different preparations utilized for the analysis of bone tissue containing osteoclasts. One preparation that can be utilized requires obtaining bone tissue, fixed in formalin for 24 hours, then decalcified using a strong acid (such as 5% nitric acid) for 48 hours. The bone tissue can then be placed into paraffin wax, and a routine hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) preparation can be done. H&E preparation is a common choice for the visualization of bone tissue. Additionally, if using immunohistochemistry, an indirect immunoperoxidase technique can be utilized for bone tissue.
