Identifying the various types of necrosis and the underlying cause of necrosis can help to target treatment for multiple diseases. Most of the time, identifying the cause of necrosis and treating it is more important than removing the dead tissue. In the case of myocardial infarction, we are aware that necrosis occurs due to hypoxia due to the occlusion of coronary vessels. Therefore treatment is targeted at opening the coronary vessels either by thrombolysis or PCI to restore blood supply.

An inflammatory response accompanies necrosis, so studying the effects of anti-inflammatory drugsÂ on necrosis suppression would be valuable.
