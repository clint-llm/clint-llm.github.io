Under normal resting conditions, the blood flowing through the brachial artery travels in a laminar (smooth) flow and will not be heard by a stethoscope. Once the sphygmomanometer is inflated, the brachial artery is compressed, and the flow becomes turbulent, enabling it to be heard by a stethoscope. It has been shown that using the bell-end piece of the stethoscope will give better sound reproduction; however, in clinical practice, the larger-diameter diaphragm is typically utilized as it is easier to secure with one hand and covers a larger surface area.

Korotkoff sounds are broken down into five phases, heard in sequential order upon deflating the blood pressure cuff.

- Phase I: clear tapping sounds heard for at least two consecutive beats - this is the systolic blood pressure

- Phase II: the softening of the tapping sounds and the addition of a swishing sound

- Phase III: the return of tapping sounds, as heard in phase I, but with an increase in sharpness and intensity

- Phase IV: the abrupt muffling of sounds, exhibiting a soft and blowing quality

-  The muffling of sounds is explained by increased resistance of the artery to collapse, caused by downstream engorgement of the veins.

- Phase V: the complete disappearance of all sounds - this is the diastolic blood pressure

The second and third Korotkoff sounds have no known clinical significance.

The phenomenon termed 'auscultatory gap' occurs in select patients, in which all sounds may disappear between phase II and phase III. In auscultation alone, this gap may not be detected and can lead to inaccurate blood pressure readings, such as underestimated systolic blood pressure and overestimated diastolic blood pressure. To prevent this auscultatory error, it is important to palpate the radial artery while the cuff pressure is increased to approximately 30 mmHg above the disappearance of the pulse. The cuff should then be deflated at a rate of 2 to 3 mmHg/second during auscultation.

In the pediatric population, there is some controversy as to whether the fourth or fifth Korotkoff sound should be used as an indicator of diastolic blood pressure. It is recommended to use the fifth Korotkoff sound, as in adults; however, if this sound is undetectable, one should use the fourth sound to indicate the diastolic blood pressure.

There are apparent differences in the Korotkoff phases between adults and children. The length of phases II and III increase with age with a concomitant decrease in phases I and IV. At present, these differences between adults and children remain unexplained.
