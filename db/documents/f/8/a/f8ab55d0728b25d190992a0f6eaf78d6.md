TTP is a rare disease; the exact prevalence is not clear. Studies cite incidences between 1 and 13 cases per million people depending on geographic location. TTP most often occurs after 40 years of age, but congenital forms can occur in children. TTP is more common in women with a 2:1 female to male predominance.
