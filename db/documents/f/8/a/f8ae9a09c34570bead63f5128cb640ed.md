In Salmonella typhi infection, intestinal necrosis occurs at the level of the Peyer's patches, thereby causing perforation of the distal ileum (in the antimesenteric bowel wall)most commonly, that occurs during the third week of febrile illness.

Intussusception most commonly occurs in infants, especially during the weaning period & also due to viral infection like adenovirus in early childhood. This presentation suggests that the exposure of the infant's gut to new pathogens causes the hypertrophy of the Peyer's patches at the lymphoid-rich terminal ileum, resulting in recurrent intussusception or intestinal obstruction.

Increased numbers of the Peyer's patches also correlate with the development of prions disease, with the M cells uptaking the orally invaded prions and the Peyer's patches acting as replicating centers of the prions.

However, Peyer's patches keep the intestinal flora at appropriate levels and the pathogens at bay, thereby****preventing a large number of infections.

As a part of the pathogenesis of food allergy, the Peyer's patches and vasculature of lamina propria allow the circulation of inflammatory cells to the immune structures.
