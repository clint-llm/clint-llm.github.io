The evaluation of suspected 17-hydroxylase should include:

- ACTH level will be elevated.

- Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in postpubertal patients will be elevated.

- ACTH stimulation test with adrenal hormone profile including 17-hydroxyprogesterone, cortisol, deoxycorticosterone, 17-hydroxypregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, and androstenedione to evaluate adrenal function and to identify the potential enzymatic defect.

- Aldosterone and plasma renin levels may be useful though levels vary across patients.

- Basic metabolic panel to evaluate for hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis.

- Karyotype may be useful in individual phenotypically female patients.

- Genetic testing may be useful to identify specific gene mutations.

- Imaging studies such as pelvic ultrasound to evaluate internal genitalia to establish if phenotypically female patients have female reproductive organs or potentially undescended testes in genotypic males.
