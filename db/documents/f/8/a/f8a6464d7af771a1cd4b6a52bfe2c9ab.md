Clinical manifestation of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) principally depends on the vascular territory affected. Family history may be positive for stroke and hypertension at a young age.

**Renal FMD**

Hypertension, specifically resistant hypertension, is the most common presentation of renal FMD. Other features of renal FMD include:

- Renal artery dissection

- Flank pain

- Hematuria

- Renal infarct

- Hypokalemia from secondary hyperaldosteronism also may be the presenting scenario, but ischemic nephropathy with renal failure is uncommon

- Abdominal bruit

**Cranio-cervical FMD**

Diagnosis of renal artery FMD should prompt screening for associated carotid artery lesions to prevent catastrophic complications. Cranio-cervical FMD may be asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging studies. Clinical manifestations include:

- Headache

- Pulsatile tinnitus

- Dizziness

- Cervical artery dissection

- Neck pain

- Stroke

- Horner syndrome

- Subarachnoid hemorrhage

- Carotid bruit

**Mesenteric FMD**

- Weight loss

- Fatigue

- Postprandial abdominal pain

- Epigastric bruit

**Subclavian FMD**

- Upper arm weakness

- Paresthesias

- Claudication

- Steal syndrome

**Lower Limb FMD**

- Claudication

- Cold legs

- Ischemic feet

**Coronary FMD**

- Chest pain

- Shortness of breath

- Acute coronary syndrome
