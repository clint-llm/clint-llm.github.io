Wellens syndrome represents a pre-infarction state of coronary artery disease. The risk factors for Wellens syndrome are therefore the same as those for coronary artery disease including dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, familial history, and smoking. The ECG pattern of Wellens syndrome is relatively common in patients who exhibit symptoms consistent with unstable angina. In studies performed by Dr. Wellens and colleagues, the ECG pattern was present in 14% to 18% of patients admitted for unstable angina.
