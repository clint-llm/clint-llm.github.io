Patients with suspected scapholunate dissociation should be placed in a thumb spica, radial gutter, or short arm volar splint. Referral to an orthopedist or hand surgeon is necessary, as closed reduction with percutaneous pinning or open reduction is required for treatment. The patient is placed in a short-arm cast postoperatively, and k-wires are removed in 8 to 10 weeks. Patients are unable to perform heavy lifting using the wrist for 4 to 6 months post-injury.

Immediate reduction is essential when a lunate or perilunate dislocation is present, toÂ relieve pressure on the median nerve and prevent further cartilage damage. These injuries require immediate orthopedic or hand surgery consultation for reduction and stabilization and frequently require arthroscopically guided reduction. Closed reduction is achieved using finger traps, with elbow at ninety-degrees of flexion. The hand is held in traction, while dorsal dislocations are reduced by wrist extension, traction, and finally wrist flexion. A sugar tong splint is then applied and followed up with surgical repair. There is frequently injury to all perilunate ligaments, requiring surgical stabilization. Without intervention, progressive instability may occur. A short arm cast is placed post-operatively for at least 6 weeks duration.
