Colposcopy is a diagnostic procedure done due to an abnormal cervical screening test or a visible lesion seen on the cervix during an exam. This diagnostic procedure assists with the formulation of a management plan based on the results of the biopsied pathology or lack of results. In general, all results can either be observed or treated and are based on evidence-based guidelines. Low-grade lesions can be followed up and managed according to ASCCP guideline algorithms. High-grade lesions are treated depending on the patientâ€™s age and fertility status.

A patient that is pregnant will have their treatment deferred until after delivery unless there is a specific concern for an invasive lesion. A colposcopy that is considered inadequate for a variety of reasons may lead to a more aggressive sampling of the cervical tissue with an excisional procedure of the cervix in order to attain the diagnosis. Invasive lesions should be referred to a gynecological oncologist for treatment options.
