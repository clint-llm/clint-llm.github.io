On pathological examination of autopsy specimens of cardiac sarcoidosis patients, gross findings include patchy fibrosis of myocardial tissue not consistent with ischemia from coronary artery disease.

The main histopathological finding that favors a diagnosis of CS on endomyocardial biopsy is noncaseating granulomas.Â Sarcoid granulomas measure in the range of a few millimeters and have well-defined margins. They are composed of macrophages, epithelial cells, and T lymphocytes.

Other microscopic findings that have been noted include micro-granulomas, confluent fibrosis, and fatty infiltration.
