Breast milk jaundice is a commonly encountered condition in the neonatal period. Addition of 5 ml of artificial baby milk (ABM) in every feed (minimum six feeds) for three days before initiation of breast milk will lower the neonatal bilirubin to safe levels; bilirubin levels tend to remain in a safe zone once normalized. Breastfeeding parents who receive this regimen should be counseled not to continue with ABM supplementation once bilirubin is normalized.

Another treatment regimen for breast milk jaundice includes a 10% solution of chicory distillate (50 ml every 12 hours) toÂ promote bilirubin normalization; a random controlled clinical trial showed this to be helpful.
