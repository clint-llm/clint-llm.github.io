The presentation of polio is highly variable, ranging from viral symptoms without paralysis to quadriplegia and even respiratory failure. Polio patients who present with only viral prodromes are likely to see complete resolution of symptoms. For those that experience acute paralysis, the degree of paralysis often remains static. Approximately 30% to 40% of polio patients will develop post-polio syndrome decades after the primary infection. This progression is multifactorial and depends on factors like severity of acute paralysis, age of onset, and even socioeconomic status.
