Hydranencephaly is a rare congenital abnormality in which the cerebral hemispheres are absent with the basal ganglia, brainstem and meninges preserved. It is commonly caused by infarction secondary to bilateral internal carotid artery obstruction. In some cases, patients appear normal at birth. This activity reviews the treatment and management of hydranencephaly and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hydranencephaly.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of hydranencephaly.
- Outline the management options available for hydranencephaly.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of patients with hydranencephaly and improve outcomes.
