Elbow dislocations are often a clinical presentation confirmed by radiographs. The patient's elbow, as well as surrounding bony structures, should be palpated to evaluate for any tenderness.

Chronic elbow dislocation is another differential.Â Chronic elbow dislocations are elbows that have remained dislocated for more than two weeks. It is essential to determine if there is a history of instability, previous attempts at reduction, or multiple episodes of dislocation. Ulnar neuropraxia in chronic dislocations occurs in 15% of patients. Due to this, fibrosis of the surrounding structures is common, and reduction is often difficult. Surgical intervention with open reduction is generally necessary due to extensive fibrosis and granulation tissue that can be present within the joint. Surgery often involves anterior and posterior capsule release and release of any surrounding fibrotic areas. Patients may also require triceps lengthening procedures or transposition of the ulnar nerve.
