Coronary artery disease (CAD) accounts for approximately 610,000 deaths annually (estimated 1 in 4 deaths) and is the leading cause of mortality in the United States.

The Framingham Heart Study enrolled its first participant in 1948 and is currently studying its third generation of participants.

Given the immense healthcare burden of CAD, modifiable, and non-modifiable risk factors were identified to mitigate the resulting economic and disease-related burden. Risk factor identification, combined with advances in medical technology, has contributed to a significant decrease in CAD mortality rates over the past forty years in western countries. One public health study that gathered mortality data from 1969 to 2014 concluded that by 2020, the number of heart disease-related deaths would decrease by 21.3 percent for men and 13.4 percent for women.

This article will review the impact and management of these risk factors. Ever since the Framingham Heart Study, there has been a plethora of data on coronary artery disease risk factors. This piece will provide a concise summary of the most recent systemic reviews and evidence.
