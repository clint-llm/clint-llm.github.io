Thoracic discogenic pain syndrome may be radicular or myelopathic pain. The radicular pain is mostly secondary to posterolateral herniations that compress spinal nerves as they exit through the intervertebral foramen. Radicular pain will usually radiate towards the dermatome of the nerve roots innervated by the exiting nerve. Myelopathic pain, on the other hand, is seen in central herniations. In this case, the herniated disc compresses the spinal cord, leading to sensory and/or motor problems in the corresponding compressed area and below. This is particularly more severe in the thoracic spinal cord since the spinal canal in this region is smaller compared to the cervical and lumbar region. Hence, a slight compression will lead to symptoms. The majority of the thoracic disc herniation goes through a calcification process. While this calcification also causes symptoms, in some cases, the adherence of this calcified herniated disc to the dura may erode it, leading to a cerebrospinal fluid leak and patients presenting with atypical symptoms like a headache, orthostatic hypotension, and intracranial hypotension, a critical condition that requires immediate medical attention
