Numerous conditions must be considered in the differential diagnosis of erythema annulare centrifugum. EAC must be differentiated from other annular erythematous lesions, particularly annular psoriasis and tinea corporis when there is associated scale. Additional entities to consider include annular urticarial, annular sarcoidosis, allergic urticarial eruption, cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia (pseudolymphoma), and mycosis fungoides. Other annular erythemas (such as erythema gyratum repens, erythema chronicum migrans, erythema marginatum, and erythema multiforme) are the most common entities that need to be differentiated from erythema annulare centrifugum. Patients with autoimmune diseases, including Sj√∂gren syndrome, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, and lupus erythematosus (subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, tumid lupus erythematosus) can also have erythematous arciform, annular, and polycyclic lesions.

Less commonly, cutaneous metastases from visceral malignancies, such as stomach (inflammatory signet ring or adenocarcinoma), ovary, primary tumors of the breast, or malignancy of unknown primary, can mimic erythema annulare centrifugum.
