The primary function of cardiac muscle is to pump blood into circulation through the generation of force. The mechanism behind each coordinated contraction involves the cardiac muscle and electrical impulses. These contractile functions of the heart require ATP,  which can be obtained through various substrates, including fatty acids, carbohydrates, proteins, and ketones. Aerobic production is the core utilization process; however, the heart may use anaerobic processes in a limited capacity.
