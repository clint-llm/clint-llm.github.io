Alteplase is a commonly used thrombolytic agent in hospital settings. However, healthcare professionals, including all clinicians who prescribe this agent as well as pharmacists and nurses that monitor dosing, must be aware of its potential complications. Nurses will often be tasked with administering the drug, so they should familiarize themselves with dosing to be aware of possible errors and can coordinate with the pharmacist on dosing and administration. The pharmacist should also perform medication reconciliation to preclude any drug-drug interactions. If the pharmacist or nurse encounters any concerns, they should contact the clinician on duty immediately. Besides bleeding, the drug may also cause allergic reactions. It is important to know the contraindications of this agent to avoid morbidity and mortality.
