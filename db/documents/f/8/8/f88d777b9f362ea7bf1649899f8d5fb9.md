Nitrates are a class of medications (not to be confused with the byproduct of nitrogen fertilizers) that cause vasodilation by donating nitric oxide (NO).

Nitrates were first discovered in 1847 as a treatment for chest pain.

The use of nitrates is indicated in the following cardiovascular diseases: angina pectoris, acute coronary syndrome, arterial hypertension, and heart failure.

The main types of nitrates are as followed

- Nitroglycerin (NTG) – angina pectoris (treatment/prophylaxis), acute coronary syndrome, heart failure, hypertension

- Isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) – chronic angina pectoris (treatment)

- Isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) – angina pectoris (treatment/prophylaxis)

- Pentaerythrityl tetranitrate (PETN) – Not commonly used in the United States

- Erythrityl tetranitrate (ETN) – Not commonly used in the United States
