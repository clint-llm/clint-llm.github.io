Patients with Poland syndrome usually present for cosmetic and aesthetic complaints and are usually asymptomatic.

The physical evaluation for Poland syndrome includes an assessment of the anterior chest wall and associated anatomic limb abnormalities.

Visual inspection and the physical examination of the ipsilateral limb is important because those limb anomalies are present in most cases, specifically syndactyly; hypoplastic metacarpals and phalangeal abnormalities of the index, middle, and ring fingers most commonly affected.
