Overall, pellagra is a clinical diagnosis and biochemical testing is rarely used. If needed, niacin deficiency can be assessed by two methods:

**Biochemical Assessment**

- This approach is not widely used. Measurement of urinary N-methylnicotinamide or erythrocyte NAD: NADP (ratio) can be obtained to evaluate the metabolic rate of niacin in the body. Thus, high levels reflect adequate intakes of this vitamin.

**Clinical A****ssessment**

- It is more widely used by assessing for diarrhea, glossitis, and dermatitis. The skin is assessed for hyperpigmentation, dryness and scaling, facial butterfly sign, and/or Casal’s collar (necklace) in sun-exposed areas. It is important to note that diarrhea and dementia may not always be present.
