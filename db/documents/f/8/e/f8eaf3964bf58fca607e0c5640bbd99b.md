The history and presentation of liposarcoma are based on the location of the tumor. The most common location for liposarcoma is in the extremities, followed by the retroperitoneum, and, least often, in the esophagus. Myxoid liposarcoma of the extremities presents as a deep mass in the lower extremity. Case reports of primary subcutaneous mass have been reported as well.

On physical examination, liposarcoma appears as a non-tender, palpable mass. Patients with retroperitoneal disease may present with diffuse abdominal distention.

The most common esophageal liposarcoma site is the upper esophagus, which explains most of the symptoms associated with this neoplasm. Patients usually present with progressive dysphagia and weight loss.
