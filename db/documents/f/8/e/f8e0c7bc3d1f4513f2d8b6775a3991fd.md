Pathophysiology of non-inflammatory arthritis is primarily mechanical but introduced cellular and biochemical processes will also change the normal slow cartilage remodeling process. There will be excess degeneration, less regeneration, and abnormal separation of the cartilage. Progressive cartilage loss, increased thickness of the subchondral plate, and cyst formation will happen. With time the cartilage gets thinner, looser, and weaker; bone will rub against bone causing remodeling of the bone and new bone formation at joint margins (osteophytes). Friction will cause mild inflammation.

Pathophysiology of inflammatory arthritis can be infectious, crystal-induced, reactive, or autoimmune. In collagen vascular etiologies, inflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies create an inflammation cascade and pannus formation which can invade the cartilage and bone, and damage them. This damage is more acute and severe, and absent immediate medical attention, joint destruction can progress quite rapidly.
