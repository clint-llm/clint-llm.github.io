Although its difficult to estimate the exact incidence of PBK, but the current reported rate of PBK in the USA is 0.1%. During the years 1978Â to 1982, various US FDA-approved studies showed the incidence of 0.06% of PBK after PCIOL implantation, 1.2% after anterior chamber lenses and 1.5% after iris fixated lenses.

The long-term reported incidence of PBK is 15%. The amount of endothelial cell loss during cataract surgery can also be correlated to PBK, which is estimated to be approximately 4.72% after extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), 4.21% after small incision cataract surgery (SICS), and 5.41% after phacoemulsification. There is no gender, sex, or racial predilection for PBK. The most common risk factor for PBK is Fuchs dystrophy which is 3 times more common in females. Old age is another important risk factor as the endothelial count reduces with age.
