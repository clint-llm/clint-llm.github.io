Most scapular fractures are managed effectively with closed treatment and medical management. In minimally displaced fractures, which account for more than 90% of scapular fractures, management is with short-term immobilization in a sling and swath.

Scapular fractures themselves are rarely surgical emergencies, except for cases with thoracic penetration or dislocation causing rupture of nearby vascular structures. Fractures with significant displacement can cause long-term morbidity and poor outcomes of the shoulder which would be strong candidates for surgical techniques. Therefore, all scapular fracture should undergo evaluation for operative treatment.

Surgery is always recommended if there is a relevant alteration to the following:

- Scapula suspensory systems (SSSC; C4 linkage), "Floating Shoulder"

- Open Fracture

- Position integrity of the glenoid

- Lateral column displacement is present

Indications for open reduction and internal fixation are based on locations of fracture, displacement, angulation, and articular step-off.

Intraarticular surgical indications:

- Articular step-off >5mm

- Associated glenohumeral instability

- Anterior rim fracture (>25% articular surface)

- Posterior rim fractures (>33% articular surface)

Extraarticular body and neck fractures surgical indications:

- Angular deformity (>40 degrees angulation)

- Lateral border offset (>15mm plus angular deformity >35 degrees)

- Lateral border offset (>20mm)

- Glenopolar angle (<22 degrees) on true Grashay AP

However, since scapular fractures are often associated with other high-energy trauma, any operative management of scapular fracture should be delayed until the patient is stable.
