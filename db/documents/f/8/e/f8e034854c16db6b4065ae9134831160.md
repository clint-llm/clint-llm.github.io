The male to female infection frequency is 2 to 1. However, a female predominance of infection is seen in those between the ages of 5 and 14 years. It most commonly affects children younger than 18 years of age. It is also commonly seen in adults who take care of children and institutionalized children. Center for Disease Control and Prevention data indicates that there are about 40 million people estimated to have been infected in the United States. Transmission can occur via contact with contaminated clothes, bedding, personal care products, and furniture. Fecal-oral is the most common mode of transmission. Rarely, transmission can occur via inhalation mode when eggs are inhaled and then subsequently swallowed.
