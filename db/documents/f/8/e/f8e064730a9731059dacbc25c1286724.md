History findings can be occult and nonspecific for the identification of PACs. Many patients are asymptomatic, and PACs are often discovered incidentally during the workup for another disease or on routine examinations. In patients who do experience symptoms, most commonly, a skipping sensation or palpitations are noted. The patient may experience shortness of breath or anxiety, as well. If the PACs are consistent, however, patients may experience signs and symptoms of heart failure.

Physical exam findings are also indiscriminate and lack sensitivity and specificity. The major contributor to this obscurity is the intermittent nature of PACs. When present, a clinician may palpate irregular pulses or visualize a canon a wave with jugular venous mapping. Auscultation may reveal early or additional heart sounds, as well as pauses in rhythm.
