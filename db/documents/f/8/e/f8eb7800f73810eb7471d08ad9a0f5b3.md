The obturator nerve is at risk of injury during surgeries that require pelvic dissection and access. In the case of repair of pelvic organ prolapse, the obturator nerve and ureter are particularly at risk of injury,Â regardless of the surgical approach. The obturator nerve may also suffer an injury during laparoscopic pelvic procedures, such as laparoscopic lymphadenectomy. Furthermore, the obturator nerve can get injured in transvaginal mid-urethral sling placements.

The obturator nerve has particular utility in transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), which is common in the treatment of bladder wall masses. Because of the obturator nerve's proximity to the inferolateral wall of the bladder, bladder neck, and prostatic urethra, electrical stimulation caused by tumor resection may cause sudden adductor contraction or "adductor jerk." This sudden thigh movement may cause perforation of the bladder and extravesical seeding of the tumor. Additionally, the adductor jerk may result in damage to the obturator artery. By performing an obturator nerve block with a local anesthetic, the adductor jerk can be eliminated and enable a safe and effective TURBT.
