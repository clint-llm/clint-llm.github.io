Oseltamivir is appropriate for treating acute, uncomplicated influenza A or B illness in adults and pediatric patients, including neonates greater than two weeks of age. Neonates under two weeks of age may also receive oseltamivir to treat influenza, but safety and efficacy in this population have not been established. Nevertheless, multiple national advisory bodies have endorsed using oseltamivir as soon as possible (ideally less than 48 hours after symptom onset) for patients hospitalized with influenza or significant comorbidities, making them at high risk for complications. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of oseltamivir so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes to combat influenza and related viral infections.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of oseltamivir.
- Identify the indications for using oseltamivir.
- Summarize the effectiveness of using oseltamivir in influenza infections.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients who can benefit from therapy with oseltamivir.
