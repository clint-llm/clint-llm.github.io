**Absolute Contraindications**

- Surgically resectable tumors and/or favorable transplantation status (if the tumors are deemed operable and/or the patient is a good candidate for transplantation, these methods of treatments should be pursued as they currently provide the best outcomes)

- Vascular invasion by the tumor(s)

- Tumor location of less than 1 cm from the main biliary duct (at this distance, bile ducts are at risk of injury when not protected simultaneously with intraductal cooling. Abscess formation, biliary stenosis, and biliary obstruction occur more frequently when bile ducts are within the area of thermally induced necrosis)

- Intrahepatic biliary tree dilatation

- Exophytic tumor location (due to the risk of tumor seeding)

- Uncorrectable coagulopathy

**Relative Contraindications**

- Extrahepatic metastases (treatment of liver tumors may be attempted if successful treatment of extrahepatic metastasis is felt to be achievable)

- Bilioenteric anastomosis (due to potential infection; antibiotic prophylaxis may aid in prevention)

- Superficial/subcapsular lesions, especially adjacent to any portion of the gastrointestinal tract or gallbladder (risk of thermal injury of the gastric/bowel wall or iatrogenic cholecystitis; open approach preferred)

- Child-Pugh class C cirrhosis or decompensated liver disease

- Tumors difficult to reach with electrodes or when electrode placement is impaired (In these cases, an open approach is preferred)

- Single tumor greater than 5 cm in diameter or multiple lesions each greater than 3 cm in diameter (RFA may be utilized in larger hepatic tumors with the purpose of debulking the lesion prior to chemotherapy or for pain relief as opposed to definitive treatment)

- More than 3 tumors (treatment of more lesions may be attempted if successful treatment is felt to be achievable)

- Tumors immediately adjacent to hepatic vasculature (flowing blood usually protects the vascular wall from thermal injury but decreases procedure efficacy due to heat loss by convection)
