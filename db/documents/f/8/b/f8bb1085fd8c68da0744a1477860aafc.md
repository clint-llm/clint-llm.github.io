Lemierre syndrome (LS) is named after the French physician, Andre Lemierre, who in 1936 reported 20 cases of anaerobic septicemia originating from oropharyngeal infections. It is a rare complication of bacterial pharyngitis/tonsillitis and involves an extension of the infection into the lateral pharyngeal spaces of the neck with subsequent septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein(s). It is associated with anaerobic septicemia and death in young, healthy patients. Due to the high frequency of benign oropharyngeal infections in this population, the diagnosis of LS is often elusive on initial presentation. ThisÂ can result in treatment delays.
