The gallbladder and cystic duct receive innervation from the following three nerves: 1) the right phrenic nerve conveys sensory information, 2) the hepatic branch of the right vagus nerve provides parasympathetic innervation, and 3) the celiac plexus provides sympathetic information. Gastric surgeries such as resections or bariatric procedures, or vagotomies done for peptic ulcer disease will de-innervate the gallbladder and cause dysfunctioning of the organ. This will, in turn, lead to the formation of gallstones and cholecystitis. Many times when such surgeries are performed, prophylactic cholecystectomies are done simultaneously to prevent cholecystitis.
