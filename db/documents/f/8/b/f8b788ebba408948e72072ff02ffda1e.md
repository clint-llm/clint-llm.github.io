The procedure should start with a bimanual examination to assess the adnexa, cervix for cervical motion tenderness, uterus including uterine position, and for cul-de-sac mass or tenderness. Then a speculum exam should be performed by lubricating a speculum and inserting it into the vagina. Foerster sponge forceps should be used to introduce iodine soaked gauze to cleanse the cervix and posterior fornix.

Apply a tenaculum or Vulsellum forceps to the lower lip of the cervix, be sure to warn patients about potential cramps during this part of the procedure. Move the tenaculum to expose the posterior fornix of the vagina. Usually, this involves moving the cervix forward and anterior. Anesthetize the mucosa about 1 cm below the posterior rim of the cervix with lidocaine. Use an 18 gauge 10 cm long needle attached to a 10 mL syringe with 2 to 3 mL of air or sterile saline and insert the needle tip 1 cm below where the cervix ends in the posterior fornix. Advance the needle 3 to 4 cm and inject the air or saline. If there is resistance when injecting the air or saline, reposition the needle until there is no resistance felt. The needle should enter the Pouch of Douglas (rectouterine pouch or cul-de-sac). Aiming the needle towards the sacrum and away from the uterus may help with positioning. Lastly, attempt to aspirate. The procedure should be stopped if three attempts produce no fluid return.
