Clinicians frequently manage nausea and vomiting with the use of selective serotonin receptor (5-HT3) antagonists. BecauseÂ these two symptoms are very common for patients, all healthcare professionals need to be familiar with these medications. Consequently, an interprofessional team approach is the most effective means to use these medications effectively.

The clinician (MD, DO, NP, PA) will order or prescribe these agents. It would be advantageous to include a pharmacist in the decision process, as they can perform medication reconciliation, verify dosing, and even suggest the optimal agent in class. Nurses will administer these drugs to inpatients and provide counsel on home administration to outpatients and monitor treatment effectiveness over time. These examples of interprofessional teamwork demonstrate how this approach leads to better healthcare outcomes for patients [Level 5]
