Lower limb development occurs due to interactions between the lateral plate mesoderm and outer ectoderm. Multiple signaling pathways exist as part of this development. The exact pathogenesis of the development of TEV has not been found to date. The lack of evidence may be due to variations in genetic codes associated with limb and muscle development, environmental exposure to smoking, and family history of TEV, among other potential risk factors. Ultimately, the characteristic finding of TEV is forefoot adduction, hindfoot varus, midfoot cavus, and hindfoot equinus.
