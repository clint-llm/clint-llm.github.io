The diagnosis of biotinidase deficiency is made by newborn screening or testing patients with disease symptoms. Enzyme activity is measurable in serum/plasma. When enzyme levels are abnormal, genetic testing can be performed to evaluate for BTD mutations.

Laboratory tests may show high levels of lactic acid and ammonia within the blood or urine. Other tests to be done when biotinidase deficiency is suspected in a patient include arterial blood gas, serum amino acids, serum chemistries, etc. Urine tests may consist of urinary ketones and urinary organic acids.

Brain MRI imaging usually shows cerebral edema, bilateral compensatory ventriculomegaly, and delayed myelination in those who are untreated and in acute crisis.in vivo. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan demonstrates changes in cerebral metabolic activity before and after biotin administration. Computerized tomography (CT) scanning may reveal bilateral basal ganglia calcifications that could be skipped on an MRI scan.

Biotinidase deficiency should be ruled out in recurrent fungal, viral, and skin infections.
