A recent study has shown that the muscles subjected to stretching have a higher threshold of activation of the myotatic reflex. Furthermore, the contralateral muscle also undergoes the same adaptation.

From recent research on an animal model, there seems to be a close relationship between nociceptive afferent pathways, the monosynaptic reflex, and serotonin. The latter would induce a reduction in the reflex muscle response indirectly by acting on the C-fibers.
