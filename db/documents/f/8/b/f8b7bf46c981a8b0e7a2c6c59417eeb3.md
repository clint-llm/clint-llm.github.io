Patients often will report seeing floaters, bubbles, bugs, cobwebs, or dark spots that move during eye movement that are most common with dim illumination and the temporal visual field. The displaced vitreous during eye movement scatters incoming light and casts a shadow on the retina that the patient perceives as a grey structure, such as hair, bugs, or webs. Photopsias also are reported due to the stimulation of the retina from vitreoretinal traction and pulling.

The work-up should include distinguishing retinal photopsia from visual changes associated with migraines, which can be associated with new floaters. Important questions to consider should include: How long have these symptoms been occurring? Have these previously happened before now? Have there been recent eye surgeries? Does the family have a history of retinal detachment?

A slit lamp exam is needed to examine the anterior vitreous for pigmented cells (Shaffer sign), and indirect ophthalmoscopy with scleral indentation can rule out a retinal tear or break. Visualization of the PVD at the slit lamp with a 90-diopter lens can be done by identifying a gray-black strand floating in the vitreous. It can help to have the patient look up, down, and straight ahead to locate the floater. Shaffer's sign and vitreous hemorrhage increase the likelihood of a retina tear over a posterior vitreous detachment.
