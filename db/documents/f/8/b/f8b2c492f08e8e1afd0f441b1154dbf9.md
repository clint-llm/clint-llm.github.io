As toxicity is common with mexiletine, the entire interprofessional healthcare team, including nurses, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physicianÂ assistants, and clinicians, should work together to monitor the patient for toxic effects that can manifest across several organ systems. Before initiating therapy, the clinician (MD, DO, PA, NP) should consult with a pharmacist, checking for contraindications, drug interactions, and verifying dosing. Nurses will be instrumental in follow-up care, counseling patients on dosing and administration, answering patient questions, and monitoring for adverse events, alerting the prescriber of any potential issues they encounter. For the best patient outcome, regular follow-up and a reporting structure should be in place so that the interprofessional healthcare team works in a coordinated fashion to provide the best patient outcome.
