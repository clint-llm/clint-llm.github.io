Complications related to goniometry are limited and mainly due to faulty techniques. They are as follows:

- The error of measurement - inaccurate measurements due to faulty technique can have a drastic effect on the patient's treatment.

- Iatrogenic injuries

Forceful joint range of motion during goniometry may cause an iatrogenic fracture in weak osteoporotic bones.
