The structural architecture of the retina constitutes ten layers comprising various cell-types and synaptic connections involved in visual processing. The inner retina includes nerve fiber layer axons, ganglion cells as well as their dendritic synaptic connections, and amacrine cells. The outer retina consists of the rod and cone photoreceptors, which transmit visual information to second-order neurons known as bipolar cells in the central retina.Â Following the transduction of visual information (phototransduction) from the outer retina, the inner retinal ganglion cells then transmit this electrical information to the brain via the optic nerve for visual information processing.
