For many with rigidly fixed fractures or minimally displaced fractures, passive range of motion (ROM) exercises to start a few days after surgery.  Close radiographic follow up is indicated over several weeks to ensure there is no displacement and to ensure the fracture is healing appropriately.  Arthroscopic approach with rigid fixation has the least restriction in ROM, while the anterior and posterior approaches have more restriction in the abduction and rotation, and a brace is often used to limit terminal/provocative ROM which stresses the joint in various instability planes.
