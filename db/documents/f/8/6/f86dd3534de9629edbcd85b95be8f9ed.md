There is a group of metabolic diseases in which the body experiences chronic hyperglycemia. Type 1, insulin-dependent, diabetes mellitus is a condition in which the pancreas has low or absent insulin production. Type 2, insulin-independent, diabetes mellitus (DM) is a condition in which the body produces insulin, but it is not enough to effectively keep up with its glucose metabolic demands. This supply and demand mismatch leads to insulin resistance and abnormal glucose metabolism. In both type 1 and type 2 DM, glucose remains elevated in the bloodstream because its proper transport into cells and metabolism is not occurring normally. Type 2 DM has reached epidemic standards within the United States. This is of significant concern due to the vast complications caused by DM. These include neuropathy, renal failure, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease.

During the early stage of type 2 DM development, although the body experiences high blood glucose levels, the pancreatic beta cells produce enough insulin to maintain euglycemia. Insulin production becomes ineffective for adequate glucose metabolism when part of the insulin-mediated glucose uptake cascade is dysfunctional. Specifically, glucose transport across the plasma membrane via GLUT-4 transporters becomes impaired, causing insulin resistance to glycogenesis in muscle cells. GLUT-4 transporter impairment may occur either due to persistent hyperglycemia or may have been inherently present.
