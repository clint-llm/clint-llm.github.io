Diagnosing labyrinthine fistulas can be difficult. Diagnostic criteria are not well established. There are criteria suggested by the Intractable Hearing Loss Research Committee of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (revised 2016).

- Symptoms - Tinnitus, aural fullness, hearing impairment, and vestibular symptoms that are associated with pre-existing or coexisting middle ear or inner ear disease/surgery

- Lab findings - Biochemical tests, microscopic/endoscopic inspection

- References - Cochlin-tomoprotein detection test, beta2 transferrin, idiopathic

- Differential diagnosis - other known causes of inner ear diseases

- Definite diagnosis - Perilymph-specific protein detection, explorative tympanotomy (ET)

A complete assessment of auditory acuity, including auditory brainstem response (ABR), emission testing, and pure tone audiometry should be done to assess hearing loss.
