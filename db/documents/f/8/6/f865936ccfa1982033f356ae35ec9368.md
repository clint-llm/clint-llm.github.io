Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that leads to the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. There is heterogeneity in the metabolic, genetic, and immunogenetic characteristics of T1D and age-related differences, requiring a personalized approach for each individual. Loss of insulin secretion can occur quickly or gradually. Residual insulin production (detectable/higher c-peptide) is more common in adult-onset compared to youth-onset T1D,Â whereas diabetic ketoacidosis is more common in youth with T1D.

Successful management of T1D requires multiple daily insulin injections (MDI), insulin pump therapy, or the use of an automated insulin delivery system, as well as glucose monitoring, preferably with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). All people with T1D should be able to perform capillary blood glucose monitoring (BGM) if CGM is unavailable. Self-management education, training, and support, as well as addressing psychosocial issues, help to optimize outcomes. A collaborative multidisciplinary approach, utilizing medical providers, nurse and dietitian educators, pharmacists, community resources, and specialists as needed (including podiatrists, mental health professionals, social workers, ophthalmologists, cardiologists, and others), is recommended.
