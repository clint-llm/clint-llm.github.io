History may explain the appearance of striae by association with stretched skin, for example, in pregnancy, pubertal growth spurt, muscular exercise, or weight gain. Inquire about topical application of potent corticosteroid or prolonged systemic steroids during the recent or remote past. If striae are widespread and none of these explanations are relevant, take a full medical history and conduct a thorough clinical examination.

The initial striae rubrae are slightly raised pink or violaceous linear marks (striae rubrae), which fade over months to years to hypopigmented, atrophic, wrinkled scars (striae albae). TheÂ marks are perpendicular to the direction of skin tension. They fade with time. In pregnancy, they occur on the abdomen, breasts, and thighs. In adolescents, they are common on thighs, buttocks, breasts (females) and back (males).

Striae rubrae are sometimes pruritic. Otherwise, striae are asymptomatic. Treatment is sought because of their unsightly appearance.
