While there is no specific approach for assessing histological changes associated with colitis, the histological pattern approach described by Jessurun seems to be practical and the current recommendation. The patterns include (1) acute colitis associated with colonic infections and drug-induced injuries, inflammation may be patchy or diffuse, and mixed inflammatory cells and abundant neutrophils are usually present (2) focal active colitis, mostly seen in drug-induced injuries, but maybe a manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease especially Crohn disease. (3) Pseudomembranous colitis pattern associated with C. difficileÂ infection, although it can result from other infections such as Shigella, drugs, and radiation injury, (4) hemorrhagic colitis is associated with the entero-hemorrhagic strain of E. coli 0157: H7. The lamina propria appears hemorrhagic and edematous. Fibrin thrombi are present within capillaries, and crypts show ischemic injury, and (5) ischemic colitis associated with acute ischemic colitis. The extent of mucosal injury determines the clinical presentation; however, colonoscopy and biopsies are seldom necessary for patients presenting with acute abdomen due to embolic occlusion, or intestinal obstruction.
