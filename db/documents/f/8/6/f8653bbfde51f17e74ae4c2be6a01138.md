- Follicular adenomas are common and usually present as solitary thyroid nodules.
- Fine needle aspiration cytology cannot differentiate between a follicular adenoma or carcinoma. A definitive diagnosis is by a tissue biopsy specimen.
- A lobectomy and isthmusectomy are adequate for such lesions. Rarely, if other comorbidities are present, a total thyroidectomy may be necessary.
- An interdisciplinary team approach between the surgeon, the pathologist, the radiologist must perform to optimize patient outcomes.
