The bones of the thumb consist of one metacarpal bone and two phalanxes (proximal and distal, respectively). This anatomy varies in comparison to the other fingers which have three phalanxes (proximal, middle, and distal). Other bony constituents of the thumb are sesamoid bones which can be found in the other fingers. The unique function of the thumb is attributed to two movements:  opposition and apposition. Additionally, at the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, the thumb can flex, extend, abduct, and adduct.

Trigger thumb is a simple term for stenosing flexor tenosynovitis of the thumb. This is a narrowing of the flexor tendon sheath which causes a clicking or popping sensation on attempted extension of the thumb. Flexion is normally enabled by the extrinsic flexor pollicis longus (FPL) and intrinsic flexor pollicis brevis (FPB). The FPL tendon runs in its tendon sheath through three pulleys (A1, oblique, and A2) located proximal to distal. The A1 pulley is located distally on the metacarpal bone overlapping the MCP joint and the base of the proximal phalanx. Trigger thumb is most commonly due to thickening of the A1 pulley which causes pain and decreased function.
