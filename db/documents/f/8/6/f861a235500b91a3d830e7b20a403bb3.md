The prognosis in most patients infected with the POW virus, who have asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic disease, is thought to be excellent, and asymptomatic infection often goes completely unrecognized. However, a subset of patients progress and will go on to develop neuroinvasive disease, which typically presents as encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. Among these neuroinvasive cases, the mortality rate is high and estimated at 10% to 15%.
