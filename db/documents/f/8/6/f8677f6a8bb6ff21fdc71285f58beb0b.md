Despite being one of the first discovered genetic disorders that are supposed to follow Mendelian law, to date, there is no effective treatment for AKU. Therefore, the management of alkaptonuria remains palliative, which includes pain control, physiotherapy, and joints surgery. Additionally, the main focus of the treatment is to reduce the deposition of HGA.

**Ascorbic acid(Vit-C)**

Commonly recommended therapy involves ascorbic acid, which known as vitamin C due to the effect on reducing the conversion of homogentisic acid to benzoquinone acetic acid by oxidation. However, it does not affect the urinary excretion of homogentisic acid.

**Low Protein Diet**

A low protein diet can reduce tyrosine load and reduce the severity of the disease, but compliance with dietary requirements is not easy. Efficacy is unproven.

**Disease-modifying Agents**

Many studies have suggested that nitisinone, a triketone herbicide has a significant impact on the treatment of AKU. The enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyrvute dioxygenase believed to play a role in converting the hydroxyphenylpyruvate to HGA. Therefore, nitisinone inhibits the conversion of tyrosine to homogentisic acid. Also, nitisinone therapy(2 mg/day )has shown to produce a reduction in urinary and plasma HGA larger than 95% hence, increase the levels of tyrosine in the body. Other serious side effects associated with raised plasma tyrosine levels rather than corneal irritation include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and porphyria.
