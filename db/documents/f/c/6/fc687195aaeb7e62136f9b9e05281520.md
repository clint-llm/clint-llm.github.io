Patients require assessment for bleeding and hypersensitivity reactions.

Neurological status and blood pressure require monitoring during intravenous therapy. Laboratory parameters to follow include hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time. If serious bleeding occurs, stop the alteplase therapy and provide supportive care.

If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, stop the alteplase and provide supportive therapy such as antihistamines and corticosteroids.

Coagulation tests may be unreliable during alteplase therapy because alteplase may degrade fibrinogen in blood samples.
