A myriad of intrinsic and extrinsic factors contribute to the formation of varicose veins, including age, gender, pregnancy, obesity, height, race, diet, occupation, history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and genetics. The primary pathologies related to varicose veins are; 1) elevated venous pressure in the extremities and 2) defective or incompetent valves resulting in reflux and, thus, elevated venous pressure in the extremity. Whether venous hypertension and valvular incompetence occur before the irreversible alterations of venous wall development or the reverse is still inconclusive.

Incompetent venous valves result in the backward transmission of the pressure gradient. The pressure gradient would be transmitted from the deep to the superficial venous system via the saphenofemoral junction (SFJ) and perforator veins. The most common site for the incompetent venous valve is the below-knee great saphenous vein.

A limited number of genetic disorders have been correlated with varicose veins disease. Accordingly, the correlation between Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome and varicose vein disease has been well established.FOXC2, thrombomodulin (THBD), and desmuslin (SYNM) may alter vein function and impose the risk of varicose vein development.
