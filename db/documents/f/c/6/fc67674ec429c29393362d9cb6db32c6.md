The most important management in prediabetes is a lifestyle change and promotion of intense weight loss. Reducing weight by 7% through a low-fat diet, in addition to an exercise regimen of about 30 minutes per day, is the overall goal of management.

Approximately 70% of people with prediabetes will go on to be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. However, this is not inevitable. Prediabetes managed appropriately can prevent diabetes mellitus and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Some patients will need to take some medications. These patients include those that have failed to maintain adequate lifestyle therapy or are at high-risk for developing type 2 diabetes. The most common medications used for prediabetes are metformin and acarbose, which will help prevent the development of diabetes mellitus. These two drugs have minimal side effects and work well in prediabetic patients.
