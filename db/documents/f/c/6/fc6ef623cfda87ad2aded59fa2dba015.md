Success with the lens depends largely on accurate preoperative evaluation, which determines the vaulting in case of a PCIOL and sizing in case of an ACIOL.

Refractive outcomes are good, and with optimum calculations, these IOLs can effectively correct myopia of up to 20 dioptres (D) with good results.

Studies have shown PIOLs to have good postoperative visual outcomes such as a mean postoperative uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of better than 20/40 in the majority of patients.
