During human embryonic development, usually 38 to 39 somites arise from paired paraxial mesoderm masses on either side of the neural tube during Carnegie Stages (CS) 9 to 13.

The somites are the basis of the segmentation of the human body and produce the sclerotomes, dermatomes, myotomes, and syndetomes. The sclerotome produces segmental bony elements that develop adjacent to the notochord and result in the somites directing cellular migration of neural crest cells and spinal nerve axons and following the consequent development of the dermatome and myotome.
