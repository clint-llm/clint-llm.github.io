Pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum are the most common chest deformities in young patients. These lesions affect the patient psychosocially and physiologically; chiefly because the deformity is cosmetic. Besides, some of these patients may also experience difficulty with respiration. Surgical correction is done when necessary; to avoid complications affecting the heart and lungs.
