First-dose hypotension is an uncommon adverse effect of ACE inhibitors that clinicians should consider when prescribing lisinopril. Thus a low starting dose is recommended to reduce the risk of this phenomenon.

Monitor serum potassium, blood pressure, and blood urea nitrogen/serum creatinine in patients taking lisinopril after 2 to 3 weeks of initiation.

Caution is necessary when prescribing lisinopril in patients with high potassium diets or among people taking other agents that might exacerbate hypotension and hyperkalemia, such as antihypertensive agents or aldosterone antagonists.

Although cholestatic jaundice is a rare reaction associated with using the ACE inhibitor captopril, monitoring liver function during lisinopril use may be appropriate with timely discontinuation if testing detects the elevation of liver enzymes.
