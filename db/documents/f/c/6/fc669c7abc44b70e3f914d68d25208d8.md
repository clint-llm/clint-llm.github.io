The risk of POVL has consistently been shown to be highest during cardiac and spine surgery. However, it can occur in non-spine orthopedic surgeries and abdominal surgery, among others.

Ischemic optic neuropathy (ION) is the most common subtype of POVL for prone spine surgery, the estimates of which range from (0.017%) to (0.1%).Â Statistically significant risk factors other than patient-related characteristics associated with ischemic optic neuropathy following prone spine surgery include use of the Wilson frame, anesthesia duration (as a surrogate for the surgical duration), estimated blood loss, and a lower ratio of colloid to crystalloid in administered non-blood perioperative fluid.
