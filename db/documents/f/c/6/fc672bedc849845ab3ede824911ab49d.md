Functions of the tear film include providing lubrication to the ocular surface and eyelid, antimicrobial defense, providing a smooth ocular surface for refraction, and supplying oxygen and nutrition to the avascular corneal epithelium.

The tear film forms a protective barrier between the ocular surface and the external environment, and it contains antimicrobial properties. Key antimicrobial factors found in the tear film include lysozyme, lactoferrin, transferrin, ceruloplasmin, IgA, IgG, IgE, complement, glycoprotein, and anti-proteinase, which are found in the aqueous layer of the tear film.

Lysozyme is bacteriolytic, hydrolyzing bacterial peptidoglycan cell walls. It is highest in concentration in tears compared to other bodily fluids.

Mucins and glycoproteins secreted by goblet cells also play a role in ocular defense by having decoy receptors for bacteria, thus preventing attachment to ocular tissue, as well as entrapping bacteria or foreign bodies.
