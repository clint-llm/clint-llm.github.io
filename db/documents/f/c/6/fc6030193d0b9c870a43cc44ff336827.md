PCFCL is a rare disease with a good prognosis, but it can often be confused with other types of lymphoma involving the skin, which may worsen the prognosis. Although lesions typically progress slowly over time, a full clinical evaluation is essential so a systemic or more aggressive process, such asÂ  PCDLBCL-LT, can be ruled out. Untreated lesions can be locally aggressive in some cases, and lesions on the legs have been noted to behave more aggressively (than head, neck, or trunk).
