**Clinical Negligence Leading to Malpractice**

- Underestimating the potential for sudden airway compromise and respiratory arrest

- Failure to send the patient to a monitored room or inadequate monitoring

- Failure to have a tracheostomy set at the bedside

- Rushing to intubate the patient without having a support team that includes an ear, nose, and throat surgeon or anesthesiologist

- Performing an oral exam that results in irritation of the upper airways and sudden airway compromise, leading to death

- Sending an unstable airway to radiology
