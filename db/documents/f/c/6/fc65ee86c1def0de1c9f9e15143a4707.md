The treatment of chronic pain has undergone many progressions since the introduction of the gate control theory. New treatment targets are continually identified, of which one is the dorsal root ganglion, a relatively novel neural target.

Several current methods exist to reduce neuropathic pain directed at the DRG. These include:

- Ablation or modulation of the DRG using continuous thermal radiofrequency

- Pulsed radiofrequency

- Electrical DRG neurostimulator technologies

- Modification of DRG cellular function using viral vectors and gene silencing

- Dorsal root ganglionectomy

Of these techniques, DRG radiofrequency ablation is the most common therapeutic choice in favor of its non-surgical, minimally invasive approach. It is also beneficial because it can target not easily accessible areas such as the low back and foot.

Studies have shown ganglionectomy, an irreversible neurosurgical technique, to be less effective in long-term pain reduction than radiofrequency and other neuromodulation techniques. While it can help treat dermatomal segmental pain, it can produce pain in other unwanted areas.
