Hemianopsia results from the disruption of visual pathways within the central nervous system. Understanding the functional anatomy of the visual pathway can help localize pathologic lesions. In brief, visual stimuli are received by each retina and transmitted along the optic nerves to the optic chiasm. Grossly, the retinal fibers divide into nasal and temporal fibers. The nasal fibers decussate at the optic chiasm allowing information about the right and left visual fields to split into their respective pathways for processing in the contralateral side of the brain.

Lesions may classify as prechiasmal, chiasmal, or retrochiasmal. Prechiasmal lesions impact the optic nerve and produce monocular blindness in the affected eye.

Homonymous hemianopsia, in conjunction with an afferent pupillary defect, localizes the lesion to the optic tract.

Homonymous hemianopsia with preservation of the central visual field, otherwise known as macular sparing, is suggestive of damage to the primary visual cortex, which receives dual vascular supply from the middle and posterior cerebral arteries.
