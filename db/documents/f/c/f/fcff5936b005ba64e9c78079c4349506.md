Favus is a chronic inflammatory dermatophytosis, characterized by scutula formation. It used to be highly prevalent worldwide. Currently, the infection is almost eradicated in most nations except in some areas of Africa and Asia. Renewed interest has emerged with the development of atypical presentations caused sometimes by unusual mycological species. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of favus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of favus.
- Summarize the appropriate history, physical examination, and evaluation of favus.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for favus.
-  Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by favus.
