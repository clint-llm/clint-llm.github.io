Fibular grafts are employed for a number of different indications, including mandibular defects, leg length discrepancy, pseudarthrosis, and others. These grafts may be harvested through either posterolateral or lateral approaches that preserve the distal end of the fibula to support the ankle joint. This activity reviews the preoperative evaluation and technical aspects of fibular grafting and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients who require this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for fibula tissue transfer.
- Summarize the treatment considerations for patients with bony defects.
- Review the preoperative vascular status assessment in a patient who is scheduled to undergo free fibular transfer.
- Outline the possible complications of fibular tissue transfer.
