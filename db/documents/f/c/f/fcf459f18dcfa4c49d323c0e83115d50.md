Interlaminar epidural injection refers to a procedure that involves the delivery of injectate to the epidural space by directing a needle between the laminae of two adjacent vertebrae. The goal of this interventional pain medicine procedure is the relief of radicular pain and may be performed in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine. Injectate typically is composed of a combination of anesthetics and steroids. The interlaminar approach allows for medication spread over a larger area than transforaminal epidural injection and can be advantageous in patients with multi-level spinal pathology. This activity reviews and explains the role of the clinician and interprofessional team in treating and improving care for patients who undergo interlaminar epidural injections, and reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique for the procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize pertinent anatomical considerations in performing interlaminar epidural injections.
- Identify the indications for interlaminar epidural injections.
- Review the rationale in choosing injectate when performing interlaminar epidural steroid injections.
- Explain the importance of the interprofessional team for optimal patient outcomes in patients undergoing interlaminar epidural injections.
