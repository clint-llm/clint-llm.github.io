EIMs of IBD should be differentiated from extraintestinal complications resulting from chronic inflammation associated with IBD resulting in nutritional deficiencies, osteopenia, osteoporosis, renal and gall stones, peripheral neuropathies, and IBD drug-associated side effects. Caution should be exercised when using Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in managing intestinal-IBD-related EIMs as they have been associated with IBD exacerbation.

As IBD increases the risk for bone loss and hypocalcemia, Primary care providers must counsel patients regarding the benefits of smoking cessation, physical activity, calcium, and vitamin D supplementation in their diet. IBD patients may be susceptible to thromboembolic events during prolong periods of immobility such as long-haul flights and need to take necessary precautions, including adequate hydration, smoking cessation, regular physical activity, and use of compression stockings.
