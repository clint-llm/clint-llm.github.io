Cryptosporidiosis presents as profuse watery diarrhea and wasting due to malabsorption. It is not unusual for symptoms to be cyclical, with periods of improvement and worsening over one to two weeks. In most cases, diarrhea resolves spontaneously within seven to 14 days. Fever, nausea, and vomiting may also occur, particularly in infants. Abdominal pain is also common. Chronic diarrhea can occur in patients with immunocompromising conditions, particularly human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. This may last for months to years without adequate treatment of their immunocompromising condition.Â In immunocompromised patients, biliary, and pulmonary complications can also occur. Complications can include malnutrition, growth delays, and cognitive impairment. Malnutrition also appears to increase the risk of infection. Cryptosporidiosis is associated with more chronic symptoms and higher mortality rates than other causes of diarrhea in childhood. In immunocompromised patients, in particular, mortality can occur in the early stages of the infection. Asymptomatic infection is also common and may also be associated with malnutrition. Studies have identified asymptomatic infection in 0% to 6% children in endemic areas.
