Pancreatic pseudoaneurysm develops in the background of pancreatitis or pancreaticobiliary surgery. Rarely it has been reported after pancreatic transplantation. Today another relatively common cause of pancreatic pseudoaneurysm is trauma and motor vehicle accidents. Some patients may develop the pseudoaneurysm after undergoing biliopancreatic surgery for malignancy or pancreas transplantation. The pseudoaneurysm tends to occur following an anastomotic leak, followed by an intraabdominal abscess. Pancreatic pseudoaneurysms tend toÂ occur in the presence of enzyme-rich pancreatic fluid, which causes autodigestion and weakening of the walls of the nearby vessels.
