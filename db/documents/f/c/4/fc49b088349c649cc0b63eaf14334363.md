Schwartz-Matsuo syndrome results from rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, causing an elevation in IOP through occlusion of aqueous outflow by photoreceptor outer segments, which have escaped through the retinal break and gained access to the anterior chamber. Therefore, the etiology is dependent on the risk factors for RRD.

The most common risk factors for RRD include:

- Trauma

- History of retinal surgery

- Peripheral retinal breaks

- Lattice degeneration

- Pathologic myopia

- History of cataract surgery

- Family history of retinal detachment
