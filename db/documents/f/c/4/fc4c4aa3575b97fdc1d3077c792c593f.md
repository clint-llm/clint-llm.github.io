IPMNs originate from stem cells of the epithelium of the pancreatic ducts which can differentiate into different phenotypes. They can have different subtypes based on their differentiation including intestinal, pancreaticobiliary, oncocytic, and gastric types.

When IPMNs become invasive, two different subtypes of carcinoma have been identified; tubular type, which usually arises from the pancreatobiliary IPMN and is morphologically similar to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and colloid (mucinous) type, which usually arises from intestinal IPMNs and is morphologically characterized by extensive pools of mucin similar to cancers of other exocrine glands.
