Most of the complications of AVSD are related to intracardiac shunts or atrioventricular valve regurgitation. In complete AVSD, shunting of blood from left to right leads to right-sided overload and signs of heart failure and pulmonary congestion at a very early age, which contributes to significant mortality during infancy. If the shunt is not corrected, it causes an irreversible pulmonary vascular disease that leads to pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome.

Regurgitation of blood from the ventricle to atria through the atrioventricular valve leads to pulmonary congestion and enlargement of the atrium. Enlargement of the atrium can lead to supraventricular arrhythmias. Other complications are related to poor feeding, which may include malnutrition and failure to thrive.
