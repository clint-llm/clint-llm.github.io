Electrophoresis and various immunological methods are commonly used for the analysis of CK isoenzyme.

Immunochemical methods are applicable to the direct measurement of CK-MB. In the immunoinhibition technique, an anti-CK-M subunit antiserum is used to inhibit both M subunits of CK-MM and the single M subunit of CK-MB and thus allow the determination of the enzyme activity of the B subunit of CK-MB, the B subunits of CK-BB, and macro-CKs. To determine CK-MB, this technique assumes the absence of CK-BB (and of the other sources of interference such as macro-CKs) from the tested serum.

In contrast with immunoinhibition, which measures the CK-MB isoenzyme by determination of its catalytic activity, mass immunoassays measure CK-MB protein concentrations.
