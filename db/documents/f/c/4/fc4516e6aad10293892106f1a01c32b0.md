What does all this have to do with healthcare simulation? To apply the concepts of translational science to healthcare simulation, we must first adjust this continuum for use in medical education. The term 'translational simulation' has been used to describe healthcare simulation activities, which directly improve patient processes and outcomes.

In this context, T1 refers to improving the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and professionalism of teams and individuals in the simulation lab.

T3 builds on T2 by taking the knowledge gained about what works and doesn't work in simulation to improve patient care and applies this knowledge across different contexts. This includes scaling up of successful programs across a hospital system within a city, state, or nationally. McGaghie's reconceptualization could be further expanded to include T4, which may target local, state, or national politicians. The goal of improving patient care through changes in regulation, policy, and funding remains paramount. T4 continues to build upon the T3 knowledge by sharing what works to improve patient care with those who can make policy decisions to improve the lives of more individuals. Reconceptualizing healthcare simulation concerning a research continuum emphasized its potential contribution to both patient and population health.
