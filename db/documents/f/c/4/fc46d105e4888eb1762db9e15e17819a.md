There is no specific treatment for MPS. Any child with suspected LMPS detected on prenatal ultrasonography and reaches term should be a high-risk delivery. Therefore, risk assessment and measures should be in place at birth to ensure good transitioning to the immediate post-natal life and avoid post-delivery complications such as respiratory distress from pulmonary hypoplasia or diaphragmatic hernia. Subsequently, affected children must be evaluated by a geneticist and managed by an interprofessional team that targets the complex organ systems involved.

Parents of affected children should be tested to determine the mode of inheritance and counseled on the risk of future pregnancies having MPS depending on genetic testing results. Patients with pterygia, joint contractures, and other orthopedic manifestations will require a surgical referral, evaluation, and treatment. Periodic follow-ups should be established to ensure survival and avoid complications of MPS that might develop. Research is ongoing to explore treatment possibilities and the prevention of inherited and acquired genetic disorders.
