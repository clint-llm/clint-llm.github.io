The incidence of UGH syndrome has reduced since strict control of the quality of IOLs, refined material for manufacture, and improvement of the manufacturing techniques and lens design.

The incidence of UGH syndrome has declined over the years from 2.2 to 3% to 0.4 to 1.2% over one year. The use of first-generation anterior chamber intraocular lenses has been most commonly linked to the development of UGH syndrome, though even single-piece IOL in the capsular bag can cause the syndrome. Though UGH syndrome has been reported usually in adults, it can happen after pediatric cataract surgery also. Lin and colleagues reported a child with anterior migration of the optic of the PCIOL causing UGH syndrome, which subsided after removal of the PCIOL.
