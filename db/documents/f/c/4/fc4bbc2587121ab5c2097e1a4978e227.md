It is highly recommended to closely monitor patients for their clinical condition, their response to the medication, and during periods of dose adjustment. Family and caregivers should be encouraged to observe their patients and to contact their psychiatrist if needed. The therapeutic index of TCAs is narrow. Therefore, regular drug monitoring is required to ensure the therapeutic blood level and, at the same time to avoid to toxic effects of imipramine.

Treatment with imipramine and other tricyclics usually requires a duration of around 4 to 5 weeks to elicit a good response. Research has shown that increasing the dose of imipramine to greater than 300ng/mL effectively treated severe depression. However, when the drug level greatly exceeds 300ng/mL, it will be more likely to be associated with significant and serious side effects. Extreme precautions are necessary, especially in a patient with cardiovascular disease, including conduction defects, tachycardia, acute myocardial infarction, and hepatic impairment. When coadministering imipramine with a MOAI, it can lead to fatal hypertensive crisis or seizures. When imipramine is co-ingested with SSRI, it can cause serotonin syndrome.
