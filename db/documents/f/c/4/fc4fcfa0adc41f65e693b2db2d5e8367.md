**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption**

- 50% of the dose absorbed attains peak plasma concentrations in approximately 3 to 6 hours.

- A maximum reduction in blood pressure occurs in 4 to 6 hours following oral administration.

- Following IV administration, hypotensive lasts for about 10 to 16 hours.

**Distribution**

- The drug is lipid-soluble and crosses the blood-brain barrier with weak binding to plasma proteins.

- Its primary metabolite has more plasma protein binding as compared to the drug.

- Conjugates formed after oral administration are acid labile and are delectable in small amounts after intravenous administration.

- The apparent volume of distribution ranges between 0.19 to 0.32L/kg and the total volume of distribution between 0.41 to 0.72L/kg.

**Metabolism**

- Methyldopa gets metabolized to alpha-methylnorepinephrine, the active metabolite.

- The drug is also metabolized extensively in the liver to its sulfate conjugate.

**Elimination**

- Excretion of 70% of the drug is via urine in the form of parent drug and metabolite.

- Unabsorbed drug is excreted in feces unchanged.

- Excretion is slow in patients with renal failure, leading to the accumulation of the drug and its metabolites.

**Monitoring**

Information about the adverse effects and pharmacokinetic principles of the drug is crucial in therapeutic monitoring. After initiation of treatment, periodic testing of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and the red blood cell count is necessary to rule out hemolytic anemia. Direct Coombs test is reported positive, usually after 6 to 12 months of therapy, but rarely results in fatal hemolytic anemia. Discontinuance of drug reverses results within weeks to months.

Liver function tests are necessary for increased serum concentrations of alkaline phosphatase, aminotransferases, and bilirubin. Hepatic dysfunction may represent a hypersensitivity reaction. Therefore, a periodic assessment of hepatic function is important during the first 6 to 12 weeks of therapy. Abnormal liver function test results require discontinuation of the drug. The drug is contraindicated in active hepatic disease.
