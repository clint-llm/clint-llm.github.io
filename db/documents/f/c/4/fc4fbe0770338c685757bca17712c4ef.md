Bacteria synthesize a cell wall that is strengthened by cross-linking peptidoglycan units via penicillin-binding proteins (PBP, peptidoglycan transpeptidase). Initially derived from the fungus Cephalosporium sp., cephalosporins are a large group of bactericidal antimicrobials that work via their beta-lactam rings. The beta-lactam rings bind to the penicillin-binding protein and inhibit its normal activity. Unable to synthesize a cell wall, the bacteria die.

Staphylococcus aureus, which is initially susceptible to cephalosporins, can develop resistance by changing the structure of the penicillin-binding proteins. S. aureus does this by having a gene that encodes a modified penicillin-binding protein; this prevents the cephalosporin’s beta-lactam rings from inactivating the protein. The bacterium that develops this mechanism of resistance is called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). As indicated above, out of the five generations of cephalosporin, only the fifth generation ceftaroline has coverage against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Another crucial resistance mechanism is producing the enzyme beta-lactamase, which cleaves the beta-lactam ring, preventing it from attaching to the penicillin-binding proteins, e.g., peptidoglycan transpeptidase. Beta-lactamase inhibitors can be co-formulated with cephalosporins to increase their spectrum of activity, e.g., ceftazidime/avibactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam.
