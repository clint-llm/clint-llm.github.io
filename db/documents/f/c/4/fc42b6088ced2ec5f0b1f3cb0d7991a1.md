The differential diagnosis of air leak and air leak syndrome should address all of the causes of pneumothorax, including the following:

- Iatrogenic

- Spontaneous

- Traumatic

- Direct and indirect causes of pneumothoraxes

Primary and secondary causes of pneumothoraxes also should be factored in the differential diagnosis.
