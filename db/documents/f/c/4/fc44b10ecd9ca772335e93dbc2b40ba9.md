Chorioretinal folds can lead to maculopathy which has been staged with the help of FFA into:

- Stage 1: Alternating bands of hyperfluorescence and hypofluorescence without any staining or leakage

- Stage 2: Areas of staining at the crest of the folds

- Stage 3: Stippled hyperfluorescence expanding in the late frames

The fluorescein pattern in stage 3 is similar to the late leakage of the undetermined source described in the macular photocoagulation study.
