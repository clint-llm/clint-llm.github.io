The exact frequency of adrenal crisis in the general population is difficult to estimate. Patients with adrenal insufficiency have been estimated to have an episode of adrenal crisis in 6-8% cases annually

**Risk Factors for Adrenal Crisis**

- Known history of adrenal insufficiency or previous history of adrenal crisis

- Diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency is associated with a higher risk of adrenal crisis compared to secondary adrenal insufficiency

- Ongoing glucocorticoid therapy including topical and inhalation - suppresses HPA axis (sudden withdrawal can trigger adrenal crisis)

- Levothyroxine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin, carbamazepine, St. John's Wart (increases cortisol metabolism)

- Ketoconazole, etomidate, fluconazole (reduces intrinsic production of cortisol)

- Anticoagulation agents (increased risk of adrenal hemorrhage)

- Other medications: megestrol acetate, medroxyprogesterone

- Pregnancy (an increased requirement in the third trimester of pregnancy)

- Older age

- Existence of co-morbidities

- Diabetes mellitus type 1

- Adrenal metastasis

- Polyglandular autoimmune syndrome 1 and 2
