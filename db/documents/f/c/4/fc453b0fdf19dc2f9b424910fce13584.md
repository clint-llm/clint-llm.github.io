The anatomical location of the coronary sinus provides a vital role in cardiac resynchronization therapy. A biventricular pacemaker is a device commonly used to treat a delay in ventricular contractions in those with advanced heart failure with an ejection fraction <35%. A pulse generator is implanted under the skin and utilizes 2Â or 3 leads that are advanced into the heart to depolarize the ventricles in synchrony. The right lead is commonly placed in an anterior cardiac vein to pace the right ventricle, while the left lead is commonly placed in the coronary sinus to pace the left ventricle.

From a cardiac electrophysiology standpoint, the coronary sinus serves as a site for electrode placement during mapping and ablation of left-sided accessory pathways. The coronary sinus is also of interest because its superficial myocardial sleeve is electrophysiologically active and may develop spontaneous arrhythmogenic foci.
