The diagnosis of alcoholic cardiomyopathy is non-specific.

The key to diagnosis is a personal history of chronic heavy alcohol use and the absence of other etiologies.

In patients exhibiting chronic alcohol use, other causes of dilated cardiomyopathy need workup. Investigative work up such as mean corpuscular volume (MCV), gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase (GGT), elevated transaminases (AST, ALT) and elevated INR usually are seen in liver injury can be helpful as supportive evidence of alcohol use.

Other supportive workups can include:

Electrocardiography:

Many changes can be observed including premature atrial or ventricular contractions, supraventricular tachycardias, atrioventricular blocks,  bundle branch blocks, QT prolongation, non-specific ST and T wave changes and abnormal Q waves.

Chest X-Ray:

Enlarged cardiac silhouette, pulmonary vascular congestion, and pleural effusion

Alcoholic cardiomyopathy can be diagnosed by the following criteria

- Dilated cardiomyopathy is seen on 2D echocardiography

- LV end-diastolic dimension greater than 2 standard deviations above normal.Left ventricle ejection fraction less than 50%.Exclusion of hypertensive, valvular and ischemic heart diseases. Hence patients with suspected alcoholic cardiomyopathy should undergo coronary angiogram along with echocardiography.
