There is an overall paucity of data on the prognosis and outcomes of those living with HIV-2, and existing studies have been small. However, HIV-2 cohorts have consistently shown that in patients with CD4 cell counts greater than 500 cells/µL, survival is improved compared to age-matched controls with HIV-1.

Further studies have demonstrated that in those with HIV-2 and advanced disease, mortality rates are similar to patients with HIV-1 when adjusted for CD4 count, age, and demographic factors.
