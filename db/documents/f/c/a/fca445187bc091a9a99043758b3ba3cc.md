**Surgery**

Surgery for vestibular schwannomas results in low rates of recurrence and a high probability of resection.

Various approaches may be employed in the resection. The retromastoid approach makes an incision behind the area and mastoid bone with the advantage of preserving hearing but with the risk of incomplete resection. The middle cranial fossa approach has the incision made anterior to the ear and may preserve hearing depending on the extent of the tumor. The translabyrinthine approach goes through the inner ear and invariably results in hearing loss. This approach may be suited for patients without any serviceable hearing. Overall, surgical resection is indicated in patients with large tumors >4cm, recurrent tumors after radiotherapy, brain stem compression, cranial neuropathy, and hydrocephalus.

Complications include post-operative CSF leak (9 to 13%), headache, CN V and VII neuropathies, hearing deficits,  hematoma, hydrocephalus, aseptic meningitis (2 to 4%), and hemiparesis.****
