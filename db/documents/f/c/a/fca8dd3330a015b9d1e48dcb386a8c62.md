A bedrock concept is using the right drug at the correct dose for the correct patient. This concept may mean using a more potent drug that has a shorter duration or a more straightforward intervention in the event of a complication. This counter-intuitive concept is built into modern sedation protocols. For example, using combinations of medications in a high dose with a long duration of action (e.g., fentanyl and lorazepam) may appear safer than using propofol for brief duration procedures. This idea represents a crucial error and demonstrates a misunderstanding of the realities of practice; avoidance of this error is especially incumbent on credentialing and training committees because the creation of artificial, non-evidence based restrictions can lead to workarounds that imperil patient safety. The reason is, if the person doing the procedure or performing the sedation gets into trouble with the sedation portion of the procedure, rescuing from hypopnea from propofol is several orders of magnitude easier and briefer duration than fentanyl/lorazepam.
