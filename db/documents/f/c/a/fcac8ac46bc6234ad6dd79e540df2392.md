Intervertebral discs are largelyÂ avascular. Only the outer annulus is vascularized. Blood vessels near the disc-bone junction of the vertebral body as well as those in the outer annulus supply the NP and inner annulus. Glucose, oxygen, and other nutrients reach the avascular regions by diffusion. The same process removes metabolites.
