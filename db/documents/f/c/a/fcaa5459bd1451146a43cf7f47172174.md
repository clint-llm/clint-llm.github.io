Milk-alkali syndrome is characterized by a triad of elevated calcium levels, metabolic alkalosis, and acute kidney injury that commonly occurs due to the combined intake of large amounts of calcium and absorbable alkali. The syndrome can have an acute onset with the rapid development of hypercalcemia and, if left untreated, may develop acute renal failure and metastatic calcification.

The syndrome was first recognized in the early 20th century when Bertram Sippy introduced a treatment regimen for peptic ulcer disease.

Recently, however, an increased number of cases of milk-alkali syndrome have been reported. This is likely due to the common use of over-the-counter calcium preparations for preventing and treating osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Calcium carbonate is also frequently prescribed to patients with chronic kidney disease to prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism. Various scholars have also suggested changing the syndrome's name to calcium-alkali syndrome due to the changing etiopathology.
