**Pathophysiology**

Gonioscopy in FHU reveals

- Small twig-like vessels in the angle that likely give rise to Amsler-Verrey sign

- The visibility of large vessels at the peripheral iris likely due to the atrophy of the iris

- Loss of the details of the angle of the anterior chamber with a 'dullness or felt-like covering

- Small irregular areas of non-confluent goniosynechiae

The fine vessels at the angle of the anterior chamber are fragile and prone to rupture after trivial trauma. The actual nature of these vessels is unknown and may be abnormal vasculature or new vessels. There is no clear correlation between the hyphema and abnormal angle vessels.

However, similar anterior chamber hemorrhage after paracentesis may also present in other conditions including

- Neovascular glaucoma

- Neovascularization of the angle of the anterior chamber

- Sudden hypotony or shallowing of the anterior chamber during anterior segment surgery

- Patients on anticoagulant therapy or bleeding disorders

- However, the sign may lead the clinician to a strong suspicion of FHU.

**Causes of Anterior Chamber Hemorrhage**

Amsler and Verrey noted hyphema after paracentesis in FHI.

- Spontaneous or possibly from trivial trauma like rubbing the eyes

- Gonioscopy

- Applanation tonometry

- Pharmacological dilatation of the pupil

- Posterior capsulotomy

- Honan balloon before cataract surgery

- During cataract surgery

- Peribulbar anesthesia
