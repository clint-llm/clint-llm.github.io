Relevant concerns about the Poison Prevention Packaging Act target the elderly or people with physical disabilities. This limited population must request special packaging if they desire a non-child-resistant container. The special packaging must abide by such guidelines:

Each special package will still have to remain senior-adult and younger-adult resistant. When applicable, a metal aerosol container can be utilized if compliant with other states of federal regulations. There shall be no reusable special packaging. Containers with liquid will be restricted to two milliliters if the container is activated, inverted, or squeezed.

A label must be provided on the container stating, “This Package for Households Without Young Children.” This statement is required for any special packaging according to the act. The label should appear easily legible on the borderline of the principal display panel. The statement must be written in contrast to the other labels. For smaller containers unable to accommodate the label, a substitute label will proceed with the statement as “Package Not Child-Resistant.”

Each special packaging standard must remain appropriate for the application and desired effect of the pharmaceutical for the particular patient. The following list is products that remain exempted from the PPPA.

- Sublingual and chewable isosorbide dinitrate less than 10mg per dosage strength

- Powdered unflavored aspirin
