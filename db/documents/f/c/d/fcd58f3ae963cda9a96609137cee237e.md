Rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep) occurs in about 90-minute intervals and is predominantly a parasympathetic state. REM sleep is also known as paradoxical sleep because beta waves appear on an electroencephalogram (EEG). Beta waves are also seen on EEG when an individual is awake. Normally during REM, there is a loss of muscle tone (atonia or tonic muscular inhibition). There is a theory that tonic muscular inhibition is under the control of the caudal part of the locus coeruleus. This decreased muscle tone may protect an individual from inadvertently harming themselves by preventing them from "acting out" their dreams. Lesions of the locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus have been theorized to be one possible cause of REM sleep behavior disorder. REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) occurs due to the loss of tonic muscular inhibition during REM, leading an individual to "act out" dreams. Depending on the area of the lesion, symptoms can range anywhere from simple limb twitches to complex behaviors such as screaming, laughing, punching, kicking, or running.
