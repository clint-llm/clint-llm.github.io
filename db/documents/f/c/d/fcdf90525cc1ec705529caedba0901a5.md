Bone metastases affect survival rates ranging from 6 to 7 months in lung cancer to several years in the breast (19 to 25 months) or prostate cancer (12 to 53 months). Metastases may present with a single bone lesion, oligometastatic disease, multiple bone metastases, or visceral plus bone metastases. A study by Hernandez et al. estimated the cumulative incidence of bone metastases in the United States as 2.9% at 30 days, 4.8% at one year, 5.6% at two years, 6.9% at five years, and 8.4% at ten years. Prostate cancer posed the highest risk for bone metastases (18% to 29%) followed by lung, renal, or breast cancer.
