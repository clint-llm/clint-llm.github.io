Complications associated with ARDS divide into the following:

- Complications related to mechanical ventilation use (barotrauma and nosocomial infections specially ventilator-associated pneumonia)

- Complications related to underlying condition and complications secondary to prolonged ICU and hospital stay including delirium

- Critical care neuromyopathies

- Deep venous thrombosis, and gastrointestinal bleeding

Patients who develop the fibrotic stage are more likely to need tracheostomy because of prolonged intubation and difficult weaning from mechanical ventilation. Oxygen supply may be necessary for a longer duration until recovery of lung injury.
