In the current environment of patients seeking healthy foods, and herbal and non-proprietary medications, therapeutic drug monitoring can pose challenges. Thorough knowledge of the patient's medication list is essential to consider potential drug-drug interactions and minimize undesired changes in the antiepileptic drug levels. The recent increase in the use of cannabidiol (CBD) as an antiepileptic drug has increased the need for frequent monitoring of certain medications, like clobazam, during concomitant therapy. CBD, in combination with valproate or clobazam, can result in increased liver enzymes, notably ALT and AST., so patients receiving this combination may benefit from additional liver enzyme monitoring. Animal studies have shown CBD to increase clobazam anticonvulsant activity via CYP3A4 activity, but only when an anticonvulsant dose of CBD was used; sub-anti-convulsant CBD dosing did not promote increased anticonvulsant effects despite increased serum clobazam concentrations.
