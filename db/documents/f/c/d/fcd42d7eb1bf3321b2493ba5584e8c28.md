The anal canal can be described in 2 ways, the functional (surgical) or anatomic anal canal. The surgical anal canal is about 4 cm long and extends from the anal verge to the anorectal ring or puborectalis sling. The anatomic anal canal is approximately 2 cm long and starts at the anal verge extending to the dentate line.

The anal canal consists of 2 muscular structures, which are responsible for anal continence. The first of these structures is the internal anal sphincter, which is the inner layer of the muscular complex and is composed of smooth muscle. The internal anal sphincter is approximately 2.5 to 4 cm long and 2 to 3 mm thick.  Since the internal anal sphincter is an involuntary muscle, it is consistently contracted to prevent inadvertent loss of stool. During a bowel movement, the internal anal sphincter muscle relaxes allowing in the expulsion of stool. The second muscular structure is the external anal sphincter, which is the outer muscular layer and is composed of striated muscle. The external anal sphincter is a muscular tube around the anal canal, which merges proximately with the puborectalis and the levator ani muscles. It is the voluntary muscle used during bowel movements.
