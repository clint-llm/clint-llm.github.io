The field of obesity is relatively new. There has been significant progress in unraveling neuronal pathways, including the hypothalamic, brainstem, and cortico-limbic system in the homeostatic regulation of energy balance, which determines weight and appetite regulation. These circuits work with input from the endocrine system, autonomic nervous system, and gut hormones.

As a part of evolution, there are mechanisms in place in the human body to maintain a set point for weight. It was a conservatory mechanism to maintain a steady level of adiposity and stable weight. During human evolution, the cortico-limbic system has been used to adapt behavior to procure food supply to maintain healthy weight and energy balance. In the modern world, there is an abundant supply of food which likely overwhelms the regulatory system.

The discovery of these pathways has been the target of pharmacotherapy for obesity. The recent discovery of gut hormones and their interaction with central regulatory neuronal pathways have paved the way for metabolic surgery forÂ obesity.
