Thoracic outlet syndrome - compression of the brachial plexus or subclavian vessels in the neck or axilla. Etiology may be soft tissue (scalene muscle hypertrophy) or bony (cervical rib) in nature. Vascular injuries and overuse in athletes may also results in TOS

Injuries of the shoulder joint (dislocation, AC joint injury, impingement, rotator cuff tear) - Traumatic injuries of the shoulder joint may be differentiated by plain radiography, MRI. Any neurologic deficits are often transient in nature.

Cervical spine pathology (cervical sprain, cervical radiculopathy) - Patients with cervical spine injury may present with neck pain, unilateral arm pain, weakness and paresthesias in a dermatomal distribution:

- C4 radiculopathy: scapular winging

- C5 radiculopathy: deltoid, biceps weakness

- C6 radiculopathy: brachialis, wrist extension weakness; numbness to thumb, index finger

- C7 radiculopathy: triceps, wrist flexion weakness; numbness to middle finger

- C8 radiculopathy: weakness in fine motor function of hand; numbness to ring, small fingers
