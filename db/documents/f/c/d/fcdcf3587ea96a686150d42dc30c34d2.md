Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet, a Belgian-born sociologist, astronomer, and mathematician, is responsible for developing the Body Mass Index. In the mid-19th century, Quetelet was searching for a way to relate an individual's height to their ideal weight as a tool for studying populations. The quotient was first cited in 1972 in the Journal of Chronic Diseases. The article discussed BMI as a valuable tool in population studies, or "social physics," as Quetelet called it. It was mentioned that this measurement was not useful for studying an individual; however, due to the simplicity of the equation, it remains the most commonly used anthropometric analysis.

Other anthropometric assessments require measurements of an individual's body. These numbers are less reliable than BMI because they can change depending on the measurement's location. BMI relies on the accuracy of the scale that an individual is weighed on and can be comparatively referred to as an objective evaluation. For these reasons, a quotient developed in the mid-1800s is so widely utilized in the 21st century.
