Multiple complex pathways activate in response to damaged DNA, cellular stress, or infections. Here we will focus on the cellular response to mechanical trauma. Although there may be many mechanisms of traumatic injury to cells (physical damage or extreme temperature changes), the ultimate consequence is a loss of cellular integrity and function, eventually leading to cell death. Necroptosis is one mechanism in which cell death due to an injury can occur and is the most studied. The pathway begins with TNF alpha binding to its receptor and subsequently leads to the "RIPotosome" formation.

After TNF binding to its corresponding receptor, TRAF2 (TNF receptor-associated factor 2) and TRADD (TNF associated death domain protein) are signaled, which leads to the ligation of RIPK1 and RIPK3's recruitment.
