Facial lacerations are a common complaint in the emergency or primary care setting, and the ear presents a unique challenge due to its structure. The ear is particularly susceptible to lacerations, avulsions, and blunt trauma due to the prominent position of the ears overlying a bony surface. Additionally, the unique composition and relatively tenuous blood supply to the structures of the pinna create challenges and considerations unique to ear laceration repair.
