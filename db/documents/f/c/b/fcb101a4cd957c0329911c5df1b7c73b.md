There were no reported deaths due to iodine toxicity in 2018, according to the 2018 Annual Report of the American Association of Poison Control Centers' National Poison Data System (NPDS): 36th Annual Report.

In iodine sufficient individuals, iodine excess causes elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels, which inhibits thyroid hormone production leading to hypothyroidism and goiter.

Patients with iodine deficiency and patients with pre-existing thyroid disease may be sensitive to iodine levels, which appear to be safe for the general population. Â Neonates, elderly, and pregnant women may also be more susceptible to iodine excess.
