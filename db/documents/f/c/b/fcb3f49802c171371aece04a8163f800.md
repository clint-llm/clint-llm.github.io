There are many major clinical practice guidelines set by several colleges and societies with their subtle differences between them. However, the primary goals of these clinical practice guidelines are all the same, which are cholesterol testing to prevent CAD in healthy populations or primary prevention and to provide early detection and slow down the progression of diseases or secondary prevention.

- Patient with a family history of premature death due to myocardial infarction in first degree relatives (<55 years [male] and <65 years [female])

- History of familial hypercholesterolemia or patient with stigmata of familial hypercholesterolemia (xanthoma/ xanthomata or eyelid xanthelasma)

- Patients with comorbidities that are likely to be benefitted from statins use, i.e., patients with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, HIV, and others.

- Risk stratification for patients without the disease, which might benefit from cholesterol-lowering treatment.
