It is a general consensus that ionizing radiation is oncogenic in nature. Much of this agreement is based upon observation of increased incidence of carcinoma in a population surviving a nuclear attack or in uranium miners exposed to radiation at the workplace. The amount of radiation used by imaging modalities is negligible as compared to the abovementioned exposures. For instance, in the United States, people are exposed to average annual background radiation levels of about 3 mSv; exposure from a chest X-ray is about 0.1 mSv, and exposure from a whole-body computerized tomography (CT) scan is about 10 mSv, and thatâ€™s one of the reasons why physicians usually miscalculate the potential risks associated with the radiation exposure while performing procedures using radiologic imaging.

Radiation is defined as a moving form of energy. It can be classified into two categories, i.e., ionizing and non-ionizing type. Ionizing radiations can be further classified into electromagnetic radiation (matter less) and particulate radiation.

Electromagnetic radiations are energy packets (photons) traveling in the form of a wave. Basic examples of electromagnetic radiation are x-rays and gamma rays. Particulate radiation consists of a beam of particles that can be either charged or neutral. Electromagnetic radiations have high energy and can easily penetrate body tissues. Ionizing radiation is mainly used for diagnostic purposes.
