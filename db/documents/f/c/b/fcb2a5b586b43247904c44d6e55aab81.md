The primary goal is adequate intraocular pressure (IOP) control. The definitive management is the removal of inciting lenticular matter.

**IOP Management**

- Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI): For PBG and PMG, it may relieve any component of the pupillary block but may be insufficient to control the IOP.

- Topical antiglaucoma medication (AGM): The first-line management includes beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Prostaglandin analogs and miotics can be used but may increase intraocular inflammation.

- Systemic IOP lowering agents: Hyperosmotic agents (i.e., mannitol) and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide) augment the effect of topical agents. Vigilant monitoring of kidney function and serum electrolytes is essential.

- Corticosteroids: Topical and systemic corticosteroids lower the inflammation in PAG and PLG before the definitive cataract surgery.

- Pars plana vitrectomy is sometimes required before cataract surgery if there is inadequate anterior chamber space to safely perform cataract surgery in cases of hyper mature or intumescent cataracts.

**Lens Extraction -**ideally performed after adequate IOP control

- Cataract extraction. As per the surgeons' experience, conventional ECCE, small incision cataract surgery (SICS), or phacoemulsification techniques are employed to remove the lens.

- The traumatic lens rupture and residual lenticular matter after cataract surgery do well with a total lens aspiration in cases of LPIG and PAG.

- For gross lens subluxation or anterior dislocation in EL, various techniques may be employed depending on the degree of subluxation.  Phacoemulsification combined with sutured capsular segments may be preferred for mild to moderate subluxation.  For severe or posterior subluxation, vitrectomy combined with pars plana lensectomy or intracapsular cataract extraction may be required.

- For patients denying the perception of light and thus unlikely to improve vision, cataract surgery can still be performed to control inflammation and pain.

**Visual Rehabilitation**

- The cases with an intact posterior capsule and adequate bag stability can have primary implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL).

- For subluxated cataracts, devices like capsule tension rings or Cionne rings stabilize the bag and facilitate implantation of a posterior chamber IOL.

- For ICCE and lensectomy cases, a primary or secondary scleral-fixated IOL or an anterior chamber IOL have variable success rates. In the post-surgery period, topical AGMs control the IOP.

- Gonio-synechialysis, in conjunction with cataract surgery, is a management option for PAS formation in chronic LIG.

- PLG - An immediate lens extraction alone results in a well-controlled IOP if the preceding history is less than a week. For a history of more than two weeks, combined cataract surgery with trabeculectomy shows a better IOP control.

- PMG - Cataract surgery alone is useful for IOP control and visual rehabilitation for patients presenting within four weeks. A combined surgery - lens extraction and trabeculectomy, is planned for chronic PMG.

- For painful blind eyes, cataract surgery or cyclodiode laser treatment may be considered to lower the IOP.
