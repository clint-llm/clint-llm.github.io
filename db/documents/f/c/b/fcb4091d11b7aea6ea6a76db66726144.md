A majority of adult cataracts are age-related with other etiologies suspected to be due to ultra-violet (UV) light exposure, smoking, diabetes, corticosteroid exposure, and other oxidizing drugs. Pediatric cataracts can be hereditary, idiopathic, or part of multisystem syndromes, metabolic disorders, or maternal infection.

Around half of congenital cataracts are genetic, and most genes are involved in lens development, including a, b, and g crystallin as well as lens cytoskeletal protein. Other causes include metabolic disorders, maternal infection, trauma, and toxic effects. Corticosteroids are associated with posterior subcapsular cataracts. Other medications that can also cause cataracts include busulfan, amiodarone, and phenothiazine.
