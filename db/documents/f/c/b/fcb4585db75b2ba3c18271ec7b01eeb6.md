Bacillary angiomatosis (epithelioid angiomatosis) is an uncommon disease characterized by neovascular proliferation in the skin or the internal organs (peliosis) due to an infection with Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. It commonly occurs in immunocompromised as well as immunocompetent patients. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of bacillary angiomatosis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify Bartonella as the causative agent in the etiology of bacillary angiomatosis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of bacillary angiomatosis.
- Outline the use of a biopsy to evaluate bacillary angiomatosis.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by bacillary angiomatosis.
