The mechanism of action for LT joint injury occurs with hyperextension of the wrist which can be caused by falling on an outstretched hand or a combination of radial deviation and extension motion. Lifting heavy objects with forced pronation has also been described as a mechanism of injury. A blow to the dorsum of the hand can provide this level of hyperextension, which is typical with sports injuries. Ulnar positive variance has also been associated with LT instability.

Isolated injury to the intrinsic LT ligament is usually asymptomatic initially. The extensive network of extrinsic ligaments within the wrist mostly maintain the LT joint, and only micromotion instability will occur, over time causing arthritis or synovitis. If a larger injury to the wrist occurs, which involves more than just the intrinsic LT ligament, VISI can occur.

In rare cases, VISI can be non-pathological due to ligamentous laxity. VISI can be seen with LT joint instability because the lunate tends to flex when there is no support from the triquetrum. As mentioned earlier, isolated injury to the LT ligament is often associated with other ligamentous injuries including dorsal radiotriquetral and volar radiolunate ligaments and the combination of these will cause a VISI deformity. VISI diagnosis will be discussed in the imaging section.
