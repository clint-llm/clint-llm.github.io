Teamwork can improve the quality of care in vascular medicine.****The cited studies describe how a team of vascular healthcare providers working together reduced minor errors, major errors, and the unnecessary exposure of patients to risks during aneurysm repair procedures.

The beneficial effect of collaboration and good communication by members of healthcare teams is discussed by the authors elsewhere, as well as specifically in the setting of vascular medicine by other authors.

The synchrony of quality and compensation will increase in the future but has not been significant in the field of vascular medicine to date. Healthcare providers and administrators should be aware of the areas in vascular medicine where there is room for improvement in the quality of patient care. They should be making decisions driven by data and evidence-based guidelines from appropriate national or international organizations to modify processes and structures that improve clinical outcomes and patient experiences while reducing costs. Cost containment and revenue generation should not come at the expense of patient safety.
