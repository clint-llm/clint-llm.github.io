Enhancing healthcare team outcomes related to this condition is dependent on the cause. For deficiency related to excessive alcohol intake, steps to ensure the successful cessation of alcohol use may involve an interprofessional approach involving clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, psychological professionals/social workers, community resources, and the use of inpatient or outpatient treatment strategies. In instances of inadequate dietary intake, nutritional counseling with a nutritionist or certified dietician may be in order. Interprofessional care coordination is crucial to patient success.

Preventing this condition is as simple as ensuring total body levels of thiamine are adequate for metabolic processes. Education of patients at risk of deficiency is imperative, and any further counseling should point toward the underlying cause of the condition. For instance, patients undergoing alcohol detoxification should receive counseling on the signs, symptoms, and long-term effects of Korsakoff syndrome, and an interprofessional team should be engaged to ensure the patient has adequate resources for detoxication and follow-up care.

Patients need to be educated about eating a healthy diet, cease tobacco, and abstaining from alcohol. The dietitian should educate the patient on foods that are rich in thiamine. Only through an interprofessional team approach can the morbidity of thiamine deficiency be reduced.
