Ensuring that patients with significant risk factors are compliant with prescribed therapy and therapeutic on medications like warfarin in the setting of atrial fibrillation or mechanical heart valves is a major preventative step. Educating patients on the known complications of poor compliance with anticoagulation therapy should be pursued during inpatient and outpatient encounters when appropriate. Those with an underlying inheritable coagulopathy predisposing them to thrombosis formation may benefit from the involvement of a hematologist.
