Pancoast or superior sulcus tumor consists of a wide range of tumors invading the apical chest wall and producing a characteristic syndrome named Pancoast-Tobias syndrome. Not all superior sulcus tumors are in this precise anatomic location, but the term signifies any tumor that presents in the apices of the lungs with the associated clinical symptoms that are the hallmark of this disease. Treatment of Pancoast tumors involves interprofessional care coordinated among a thoracic surgeon, a radiation oncologist and a medical oncologist. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Pancoast tumors and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the presentation of a Pancoast tumor.
- Describe the typical imaging findings associated with Pancoast tumors.
- Outline the treatment considerations for patients with Pancoast tumors.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination by an interprofessional team to improve the outcomes for patients affected by Pancoast tumor.
