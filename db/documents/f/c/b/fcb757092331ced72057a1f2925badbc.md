A Schatzki ring is a circular membrane of mucosa and submucosa that forms at the squamocolumnar junction of the distal esophagus. Schatzki rings appear as thin membranous structures that do not contain any muscularis propria. The upper surface is covered with squamous epithelium, and the lower surface is covered with columnar epithelium. Schatzki rings are always associated with hiatal hernias. This activity describes the pathophysiology, etiology, presentation, and management of Schatzki rings and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Schatzki rings.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a Schatzki ring.
- Review the treatment options for Schatzki rings.
- Explain the importance of optimizing care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with Schatzki rings.
