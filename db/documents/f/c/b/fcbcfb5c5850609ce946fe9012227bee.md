Various neurological disorders can cause dysarthria. Dysarthria can arise from disorders at various locations of the neuroaxis, including the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, cranial nerve nuclei, or peripheral nerves, and from a primary motor disorder of the tongue, larynx, and pharynx.

**Mayo Clinic Classification (commonly used - groups dysarthria based on the location)**

**Etiopathological Causes**

- Infections: Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, acquired immune deficiency disease.

- Vascular disorder: Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, arterio-venous malformations.

- Neoplasm: Primary and metastatic brain tumors.

- Demyelinating: Multiple sclerosis, Guillain–Barre disease.

- Degenerative: PD, progressive supra nuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, Huntington disease (HD), ataxia telangiectasia.

- Trauma: TBI, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, cerebral palsy.

- Toxic: Heavy metal poisoning (Minamata disease due to methylmercury poisoning can cause dysarthria), alcohol, drugs

- Genetic: Sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophthalmoparesis (SANDO) due to a mutation in the gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma enzyme (POLG1)

In addition to the neurological causes, nonneurological causes, such as cleft lip or palate and laryngeal tumors, also cause difficulty with articulation. However, the condition is not termed dysarthria if it stems from nonneurological causes.
