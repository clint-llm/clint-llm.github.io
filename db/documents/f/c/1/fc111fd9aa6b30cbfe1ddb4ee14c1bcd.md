Bladder prolapse (cystocele) is a chronic condition during which a bladder herniates to the anterior vaginal wall. Due to the condition's progressive nature, if left untreated it can significantly impact a woman's well-being, mental, and sexual health. It can be managed by pelvic exercises, vaginal pessaries, or with a surgical procedure. This activity describes the evaluation and management of bladder prolapse and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.
