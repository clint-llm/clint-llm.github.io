The function of the spinal cord and spinal nerves includes:

- Â Protection of the spinal cord and spinal nerves

- The spinal cord is contained within the spinal canal, a central lumen within each vertebral body. Spinal nerves emerge from the main cord at each vertebral level to make up the sympathetic trunk and splanchnic nerves. The diameter of the spinal canal changes in the different parts of the vertebral column, larger in the cervical and lumbar regions and smaller in the thoracic region.

- Structural Support

- The spinal column forms the central axis of weight bearing and supports the head as well as transfers the weight of trunk and abdomen to the legs

- Provide structure as well as flexibility to the body

- Movement: The unique jointed structure of the spine allows rotation and bending
- In the thoracic region, the spine provides attachment sites for ribs.
- The spine serves as the attachment site for multiple muscles.

- Intervertebral discs: Provide cushioning between the vertebrae

- Cartilaginous structures between adjacent vertebrae composed of annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus
- The discs compose about 25% of the length of the vertebral column
- Support the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments
