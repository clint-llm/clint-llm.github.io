**Medications**

- As for most cosmetic procedures, patients are asked to abstain from smoking and use of any blood-thinning agents within 1 to 2 weeks of the procedure. Some surgeons will require antiviral medication starting one day prior to surgery and continuing for ten days postoperatively to prevent posttraumatic herpetic lesions, particularly in patients with a history of zoster/shingles.

**Marking**

- First, the surgeon must measure the lip to ensure appropriate implant sizing; the measurement is from oral commissure to oral commissure along the wet-dry junction of the red lip. Implants that are too short will have visible tapered ends shy of the commissure.

While lip implantation is possible under general anesthetic, most surgeons elect to perform lip implants under local anesthesia. A regional block is performed using an injection of a buffered solution of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine (1:100,000) targeting the infraorbital and mental nerves bilaterally. Then, each commissure is infiltrated with this solution. Finally, the local anesthetic is injected into the deep submucosa of the lip along the previously marked wet-dry border, with care to remain superficial to the orbicularis oris muscle.
