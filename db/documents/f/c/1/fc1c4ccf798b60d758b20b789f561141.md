- Fetal kidneys produce amniotic fluid, and it is swallowed through the mouth by the fetus. A defect in the kidneys can lead to a low quantity of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), and defective swallowing of the amniotic fluid can lead to excess amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios)

- The diagnosis of a GI obstruction is possible in the late second to early third trimester.

- Amniotic fluid can be assessed to help check fetal health. There are many ways to assess the quantity of amniotic fluid. An ultrasound can provide accurate data about the amount of amniotic fluid.Â 

- Clinical palpation to measure the single deepest vertical pocket
- Amniotic fluid index (AFI) using the four-quadrant technique; this is the most popular and reliable method.

- AFI <5 cm is oligohydramnios
- AFI >25 cm is polyhydramnios
- AFI between 8-25 is considered normal.

- Fetal MRI can be used to complement the findings of an ultrasound.
