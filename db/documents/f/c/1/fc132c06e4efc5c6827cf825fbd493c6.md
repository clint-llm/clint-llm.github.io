Acute Q fever can result in fatal interstitial pneumonia, myopericarditis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, and cholecystitis. Immunocompromised patients are at higher risk of developing complications. Chronic Q fever can result in vascular prosthesis infection and prosthetic valve infections. Endocarditis, if not treated, can result in serious cardiac complications. Chronic persistence can result in Q fever fatigue syndrome, hemolytic anemia, and bone marrow necrosis. When not treated, pregnant females with Q fever have poor fetal outcomes,Â including abortion.
