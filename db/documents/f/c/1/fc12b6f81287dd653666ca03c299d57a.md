Viruses are the most common etiological agents of acute respiratory tract infection (ARTIs). HPIV shares practically the same signs and symptoms of respiratory tract infection with other bacterial and viral pathogens, which makes it more difficult to have a diagnosis based only on clinical features. Some of the common viral respiratory pathogens which are considered in the differential diagnoses of HPIV include:

- Respiratory syncytial virus

- Influenza types A and B

- Human rhinovirus

- Human metapneumovirus

- Adenoviruses

- WU polyomavirus

- Human bocavirus
