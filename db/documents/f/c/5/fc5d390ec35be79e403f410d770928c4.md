In patients with DM (mainly type 1 butÂ can also be type 2) and on an insulin regimen, blood glucose should be monitored between meals to prevent hypoglycemia. Additionally, weight measurements are necessary due to insulin-associated weight gain. Insulin's regular onset of effect is 1 hour, peaks at 2 to 4 hours, and the duration of the effect lasts 4-hours.

Patients with DKA and HHS that are on an insulin infusion regimen must have careful monitoring for the development of electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia, as well as serial blood glucose measurements.
