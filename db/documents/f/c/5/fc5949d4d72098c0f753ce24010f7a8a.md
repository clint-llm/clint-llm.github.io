Minimal change disease is frequently encountered as the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children, and it is the third most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. An interdisciplinary team including a nephrologist, pharmacist, primary care, and nurse is essential for detection, diagnosis, and optimizing therapy. In children, MCD presents with distinct clinical features. However, in adults, the clinical features may vary. It is important to recognize these clinical and lab findings associated with MCD to tailor and optimize therapy in MCD subgroups.
