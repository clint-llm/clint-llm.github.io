Critical bedside examination of the jugular venous pulse (JVP) provides an invaluable amount of information relating to both disease process and medication management. Using the method above to examine the height of the JVP, clinicians are able to interpret the volume status of patients. Simply stated, an elevated JVP of greater than 9 cm H2O (venous hypertension) along with other symptoms can help distinguish between left and right heart failure, suggest pericardial disease, and suggest someÂ specific types of arrhythmias.
