As previously stated, the sleep cycle is regulated by the circadian rhythm, which is driven by the SCN. The circadian rhythm also controls the nocturnal release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, melatonin, and norepinephrine (NE).

Although it is apparent that humans need sleep, the current understanding of precisely why sleep is an essential part of life is still yet to be determined. We might suggest that the primary value of sleep is to restore natural balances among neuronal centers, which is necessary for overall health. However, the specific physiological functions of sleep remain a mystery and are the subject of much research. The current hypotheses as to the function of sleep include:

- Neural maturation

- Facilitation of learning or memory

- Targeted erasure of synapses to "forget" unimportant information that might clutter the synaptic network

- Cognition

- Clearance of metabolic waste products generated by neural activity in the awake brain

- Conservation of metabolic energy
