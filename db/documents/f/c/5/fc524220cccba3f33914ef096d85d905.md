Crigler-Najjar type I syndrome has a poor prognosis. It may require emergent treatment during the hyperbilirubinemia crisis. Once a patient develops kernicterus, it may be irreversible. Due to some activity of the UGT enzyme, Crigler-Najjar type II syndrome presents with mild symptoms, and can even be asymptomatic, and has a better prognosis than type I.
