Rh-hemolytic disease presents clinically as jaundice, anemia, and serum indicates unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Bilirubin is conjugated to be excreted from the body by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1. UGT1A1 enzyme deficiency or excessive production of bilirubin is responsible for this state.

The most common cause of pathological hyperbilirubinemia is breast milk-induced jaundice due to probable caloric deficiency in these breastfed infants and the influence of breast milk on the UDP-glucuronyltransferase enzyme system.

Other important causes for this physiopathology are ABO incompatibility, hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary enzyme deficiencies, fetomaternal hemorrhage, twin transfusion syndrome, thalassemia, especially alpha thalassemia, and thrombotic microangiopathies. Investigations to differentiate these conditions from Rh-incompatibility are complete blood count with differential, peripheral blood smear, conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin levels, liver function tests (serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and albumin level), serum blood markers to differentiate intravascular hemolysis causes from extravascular causes (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase level, hemosiderin level in blood and urine, haptoglobin level), reticulocyte count, RDW (red cell distribution width), and direct and indirect Coomb's test.
