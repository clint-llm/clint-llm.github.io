Neonatal hypertension is often missed or undiagnosed in infants admitted to the newborn nursery and is picked up incidentally on routine follow up visits. Early diagnosis and timely treatment are important in this population to prevent end-organ damage and adverse long-term sequelae. The pharmacological management is a challenge for neonatologists as very few agents have been studied for their efficacy and safety in this age group. A lack of the normative data and definition adds to the uncertainties in managing hypertension presenting during the neonatal period and infancy.

There are no clear cut guidelines, espy about the timing of starting antihypertensive treatment and the management of milder forms. As most infants require short term therapy (10 days on average) and many ameliorate spontaneously with time, a judicious approach based on the infant's condition and other associated factors should be considered. In moderate NH, starting treatment with oral and in severe NH introducing IV therapy is recommended.
