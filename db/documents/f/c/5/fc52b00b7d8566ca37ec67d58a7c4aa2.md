Since the 1950s, tympanoplasty has been performed in patients with CSOM with the aim of reducing infection recurrence and refining hearing and, in turn, improving social development and quality of life. Methods of tympanoplasty have evolved over time; however, despite the increase in uptake of endoscopic middle ear surgery, a postauricular approach using an autologous graft is still the predominant surgical method in many centers.
