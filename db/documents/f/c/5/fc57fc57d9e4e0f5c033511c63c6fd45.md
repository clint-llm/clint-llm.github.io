The most common causes of bowel necrosis are acute arterial obstruction from a thrombo-embolism with underlying atrial fibrillation, through a patent foramen ovale, or from frank perforation and bacterial invasion. Less common causes are venous thrombosis, chronic ischemia, autoimmune disease, mechanical obstruction, and non-obstructive mesenteric ischemia. These conditions are typically seen in patients with severe vascular pathology and other comorbidities and are theorized to be a combination of infectious agents, inflammatory mediators, and reperfusion injury leading to ischemia, perforation, and bowel necrosis.
