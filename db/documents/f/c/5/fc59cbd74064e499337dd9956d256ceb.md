Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE), also known as epithelioid hemangioma, is an uncommon, benign vasoproliferative disorder. The pathogenesis of ALHE is not clearly understood. It usually presents with papules or nodules involving mostly the head and neck region. Rarely, the lesions can appear in other sites of the body or affect extracutaneous tissues. The objective of the treatment is to address cosmetic issues and allow symptomatic relief. Multiple treatment modalities have been attempted, but unfortunately none of them with reproducible success. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical history and physical exam findings in a patient with angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia.
- Explain the typical histopathological findings associated with angiolymphoid hyperplasia.
- List the therapeutic options for angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia.
