Although the diagnosis of PLEVA is mainly clinical and aided by dermatoscopy, a histologic evaluation of lesional skin is imperative due to the numerous differential diagnoses with similar presentations. Punch biopsies are recommended to ensure that the epidermis and dermis can be appropriately evaluated. Immunohistochemical studies can aid in confirming the diagnosis and typically show CD8-positive T lymphocytes along with negative CD30 stains (to rule out lymphomatoid papulosis).

Serological studies are not specific for PLEVA, but findings, including leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, can be seen in FUMHD.
