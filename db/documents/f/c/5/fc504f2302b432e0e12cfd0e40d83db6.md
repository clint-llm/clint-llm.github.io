An open fracture is an injury where the fractured bone and/or fracture hematoma are exposed to the external environment via a traumatic violation of the soft tissue and skin. The skin wound may lie at a site distant to the fracture and not directly over it. Therefore, any fracture that has a concomitant wound should be considered open until proven otherwise. This activity examines when this condition should be considered on a differential diagnosis and how to properly evaluate for it. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Define an open vs a closed fracture.
- Review the workup procedure for an open fracture, including diagnostic imaging, laboratory studies, and empiric care where appropriate.
- Outline the management and followup for an open fracture, both surgical and post-surgical.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes with the treatment of open fractures.
