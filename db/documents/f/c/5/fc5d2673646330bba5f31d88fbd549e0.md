Femoral neck fractures (FNFs) are extremely common. FNFs demonstrate a bimodal distribution pattern, occurring secondary to low-energy falls in elderly patients and higher-energy traumatic mechanisms in younger patients. This activity reviews the key operative techniques and surgical management options, including the recent advances, for managing FNFs in the elderly and young populations. Intracapsular FNFs account for approximately 50% of all hip fractures. The majority of these fractures occur in elderly patients with underlying osteoporosis. This activity describes the pathophysiology of FNFs and emphasizes the importance of the interprofessional team in the preoperative workup of these patients to improve outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures involved in a femoral neck fracture.
- Describe the surgical techniques for managing a femoral neck fracture.
- Review the early and late complications of surgery to fix FNFs.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the preoperative workup of patients undergoing surgery and improve outcomes.
