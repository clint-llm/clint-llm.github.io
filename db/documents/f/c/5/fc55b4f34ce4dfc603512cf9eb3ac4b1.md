Insulin is a peptide hormone comprised of 51 amino acids distributed among two peptide chains, the A and B chains of 21 and 30 amino acid residues, respectively. Disulfide bonds of cysteine residues connect the 2 chains. Preproinsulin is the original precursor protein of insulin. It is a single-chain polypeptide consisting of proinsulin and signal peptide sequences. Upon its translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum, preproinsulin is cleaved at its signal peptide, releasing proinsulin.  Proinsulin is a single-chain containing insulin’s A, and B chains in a continuous fashion joined through a segment known as the C domain. Dibasic residues flank the C domain at each end. At the site of each dibasic residue, a trypsin-like enzyme cleaves proinsulin. This cleavage finally releases insulin along with a C-peptide. Until it is metabolically needed, insulin is stored within glucose-regulated secretory vesicles as zinc insulin hexamers.
