Despite MI's existence and extensive use over the past 40 years, researchers do not fully understand how it works to illicit changes in behavior. MI was developed using clinical experience and intuition in a bottom-up approach rather than top-down from the framework created by theory.

There are three predominant hypotheses regarding how MI creates behavioral changes; the Technical Hypothesis, the Relational Hypothesis, and the conflict resolution hypothesis.

The technical hypothesis is the most widely researched of the hypotheses. It predicts that the healthcare professional's proficiency in the technical skills of MI shapes the patient's behavior and allows them to talk themselves into behavioral changes.

The provider utilizes reinforcement and evocation to lead the patient towards change talk and to decrease sustain talk. Some studies estimate a 62 to 83% increased probability that the provider's questions will elicit change talk in their patients.

The Relational hypothesis predicts that the relationship between the healthcare provider and the patient will lead to positive behavioral changes as they collaborate and focus on the problem. Empathy and patient-centeredness are the key skills associated with this hypothesis and allow the provider to ensure the patient retains their autonomy in making their own healthcare decisions.

There has been significantly less research performed on this hypothesis than the technical one, likely due to the greater variability in how a provider displays empathy and the non-specific nature of the content. Additionally, early studies on the effects of relational factors on outcomes have been mixed.

The conflict resolution hypothesis prioritizes exploring and resolving patient ambivalence to change.

At least one study has been performed regarding addressing patient ambivalence and commitment to change in drinking habits. It concluded that focusing on ambivalence did not consistently predict positive outcomes, especially in those individuals who were at lower stages of change and did not resolve their internal conflicts regarding that change. Additionally, a focus on commitment to change did indicate positive results.
