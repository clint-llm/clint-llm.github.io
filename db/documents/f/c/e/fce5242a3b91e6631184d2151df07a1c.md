**Normal Thyroid Physiology During Pregnancy**

During pregnancy, there are increased metabolic needs of the maternal body resulting in changes in thyroid physiology. These changes in thyroid physiology reflect in altered thyroid function tests. The different changes occurring in thyroid physiology are as follow:

- An increase in serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) leading to an increase in the total T4 and total T3 concentrations. Their levels peak by approximately week 16 of gestation and remain high until delivery.

- Stimulation of the thyrotropin (TSH) receptor by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) which increases thyroid hormone production and subsequently reduces serum TSH concentration.

Therefore, compared to the non-pregnant state, women tend to have lower serum TSH concentrations during pregnancy. Studies have shown that 15% of healthy women during the first trimester of pregnancy have TSH below the non-pregnant lower limit of 0.4 mU/L.

**Trimester-Specific Ranges**

The serum TSH concentration is the initial and most reliable measure of thyroid function during pregnancy.

**Iodine Requirement During Pregnancy**

There is an increase in iodine requirement during pregnancy due to an increase in maternal thyroid hormone production as well as an increase in renal iodine clearance. Along with the above two factors, there is also a fetal iodine requirement; therefore, dietary iodine requirements are higher during pregnancy.
