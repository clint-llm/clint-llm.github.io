The treatment varies based on the severity of polyhydramnios and its underlying cause. Idiopathic and mild polyhydramnios rarely require treatment.

Reductive amniocentesis is beneficial and recommended only as a symptomatic treatment for pregnant women with significant respiratory complaints associated with restricted diaphragmatic movement and for those with substantial discomfort associated with excessive amniotic fluid.

Indomethacin, a prostaglandin synthetase inhibitor, has demonstrated the ability to decrease amniotic fluid volume and is useful as a tocolytic in preterm labor.

The delivery timing depends on the severity of polyhydramnios, underlying congenital malformations, and presentation of preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes. Mild and idiopathic polyhydramnios are not indications for labor induction, and the mode of delivery should be based on the usual labor characteristics determined by maternal and fetal factors. When pregnant women with polyhydramnios present in labor, an ultrasound should determine fetal presentation. An external cephalic version (ECV) may be performed for breech presentation without contraindications. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is recommended during labor. There is an associated risk for delayed first stage of labor due to uterine overdistension and an increased rate of amniotomy. The risk of cord prolapse increases due to the lack of fetal head engagement, which warrants cesarean delivery.

The risk of shoulder dystocia increases due to fetal macrosomia risk, with a reported increased incidence of fetal weight exceeding 4000 grams.

There is no consistent evidence to support bed rest to prevent complications associated with polyhydramnios, and bed rest is associated with increased risk for venous thromboembolic disease in pregnancy.
