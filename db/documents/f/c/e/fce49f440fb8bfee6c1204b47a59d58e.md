The ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the trigeminal nerve provide the sensory innervation of the external nose. The ophthalmic branch supplies the nose with its three branches, which are the supratrochlear, the infratrochlear and the external nose nerve. The external nose nerve innervates the tip and the posterior part of the nose. The maxillary branch supplies the nose with its two branches, the infraorbital nerve, and the nasopalatine nerve. The infraorbital nerve innervates the tip, the ala and the lateral parts of the nose, while the nasopalatine nerve innervates the nasal septum.
