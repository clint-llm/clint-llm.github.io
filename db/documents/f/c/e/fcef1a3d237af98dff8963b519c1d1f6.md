Suspected cases of rubella should be notified immediately to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Once the diagnosis of rubella is confirmed, the patient should be promptly isolated for at least 7 days after onset of the rash. Because rubella is transmitted primarily by inhalation of virus-laden airborne droplets, standard and droplet precautions are recommended for hospitalized patients. The management of congenital rubella syndrome should include a multidisciplinary team, as previously discussed. Children with congenital rubella syndrome can shed the virus in saliva and urine for several months and therefore are contagious. These individuals should be isolated until two pharyngeal or urine cultures have negative results.
