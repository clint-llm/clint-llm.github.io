When a patient with bilateral and symmetric optic neuropathy is encountered, it is recommended that the following tests be routinely performed:

- Blood tests for vitamin B12 levels and serum cobalamin levels

- Levels of vitamin B12 metabolites (serum methylmalonic acid and plasma total homocysteine)

- Complete blood count (CBC) with smear analysis to rule out anemia, macrocytosis, and neutrophil hypersegmentation

- Levels of intrinsic factor and parietal cell antibodies to rule out pernicious anemia

- Red blood cell folate levels are a more reliable indicator of tissue stores than serum folate levels)

- Plasma total homocysteine level

To investigate the presence of copper deficiency, serum, and urinary copper levels, as well as various hematologic parameters like anemia, and neutropenia, the presence of vacuolated myeloid precursors and ringed sideroblasts should be checked. Levels of niacin, riboflavin, pyridoxine, and thiamine should also be tested in all patients to assess for vitamin deficiencies.
