Wilson disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by abnormal copper accumulation in the body particularly involving the brain, liver, and cornea. It affects 1 in 30,000 individuals and may present as weakness, abdominal pain, jaundice, personality change, seizures, etc. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Wilson disease and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of Wilson disease.
- Summarize the faulty copper excretory mechanism in the pathophysiology of Wilson disease.
- Identify the Kayser-Fleischer rings in the physical examination of patients with Wilson disease.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to provide genetic counseling in order to prevent the transmission of the defective gene in Wilson disease.
