Cavernous sinus thrombosis (CST) is a rare, life-threatening disorder that can complicate facial infection, sinusitis, orbital cellulitis, pharyngitis, or otitis or following traumatic injury or surgery, especially in the setting of a thrombophilic disorder. The disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a primary care provider (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, family physician) ophthalmologist, neurosurgeon, neurologist, infectious disease expert, hematologist, and an emergency department physician.

Early recognition of cavernous sinus thrombosis which, often presents with fever, headache, eye findings such as periorbital swelling, and ophthalmoplegia, is critical for a good outcome. Despite modern treatment with antibiotics and anticoagulation, the risk of long-term sequelae, such as vision, diplopia, and stroke, remains significant.

As many as 50% of survivors might have sequelae, most commonly third or sixth nerve palsy.  Other complications can include sepsis, meningitis, subdural empyema, brain abscess, blindness, panhypopituitarism, intracranial hypertension, infectious arteritis or mycotic aneurysm of the internal carotid artery, vasospasm, septic emboli, stroke from carotid narrowing, cortical vein thrombosis or hemorrhagic infarction, coma, and death. Mortality rates as high as 80% in the era before antibiotics have diminished to below 8% to 13%.
