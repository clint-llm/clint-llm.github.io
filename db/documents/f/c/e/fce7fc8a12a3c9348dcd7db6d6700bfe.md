Disruption of the integrity of the corneal epithelium activates a highly regulated cascade over 7 to 14 days comprising proliferation and migration of epithelial cells, adherence to the underlying intact basement membrane, extracellular matrix remodeling, and eventual apoptosis or quiescence.

The epithelium takes approximately seven days to develop, regenerate and adhere to the intact basement membrane. The stroma can adhere to this layer only following re-epithelialization, failing which tissue defects can develop. This entire process involves a complex interplay of various growth factors and cellular signals, namely epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), keratocyte growth factor (KGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β).

Any variation in this highly regulated process can result in abnormally slow healing. For example, if the stroma is affected along with the basement membrane, the epithelium will take around eight weeks for complete reattachment, resulting in a PED. The defect extends into the stroma and involves the proliferation of myofibroblasts with the resultant disordered extracellular matrix, developing ulceration, stromal melting, and scarring.
