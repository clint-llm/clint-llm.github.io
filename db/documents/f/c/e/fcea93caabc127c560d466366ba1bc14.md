Uncal herniation occurs when rising intracranial pressure causes portions of the brain to move from one intracranial compartment to another. It is a life-threatening neurological emergency and indicates the failure of all adaptive mechanisms for intracranial compliance. This activity describes the risk factors, evaluation, and management of uncal herniation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care delivery for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of uncal herniation.
- Review signs and symptoms that should prompt consideration of uncal herniation.
- Identify the workup that should be done in a patient suspected of having uncal herniation.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of uncal herniation and improve outcomes.
