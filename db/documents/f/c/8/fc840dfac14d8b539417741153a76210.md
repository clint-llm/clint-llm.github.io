Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are in the same disease spectrum. The only difference is the severity of skin affection. If epidermal detachment is less than 10% of the total body surface area, it is SJS. While if the affected body surface area is more than 30%, this is considered TEN. Overlap between the two conditions occurs when the affected body surface area is between 10 to 29%. The main differential diagnosis is erythema multiform major (EMM). It mainly affects less than 10% of body surface area and is characterized by the symmetric acral distribution of target lesions with or without blister formation. In contrast, SJS and TEN consist mainly of skin blisters arising on erythematous macules in central distribution (face and trunk). Moreover, 2 or more mucous membranes are involved in 90% of SJS and TEN cases.

Other differential diagnoses include:

- Other drug rashes

- Toxic shock syndrome(usually present with early multiorgan failures and unique cutaneous manifestations in the form of macular rashes affecting palm and soles that later on evolve to desquamation over the period of 14 days)

- Paraneoplastic pemphigus(as a mucocutaneous manifestation of malignancy)

- Exfoliative erythroderma(usually affects skin only and spares mucous membrane and is painless in most of the cases)

- Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in children: (evidence of staphylococcal infection, no history of drug intake, and it usually spares mucus membranes)

Skin biopsy is also an important tool to differentiate TEN and SJS from these disorders.
