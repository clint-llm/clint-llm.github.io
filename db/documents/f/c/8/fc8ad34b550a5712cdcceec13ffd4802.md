The peroneus longus muscle arises from the head and upper lateral side of the fibula and inserts on the base of the first metatarsal, medial cuneiform. Its tendon passes inferior to the cuboid bone in a bone tunnel termed the cuboid tunnel and inserts onto the plantar surface of the foot on the medial cuneiform. However, several variants exist that may possess one or more accessory tendinous slips that insert into other neighboring bones or tendons. These physiologic variants are clinically important because the peroneus longus muscle is involved in several pathologies, including traumatic injury, tendinitis, dislocation, acute rupture, and chronic tear. Some of these may be more common with certain physiologic variants. A recent study described common physiologic variants in cadaveric specimens.

A table describing the incidence of various bony insertions of the peroneus longus tendon appears below.Â The description of the most common insertions of the peroneus longus tendon may help physicians better understand the symptoms associated with peroneus longus tendon pathologies and the role played by the tendon in maintaining the arch of the foot.

- The base of 1st metatarsal: 30 specimens, 100%

- Medial cuneiform: 26 specimens, 86.6%

- The neck of the 1st metatarsal: 3 specimens, 10%

- The base of the 2nd metatarsal: 6, 20%

- The base of the 4th metatarsal: 5, 16.6%

- The base of the 5th metatarsal: 7, 23.3%
