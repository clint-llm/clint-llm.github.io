The prevalence of NMOSD is approximately 0.3–4.4 per 100,000.

NMOSD occurs worldwide, and most information on the disorder is limited to the economically advantaged countries, likely due to the relative ease of access to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and targeted antibody testing compared to emerging countries.

Ethnicity appears to play a role in the phenotype of the disease. A study done in Cuba showed that black African heritage patients with NMOSD were older, had more lesions on MRI, and more relapses than comparable patients of other ethnicities.

NMOSD can correlate with other auto-immune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, celiac disease, Sjögren syndrome, and sarcoidosis.
