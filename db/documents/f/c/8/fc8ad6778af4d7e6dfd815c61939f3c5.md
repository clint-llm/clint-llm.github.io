In patients with risk factors for atherosclerotic vascular disease, it can be confused with the acute coronary syndrome.

Patients usually present with complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, fever and on examination may have a pericardial friction rub.

Laboratory tests will be positive for markers of inflammation like erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and white cell count.

Cardiac biomarkers will be elevated in patients with myopericarditis. An electrocardiogram may have changes of pericarditis, but in patients with significant pericardial effusion and myocarditis, typical changes may not be seen.

An echocardiogram is routinely performed to assess the degree of pericardial effusion and left the ventricular function.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may provide, additional information to quantify the extent of inflammation in the myocardium.

Patients with predominant pericarditis features are treated with high dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, while in patients with predominant myocarditis features, these drugs have to be used with caution.
