The pathogenesis of osteoarthritisÂ is multifactorial and interrelated. There are three major processes, including mechanical wear-and-tear, structural degeneration, and joint inflammation. The main process is believed to be due to the overuse of the joint and aging, although increased levels of several cytokines and chemokines in the affected joints' synovium suggest an inflammatory process is also present. Matrix metalloproteinases are activated and cause degradation of the cartilage extracellular matrix. The stress to cartilage promotes chondrocyte proliferation and activation, leading to the production of matrix-degrading enzymes. Later in the disease, chondrocytes undergo apoptosis, and the number of cells decreases overall.

On the anatomic level, OA's earliest process is articular cartilage damage, including surface fibrillation, irregularity, and focal erosions. Cartilage damage causes chondrocyte proliferation, and outgrowths can ossify and form osteophytes or bone spurs.

Subchondral bone sclerosis and bone cyst formation occur later in the disease and may increase joint stiffness and pain. Advanced disease results in episodic synovitis. Although rare, bony erosions may occur in erosive OA.
