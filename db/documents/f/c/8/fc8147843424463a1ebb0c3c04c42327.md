During the third month of gestation, the cartilaginous optic foramen  forms. The cartilaginous optic foramen gets ossified between week 12 and 17 of gestation. During the fifth month of fetal development, the bony optic foramen transforms into the bony optic canal. This transformation is dependent on the normal development of the optic strut, the lower part of the sphenoidal wing, into an anterior-inferior and a posterior-superior segment.

Orbital development exhibits a linear growth. The growth rate is different at various stages of fetal growth. The optic canal reaches its peak growth potential when a fetus reaches 400 mm in length.

While the diameter of the cranial opening portion of the optic canal grows the most during the gestational period, this diameter continues to grow during childhood and into adulthood.

Assessing the proper formation and growth of the optic canal is essential when studying the various ocular malformations such as ocular hypertelorism, hypotelorism, anophthalmos, and microphthalmos. These congenital abnormalities affect the shape of the optic canal. Orbital defects in fetuses can be assessed using ultrasound or MRI.
