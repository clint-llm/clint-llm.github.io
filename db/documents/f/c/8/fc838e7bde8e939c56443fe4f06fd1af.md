**Cardiopulmonary arrest:**Cardiopulmonary arrest and/or sudden death occurred in 2% of patients. Use with caution in patients with a history of coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias.

**Infusion reactions:**Serious infusion reactions occurred with the administration of cetuximab in approximately 3% of patients in clinical trials, with fatal outcomes reported in less than 1 in 1000. Immediately interrupt and permanently discontinue cetuximab infusion for serious infusion reactions. In most subjects with a hypersensitivity reaction to cetuximab, IgE antibodies against cetuximab were present in serum before therapy. The antibodies were specific for galactose alpha-1,3-galactose. The presence of this oligosaccharide is related to the production of cetuximab in a murine cell line. Anaphylaxis in response to cetuximab is a significant clinical problem in the Southeastern United States, with a grade 3/4 infusion reaction rate of 14%.

**Dermatologic toxicity**: An acne-like or maculopapular rash, a characteristic side effect of EGFR blockade, is due to the role of EGFR in maintaining the integrity of the skin. There are reports of acneiform rash in 76% to 88% of patients (severe in 1% to 17%), usually developing within the first two weeks of therapy, may require dose modification, generally resolved after discontinuation in most patients, although persisted beyond 28 days in some patients. The acneiform rash should have treatment with topical and/or oral antibiotics; topical corticosteroids are not recommended.

**Interstitial lung disease**: use with caution in patients with preexisting lung disease.

**Electrolyte abnormality**: Hypomagnesemia is common (may be severe). Because EGFR strongly expresses in the kidney, particularly in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, where 70% of filtered magnesium gets reabsorbed, EGFR blockade may interfere with magnesium transport. Because symptoms may ameliorate rapidly with supplementation, when fatigue or hypocalcemia occurs during cetuximab therapy, serum magnesium levels should be measured, with repletion as necessary. The onset of electrolyte disturbance may occur within days to months after initiation of treatment; monitor magnesium, calcium, and potassium during treatment and for at least eight weeks after completion.
