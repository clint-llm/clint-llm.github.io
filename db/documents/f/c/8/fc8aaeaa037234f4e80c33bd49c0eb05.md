Diagnosis and management of traumatic and tension pneumothoraces require a high level of cooperation among interprofessional healthcare team members. The timely and accurate evaluation leads to early interventions decreasing mortality and morbidity. In these situations, care coordination is vital, and having different team members trained and ready to act promptly is life-saving. The first-line responders when a patient develops a traumatic or tension pneumothorax vary depending on the situation and underlying etiology. In the case of trauma, this usually happens outside the hospital or in the emergency department (ED). In these cases, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), ED nurses, and providers have a role in recognizing this entity promptly and initiating early interventions.

In the case of iatrogenic or tension pneumothoraces in the hospital, this is usually in the ITU settings, the operating room, or a procedure suite. Thus, having personnel trained in emergency assessment of pneumothoraces and having an emergency kit for thoracotomies, intubation, and patient stabilization is essential. Once the patient is stabilized, this condition is managed by an interdisciplinary team, and input from each member is critical for successful patient outcomes. This includes ITU team members, surgeons, nurses, respiratory therapists, the radiology team, and pulmonologists.
