There are several important things that patients should be made aware of if cornea arcus are observed on a physical exam. The first thing they should be made aware of is the lack of direct clinical significance, the arcus are not going to affect their vision, and they are unlikely to have any complications because of them. One of the concerns patients are likely to have are cosmetic, and patients should be reassured and comforted in regards to this. They should also be made aware that the arcus may be a complication of an underlying condition; which may need to be assessed. They should also be made aware that the arcus are unlikely to regress, even if the underlying condition is assessed. Patients should also be consoled on the cosmetic implication of the arcus.
