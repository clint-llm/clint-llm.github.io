There are no management guidelines or specific proven treatment to date. Management is similar to the one for Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome or alcohol abuse disorder. Most of the case reports of MBD have shown a favorable response to the endovenous administration of thiamine, folate, and vitamin B complexes as well as high-dose corticosteroids

- Thiamine, in normal saline or 5% dextrose
- **Alcohol withdrawal syndrome:**100 to 250 mg/QD IV/IM for 3 to 5 days, followed by 100 mg/tid orally for 1 to 2 weeks. Concluding with 100 mg/QD orally. Adding benzodiazepines is almost always necessary in these patients.
- **Properly MBD or****Wernicke encephalopathy:**
- Prophylaxis: 100 to 250 mg/QD IV/IM for 3 to 5 days, followed by 100 mg/tid orally for 1 to 2 weeks. Concluding in 100 mg/QD orally.
- Treatment: 200 to 500 mg/tid IV for 2 to 7 days. If the response is adequate, continue with 250 mg/QD IV/IM for 3 to 5 days (or until there is a maximum clinical improvement) followed by 30 mg/bid orally orÂ 100 mg/tid orally for 1 to 2 weeks, concluding with 100 mg/QD orally.

- B Complex pills can be administered as needed.

- Amantadine

- Folic acid can be administered as 1 to 5 mg/QD orally to treat or prevent megaloblastic and macrocytic anemias.
