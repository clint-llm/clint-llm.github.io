There is no definitive treatment for NF-1 as it is a genetic disorder with multiple manifestations.

- Tumors are treated based on the type, involvement of other structures, and associated complications. Radiation therapy in NF-1 is associated with the emergence of secondary tumors, thereby opting for radiation only in essential cases.

Newer advances in therapy include:

- Tumor-tropic cell carriers harboring therapeutic gene

- Oncolytic Virotherapy

- Suicide gene therapy

- Tumor Suppressor Gene Therapy

- Immunomodulatory Gene (IFN-Î²) Interleukin-12, and

- Gene Target Therapy.

- Optic pathway gliomas and other low-grade gliomas should be closely monitored for symptoms, visual acuity, and size. Chemotherapy with vincristine, carboplatin, and vinblastine is the first-line therapy in children.

- There is no standard management available for cNF. Surgical removal gives excellent cosmetic results for plexiform NF. CO laser ablation, laser photocoagulation, electro-drying, and radiofrequency ablation are fast and effective but can cause depigmentation, hyperpigmentation, or extensive scarring.

- Seizures or epilepsy should thoroughly be investigated as a neurosurgical intervention is sometimes very beneficial for the patient.

- Children with learning or cognitive disabilities and neurologic impairment should work closely with speech, occupational, and physical therapists.

- Skeletal abnormalities like dysplasias, pseudoarthrosis, and scoliosis might require orthopedic correction.

- Psychotherapy and counseling can assist with psychosocial functioning and boost morale.

- Follow-up every 12 months is recommended to assess for different complications of the disease.

- All infants are screened with cranial MRI to look for neurological abnormalities.

- Genetic counseling is very important in disease management. Informing the patients about the different complications of the disease is very important. And it should be made very clear to the patients regarding their children that 50% are likely to be affected, and the condition may be severe. First-degree relatives who have no disease manifestations are unlikely to carry the gene, and the risk for their offspring is small but not absent.
