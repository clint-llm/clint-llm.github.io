Although most patients heal exceptionally well, the most common complications are a slight separation of the labial edge closure or a small fistula, occurring in less than 2% of cases. These can typically be repaired under local anesthesia within 4 to 6 months from surgery. Major dehiscence is rare if performed as stated. Chronic scar discomfort or interference with intercourse are very rare and can be corrected. Occasionally, the labia or scars may stretch back over time, but this can be easily revised. If the labia still protrude too far after maximal ‘V’ excision, then medial and lateral elliptical excisions can be performed later, but this is rarely necessary.
