The importance of advance care planning cannot be emphasized enough. Though a challenging subject for both physicians and patients it is necessary to ensure patient autonomy and implement care preferences when patients are incapacitated. It is a proactive and continual process that may need to be revisited based on any changes in a patient’s medical condition. Currently, there are no set guidelines to instruct physicians, but the evidence does exist to guide conversations and improve implementation. Advance directives, not only become important when the patient is hospitalized but also during outpatient procedures when there are no admission orders but interventions may still have a risk for adverse outcomes, such as anesthesia or procedural complications.

Advance directive documents are often many pages long also covering other legal issues and the procedural team may not be familiar with the patient's wishes from prior encounters. It is therefore particularly important to address DNI and DNR status with the patient or their surrogate prior to interventions, especially those that do require intubation. Any temporary changes in DNR and/or DNI status should be documented in the chart prior to the procedure, DNR/DNI orders should be changed if necessary during the procedural period and then changed again back to the original order after the procedural period.
