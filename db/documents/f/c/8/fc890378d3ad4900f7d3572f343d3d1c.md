Tamoxifen is indicated for the treatment of breast cancer in a variety of settings. It should be noted that evidence suggests that patients with estrogen receptor-positive tumors are more likely to benefit from tamoxifen. FDA-approved Indications include treatment of breast cancer in both females and males, adjuvant treatment of breast cancer after patients have completed their primary treatment with surgery and radiation, treatment of female patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (non-invasive breast cancer) after surgery, and radiation to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer, and breast cancer risk reduction in certain patients at high risk. Tamoxifen also has many off-labeled uses, and they may require additional data. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of tamoxifen, so providers can direct patient therapy in treating indicated disorders as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the mechanism of action of tamoxifen.
- Identify the approved indications of tamoxifen, and cite some of the non-approved indications as well.
- Review the adverse event profile of tamoxifen therapy.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use tamoxifen to improve patient outcomes in the varied scenarios where it can be effective.
