CABG is generally recommended when there are high-grade blockages in any of the major coronary arteries and/or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has failed to clear the blockages. Class 1 recommendations from the 2011 ACCF/AHA guidelines areÂ as follows

- Left main disease greater than 50%

- Three-vessel coronary artery disease of greater than 70% with or without proximal LAD involvement

- Two-vessel disease: LAD plus one other major artery

- One or more significant stenosis greater than 70% in a patient with significant anginal symptoms despite maximal medical therapy

- One vessel disease greater than 70% in a survivor of sudden cardiac death with ischemia-related ventricular tachycardia
