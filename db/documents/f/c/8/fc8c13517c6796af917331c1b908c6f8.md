Newborn screening programs around the nation can successfully detect high arginine levels. However, it is not universal yet; around 12 states do not include it in their analysis. Therefore, in individuals with no such opportunity, a high index of suspicion should rise if they present with regression of development milestones.

Initial steps to be performed after a positive newborn screen are plasma ammonia levels, plasma amino acids, and urine organic acids (with a focus on orotic acid).

Elevated arginine levels (which can rise 4-fold) and ammonia levels (if present, above 200 micrograms/dL), along with increased orotic acid, are suggestive. Subsequent arginase enzyme analysis on red blood cells (less than 1%) or molecular analysis of ARG1Â confirm the diagnosis; however, the latter is considered the first confirmatory step due to the difficulty of performing enzyme analysis.

This initial stage is critical, as there are other types of urea cycle disorders that benefit from arginine administration to reduce ammonia levels by indirectly increasing citrulline levels; at the same time, it attaches ammonia molecules for excretion.
