Mucinous cystadenoma, though uncommon, constitutes about 27% of cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. A detailed evaluation with CT and/or MRI abdomen and discussion with the radiologist to rule out suspicious features is pertinent to plan surgical strategy. When imaging is inconclusive, a gastroenterologist may be involved in performing endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) to characterize the cyst and its relation to the vessels. EUS can also be used simultaneously for the aspiration of cyst fluid to be sent for analysis. Since the condition is more often seen in a comparably younger age group, most patients are fit to undergo surgery. However, a pre-anesthetic check-up is needed to assess the patient's fitness for surgery. Post-surgery patients need to be started on prophylactic thromboprophylaxis. The patient also needs to be started on a spirometer, and physiotherapy for early ambulation is carried out.

Drains kept intra-operatively should be diligently monitored for the quantity and character of the fluid. If this is high, drain fluid amylase needs to be obtained. If the patient has a pancreatic fistula, then the drain is to be kept for a longer duration until the output decreases to less than 30-50 ml. The patient may be discharged with the drain in place if the output is high and the patient is tolerating an oral diet. Further follow-up and care by the supportive staff will be needed in this case.
