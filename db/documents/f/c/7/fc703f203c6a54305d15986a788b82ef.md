Preparation for EBUS begins with obtaining informed consent. The patient should be made aware of the procedural risks and benefits, and care should be taken to ensure that allergy status and clotting function have been checked. The patient should undergo basic observations, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation, and intravenous access should be placed prior to commencing the procedure.

Prior to commencing the procedure, a formal ‘sign-in’ should take place following the principles of the World Health Organisation surgical safety checklist to ensure that equipment is checked, staff members have been introduced to the patient, patient factors have been checked, and that the procedure is safe to go ahead. Conscious sedation should be given in line with local practice, and the procedure can begin.
