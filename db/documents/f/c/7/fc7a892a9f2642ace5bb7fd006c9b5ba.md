Complications are unusual after duodenal biopsies. Abdominal pain may occur after multiple or deep biopsies. The most common complication necessitating intervention is hemorrhage. The gastroduodenal artery and its branches have a variable often close relation to the medial wall of the descending duodenum and may beÂ inadvertently punctured.

Substantial hemorrhage may result in hypotension, and lesser volume loss detected by tilt test maneuvers. Interventions include repeat upper endoscopy with attempted hemostasis, interventional radiology, or rarely surgery. Perforation after duodenal biopsy may require surgery, though conservative management may be a consideration if the defect is small and the patient stable. Ampullary biopsy, whether directed or inadvertent, may result in pancreatitis.
