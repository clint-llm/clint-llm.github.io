The fingertip is the most distal portion of the finger providing the tactile and sensory functions that are then relayed to the brain. It is anatomically defined as the portion of finger distal to the insertion of the flexor digitorum superficialis and extensor tendons on the distal phalanx, or the interphalangeal joint when referring to the thumb. This activity reviews the cause and presentation of fingertip injuries and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of fingertip injuries.
- Describe the evaluation of fingertip injuries.
- Summarize the management of fingertip injuries.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by fingertip injuries.
