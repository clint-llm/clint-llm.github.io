Diabetes mellitus can cause peripheral neuropathies. One of the more common variants is termed diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy. In this case, the patient appears to have femoral neuropathy but has other signs and symptoms that indicate that this is not a true femoral neuropathy, even though it has signs and symptoms consistent with a femoral neuropathy. As with the case above of vaginal delivery, the other symptoms are not consistent with true femoral neuropathy.
