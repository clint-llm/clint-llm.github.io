Conization of the cervix is usually performed by the gynecologist, but it is vital to have a cytopathologist as part of the team to interpret the biopsy. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should educate the patient on the prevention of cervical cancer by emphasizing the importance of safe sex and use of the condom during sexual intercourse. Both males and females should be made aware of the HPV vaccine, which may help prevent or reduce the risk of cervical cancer.
