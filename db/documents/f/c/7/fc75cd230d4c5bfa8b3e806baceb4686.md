An interprofessional approach is very important in the management of Eastern equine encephalitis. This is a nationally notifiable condition, communication between epidemiologists and the health department is vital to understand changing trends and raise awareness if a new outbreak is taking place, especially among physicians, to diagnose EEE promptly. Neurology evaluation could also be considered, depending on the level of confidence of the primary team and theÂ complexity of the case.
