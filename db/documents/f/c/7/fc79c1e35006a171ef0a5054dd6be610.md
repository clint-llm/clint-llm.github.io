Mediastinoscopy is a well-known and common procedure. It is paramount to educate the patient, physicians, all others that are involved in mediastinoscopy cases what to expect before, during, and following the procedure. In many instances, there is a close association of the procedure with a lung cancer diagnosis, and patient care must be well coordinated with other physicians and care staff to make sure the patient is optimized for the procedure. As ultrasonic methods become more advanced endobronchial ultrasound with biopsy of the mediastinum may largely overtake mediastinoscopy, but at this timeÂ both have a major role in thoracic surgery.
