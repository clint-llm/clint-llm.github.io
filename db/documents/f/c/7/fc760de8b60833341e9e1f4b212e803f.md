Disaster care teams assist from the initial response through the final recovery phase of a disaster. The initial response, often local EMS or community members, can typically occur within minutes. The state/regional level of response may take hours. Federal response with DMAT teams can take days. Each level of response in theÂ United States, from local to federal, is guided by an overlying structure called the incident command system (ICS). The ICS integrates management of the emergency under several functional areas: command, operations, logistics, planning, and finance/administration. It is important to understand the idea of ICS and how ICS relates to the management of disaster care teams. Clinicians practicing in a disaster area must be aware of the different levels of response and the chain of command established by the ICS which helps to guide the disaster response. Additionally, clinicians and responders in a disaster area must have the ability to be flexible and expect to work in less than ideal conditions. By understanding the types of disaster care teams available and the idea of ICS, clinicians will be better prepared to respond to a disaster in their hospital or community.
