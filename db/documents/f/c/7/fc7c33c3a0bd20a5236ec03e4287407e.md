Treatment for hyperacusis can broadly be categorized into those which target the physical symptoms, and those which aim to reduce the psychological burden of the condition.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the most effective components of hyperacusis therapy alongside counseling and education.

Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) involves educating the patient about their condition alongside gradual sound enrichment, and its use in hyperacusis is becoming increasingly popular.

Surgery may be indicated in select cases, including those refractory to the above treatments or in conductive hyperacusis secondary to superior semi-circular canal dehiscence syndrome.

Alternative treatments often are given special attention for chronic pain and may include supplements and vitamins, acupuncture, exercise, yoga, meditation, massage, relaxation therapy, and hypnosis.
