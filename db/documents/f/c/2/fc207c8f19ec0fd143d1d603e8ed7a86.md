Microscopic evaluation in active inflammatory bowel diseaseÂ (IBD) patients reveals pronounced infiltration of the lamina propria with a mix of neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer T cells. Increased numbers and activation of these cells, increases the level of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), interleukin-1b, interferon-gamma, and cytokines of the interleukins-23-TH17 pathway.

The histopathology in ulcerative colitis will show the involvement of only the mucosa and submucosa with the formation of cryptic abscesses and mucosal ulcers. Biopsy specimens show neutrophilic infiltrate along with crypt distortion and crypt abscesses. Granulomas are not seen in ulcerative colitis. The disease is contiguous and usually involves the rectum. Another feature of ulcerative colitis is the presence of pseudopolyps. In Crohn disease, the entire intestinal wall is involved and granulomas may be seen. Inflammation in Crohn disease is transmural characterized by lymphocytic infiltrate.
