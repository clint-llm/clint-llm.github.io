Angiogenic precursors stem from embryonic mesoderm tissue.

We can find the right side subclavian artery (SCA) during intrauterine life (seventh week); this comes from the small tract of the dorsal aorta, from the seventh intersegmental artery of the right side and the fourth aortic artery of the right portion. The left SCA derives from the seventh intersegmental artery of the left portion. Around the seventh week, in the cervical tract,Â  the dorsal intersegmental arterial branches, right and left, form different anastomotic unions, creating the longitudinal channels. The latter forms the various branches of the SCA, such as the supreme intercostal artery, the internal thoracic artery, the vertebral artery, the ascending cervical artery, the transverse cervical artery. The thyrocervical trunk derives from the union of the suprascapular artery, the transverse cervical artery, the ascending cervical artery, and the inferior thyroid artery.
