Hypothalamic hamartomas are congenital non-progressive lesions in the hypothalamus that occur during fetal development. Two anatomical subtypes are recognized depending on the location of the mass-like lesion. The first type is the intrahypothalamic lesion that connects with the posterior hypothalamus and third ventricle; they appear near the mamillary bodies and are usually associated with gelastic seizures.
