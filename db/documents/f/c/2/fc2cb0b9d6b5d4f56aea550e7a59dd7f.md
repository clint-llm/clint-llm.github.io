Visual stimuli from our surroundings are processed by an intricate system of interconnecting neurons, which begins with the optic nerve in the eye up to the visual processing center in our forebrain called the visual cortex. All the information travels in the form of nerve impulses that are triggered by photosensitive chemical reactions occurring in the retina. Several separate and parallel pathways code its processing at multiple sites in the nervous system.

Disruption in these pathways and their clinical manifestations offers crucial diagnostics for an underlying disease.
