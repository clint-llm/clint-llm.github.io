Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) is a type of volume control mode of ventilation. With this mode, the ventilator will deliver a mandatory (set) number of breaths with a set volume while at the same time allowing spontaneous breaths. Spontaneous breaths are delivered when the airway pressure drops below the end-expiratory pressure ( trigger). This activity reviews SIMV, and highlights the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in evaluating, managing, and improving care for patients who are treated with SIMV.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications and contraindications of synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation.
- Review the potential complications and clinical significance of synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation and improve outcomes.
