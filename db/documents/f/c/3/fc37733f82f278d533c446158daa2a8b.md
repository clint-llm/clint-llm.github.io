Given that the peliosis hepatis diagnosis is often made on autopsy or is an incidental finding due to an idiopathic cause, interventions are not always necessary. If the condition appears to be secondary to a medical therapy, the medication can be stopped, or if immunosuppression is the likely culprit, the immunosuppression therapy can be switched to an alternate agent. For those individuals who have findings consistent with peliosis hepatis due to other treatable medical conditions, the thinking is that the management of those individual conditions may lead to the regression of the condition. Patients with bacillary peliosis have demonstrated a response to antibiotic therapy in the appropriate setting. There is no current consensus on whether patients with asymptomatic peliosis hepatis warrant routine imaging studies to monitor disease burden or progression. However, some experts believe annual or more frequent evaluation with ultrasound is adequate.
