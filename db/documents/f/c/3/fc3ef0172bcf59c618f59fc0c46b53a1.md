Currently, there is no standardized protocol or specific medications available for the treatment of cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. Patients should receive standard medical therapy for the management of heart failure and undergo evaluation for liver transplantation.

Medical therapy will generally include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), loop and thiazide diuretics, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and beta-blockers. ACE inhibitors are known to reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure but are not recommended in patients with Child-Pugh classes B or C due to the potential to exacerbate systemic vasodilation and increase the risk of hepatorenal syndrome. Loop and thiazide diuretics are used for the management of hypervolemia and represent key elements of treatment. Aldosterone receptor antagonists are used to improve hemodynamics in patients with CCM by curtailing the continuous activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. At presentation, patients with cirrhosis are already likely to be taking beta-blockers to reduce portal hypertension and prevent variceal bleeding. Non-specific beta-blockers,Â in particular carvedilol, have been suggested to more effective in reducing portal hypertension and have been shown to reduce QT prolongation.

Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement is used to reduce portal hypertension in patients with cirrhosis, but this procedure is not expected to improve cardiomyopathy.

As CCM develops due to cirrhosis, liver transplantation is the cornerstone of treatment. Transplantation has been shown to significantly improve systolic and diastolic dysfunction and reverse QT prolongation in 50% of patients. Cardiac benefits are observed within 3 to 12 months following surgery. The extent of cardiac normalization following liver transplantation is currently unknown.
