Most longitudinal long-term studies have shown that most of the patients continue to have chronic pain and fatigue, but the majority of these studies have been from tertiary referral centers. In contrast, patients treated by primary care physicians in the community have a much better prognosis. Many demographic and psychosocial factors significantly impact the prognosis and outcome in patients with fibromyalgia. Female gender, low socioeconomic status, unemployment, obesity, depression, and history of abuse had adverse effects on the outcome.

Overall the prognosis is poor for many patients. Factors associated with poor prognosis include:

- A long duration of disease

- High-stress levels

- Presence of depression or anxiety that has not been adequately treated

- Long-standing avoidance of work

- Alcohol or drug dependence

- Moderate to severe functional impairment
