NSAIDs have relatively few contraindications; however, according to the package insert, they are as follows:

- A history of NSAID or salicylate-induced hypersensitivity and atopic reactions after taking NSAIDs (examples include urticaria, asthma, exfoliative dermatitis, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or Stevens-Johnson Syndrome)

- A previous history of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a contraindication for using indomethacin. Two large clinical trials of NSAID use in the first 14 days following CABG surgery reported an increased stroke and myocardial infarction incidence. Hence NSAIDs are contraindicated in the patients following CABG.

- Indomethacin use can cause premature closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus; consequently, use is contraindicated in pregnant women starting the third trimester of pregnancy (on and after 30 weeks gestation).
