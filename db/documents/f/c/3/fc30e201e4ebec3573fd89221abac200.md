Motor evoked potentials are highly sensitive to anesthetic agents and physiologic derangements.

Neuromuscular blocking drugs weaken or abolish MEPs; thus, muscle relaxants should be avoided during MEP monitoring. Short-acting muscle relaxants (e.g., succinylcholine) can be used to facilitate intubation but should be allowed to wear off after successful intubation. For patients with contraindications to succinylcholine, non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers can be used, though they may need to be reversed for MEP monitoring.

Inhaled anesthetics (isoflurane, desflurane, sevoflurane, nitrous oxide) suppress MEPs in a dose-dependent manner.

Intravenous anesthetics such as propofol suppress MEPs to a lesser degree than inhaled anesthetics.

Benzodiazepines transiently reduce MEP amplitude, though anxiolytic doses of short-acting drugs (e.g., midazolam) can be administered preoperatively without adversely impacting intraoperative readings.

Opioids reduce MEPs, but to a lesser extent than propofol. Thus, opioid infusions are often used during surgery utilizing MEPs to reduce propofol or inhaled anesthetic requirements and decrease the likelihood of spontaneous patient movement. Commonly utilized opioids include infusions of relatively short-acting opioids such as remifentanil, sufentanil, and fentanyl.

Ketamine has been shown to increase the amplitude of evoked potentials.

Dexmedetomidine has minimal impact on MEPs.
