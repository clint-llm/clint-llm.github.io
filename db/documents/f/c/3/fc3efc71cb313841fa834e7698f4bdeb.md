Acute ischemic stroke is one of the most significant causes of mortality and morbidity in the United States. An acute ischemic stroke occurs when there is a sudden onset occlusion of blood supply to an area of the brain. Primary mechanisms of acute ischemic stroke include embolic events and atherothrombosis (a clot forming over an atherosclerotic plaque). Treatment involves recanalization of the affected vessel through mechanical or pharmacological mechanisms.

One of the first pharmacological mechanisms for treatment of acute ischemic strokes was IV recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA). Approved in 1996 in the United States for patients presenting within the first 3 hours of symptoms onset. Recent data support the use of IV-rtPA between 3 to 4.5 hours.

While limited by symptom onset, IV rtPA is still considered one of the gold standards of care in the setting of acute ischemic stroke. Currently, the use of IV rtPA in the setting of acute ischemic stroke in the absence of contraindications is widespread within the United States, and research is ongoing into ways to enhance medical management of acute ischemic events.
