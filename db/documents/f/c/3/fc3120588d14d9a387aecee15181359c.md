Patients on clopidogrel should have monitoring for signs of bleeding, both visibly and via laboratory testing (hemoglobin and hematocrit).

As noted, several patients can have genetic polymorphisms to the CYP enzymes. The CYP2C19 enzyme has been the most studied regarding medication metabolism and response. Genetic testing may be considered in patients prior to initiating therapy in patients at high risk for adverse outcomes (e.g., PCI patients with increased risk of stent thrombosis). However, based on available data, the most optimal dose has been determined. Furthermore, after drug administration, the use of platelet function testing can be used to determine patient response. There are various consensus opinions to the defined threshold for non-responsiveness and optimal strategy for management.
