Generally, the prognosis of tarantula envenomation is good, requiring only conservative management, including local wound care and pain control. Less commonly, more aggressive wound care, including debridement, may be necessary. Pain from a bite/envenomation can last for several hours.Â Pruritus associated with urticating hair exposure is usually self-limiting and responds to symptomatic treatment. In some cases, particularly in envenomation from species belonging to the rare Poeciltheria genus, delayed onset severe muscle cramping can occur and last up to three weeks.
