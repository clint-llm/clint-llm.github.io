Lepidopterism can cause urticaria, headache, nausea, vomiting, upper airway inflammation, and wheezing.

Dendrolimiasis, which can be chronic, results from exposure to the Asian Dendrolimus pini caterpillar.

In Lonomism, the venom of the Lonomia obliqua (giant silkworm moth) caterpillar activates factor X and prothrombin which can lead to coagulopathy.  Suggested mechanisms of toxin-mediated AKI are postulated to be dilation of Bowman's capsule, increased permeability of the tuft capillaries resulting in deposition of fibrinolytic compounds leading to acute tubular necrosis (ATN).
