Risk factors are similar to the known general risk factors for stroke. The most common is hypertension which is found in as many as 70% of cases. Other risk factors include diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, cigarette smoking, and hyperlipidemia.

The frequency, incidence, and prevalence are not well known in the medical literature. 20% of cerebral blood flow goes through the posterior circulation (vertebrobasilar system), it is logical to understand why posterior circulation occlusions account for one-fifth of all strokes. Fortunately, basilar artery occlusions are believed to account for approximately only 1% of all strokes. Basilar artery occlusion has been reported in 2 out of 1000 post-mortem cases. Basilar artery thrombosis may explain as many as 27% of ischemic strokes occurring in the posterior circulation. An increased prevalence exists in males, with a 2:1 ratio. Occlusion due to atherosclerotic disease is most prevalent in patients of advanced age, usually in the sixth and seventh decades of life. Distal basilar artery occlusion is usually secondary to embolism and is most prevalent in the fourth decade of life.
