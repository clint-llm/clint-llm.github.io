Antenatal imaging will show a double bubble, an echoless stomach filled with amniotic fluid, and a second nearby but the more distal fluid-filled, often circular (but blind-ended) structure (the second bubble) that is the obstructed portion of the duodenum.  The use of prenatal ultrasound has allowed for an earlier diagnosis of duodenal atresia.  An advantage of neonatal abdominal ultrasound is that it can be performed in the neonatal intensive care unit or nursery.  When antenatal ultrasound is performed, the duodenum is usually not filled with fluid, and the presence of a fluid-filled duodenum suggests duodenal atresia.  If a double-bubble sign is seen on antenatal ultrasound, then the sonographer needs to demonstrate a connection between the two fluid-filled structures because foregut duplication cyst, as well as other abdominal cysts, may simulate the appearance of a double-bubble sign.

The initial postnatal radiographic evaluation for diagnosing duodenal atresia is a plain abdominal x-ray.  There is gas in the stomach and the proximal duodenum in duodenal atresia but an absence of gas distally in the small or large bowel.  A plain abdominal x-ray may reveal the double-bubble sign, which is seen postnatally as a large radiolucent (air-filled) stomach usually in the normal position to the left of the midline, and a smaller, more distal bubble to the right of the midline, which represents a dilated duodenum.  A double-bubble sign on an abdominal x-ray is a reliable indicator of duodenal atresia.  Other causes of intestinal obstruction may simulate a double-bubble sign.  The annular pancreas is the second most common cause of duodenal atresia.  Jejunal or more distal obstruction may dilate more distally, or more than two bubbles may be present.

In patients with Down syndrome, the x-ray double-bubble has a higher positive predictive value. The prevalence of duodenal atresia in Down syndrome is much higher than in the general population. Further evaluation with additional modalities is not always needed before proceeding to surgery.  Duodenal stenosis can also cause the double-bubble sign; however, if the stenosis is present, at least a small amount of gas may be present distal to the obstruction.  The absence of gas in the stomach on an abdominal x-ray signifies esophageal atresia without a tracheoesophageal fistula.  At times there may be air distal to a segment of duodenal atresia that has entered the distal bowel via an anomalous biliary tree.  The radiographic appearance of the double-bubble sign should prompt immediate surgical consultation.  For cases of suspected duodenal atresia not identified antenatally, barium fluoroscopy can be used to assess the gastrointestinal tract.  If necessary further evaluation with ultrasound or upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) may be performed.  More recently, neonatal ultrasound is very helpful in clarifying the anatomy, especially using the fluid as a contrast agent.

Barium contrast is sometimes administered via an orogastric or nasogastric tube under fluoroscopy to evaluate the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.  Only a controlled amount of barium is placed to confirm obstruction.  It is then removed by a nasogastric tube to prevent reflux and potential aspiration.  The main purpose of the UGI is to differentiate between duodenal atresia and midgut volvulus, an important distinction because midgut volvulus requires emergency surgery. In contrast, duodenal atresia can be managed on an elective basis.

Pediatric CT plays a very limited if any, role in the diagnosis and evaluation of duodenal atresia.  However, a CT reconstruction may allow for further evaluation of bowel layout in confusing cases.  Neonatal CT is more technically challenging as it may require sedation, bundling and, starting a neonatal intravenous line for contrast administration. Additionally, CT does involve ionizing radiation and may be more difficult to interpret because there is less abdominal fat separating abdominal viscera than in older patients.
