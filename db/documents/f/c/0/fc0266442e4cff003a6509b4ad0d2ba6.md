Cockayne syndrome is a rare but serious genetic disorder whose pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. Future goals are to understand how the proteins made by the ERCC6 and ERCC8 genes work in cells and how their dysfunction causes this syndrome. By understanding these mechanisms, new treatments may be discovered.

Studies are underway to identify and specify the characteristics of neurological disorders, including through MRI, which may better diagnose the syndrome.
