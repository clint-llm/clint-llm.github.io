Hazardous materials (HAZMAT) are chemical or radioactive substances that can harm an individual and the environment upon exposure, resulting in different levels of poisoning and medical complications. Exposure can happen after industrial, residential, or transportation incidents and natural disasters. Hazmat incidents are challenging scenarios for emergency medical system response and emergency department care. This activity reviews and describes the hospital and community planning, and the management of hazmat incidents including the use of personal protective equipment and decontamination process, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing hazmat victims.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the importance of community and hospital planning for incidents involving toxic exposure to hazardous materials.
- Describe the management of incidents involving hazardous materials, including the decontamination process.
- Identify the different levels of personal protective equipment required in the response of incidents involving hazardous materials.
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional team strategies and collaboration for improving care coordination for victims affected by toxic exposure to hazardous materials.
