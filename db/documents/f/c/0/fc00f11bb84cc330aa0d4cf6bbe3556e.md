Following identification of a concerning lesion on imaging (calcifications or masses), a core needle biopsy of the lesion is preferable over excisional biopsies for optimal surgical treatment. When performed, a small clip gets placed in the area of the biopsy to confirm the biopsied region as well as mark the location of concern for future surgical treatments. This clip is especially helpful for lumpectomies for non-palpable cancers or DCIS that require radiologic identification. Clip placement is crucial in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy as localization of the tumor can become extremely difficult in patients who achieve significant clinical responses.

The most commonly used approach to this is wire-guided localization. A radiologist or operating surgeon typically performs this procedure on the same day as surgery. Under stereotactic or ultrasound guidance, a wire is inserted through the skin and terminates at the lesion or area of concern.

There are disadvantages to wire-guided localization, including the presence of a foreign body at the pathological assessment, wire transection, migration, patient discomfort, injury associated with wire barbs, and pneumothorax, which have led to the development of alternative localization approaches.
