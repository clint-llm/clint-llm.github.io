Most patients with pulmonary regurgitation are asymptomatic. Those that are symptomatic may present initially with symptoms of exertional dyspnea as a result of reduced cardiac output stemming from the volume overload to the right heart.

In clinical presentations where an underlying pathology is determined as the root cause for pulmonary regurgitation, symptoms of the underlying disease are prominent. Pulmonary regurgitation secondary to pulmonary hypertension may show symptoms of the underlying condition such as left heart disease, chronic lung conditions such as COPD or OSA, or primary pulmonary arterial hypertension.

Auscultation in pulmonary regurgitation would reveal a diastolic decrescendo murmur heard in the 2nd and 3rd left intercostal spaces. Also appreciated is an S3, indicating volume overload. Being a right-sided murmur, the intensity of the murmur would increase during inspiration (owing to the increased preload) and would reduce during the Valsalva maneuver.

It is worth mentioning the changes in auscultatory findings in patients with or without pulmonary arterial hypertension. As a large gradient exists between the pulmonary artery and right ventricle due to elevated pulmonary artery pressures the murmur of PR is diastolic, heard throughout diastole (whereas it is short-lived in cases without pulmonary hypertension), decrescendo, associated with loud P2 and heard in the 2nd and 3rd left intercostal spaces and increases with inspiration.
