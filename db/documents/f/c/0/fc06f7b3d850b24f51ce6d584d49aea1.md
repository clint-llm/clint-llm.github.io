A multidisciplinary approach to this issue is very important. Once a patient has been diagnosed with any disease that is associated with priapism, the treating physician should counsel them about the relative risk of developing it, how to initially treat it at home, and when to seek medical advice. This will help reduce the anxiety associated with the disease and the number of patients who present to the emergency department late with acute ischemic attacks and complications. This also applies to counseling when starting medications with priapism as a potential side effect. Having the hospital pharmacy ready to prepare a diluted phenylephrine treatment pack for intracavernosal injections in patients with priapism can greatly speed up the process and minimize delays in therapy. Quick recognition and prompt treatment of acute attacks in the emergency department will help reduce the incidence of complications like erectile dysfunction and improve treatment outcomes.
