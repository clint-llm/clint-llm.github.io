In the United States, approximately 2 million patients present annually to the emergency department for facial lacerations.

Facial scarring can lead to negative social and functional impacts; timely facial soft tissue trauma management is crucial for maximizing aesthetic outcomes and overall patient satisfaction.

To provide optimal care for patients with facial lacerations, clinicians need to understand the relative anatomy of facial subunits and demonstrate competency in employing appropriate closure techniques and managing common complications associated with facial laceration repair.
