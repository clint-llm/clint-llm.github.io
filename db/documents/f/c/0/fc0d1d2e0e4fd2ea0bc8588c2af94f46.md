In sickle cell disease, polymerization of HbS occurs under conditions of hypoxia, leading to aggregation of the stiff HbS molecules, damaging the RBC cell membrane and cytoskeleton, and producing the characteristic sickle-shaped red blood cells. These sickle-shaped red blood cells are rigid and less deformable. They have a longer transit time across the capillaries of the retina and choroid and increased endothelial adhesion, causing damage to the blood vessels. The endothelium is thought to produce adhesion molecules, and there is also the release of inflammatory mediators, all of which produce vascular occlusion. Repeated vaso-occlusive episodes presumably lead to the production of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and fibroblast growth factor, which subsequently give rise to proliferative retinopathy.

Thalassemia is characterized by the absent or reduced production of hemoglobin chains, leading to inefficient erythropoiesis, which itself can cause ocular damage. However, iron overload due to repeated transfusions and iron chelators can also add on to the ocular damage.
