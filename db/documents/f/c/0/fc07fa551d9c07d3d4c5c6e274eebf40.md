**Hematologic**

Bilirubin, the major pigment of bile, is an end product of heme catabolism that travels to the liver bound to albumin. Once inside the liver, the enzyme uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase (UDPGT) conjugates bilirubin to form bilirubin glucuronide. The water-soluble conjugated bilirubin is then secreted into bile, providing its characteristic yellow color

**Gastrointestinal/Hepatobiliary**

Liver: Site of bile formation, reuptake of bile acids, and reuptake of urobilinogen

Bile ducts: Modify and transport bile, secrete ions and water into bile

Gallbladder: Stores and concentrates bile

Small intestine:

- Bacteria form secondary bile acids via dehydroxylation of primary bile acids

- Bilirubin glucuronide is converted back to bilirubin

- Bacteria convert bilirubin to urobilinogen

Duodenum: Site of lipid digestion and absorption facilitated by bile

Ileum: Site of reabsorption of bile salts

Portal circulation: Transports reabsorbed bile salts back to the liver

Rectum: Urobilin and stercobilin (compounds oxidized from urobilinogen) are responsible for dark fecal pigment.

**Genitourinary**

Some urobilinogen is excreted in the urine
