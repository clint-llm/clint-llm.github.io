Although MNTI mostly presents as a benign neoplasm, malignant behavior is observed in 3% of cases. The 5-year recurrence rate is slightly higher in females than males (25% versus 22%).

- Age: Presentation at an age less than 2-months is associated with higher recurrence. Paradoxically, a presentation greater than 12 months is associated with 75 fold mortality.

- Distant metastasis at presentation is associated with higher recurrence rates and 14-fold higher mortality.

- Location and size of the lesion: The mandible was found to have the highest recurrence rate (33%), followed by the skull (31%) and the maxilla (19%).

- Model of treatment: Curettage is associated with the highest recurrence rate (61%).

- Immunohistochemical markers: Although it is rare, the expression of Ki-67 and CD99 on MNTI is associated with more aggressive behavior of the lesion.
