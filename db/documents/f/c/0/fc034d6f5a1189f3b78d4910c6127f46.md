"**Platybasia**" - an abnormal flattening of the base of the skull was coined by Virchow.

"**Basilar impression,**" also referred to as atlantoaxial impaction or vertical cranial settling, results from softening of the bone at the skull base secondary to:

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- Paget's disease

- Osteomalacia

- Hyperparathyroidism

- Osteogenesis imperfecta

- Hurler syndrome

- Rickets, and

- Skull base infection.

It is speculated that the basilar impression is due to recurrent microfractures from repetitive axial loads. Supporting this theory are intraoperative findings of proliferative callus at the base of the skull in patients with osteogenesis imperfect (OI). One study showed that about 25% of such patients had this defect. Even if treated secondary, basilar invagination potentially has devastating sequelae in osteogenesis imperfect patients and other osteochondrodysplasias such as Hajdu-Cheney syndrome.
