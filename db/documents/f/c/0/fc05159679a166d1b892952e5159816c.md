The most common complication of the Sistrunk procedure is a recurrence of the thyroglossal duct cyst, which occurs in about 10% of cases. Contributing factors to recurrence include incomplete excision, intraoperative rupture, surgical proficiency and experience, and presence of infection. However, recurrence can still occur after technically proficient procedures.

A laryngotracheal injury is a rare and potentially devastating complication of the Sistrunk procedure, resulting in issues with the airway, swallowing,Â and/or voice. It can be caused by erroneous resection of the thyroid cartilage instead of the hyoid bone. Appropriate identification of the hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, and the thyrohyoid membrane is essential to prevent this during surgery.

A hypoglossal injury is also rare but has been reported after the Sistrunk procedure, resulting in paralysis of half of the tongue. The hypoglossal nerve travels lateral to the hyoglossus muscle and medial to the stylohyoid muscle and lingual nerve near the lateral portion of the hyoid bone. It is important to keep the hyoid resection medial to the lesser cornu of the hyoid to avoid hypoglossal injury.
