ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in patients with a history of angioedema or hypersensitivity related to treatment with an ACE inhibitor and those with hereditary or idiopathic angioedema.

These drugs should not be given to patients already taking a direct renin inhibitor such as aliskiren.

ACE inhibitors should not be given during pregnancy. They were Category D in pregnancy under the old FDA system because it is known to cause skull hypoplasia, anuria, hypotension, renal failure, lung hypoplasia, skeletal deformations, oligohydramnios, and death.

The combination therapy of ACEi and ARBs does not reduce mortality in patients with heart failure compared to monotherapy. In fact, the combination therapy can worsen renal indices and cause life-threatening hyperkalemia.
