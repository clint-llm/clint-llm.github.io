Unlike pulmonary tuberculosis,Â cutaneous tuberculosis is not common. Of all the patients that present with extra-pulmonary manifestations of tuberculosis, 1% to 2% suffer from cutaneous tuberculosis. It is more prevalent in parts of the world where infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is common, or where people are immunodeficient for other reasons.
