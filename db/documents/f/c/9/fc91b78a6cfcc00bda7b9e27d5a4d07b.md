Glucose reserves get stored as the polymer glycogen in humans. Glycogen is present in the highest concentrations in the liver and muscle tissues. The regulation of glycogen, and thus glucose, is controlled primarily through the peptide hormones insulin and glucagon. Both of these hormones are produced in the pancreatic Islet of Langerhans, glucagon in from alpha-cells, and insulin from beta-cells. There exists a balance between these two hormones depending on the body's metabolic state (fasting or energy-rich), with insulin in higher concentrations during energy-rich states and glucagon during fasting. Through a process of signaling cascades regulated by these hormones, glycogen is catabolized liberating glucose (promoted by glucagon in times of fasting) or synthesized further consuming excess glucose (facilitated by insulin in times of energy-richness). Insulin and glucagon (among other hormones) also control the transport of glucose in and out of cells by altering the expression of one type of glucose transporter, GLUT4.

There are several types of glucose transporters in the human body with differential expression varying by tissue type. These transporters differentiate into two main categories: sodium-dependent transporters (SGLTs) and sodium-independent transporters (GLUT). The sodium-dependent transporters rely on the active transport of sodium across the cell membrane, which then diffuses down its concentration gradient along with a molecule of glucose (secondary active transport). The sodium-independent transporters do not rely on sodium and transport glucose using facilitated diffusion. Of the sodium-independent transporters, only GLUT4's expression is affected by insulin and glucagon. Below are listed the most important classes of glucose transporters and their characteristics.

- **SGLT**: Found primarily in the renal tubules and intestinal epithelia, SGLTs are important for glucose reabsorption and absorption, respectively. This transporter works through secondary active transport as it requires ATP to actively pump sodium out of the cell and into the lumen, which then facilitates cotransport of glucose as sodium passively travels across the cell wall down its concentration gradient.

- **GLUT1**: Found primarily in the pancreatic beta-cells, red blood cells, and hepatocytes. This bi-directional transporter is essential for glucose sensing by the pancreas, an important aspect of the feedback mechanism in controlling blood glucose with endogenous insulin.

- **GLUT2**: Found primarily in hepatocytes, pancreatic beta-cells, intestinal epithelium, and renal tubular cells. This bi-directional transporter is important for regulating glucose metabolism in the liver.

- **GLUT3**: Found primarily in the CNS. This transporter has a very high affinity for glucose, consistent with the brain's increased metabolic demands.

- **GLUT4**: Found primarily in skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, adipose tissue, and brain tissue. This transporter gets stored in cytoplasmic vesicles (inactive), which will amalgamate with the cell membrane when stimulated by insulin. These transporters will experience a 10 to 20-fold increase in density in times of energy-excess upon the release of insulin with the net effect of a decrease in blood glucose (glucose will more readily enter the cells that have GLUT4 on their surface).

**Central Role of Glucose in Carbohydrate Metabolism**

The final products of the carbohydrate digestion in the alimentary tract are almost entirely glucose, fructose, and galactose, and the glucose comprises 80% of the end product. After absorption from the alimentary canal, much of the fructose and almost all of the galactose is rapidly converted into glucose in the liver. Therefore only a small quantity of fructose and galactose is present in the circulating blood. Thus glucose becomes the final common pathway for the transport of all of the carbohydrates to the tissue cells.

In liver cells, appropriate enzymes are available to promote interconversions among the monosaccharides- glucose, fructose, and galactose. The dynamics of the enzymes are as such when the liver releases the monosaccharides, the final product always glucose. The reason is that the hepatocytes contain a large amount of glucose phosphatase. Therefore the glucose-6-phosphate can be degraded to the glucose and the phosphate, and the glucose can be transported through the liver cell membrane back into the blood.
