The operator must stand on the opposite side to where the injection will be administered. The patient is put in a semi-inclined position with the head stabilized on the chair and the mouth wide open to allow proper visualization of the anatomical landmarks and needle insertion. A topical anesthetic, such as 20% benzocaine, can be applied to the target area to reduce pain during injection.
