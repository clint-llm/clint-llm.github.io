Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is a rare but complex pain syndrome requiring multidimensional management. Management of glossopharyngeal neuralgia requires expertise from the fields of neurology, otorhinolaryngology, interventional pain, and neurosurgery. It is best to manage the condition with an interprofessional team of specialists, specialty-trained nursing staff, and pharmacists for optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]

No clinical trials demonstrate the efficacy of the different groups of medications used in the medical management of glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Since glossopharyngeal neuralgia is a type of neuropathic pain, it would be beneficial to present levels of evidence of medicines used in the management of glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Gabapentin and pregabalin, selective serotonin receptor inhibitors, carbamazepine, and tricyclic antidepressants are first-line treatments. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should educate the patient on the potential side effects of these drugs. Second-line treatment includes opioids, certain anti-seizure medicines (like lamotrigine), topical capsaicin, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists. These classes of drugs have shown the best evidence with clinically relevant effects without any superiority from one over another. One meta-analysis study reported that despite an increase of published trials by 66%, there is only a limited improvement in the medical management of neuropathic pain.
