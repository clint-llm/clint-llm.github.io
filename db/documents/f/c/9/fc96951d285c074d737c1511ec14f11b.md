Information and understanding of Fanconi anemia are essential for family members because of the genetic inheritance pattern of the disease, and the patient is usually a child at the time of clinical presentation and diagnosis. Genetic counseling for the disease helps the family members have enough patient education to increase the compliance and the patient-clinician relationship. Fanconi anemia in a child necessitates the testing of the disease in other family members, most importantly, siblings, to either catch the disease in the early stage or to prevent future childbirth with genetic defects.

It is also important to perform the abnormal chromosomal breakage test and HLA matching of siblings in order to evaluate for possible hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between the siblings. A level of knowledge regarding the disease process, signs and symptoms, and the treatment plan should be a part of the education of parents. Parents should be informed about any interventions to be made, the benefits of one over other options, and health hazards. After complete clarification, they should be provided the opportunity to choose the best treatment plan.
