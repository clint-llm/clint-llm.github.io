The most recentÂ staging guidelines were published in 2017 and divides the classification into staging and grading of periodontitis.

Staging is based on the severity and extent of the management required and is given a stage depending on factors such as clinical attachment loss, radiographic bone loss, and tooth loss.

- Stage I: Initial periodontitis

- Stage II: Moderate periodontitis

- Stage III: Severe periodontitis with the potential for additional tooth loss

- Stage IV: Severe periodontitis with the potential for loss of dentition

Grading is a measure used to describe the rate of progression of the disease based on the evidence for associated risk factors such as smoking and diabetes mellitus

- Grade A: low rate of progression

- Grade B: expected progression

- Grade C: high risk of progression
