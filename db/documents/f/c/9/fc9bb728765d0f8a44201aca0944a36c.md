When evaluating patients with central cord syndrome, conditions that closely mimic CCS should be ruled out, including cruciate paralysis and the avulsion of cervical roots. Cruciate paralysis is a rare neurological disease involving the cervicomedullary junction. The main precipitatingÂ factors of cruciate paralysis are mechanical trauma, metabolic disorders, or post-surgical complication. Typically, the patient with cruciate paralysis presents with bilaterally upper extremity paresis while sparing the lower extremities in most cases.

A cervical root avulsion is a severe form of nerve root injury that usually results from high-energy trauma to the neck or ipsilateral arm. Neurological deficits from nerve avulsion range from a mild motor function deficit to complete paralysis that requires surgical correction.
