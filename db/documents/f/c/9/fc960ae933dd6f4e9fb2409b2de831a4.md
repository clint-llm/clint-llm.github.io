Mucopolysaccharidosis 2 (MPS II) results due to decreased activity of IDS. The enzyme is encoded by the IDS gene located on the long arm of chromosome X. The IDS gene consists of 9 exons, and over 600 different types of mutations have been reported to cause MPS II. The main mutations include point, frameshift, insertion, mutation at splice site, and minor and complete deletion of the IDS gene.

**Severe Phenotype**

- Occurs in 60% of the affected individuals.

- Presents initially as hydrocephalus followed by behavioral changes and central nervous system (CNS) involvement.

- The child develops normally until 3 or 4 years of age when he develops behavioral changes, attention difficulties, speech delay, cognitive decline, and poor performance in school.

- The child also has hearing loss due to deformities in the middle ear, inner ear, and frequent ear infections.

- May be associated with episodes of epileptic seizures.

**Attenuated Phenotype**

- Patients have less severe clinical symptoms without CNS involvement.

- Patients have normal cognitive and intellectual development.

- A few patients may report retinal degeneration and neurological symptoms at an advanced stage.
