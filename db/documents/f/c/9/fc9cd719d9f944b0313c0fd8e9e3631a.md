Brodalumab administration is by subcutaneous injection. Patients may self-inject the 210 mg/1.5 ml prefilled syringe at weekly intervals for weeks 0, 1, and 2, followed by an injection every two weeks. Prefilled syringes should be stored at 2 degrees C to 8 degrees C but require approximately 30 minutes to reach room temperature before injection. Syringes may be stored at room temperature for up to 2 weeks but should not be re-refrigerated. If there is an inadequate response by weeks 12 to 16 of treatment, discontinue brodalumab as therapy past 16 weeks is unlikely to result in more significant disease improvement.
