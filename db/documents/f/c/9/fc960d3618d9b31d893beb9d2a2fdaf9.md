Aliskiren is active in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).

Aliskiren acts as a renin inhibitor, which blocks the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. This effect subsequently decreases the formation of angiotensin II. Angiotensin II acts on the AT1 receptor, which is responsible for vasoconstriction, aldosterone secretion, and catecholamine release.

Hence, blood pressure decreases by decreasing the amount of angiotensin II to reach the AT1 receptor, therebyÂ causing a decrease in vasoconstriction, aldosterone secretion, and catecholamine release. Any agent that works to inhibit the RAAS can suppress the negative feedback loop.

O'Rawe et al. conducted a phase I clinical trial to determine the safety and tolerability of several drugs which target the renin-angiotensin system in patients with glioblastoma.
