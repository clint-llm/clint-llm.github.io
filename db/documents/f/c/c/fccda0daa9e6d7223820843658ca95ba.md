The history and mechanism of injury frequently point to the diagnosis of an abrasion. The presence of foreign material may indicate the causation and nature of the injury. Abrasion over the eyes, including the conjunctiva, could be mistaken for a variety of ocular conditions, including conjunctivitis, corneal ulcer, and endophthalmitis.

In medico-legal examinations, the nature of abrasion is more important than the gravity of the injury. The location of abrasion may present significant findings and could be a vital piece of evidence. Injuries present over the neck may indicate a case of (attempted) homicide. Similarly, injuries present over the thighs and genitalia could indicate a case of sexual assault.
