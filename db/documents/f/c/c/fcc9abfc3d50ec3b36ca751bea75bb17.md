The mainstay treatment of TEN is supportive care until re-epithelialization of the affected skin. Supportive measures include fluid resuscitation, pain management, wound care, and nutritional support. Early management of these cases in the emergency department should focus mainly on two things: discontinuation of the offending drug and early referral to a burn unit or intensive care unit with experience in dealing with such cases. When taken in the first 24 hours of blister formation, these two measures decrease infection rate and hospital stays and improve the overall survival.

The airway should be observed frequently, along with the provision of supplemental oxygen via a face mask if needed. In case of respiratory distress, endotracheal intubation should be done by an expert. Fluid resuscitation using crystalloids should be guided by one of the standard burn resuscitation Performa (e.g., Parkland formula). The target of resuscitation should be to maintain adequate tissue perfusion by achieving an adequate mean arterial blood pressure (ABP>65mm Hg), a central venous pressure between 8 to 12 mmHg, and a urine output of 0.5 to 1 ml/kg/hour.

Nutritional support is crucial in TEN patients due to the hypercatabolic nature of this disease. Enteral feeding is superior to parenteral feeding as it decreases the risk of bacterial translocation. If oral mucosa is significantly affected, a nasogastric tube may be used. Energy requirement and nutritional support must be carefully calculated (aim to 20 to 25 kcal/kg/day).

**Wound****Care**

Aseptic wound care is important to prevent secondary infection until re-epithelialization. Skin lesions usually heal within 2 weeks, while mucosal lesions may take longer. There is no standard approach for wound care. No strong evidence to support either early, late, or no debridement of the affected skin. In case of wound debridement, this should be done under general anesthesia. The involved area can be dressed by a variety of options, including biological dressing (e.g., allograft, xenograft, and homograft), biosynthetic dressing (e.g., biobrane), or silver-impregnated dressing. Good wound care will also reduce analgesia requirements.

Infection is common and may be lethal. Staphylococcal infection is the most common, followed by pseudomonas infection, which occurs after a prolonged hospitalization.

**Pharmacotherapy**

There is no proven effective treatment modality, including systemic steroid, plasmapheresis, cyclosporin, Anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).

**Complications**

Ocular complications are common and sometimes serious. Early ophthalmological consultation is vital, and treatment usually consists of topical lubricants, antibiotics, or steroid drops. Genitourinary complications are also common. Topical estrogen is used to promote mucosal healing. In severe cases, menstrual suppression may be helpful to minimize the potential risk of vaginal adenosis. According to the clinical presentation, further input may be needed from other specialists, including urology, otolaryngology, and respiratory medicine. Furthermore, all patients with TEN should be assessed for the need for post-discharge psychological support.
