Gallbladder cancer detection often occurs as an incidental finding on imaging or after a surgical procedure. Early-stage gallbladder cancer is commonly discovered after cholecystectomy and review of the surgical pathology specimen.

Gallbladder cancer patients are often asymptomatic at presentation or describe vague symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, indigestion, weakness, anorexia, loss of appetite, weight loss, and can present with jaundice, which can easily be confused as cholecystitis. Biliary obstruction by cancer leads to jaundice, clay-colored stools, cola-colored urine, and skin pruritus. Also, Mirizzi syndrome (common hepatic duct obstruction by an impacted stone in the gallbladder neck due to an extrinsic compression) has shown an association with gallbladder cancer. It carries a poor prognosis due to unresectability at presentation

Physical examination may demonstrate jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, or Courvoisier sign (non-tender palpable gallbladder with jaundice), which is most likely to develop due to chronic progressive malignant obstruction rather than an intermittent gallstone obstruction. Hepatomegaly, abdominal palpable mass, ascites, and bowel obstruction on physical examination are presentations that indicate advanced metastatic stage.
