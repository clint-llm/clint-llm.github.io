The spine can be considered as a series of connected motion segments. In each segment, the superior articular process of the lower vertebra connects the inferior articular process of the superior vertebra. Thus, spine alignment and load distribution are thought to play an important role in the development of the degeneration of facet joints.

Instability of the spine due to trauma or poor posture that loads extra weight on the posterior structures of theÂ spine may also cause degeneration of the facet joints.
