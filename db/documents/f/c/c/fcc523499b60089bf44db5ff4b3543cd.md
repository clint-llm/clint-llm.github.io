Pre-operative workup is included to ensure patients are adequate surgical candidates. This includes a physical examination, pulmonary function testing, bronchoscopy, computed tomography (CT), and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan.

A cardiac workup should be recommended if a patient has pre-operative risk factors, such as a long history of smoking. Invasive mediastinal staging such as endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or mediastinoscopy should be performed to evaluate for the nodal disease if clinically suspected.

Depending on the indication for lung tumor resection, patients may undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy and possibly radiation before undergoing pulmonary sleeve resection (PSR).
