Hypercarbia is an important acid-base disturbance and requires a team effort for evaluation and management. Though diagnosed with relatively straightforward arterial blood gas analysis, it is important to identify and treat the underlying cause. Hypercarbia is best managed by an interprofessional team, including nurses, respiratory therapists, intensivists, emergency medicine providers, anesthetists, and others. Nurses monitor vital signs, recognize patient decompensation, and support the patient and family members at the bedside. Respiratory therapists help to set up and manage both invasive and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation.

Providers across different specialties are responsible for securing the airway and directing care specific to the underlying cause. Ventilatory support can be weaned once the underlying pathology is improved. In many cases, hypercarbia is reversible.
