There are no absolute contraindications to neck dissection beyond those that make a patient unfit for general anesthesia and resection, with one exception: unresectable disease. Relative contraindications include:

- Severe cardiopulmonary disease, COPD with poor functional status

- Preoperative imaging showing deep infiltration of the tumor in the prevertebral space, scalene muscles, levator scapula muscle, phrenic nerve, and brachial plexus are not suitable candidates

- The primary tumor that is uncontrollable.

- Distant metastatic disease

- Tumor encasement of the carotid artery (NOTE: many authors view this as 'unresectable disease,' as resection and grafting does not confer a survival or local control advantage, even if it is technically possible)

Absolute contraindication:

- Fixed neck mass in the deep neck muscles, prevertebral fascia, and/or skull base involvement (unresectable disease)
