Early and serial ECGs are an essential part of the evaluation. ECG leads II, III, and aVF correlate with the inferior wall of the heart. ST-segment elevation in those leads indicates an inferior wall STEMI.  Reciprocal ST depression often is seen in lead aVL. Almost half of the inferior wall infarctions are associated with right ventricular MIs.  The addition of right-sided ECG leads should be used to examine the right ventricle. Right-sided ECGs are performed by reversing the precordial leads to the right side of the chest in a mirror image of the traditional precordial leads. Lead V4R is particularly useful for detecting a right-sided infarction. If there is evidence of ST elevation MI, the catheterization laboratory should be activated. If there is no ST elevation, troponin levels should be followed.
