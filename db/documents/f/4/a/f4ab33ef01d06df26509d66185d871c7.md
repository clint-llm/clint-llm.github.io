In conclusion, several studies have noted significant clinical improvement in patients undergoing septal ablation with documented improvement in patient's objective and subjective parameters, which include the patient's functional class and performance on a treadmill exercise test. Several studies in the literature have also compared overall survival of patients undergoing alcohol septal ablation versus those who undergo surgical myomectomy with follow-up ranging from 3 months to 8 years, and these studies have largely concluded similar survival rates among patients who undergo these procedures.
