After birth, neonates with CL/P will become involved with an interprofessional health care team including:

- Pediatrics/primary clinician

- Speech therapy (SLP)

- Genetics

- Otolaryngology

- Audiology

- Social work

- Orthodontics

- Craniofacial surgery

The initial evaluation is focused on respiratory and feeding issues to ensure the infant can grow and develop appropriately until the definitive surgical repair. Neonates need to be evaluated for sleep apnea, and parents counseled on appropriate management. A trained speech therapist will need to work with parents to teach appropriate feeding techniques and provide assistive devices to improve intake and reduce infant fatigue during feeds. A variety of special bottles and nipples are available to protect the nasal passages from reflux during feeds and decrease respiratory distress. A dental evaluation should be considered as well for possible oral prosthetics to aid in feeding until surgery. It is critically important for the infant to gain weight appropriately both for development, but also to prevent delays of surgical intervention.

Subsequent and long-term evaluations include:

- Audiologic assessment and management of hearing deficits

- Otolaryngologic management of middle ear effusion with ventilation tubes and for assessment of obstructive sleep apnea as the child grows, including the possible need for adenotonsillectomy, turbinate reduction, and/or tongue reduction

- Speech-language assessment of feeding and language development

- Family genetic counseling and future planning

- Dental evaluation and intervention as the childâ€™s teeth begin to present

- Psychosocial counseling for both parents and child
