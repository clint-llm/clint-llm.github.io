After ingestion of cyclops contaminated water,Â  infected larvae released in the stomach penetrate the mucosa of the stomach and intestinal wall and migrate into the connective tissue. The larvae then mature into adult worms. After maturation and impregnation of the female worms, the male worms die. Female worms fully mature after 9 to 14 months and can measure up to 1 meter in length. Worms migrate through the subcutaneous tissue. Approximately after one year of infection, the female worms are attracted to the cooler surface of the skin and emerge from the skin, usually the feet. Before emerging, they form a painful blister at the skin site. Patients usually place or soak their legs in cold water to get relief from the symptoms, and this causes the worm to break from the blister and emerge from the skin. This stage causes itching and pain at the local skin site. During this time, the 1st stage larvae are released into the water and are ingested by the Cyclops and undergo two molts to develop into the 3rd stage larvae. Ingestion of Cyclops with 3rd stage larvae contaminated water by humans starts the lifecycle again.

An alternative life cycle was proposed recently involving dogs and fish.
