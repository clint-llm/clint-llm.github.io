Neonates are susceptible to invasive infections due to their "inexperienced" immune system and lack of maternal antibodies if born preterm. The most common mechanism is primary bloodstream infection seeding the CNS. Early-onset infection is mainly maternal in origin because pregnancy and delivery expose the fetus/neonate to many pathogens that can be transmitted through the vagina to ruptured amniotic membranes or via contact with the neonate's skin during passage through the birth canal. Organisms such as L. monocytogenes can be transmitted through the placenta. Late-onset infection is mainly nosocomial, with foreign devices such as endotracheal tubes, catheters, and feeding tubes, increasing the risk of infection.
