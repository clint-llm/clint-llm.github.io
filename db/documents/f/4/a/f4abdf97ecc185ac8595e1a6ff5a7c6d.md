The inferior colliculus (IC; plural: colliculi) is a paired structure in the midbrain, which serves as an important relay point for auditory information as it travels from the inner ear to the auditory cortex. It is responsible for integrated sound localization, as it is the first site at which input from cells carrying horizontal and vertical sound location data from each ear converge. Also, it plays an important role in generating the startle response, orienting the body toward relevant stimuli, and discriminating pitch and rhythm. It receives signals from many non-auditory sources, but primarily from the other brainstem nuclei involved in the auditory system. Efferent projections from the IC often travel to the many nuclei which send it afferents, but especially to the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.
