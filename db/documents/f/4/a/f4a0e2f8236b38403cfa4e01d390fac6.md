Limb-sparing surgery is the mainstay of treatment for patients with synovial sarcoma who present with localized disease. Amputation is rarely pursued and reserved for patients where limb salvage is impossible. The goal is to achieve an R0 margin of at least 1 to 2 cm in width.

Alternatively, a fascial plane uninvolved by the tumor is an acceptable margin, regardless of the distance of the tumor from the fascia. In patients with synovial sarcoma, where the tumor is less than 5 cm in size, a wide local resection with a margin of 1-2 cm is adequate.
