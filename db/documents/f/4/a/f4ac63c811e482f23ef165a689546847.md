Specialists well-trained in airway intervention and intubation, particularly otolaryngologists, anesthesiologists, and pulmonologists, should be notified quickly in cases of impending airway demise. In acute settings, a pulmonologist can perform a flexible bronchoscopy in a child with an inhaled foreign body, which is in a distal bronchus. Moreover, rigid equipment regularly utilized by otorhinolaryngologists is very effective for more proximal foreign bodies. Cardiothoracic surgeons can also become involved in these cases where removing the foreign body via the airway is difficult, as the patient may require a thoracotomy if the foreign body is in a distal airway and cannot be removed endoscopically.
