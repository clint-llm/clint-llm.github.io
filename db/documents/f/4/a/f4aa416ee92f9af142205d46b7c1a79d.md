Neural tube defects emerge when there is a disturbance during neurulation.

**Primary neurulation:**

Neurulation is a series of systematic, morphologic, structural changes. The process begins with the Hensen node and the nascent ectoderm signaling to one another, which induces the neural plate to begin neurulation.

**Secondary neurulation:**

At the sacral and coccygeal level, the neural tube is referred to as the tailbud.
