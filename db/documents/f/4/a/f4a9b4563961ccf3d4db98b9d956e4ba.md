Most pulmonary contusions require supportive therapy until the contusion heals. Because contusions can gradually evolve over the first 24 to 48 hours after trauma, close monitoring is needed. Treatment aims to prevent respiratory insufficiency, failure, and complications.

**Supportive care**like postural drainage, suctioning, chest physiotherapy, incentive spirometry, encouraging coughing, and deep breathing can be tried to prevent atelectasis. Positive pressure ventilation using CPAP and BiPAP may be used.

**Surgical stabilization**may be required for multiple rib fractures/ flail chest to correct pulmonary mechanics. Cases refractory to all conventional therapies have been successfully managed by extracorporeal gas exchange (ECMO).
