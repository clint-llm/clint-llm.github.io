Primary laryngeal and glottic cancers are uncommon, representing approximately 1% of all male and 0.3% of female cancers worldwide. The American Cancer Society estimates the diagnosis of 12370 new cases of laryngeal carcinoma in 2020, with approximately 60% arising primarily from the glottis. Of these new cases, 9820 will occur in men, and 3750 will die from the disease with a male to female ratio of 4 to 1. Reassuringly, these figures follow a 2 to 3% year on year reduction in overall cases. Rates of laryngeal cancer vary significantly with specific patient characteristics as male, low-income, and African-American patients have shown to present with higher rates of advanced disease.
