**Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005**

The CSA also allows for the regulation of chemicals that are precursors to controlled substances. The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act was passed as an amendment to the Patriot Act renewal, which placed comprehensive restrictions on the sale of medications containing precursor chemicals to amphetamines/methamphetamine.

This new law created a CSA category of “Scheduled Listed Chemical Products,” effectively reclassifying all products containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. Products containing these ingredients are now subject to sales restrictions and record-keeping requirements. The law limits the purchase of products with pseudoephedrine to no more than 3.6 grams per day per purchase and no more than 9 grams in total in a month, as of April 2006.
