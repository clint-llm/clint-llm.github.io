The patients with tinea pedis mostly present as a long-standing, itchy, intertriginous dermatitis of the toes characterized by peeling, maceration, and fissuring. Lateral toe clefts are mainly affected by the involvement of the under the surface of the toes. The affected areas are erythematous and covered with fine, silvery white scales. Occasionally, a pompholyx like the vesicularÂ eruption of the sole may be present. Chronic intertriginous type is the most common presentation. It begins as scaling, maceration, erosion, and erythema of the interdigital and subdigital skin of the feet. Pruritus and malodor are present. Chronic hyperkeratotic or moccasin type usually presents with patchy or diffuse scaling of the bottom, medial, and lateral sides of the soles. The vesiculobullous form is typically caused by Trichophyton mentagrophytes and present as tense vesicles or bullae over the soles. The burning and itching caused by bullae may produce great discomfort. Sometimes, the associated bacterial infection may result in an acute ulcerative type of tinea pedis.
