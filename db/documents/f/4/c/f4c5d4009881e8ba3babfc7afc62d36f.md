As opposed to RB or RBILD, macrophage accumulation in DIP is extensive, diffuse, and uniform within alveolar spaces. The extensive alveolar infiltration of macrophages renders them an eosinophilic stain due to the abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm of the macrophages. Alveolar macrophages often contain a distinct light brown pigmentation that does not stain for hemosiderin and is known conventionally as “smoker’s pigment,” the corresponding macrophages known as “smoker’s macrophages.“ Macrophages of marijuana smoker with DIP tend to have a characteristic smaller golden brown particulate material.

Overall alveolar architecture is well preserved, but focal interstitial thickening and inflammatory changes are quite common. Toward late-stage disease, production of transforming growth factor beta-1 results in fibrosis around alveolar interstitium. Unlike usual interstitial pneumonia, however, fibroblastic foci are almost never seen. Multinucleated giant cells are also often reported.
