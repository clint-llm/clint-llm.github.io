Even though the general presumption is that height assessment is a part of the preliminary examination/routine check-ups carried out at hospitals and health care centers, it has many other underlying indications too. As previously described, it can indicate several abnormalities in individuals and be used to diagnose these conditions. However, to arrive at a correct diagnosis and accurate assessment, the recommended methods of height assessment should be followed rigorously. The measurement tools should be calibrated regularly, and proper training of the staff should be ensured.

Diagnosis of clinically significant conditions requires trained nursing staff to aid in the process of measuring height, and its correct interpretation requires the involvement of clinicians. Better outcomes are possible by involving an anthropologist. Based on the accurate assessment of height, anthropologists can help shed light on varying growth patterns across regions and populations and use this information to indicate abnormalities, if any. A well-coordinated interprofessional team of nurses and clinicians can improve the accuracy rate of height assessment in patients, which will provide a better overall health assessment of the population as a whole.
