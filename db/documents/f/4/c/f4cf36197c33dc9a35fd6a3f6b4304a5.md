While many eye care providers are proficient in diagnosing and managing Lid Wiper Epitheliopathy (LWE), it is important to acknowledge that the available data on the diagnosis and treatment of this conditionÂ are limited. The current body of research on LWE is relatively small, which presents challenges in standardizing the classification and treatment approaches.

Due to the limited data, there is a need for further large-scale clinical research to enhance our understanding of LWE. Such research can contribute to the development of standardized diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines, which would greatly benefit healthcare providers and improve patient care.
