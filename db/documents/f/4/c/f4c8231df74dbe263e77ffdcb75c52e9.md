Patients with HANDL syndrome should be educated about the nature of the disease and must be well informed about the benign and self-limiting nature of the disease. The rare occurrence of risk and complications of HaNDL syndrome should also be explained to the patient and their family. Apart from its dramatic and sudden onset, the condition is self-limited and rarely causes any life long complications.
