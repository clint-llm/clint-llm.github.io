The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is the primary side effect of treatment. It is due to the release of endotoxin from the lysing spirochetes and characteristically presents as fevers, chills, myalgias, tachycardia, headache, and vasodilation with resultant flushing and/or mild hypotension. The reaction usually occurs in the first 2 to 6 hours of antibiotic administration and resolves within 12 to 24 hours. Management is symptomatic with acetaminophen as the preferred agent.
