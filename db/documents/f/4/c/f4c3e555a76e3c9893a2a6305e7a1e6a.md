Since the mid-1900s when the mortality for PE was around 23%, outcomes have improved to mortalities as low at 1-2% in specialized centers.

The role of PE for advanced cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers has recently diminished related to improved responsiveness of primary malignancies to chemoradiation techniques.

For palliative PE, the in-hospital mortality has been demonstrated to be 6.3% (0-66.7%) with an overall survival median of 14 months (4-40 months).
