A recent history of diving is the most likely scenario; however, DCS can also rarely occur in aviators (especially high-altitude aviators above commercial heights, such as certain military pilots and astronauts) and compressed air workers such as caisson workers. Exceeding the limits of dive tables can put patients at increased risk. DCS is rare in dives that are less than 10 meters in depth. Recreational dives that are deeper and longer could be associated with higher chances of DCS.

TheÂ clinician should obtain a comprehensive history from the patient, including details of the dive profile, including time and depth, gaseous mixtures used, and the time delay to onset of symptoms relative to surfacing.

In a patient experiencing IEDCS, symptoms will typically arise within 2 hours of surfacing and can even rarely occur while patients are still under pressure.

While IEDCS can occur in isolation, patients experiencing vertigo, balance issues, or hearing loss after diving should also be examined and questioned for other manifestations of decompression sickness and other diving injuries while ruling out all non-diving-related causes.

All patients should undergo comprehensive neurological examination, including testing for balance, gait, proprioception, nystagmus, and bilateral hearing. Further physical examination for pain and numbness, cutaneous lesions/rash, musculoskeletal pain/discomfort, and pulmonary function should also be performed.
