The isthmus lies at the junction of the relatively mobile ascending aortic arch and the descending thoracic aortic which lies fixed to the posterior chest wall. This transition zone is tethered in place by the ligamentum arteriosum, a vestige of the fetal ductus arteriosus, which increases shearing forces during rapid deceleration. Also, physicians believe that the isthmus may represent a weak point along the aorta, with studies showing decreased tensile strength when subjected to stress. The “water-hammer” effect is another proposed mechanism where occlusion of the aorta at the diaphragm during impact results in a simultaneous increase in intra-aortic pressure and the generation of a high-pressure wave creating severe stress and rupture at the arch. A final theorized mechanism is the “osseous pinch.” This involves entrapment of the aorta between the bony structures of the anterior chest wall and the vertebral column resulting in rupture. However, it is likely that most injuries result from a combination of forces through several of these injury mechanisms.
