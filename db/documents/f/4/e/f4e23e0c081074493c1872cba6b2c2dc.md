Statins have been around for over two decades and have proven effective at lowering cholesterol. Statin therapy requires an interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists. When the patient has been prescribed a statin, the nurse and pharmacist should educate the patient on the dose and side effects of the drugs. The pharmacist must regularly check the patient's list of medications to ensure safety and prevent polypharmacy interactions. Nursing staff should verify medication compliance, ask about any new symptoms that may have links to statin use, counsel the patient on administration, and inform the prescriber if there are any concerns. Further, clinicians should monitor liver function because these statins cause transaminase elevations. These monitoring practices should occur within an interprofessional team environment so that all team members have access to the same information and can make decisions and recommendations based on the latest data for the patient, leading to improved therapeutic outcomes.

Statin therapy correlates with an increased risk of diabetes, with the first notable JUPITER trial published in 2008.

**Outcomes**

Clinical trials have shown that statins effectively lower cholesterol and the risk of adverse cardiac events. The ALLHAT-LLT trial found no benefit in primary prevention in older adults above 75 years of age with statin therapy and hyperlipidemia.
