Strychnine poisoning occurs via accidental or intentional ingestion of compounds containing the chemical. Typically, strychnine is used intentionally for suicidal or homicidal means. Strychnine poisoning may also occur unintentionally by ingesting the Chinese or Cambodian herbal remedies, Miqianzi and slang nut, respectively. Commonly, it is found as a white powder and most often is ingested orally, but there are reports of intravenous injection and intranasal insufflation via adulterated heroin and cocaine.
