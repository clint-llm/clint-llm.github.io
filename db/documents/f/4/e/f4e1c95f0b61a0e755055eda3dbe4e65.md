**Laser System**

- Argon green laser light is used in ALT

- Q-switched Nd: YAG laser is used in SLT

Lenses used - A contact lens with a mirror to visualize the anterior chamber angle (gonioprism) is used in laser trabeculoplasty. The lens should have an anti-reflective coating on its front surface.

- Goldmann type three-mirror lens can be used. It has one mirror inclined at an angle of 59 degrees.

- Thorpe four-mirror gonioscopy lens, all the mirrors are inclined at 62 degrees. It has the advantage of simultaneous viewing of all the quadrants of the angle of the anterior chamber.

- Ritch trabeculoplasty lens- two mirrors are inclined at 59 degrees for viewing the inferior quadrants and two at 64 degrees to view the superior angles. It has a 17 diopter planoconvex lens which provides a magnification of 1.4, thus reducing a laser spot size.

- Latina lens- this lens is designed explicitly for SLT. It has a single mirror at a 63-degree angle. It has a magnification of 1.
