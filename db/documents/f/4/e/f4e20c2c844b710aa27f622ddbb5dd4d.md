The complex anatomy and function of the superior oblique muscle and tendon make surgery on these structures quite challenging. One surgical consideration is the requirement of an incision through the conjunctiva and through Tenon’s fascia, a connective tissue capsule that attaches to the optic nerve posteriorly and is pierced by most extraocular muscles, including the superior oblique, to access the episcleral space. Excessive damage to this fascia may cause adhesions, which may limit eye movement.

Factors to consider when starting surgery are noting the most common sites of infection, which are the patient’s skin, lid margins, and conjunctiva. Infection of these sites can cause serious postoperative complications, therefore cleansing these structures with an antimicrobial solution in advance of surgery is vital.
