To achieve good results and avoid the complications, bariatric surgery needs an interprofessional team approach that consists of a surgeon, bariatric nurse, pharmacist, physiotherapist, dietitian, social worker, and a gastroenterologist. After the surgery, these patients need to have DVT prophylaxis and ambulation. At the same time, the nurse should monitor the patient was wound infection, respiratory difficulties, and ileus. A dietary consult is required to ensure that they consume the right foods to prevent mineral and vitamin deficiencies. All patients should be educated about the importance of lifestyle changes and participating in a regular exercise program. Pharmacists can consult on post-operative infection and pain control with the surgeon and nurse. In the follow-up period, the patients need to be assessed for flabby skin, pendulous breasts, or overhanging abdominal skin. These features can have a negative impact on cosmesis and hence, a referral to a plastic surgeon should be made.

**Evidence-based Outcomes**

There is no longer any question that bariatric surgery is effective and does help people lose weight. More important there is evidence showing that bariatric surgery can lower the risk of adverse cardiac events, diabetes, and stroke. Several studies have also shown that bariatric surgery can lower the risk of endometrial cancer in obese women undergoing weight loss surgery. In addition, bariatric surgery by reducing weight can decrease the intensity of low back pain and significantly improve the quality of life. Finally, there is evidence that in the long run bariatric surgery can help lower the cost of health care by lowering blood pressure, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and musculoskeletal disease compared to non-surgical methods of weight loss. Unfortunately, there are not many long-term studies that have determined if the benefits of bariatric surgery are sustained or if the patients regain the weight. Anecdotal reports indicate that some patients who do not change their lifestyle quickly regain weight. Finally, it should not be forgotten that bariatric surgery is also associated with several post-surgical complications that cannot only prolong hospital stay but can also increase mortality. In institutions that specialize in bariatric surgery, mortality rates of less than 3% have been stated, but in hospitals where the procedures are not frequently done, the mortality rates are slightly higher.
