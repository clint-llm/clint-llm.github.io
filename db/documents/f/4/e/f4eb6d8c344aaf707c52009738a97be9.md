Most cordotomies utilize the percutaneous approach at the level of C1-C2. The surgeon often uses fluoroscopic or CT guidance. Patients are usually awake for the procedure, which is performed under local anesthesia. A laminectomy is required to execute an open cordotomy. It comes with a lengthier recovery and a higher risk of side effects. However, when percutaneous cordotomy is unfeasible, especially in children, the open procedure is preferred.
