Given that DDD is a disorder of hyperpigmentation, the main pathophysiology behind the disease fittingly involves melanosomal functioning. Intracellular transport, a function once believed to be reserved to microfilaments and microtubules, has been linked to keratins through studies elucidating the effect ofÂ haploinsufficiency of keratin 5 on the organization of cell adhesion, melanosome uptake into keratinocytes, organelle transport, and nuclear anchorage. Specifically, the head domain of keratin 5 is believed to play a role in melanosome trafficking through its interaction with Hsc70, a chaperone protein involved in vesicle uncoating.

In addition, mutations in POFUT1 and POGLUT1 disrupt the Notch signaling pathway by affecting enzymes involved in post-translational modification. Mutations in PSENEN also affect the Notch signaling pathway by modifying an enhancer gene that encodes a component of y-secretase protein complex. The Notch signaling pathway plays an integral part in skin homeostasis by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of melanocytes and keratinocytes and mediating their interactions with one another.
