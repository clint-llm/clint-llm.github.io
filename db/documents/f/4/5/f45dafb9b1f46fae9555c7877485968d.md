The evaluation for urge incontinence of urine can be done with the following sequential steps.

- The first step should always involve a thorough history and physical examination. At this stage, some validated questionnaires can also be used. Commonly used questionnaires to quantify the amount of bother, and bladder symptoms include the short form of Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory and the short form Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire.
- The second step can include urine analysis with microscopy and, if needed, culture to rule out any hematuria, glycosuria, and urinary tract infection (UTI). At this time, office-based examinations like a cough stress test, cotton swab test, post-void residue, and voiding diary can be utilized. A voiding diary can clarify fluid intake, symptoms, and situations in which the incontinence symptoms occur.
- Anytime during these steps, assessment should also aim to rule out reversible causes. Decisions should also be made when to refer to a urologist/urogynecologist. The reversible causes can be memorized with the mnemonic DIPPERS (delirium, infection, pharmaceutical, psychological morbidity, excess fluid intake, restricted mobility, and stool impaction). If present, any of these conditions need treatment and reassessment. Referral to a specialist should be considered if there is bladder pain, advanced urological prolapse, fistula, neurological symptoms, urogenital malignancy, urogenital surgery, recurrent UTI, sterile pyuria, hematuria, post-void residual volume of more than 50 mL, and insensible loss of urine.
- The third step is to try to decide the presumed type of urinary incontinence from the information gathered. Points in favor of urge incontinence include symptoms of urgency, typical frequency and nocturia, no incontinence with cough, sneezing, lifting, position change, variable volume loss on voiding diary, negative cough stress test, and post-void residual volume of < 50 mL.
- The final step involves the utilization of urodynamic studies. These studies can acquire valuable information about the relationship of pressure and flow between the urethra and the bladder. They also often provide ample details on lower urinary tract function. Even though these studies are outside the scope of primary clinicians' office, they can be crucial to achieving a correct diagnosis of mixed and urge incontinence.
- Significant inconsistencies between symptom scale, history, and voiding diary
- Planned or previous surgery
- Hematuria
- The presence of neurological diagnoses such as multiple sclerosis
- Associated prolapse of pelvic organs
- Previous history of correction surgery for incontinence
- Elevated volume of post-void residual urine.
- Well known components of urodynamic studies include a) uroflowmetry, b) cystometry, c) post-void residual urine volume, d) urethral pressure profiles for urethral closure pressures, e) leak point pressure measurement, f) neurophysiologic studies.
