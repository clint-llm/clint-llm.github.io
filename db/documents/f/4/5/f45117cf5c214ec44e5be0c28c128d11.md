The diagnostic criteria of FSHD have evolved from a cluster of clinical symptoms and laboratory findings to genetic analysis of suspected cases. While genetic testing is the current gold standard in evaluating patients, equivocal presentations are aided by electromyography (EMG) studies, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), laboratory tests, and muscle biopsies.

EMG studies are generally characterized by low amplitude, polyphasic potentials present for brief time intervals.

Before the presence of fatty, fibrous replacement, T2 MRI images demonstrate increased water content of affected muscles.
