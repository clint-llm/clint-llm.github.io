Apnea in infants is the term used to describe episodes of cessation of breathing and may be due to many physiologic or pathophysiologic processes. Brief periods of apnea that occur in short cycles of 5 to 10 seconds is not pathologic and is referred to as periodic breathing. Periodic breathing is seen predominantly during the age of two to four weeks and resolves by age six months. Apnea is frequently seen in preterm infants but can occur at any age. Apnea of prematurity is defined as a sudden cessation of breathing that lasts for at least 20 seconds or is accompanied by bradycardia or oxygen desaturation (cyanosis) in an infant younger than 37 weeks gestational age. Apnea of infancy is defined as an unexplained episode of cessation of breathing lasting 20 seconds or longer, or a shorter respiratory pause associated with bradycardia, cyanosis, pallor, and/or marked hypotonia. This activity examines the differential diagnosis of infant apnea and how to properly evaluate these infants. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe infant apnea.
- Review the presentation of infant apnea. 
- Identify the etiology of infant apnea. 
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for infants with apnea.
