Any person who has had an encounter with healthcare has had some sort of chest imaging. Whether it is for screening, establishing a diagnosis, assessing disease severity or monitoring treatment response, the essentiality, and importance of imaging is hard to overstate. In such a situation, one must be conscientious to ensure that studies are ordered based on appropriate indications, optimal for the suspected pathology, and also explained and acceptable to the patient.

While the amount of radiation exposure has now significantly decreased owing to technological advancements and awareness regarding radiation risks, efforts should be made to space out imaging and not expose the patient to ionizing radiation, especially in patients who require repeat imaging. The need and use of intravenous contrast should also be carefully considered. Iodinated contrast should be avoided in patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 30mL/min.

There is extensive ongoing research in the realm of radiogenomics, which aims to correlate imaging features with the predicted molecular makeup of a mass, for example, non-small cell lung carcinoma.
