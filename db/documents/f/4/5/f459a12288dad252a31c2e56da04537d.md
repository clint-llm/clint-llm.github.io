The interprofessional team is vital to the treatment of BPPV while using the Epley maneuver. Though the procedure only requires one operator, the situation may require anticipation of adverse side effects to produce satisfactory care. The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner performing the procedure should anticipate nausea and vomiting; thus, communication with the nursing staff is vital to ensure the patient is either premedicated with an antiemetic or have these medications readily drawn in the event the patient requires it.
