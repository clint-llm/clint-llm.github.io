The etiology is not completely understood for hepatic hemangiomas. They sporadically occur without any known predisposing factors. When hemangiomas are greater than 10 cm, they are considered giant hemangiomas. Since they are considered vascular malformations, they enlarge by ectasia rather than hyperplasia or hypertrophy. In pregnancy, the hemangioma may grow secondary to the increase in hormones (estrogen and progesterone); however, estrogen receptors have not been proven in all tumors. Some tumors may even grow in the absence of estrogen therapy.

Several associated abnormalities include focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver and Kasabach-Merritt syndrome, consisting of multiple hemangiomas throughout the body, elevated fibrin degradation products, and thrombocytopenia.
