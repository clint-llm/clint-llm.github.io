Characteristics of carbohydrates include being soluble, relatively easy to transport, non-toxic molecules that serve as the substrate of energy when oxygen levels are compromised.

The most energy-dense molecule are lipids and is the principal energy molecule for mammals and tissues. Because they are not soluble, they are not readily transportable in the blood, are not usable anaerobically, and require more oxygen to extract energy from them (2.8 ATP/oxygen molecule). They cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, and erythrocytes or renal cells are unable to use them. Amino acids act as substrates to produce glucose only in states of prolonged starvation, exhibiting the depletion of glycogen stores.

The metabolism of these three principal substrates converges into one molecule, acetylâ€“CoA, in the mitochondria. Metabolism of this intermediate molecule generates 3 NADH, 1 FADH, 1 GTP, and 2 CO2, all of which participate in the respiratory chain in the mitochondria to synthesize ATP.
