Patients explain a sensation of motion when no motion is taking place or an altered sensation with a normal motion to define vertigo. In a vestibular migraine, the sensation is often described as a "to-and-fro" sensation, and this can complicate diagnosis. Simultaneous headaches do not always accompany the vestibular symptoms, thus making an in-depth history and multi-specialty evaluation pivotal in order to make a diagnosis.

The International Headache Society in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, Second Edition classified a migraine into distinct diagnoses; however, only benign paroxysmal vertigo of childhood-type and basilar-type migraine included vertigo.

Definite vestibular migraine criteria included:

- At least 2 vestibular vertigo attacks

- Migraine according to ICHD-II classification

- Concomitant migrainous symptoms during at least 2 vertigo attacks (migraine headache, photophobia, phonophobia, visual or other auras)

- No evidence of other central or otological causes of vertigo

Probable vestibular migraine diagnostic criteria included:

- At least 2 vestibular vertigo attacks

- At least 1 of the following:

- An ICHD-II migraine

- At least 1 migrainous symptom during at least 2 vertigo attacks (migrainous headaches, photophobia, phonophobia, visual or other auras)

- No evidence of other causes of vertigo

In 2012, definite and probable diagnostic criteria were replaced with diagnostic criteria for a vestibular migraine put forth by both the Barany Society and the International Headache Society.

The currently accepted vestibular migraine diagnostic criteria consist of the following:

- At least 5 episodes of vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity lasting 5 minutes to 72 hours

- Current or previous history of migraines with or without aura according to the ICHD classification

- One or more of the following migraine features with at least 50% of vestibular episodes:

- Headache with at least 2 of the following characteristics

- One-sided location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity; photophobia or phonophobia

- Visual aura

- Not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis

Due to the relatively new diagnostic criteria, much of the reviewed literature is based on the Neuheuser criteria.
