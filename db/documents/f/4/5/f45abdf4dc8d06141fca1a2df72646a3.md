Most complications of pulmonary edema arise from the complications of the underlying cause. Common complications associated with cardiogenic etiologies include:

- Risk of arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardias)

- Thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism, DVT, stroke)

- Pericarditis

- Rupture

- Valvular heart disease

- Cardiogenic shock

- Tamponade

- Dressler syndrome

- Death

Pulmonary edema can cause severe hypoxia and hypoxemia leading to end-organ damage and multi-organ failure. Respiratory failure is another common complication of cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
