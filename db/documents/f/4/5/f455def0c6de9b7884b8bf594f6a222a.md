SMA syndrome presents with vague symptoms of bowel obstruction. However, diagnosis is based on interpreting clinical symptoms alongside radiological testing which can confirm its presence. Various imaging modalities that can be used include plain film x-ray, barium x-ray, endoscopy, computed tomography (CT), Doppler ultrasound, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Plain radiographs may reveal a dilated stomach and diminished distal bowel gas. Endoscopy and barium studies can be used but are often nonspecific and not available in an emergency setting. Endoscopy, rather, can be used to investigate complications of the disease including gastric stasis, biliary reflux, gastritis and duodenal ulcers and to rule out other cause of the duodenal compression. CT scan is helpful in diagnostics in that it allows for measurement of aortomesenteric (AO) angle which aids in confirmation of SMA syndrome and has thus replaced MRA as the standard for diagnosis. The normal AO angle is between 38 to 65 degrees and has a distance of 10 to 28 mm. In a study which reviewed 8 cases of SMA syndrome, a reported AO angle cutoff of 22 degrees revealed a 42.8% sensitivity and 100% specificity, and a distance of 8 mm was both 100% sensitive and specific for the condition. Laboratory tests are usually nondiagnostic and it is noted that electrolyte disturbances as well as protein and albumin levels can still be normal despite associated weight loss. While it is rare, SMA syndrome is important to consider because the delay in diagnosis can result in significant morbidity and mortality from malnutrition, dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, gastric pneumatosis and portal venous gas, gastrointestinal hemorrhage and gastric perforation.
