Workup of smoke inhalation injury may include the following:

- Chest imaging: Serial chest radiographs (often negative early in smoke inhalation injury), computed tomography (CT) chest

- Complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), lactate

- Pulse oximetry (may be falsely elevated with carbon monoxideÂ exposure)

- Arterial blood gas (ABG)

- Carboxyhemoglobin level

- Cyanide level (often not readily available therefore limited use in the acute setting)

- Pulmonary function testing: The flow-volume loop is a very sensitive noninvasive test

- Bronchoscopy and direct laryngoscopy
