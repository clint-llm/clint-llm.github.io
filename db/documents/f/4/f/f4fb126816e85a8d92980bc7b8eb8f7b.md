Qualitative and semiquantitative immunological methods have been used for the detection of myoglobin.

A rapid, qualitative latex agglutination test for detecting increased concentrations of myoglobin in serum has been reported.

Red blood cell agglutination techniques are reported to be sensitive in the 50 to 100 mg/L range.Â A disadvantage of this technique is that some sera containing a high concentration of rheumatoid factor gave positive agglutination reactions.

A quantitative microcomplement fixation assay has been developed to detect myoglobin in the serum and urine of patients with acute coronary syndrome or myopathies.

Currently, the determination of serum myoglobin for diagnosing AMI and other muscle disorders is performed almost exclusively by immunoassay techniques because of their high analytical sensitivity, specificity, precision, and rapid turnaround time.

Qualitative and quantitative methods for serum myoglobin have also been developed for point-of-care (POC) use.

International guidelines such as those from the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry have suggested that results of cardiac markers should be reported within one hour of blood collection.
