A bruit from carotid artery stenosis is due to a carotid atherosclerotic plaque that can be both stable and unstable. These plaques are similar to the other arterial plaques of the body. The genesis of atherosclerosis begins with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles trapped in the subintimal space by glycoproteins. After the LDL particles become oxidized, a cascade of inflammatory response ensues, resulting in the formation of solid crystalline cholesterol that expands in volume, compromising the fibrous cap. The fibrous cap maintains the integrity of the plaques and faces the vascular lumen. Rupture of the fibrous cap leads to thrombosis, potential arterial lumen blockage, and distal embolization. High-grade carotid stenosis is often found to have inflammatory cell infiltrates.  Additionally, intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) has been found in symptomatic patients and is predictive of future neurologic events and plaque rupture. Several factors seem to influence plaque morphology. Smoking may play a role in expediting atherogenesis. Men are also found to have high-risk plaque features compared to women.  Interestingly, age did now show a trend toward age-related plaque instability.
