TheÂ dentate nucleus mainly receives blood supply from the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) with some contribution from the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA).

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) derived from blood vessels supplying the dentate nucleus commonly comes from the PICA and the adjacent choroid plexus in the fourth ventricle.
