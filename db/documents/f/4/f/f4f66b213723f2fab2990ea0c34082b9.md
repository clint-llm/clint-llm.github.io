Medical science is an ever-evolving field with advances in all aspects of patient care that stem from basic, translational, and clinical investigations. Clinicians, therefore, engage in lifelong learning to keep up with these changes throughout their professional lives. Continuing medical education (CME) is such a critical aspect that it is required in most states for medical license renewal. Involvement in CME may include a variety of learning experiences to keep the learner up to date in their area of expertise.

In recent decades, there has been a transformation of CME in the USA due to stakeholder concerns over the cost of healthcare, frequency of medical errors, fragmentationÂ of patient care, commercial influence, and the competence of healthcare professionals.
