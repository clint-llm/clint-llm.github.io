AKI is veryÂ commonly seen in patients admitted to the hospital. In the United States, 1% of all hospital admissions have AKI on admission. It is often an important factor in making the decision to hospitalize for other conditions, if not being the sole reason for hospitalization. During hospitalization, the approximate incidence rate of acute kidney injury is 2% to 5% and it develops in up to 67% of patients admitted in the intensive care unit. AKI is one of the most clinically impactful diseases since it affects patient management to a great extent in terms of the treatment options for their primary disease. Most drugs or procedures that use contrast media may need to be delayed due to co-existent AKI. Most of the drugs are renally excreted, and dosages might need to be adjusted on account of the reduced renal function. Sometimes, it may even necessitate frequent monitoring of drug levels, for example, vancomycin. Furthermore, a huge percentage, approximately 95%, of nephrologist consultations are related to AKI. AKI is thus an important contributor to more extended hospital stays and patient morbidity.
