There are two described techniques for performing this nerve block: intraoral and extraoral (percutaneous). Syverud et al. compared these two approaches and found that the intraoral block with the application of topical anesthesia was less painful than the percutaneous injection

**Percutaneous**

- Identify the location of mental foramen with the left index finger (as described above in Anatomy and Physiology

- Prepare the skin with topical antiseptic (like isopropyl)

- Insert a 27-gauge needle at the injection point approximately 1 cm toward the foramen

- Aspirate to prevent vascular injection

- Avoid intra-foraminal injection by withdrawing the needle if the patient reports paresthesia

- Instill 1.5 to 3 mL local anesthetic

**Intraoral**

- Identify the injection site (as described above in Anatomy and Physiology)Apply topical anesthesia on the injection site for approximately 60 seconds

- Retract the lower lip and insert a small-gauge needle parallel to the premolar at about 1 cm depth ( the thumb remains placed just below the mental foramen as palpated previously)

- Avoid intra-foraminal injection by withdrawing the needle if the patient reports paresthesia

- Aspirate to exclude vascular injection

- Instill 1.5 to 3 mL local anesthetic

Slow injection of anesthetic has been proven more comfortable to patients than a brisk one, and anesthesia success is the same with both

Pinprick sensation on the inferior lip and chin and absent light touch signify a successful block
