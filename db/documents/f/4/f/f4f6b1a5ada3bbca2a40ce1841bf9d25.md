The primary goal of therapy is to reduce the abnormal muscle contractions resulting from abnormal impulse transmissions to adjacent neurons (ephaptic). Hemifacial spasm can be either treated medically or surgically based on the underlying etiology and severity of the disorder.

**Medical Management**

**Botulinum Neurotoxin (BoNT) Injections in H****emifacial Spasm**

The advent of botulinum toxin has revolutionized the management of hemifacial spasm. Injecting botulinum toxin has become a first choice among the treating physicians as well as the patients due to its efficacy and fewer side effects. The most commonly used BoNT in treating hemifacial spasm is Onabotulinum toxin A. Other commercially available BoNT preparations include rimabotulinumtoxinB and Abobotulinum toxin A. A thorough evaluation excluding the secondary causes such as tumors or vascular malformations is essential before the treatment with botulinum toxin to achieve maximum benefit.

**Mechanism of Action of Botulinum Toxin**

BoNT acts on the presynaptic terminal at the neuromuscular junction and blocks the calcium-mediated release of presynaptic neurotransmitter-acetylcholine (Ach), leading to non-conduction of a nerve impulse across the NM junction leading to temporary paralysis of muscles supplied. This chemodenervation effect usually lasts for 3 to 6 months and subsequently reverses back to baseline.

**Dosing and Scheduling of Botox Injection**

The usual dose of Onabotulinum toxin A is 10 to 36 U. There is a need for repetitive injections scheduled at intervals of 3 to 6 months. Some physicians prefer flexible dosing intervals ranging from 6 to 20 weeks as lasting effects vary. The symptomatic improvement after botox injection is evident 3 to 6 days after the injection and reaches to peak after 2 weeks of injection.

BoNT is injected in affected muscles, most commonly the orbicularis oculi (upper and lower eyelids), corrugator, frontalis, zygomaticus major, buccinators, and masseter.

See Table 1. Commonly used doses for Onabotulinum neurotoxin A in hemifacial spasm.

Injecting Botulinum toxin is a simple and non-invasive procedure. However, the patient should be forewarned about the side effects such as ptosis, temporary bruising, swelling, facial asymmetry, asymmetric eyebrows, facial weakness, among others which are mild and transient. The frequent repetition of procedures and high cost are the two major drawbacks of this therapy.

Botulinum toxin treatment has reported achieving notable symptomatic improvements in 85% to 95% of patients in various clinical trials.

Botulinum toxin has a dual benefit as it reportedly reduces depression among patients with hemifacial spasm. The theory postulated includes 2 ways by which botulinum toxin alleviates depression. The first way is by providing symptomatic relief leading to less social embarrassment. The other possible mechanism is reducing the hyperactivity of the amygdala, causing depression and anxiety.  Botulinum toxin causes chemical denervation in adjacent muscles of the face causing interruption of afferent sensory information to the trigeminal tract leading to reduced trigeminal sensory input to the brainstem and amygdala.

**Oral Medications**

Traditionally, the treatment of hemifacial spasm, especially in the mild form and early stages, was oral medications. Commonly prescribed oral medications include anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine, gabapentin, benzodiazepines (clonazepam), anticholinergics, baclofen, haloperidol, among others. These drugs have some efficacy in relieving the spasm, but the results are inconsistent. The major drawback of most of these medications is side effects such as excessive sedation and fatigue associated with their long-term use. Oral medications can be considered as first-line therapy in those who are unwilling for botulinum toxin therapy and not good candidates for surgery.

**Surgical Management**

Surgical treatment is the only permanent treatment solution that addresses the underlying cause. It is preferred in most severe cases of hemifacial spasm and those refractory to botulinum toxin therapy. The procedure of choice is microvascular decompression that entails releasing the facial nerve from the aberrant vessel, causing compression at the brainstem. As discussed earlier in electrophysiological findings, the lateral spreading response results from ephaptic transmission of nerve signals to neighboring neurons due to compression-related demyelination of facial nerve root at the exit/entry zone. When such compression is relieved, the lateral spreading response on nerve stimulation will disappear. Thus EMG can be used to assess the achievement of successful decompression post-operatively. Following the first year after surgery, the average success rate of microvascular decompression surgery is reported to be 80% to 88%.

The complications due to an invasive procedure, for example, anesthetic complications, transient or permanent facial nerve palsy, hearing loss, cerebrospinal (CSF) leakage, recurrence of symptoms, are some of the disadvantages of this surgical modality. Recurrent hemifacial spasm is rarely seen to develop (1%) when patients remain asymptomatic for at least 2 years after surgery.
