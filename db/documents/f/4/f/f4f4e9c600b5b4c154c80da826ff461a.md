Pityriasis rosea is a relatively common skin lesion seen in the clinic. The condition is often managed by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, dermatologist and the emergency department physician. It is important for clincians to recognize the herald patch because at least 25% of patients will have an accompanying severe itch, which if not treated can lead to a poor quality of life. These patients need follow up as recurrences are common.
