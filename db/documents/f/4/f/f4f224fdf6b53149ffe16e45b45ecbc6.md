The sartorius is innervated by the femoral nerve, which receives its nerve supply from L2, L3, and L4 nerve roots. The femoral nerve innervates both the hip flexor and quadriceps muscle groups.

**Anterior Division - Motor**

- Sartorius

- Pectineus

- Typically receives its innervation via the femoral nerve, although through cadaveric studies, it is now known that the obturator nerve also provides additional innervation.

- Iliacus

- Via muscular branches of the femoral nerve (specifically L1, L2, L3)

**Posterior Division - Motor**

- Quadriceps muscle group (rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius)

The innervation to sartorius is derived explicitly from the anterior division of the femoral nerve. The posterior division supplies innervation to the muscles of the quadriceps. The pectineus nerve innervates the pectineus, which branches off the femoral nerve cephalad to the inguinal ligament. The femoral nerve also supplies sensation to the anterior thigh and medial leg.
