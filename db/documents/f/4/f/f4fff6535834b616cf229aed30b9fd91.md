Presbyopia is the most common optical error in the eye. It is characterized by a gradual and progressive reduction in the ability to see near. Systemic conditions that affect the integrity of the crystalline lens, like diabetes and chronic inflammatory disease requiring high doses of long-term cortisone therapy, can significantly affect testing and result in erroneous prescriptions. While this condition usually presents at about the age of 40, it may occur earlier or later, depending on the inherent refractive error of the patient. Proper refraction at a distance followed by near refraction can result in the correct power being obtained. This can be dispensed as single-vision lenses, multifocal, or contact lenses. A small percentage of people may opt for refractive surgery. Knowledge of the condition and related complications will help the healthcare team achieve better patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of presbyopia.
- Review the embryology of the crystalline lens.
- Identify the signs and symptoms of presbyopia.
- Outline how comorbidities may interfere with proper prescriptions for presbyopia.
