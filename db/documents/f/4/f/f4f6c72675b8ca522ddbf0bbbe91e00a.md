The tools for assessing the hepatoduodenal ligament are different:

- Ultrasonography (US) is the simplest and most informative tool about blood flow.

- Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) can provide a general evaluation.

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has a higher resolution for soft tissues.

- Magnetic resonance (MR) cholangiography is useful to understand the clinical situation of the biliary tract.

- Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is used for an initial and general evaluation.

- Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET / CT) is used when there is a need to evaluate the presence of tumors.

- Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and intraductal ultrasonography are more effective for some authors as an assessment tool for the biliary area.
