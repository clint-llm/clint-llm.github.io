Alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually appear when the individual discontinues or reduces alcohol intake after a period of prolonged consumption. However, healthcare workers should be aware that alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be severe and lead to death. In all cases, the management of alcohol withdrawal is monitored and managed by an interprofessional team to ensure good outcomes.

Alcohol withdrawal can be managed both as an inpatient or outpatient. In each case, close monitoring is essential as the symptoms can suddenly become severe.

In most cases, mild symptoms may start to develop within hours after the last drink, and if left untreated, can progress and become more severe. Because chronic alcohol use is widespread in society, all healthcare workers, including the nurse and pharmacist, should be familiar with the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and its management. Nurses monitoring alcoholic patients should be familiar with signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal and communicate to the interprofessional team if there are any deviations from normal. In most cases, the symptoms are autonomic. For those who develop delirium tremens, monitoring in a quiet room is recommended.

Today, pharmacotherapy is often used to manage the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. However, if the symptoms are severe and pharmacological treatment is required, the patient should be referred to an internist or an alcohol treatment specialist. Prompt referral and treatment can help lower the morbidity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms and may even be lifesaving.

After treatment, the patient should be referred to AA and urged to abstain from alcohol. For patients without support, a social worker should be involved to help facilitate addiction rehabilitation.

**Outcomes**

Today the outcomes for most patients with alcohol withdrawal are good, but for those who develop delirium tremens, the findings are less optimal. Despite optimal treatment, the condition is associated with mortality rates of 1 to 5%.
