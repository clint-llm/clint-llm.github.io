Outcomes after treatment can be assessed based on Crawford Classification

- Excellent outcome: No pain and a full range of motion at the DIP joint.

- Good outcomes: less than a 10-degree extension deficit.

- Fair outcome:10–25 degrees of extension deficit with no pain.

- Poor outcome: more than 25 degrees of extension deficit or persistent pain.

Missed diagnosis or inappropriate treatment can result in DIPJ dysfunction. Lengthening of the terminal extensor tendon by 1mm results in 25 degrees of extension lag, and a shortening of 1 mm will restrict DIPJ flexion
