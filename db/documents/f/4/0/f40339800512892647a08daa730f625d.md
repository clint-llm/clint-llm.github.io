Sciatica results from pressure on the sciatic nerve; therefore, complications may develop if measures are not taken to relieve the pressure. Potential complications of unresolved sciatic nerve compression include

- Increased pain over time

- Paresthesias in the affected leg

- Loss of muscular strength in the affected leg

- Loss of bowel and/or bladder function

- Permanent nerve damage
