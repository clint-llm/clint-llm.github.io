These types of skin grafts require a collaborating interprofessional team.

The donor sites, recipient sites, and date of next dressing changes should be delineated in medical notation by the surgical team so the entire healthcare team can treat the patient appropriately. In this way, recently grafted wounds are not disturbed, and graft take is not jeopardized. Burn patients should ideally receive care for in a burn center with experienced nurses, techs, social workers, and therapists. Nurses should be fully aware of the post-operative management of patients with skin grafts. The wounds should be monitored closely for bleeding, infection, and ischemia. Any change in the wound requires immediate communication with the surgeon. Additionally, since many of these patients remain immobile, nurses should ensure they are on deep vein thrombosis. Wound dressing changes should take place according to the preference of the surgeon. Once the wounds have healed, some patients may require physical therapy. Others may need to wear compression garments to prevent hypertrophic scarring. A wound care nurse should monitor these patients until the healing is complete and report any concerns to the surgeon for evaluation. The success of skin grafts depends not only on the surgeon but the interprofessional team looking after the patient. [Level 5]
