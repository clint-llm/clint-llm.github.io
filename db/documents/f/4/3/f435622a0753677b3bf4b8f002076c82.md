Antibiotics are common agents used in modern healthcare. This was not always the case. From ancient times, people sought ways to treat those afflicted with infections. Dyes, molds, and even heavy metals were thought to hold promise for healing. Various microorganisms have medical significance, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Antibiotics are compounds that target bacteria and, thus, are intended to treat and prevent bacterial infections. This activity will examine the various classes of antibiotics, their mechanisms of action, bacterial susceptibilities, and potential adverse events.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various classes of antibiotic medications.
- Explain the various mechanisms of action of different classes of antibiotics.
- Review the potential adverse effects both of antibiotics in general and class-specific side effects.
