Cheyne-Stokes respiration is a type of breathing disorder characterized by cyclical episodes of apnea and hyperventilation. Although described in the early 19th century by John Cheyne and William Stokes, this disorder has received considerable attention in the last decade due to its association with heart failure and stroke, two major causes of mortality, and morbidity in developed countries. Unlike obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which can be the cause of heart failure, Cheyne-Stokes respiration is believed to be a result of heart failure. The presence of Cheyne-Stokes respiration in patients with heart failure also predicts worse outcomes and increases the risk of sudden cardiac death. Despite increasing recognition and growing knowledge, Cheyne-Stokes respiration remains elusive, and patients have very limited treatment options.
