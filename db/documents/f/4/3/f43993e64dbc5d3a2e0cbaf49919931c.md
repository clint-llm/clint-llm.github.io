These lesions are benign but can create a cosmetic concern. They are challenging to treat; the entire sebaceous unit must be eliminated to prevent a recurrence. The severity of SGH lesions has been classified as limited if less than ten lesions are recognized, moderate (10 to 50 lesions), frequent (less than 100 lesions), and very frequent (more than 100 lesions).

Sebaceous hyperplasia is treatable with different techniques with variable cosmetic results. The therapeutic outcomes have been categorized as optimal (if results in no scarring and no hypo- or hyperpigmentation), moderate (moderate scarring and/or hypo- or hyperpigmentation), and poor (scarring and/or hypo- or hyperpigmentation is prominent).

The main treatments are pharmaceutical agents like trichloroacetic acid (topic treatment) and isotretinoin (systemic). Physical treatments are cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, photodynamic and laser therapy, excision, shave, and curettage. Cryotherapy, electrodesiccation, curettage, excision, and topical trichloroacetic acid can cause skin discoloration and scarring so that the cosmetic outcome can be unsatisfactory. Photodynamic therapy uses with the wavelength of 1720 nm that is said to be specific for the sebaceous gland unit; it provides minimal damage to the surrounding tissues but requires multiple sessions and special equipment.
