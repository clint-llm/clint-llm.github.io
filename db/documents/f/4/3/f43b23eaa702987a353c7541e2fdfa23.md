Proper patient education on dosage, monitoring, and stopping treatment will help improve outcomes. Proper physician education on considerations when prescribing, comorbidities, monitoring, and stopping treatment is also necessary. Care is essential when prescribing the oral solution for pediatric patients due to the possibility of pancreatitis or worsening existing pancreatitis. Consideration is also required when prescribing the correct formula for the proper condition(s). Lower dose lamivudine is indicated for patients with HBV only. If a patient is co-infected with HIV-1, a larger dose of lamivudine is necessary to prevent HIV-1 mutation and resistance. Additionally, co-administered sorbitol-containing medicines should be avoided to limit the sub-exposure of medication. All these factors require the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs), specialists (particularly with infectious disease and HIV specialized training), nurses, and pharmacists, collaborating so that lamivudine and other antiviral measures can be optimized and issues that can limit therapeutic effectiveness avoided. This will result in better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
