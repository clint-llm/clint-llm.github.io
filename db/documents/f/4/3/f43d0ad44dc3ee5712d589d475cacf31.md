Bladder-exstrophy-epispadias-complex (BEEC) depicts a spectrum of birth defects, ranging from epispadias to cloacal exstrophy at the milder and the most severe ends of the spectrum. The classical bladder exstrophy is characterized by abnormalities involving the lower urinary tract, abdominal wall, bony pelvis, genitalia, pelvic floor, spine, and the anus.

As a general rule, all the structures, including the bladder, urethra, vagina, and rectum, are displaced anteriorly in bladder exstrophy. The distorted anatomy of the bony pelvis in bladder exstrophy needs a special mention. The 'open book configuration' of the pelvis is an appropriate term for its description. The main abnormalities in the bony pelvis include pubic diastasis, shorter anterior segments, and outward rotation of the anterior and posterior segments.

In children with exstrophy, the pubic diastasis is around 4 cm at birth and increases to around 8 cm by the age of 10 years. Contrary to this, in a normal human, the distance is less than 1 cm at all ages. It has been postulated that a disruption in the symphyseal ligaments might be responsible for this. Secondly, the anterior segments of the bony pelvis are approximately 30% shorter. However, the dimensions of the posterior segments of the bony pelvis are within normal limits. Both, the anterior and posterior segments of the bony pelvis, are also externally rotated.
