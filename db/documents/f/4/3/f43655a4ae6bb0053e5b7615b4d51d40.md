Meclizine has not been shown to require serum testing for monitoring. There is no established therapeutic level for meclizine. Just like any drug, patients require clinical monitoring for any adverse reactions.

Due to meclizine's anticholinergic effects, its ability to cause CNS depression, and its metabolism by CYP enzymes, it has the potential to interact with a large variety of different drugs. Before prescribing, the healthcare provider should carefully review a patient's current medication list and past medical history to avoid interactions, systemic drug accumulation, and/or exacerbating an already establish ailment.
