Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) isÂ an alternative revascularization procedure to systemic thrombolysis, transcatheter embolectomy, or surgical embolectomy for massive and submassive PE with hemodynamic instability and a high risk of morbidity and mortality with the standard care. It is associated with some risks, but overall it reduces the systemic risk of thrombolytic therapy in patients with severe submassive or massive PE and a high risk of bleeding. The use of this therapy is on the rise in the United States as more healthcare professionals are becoming trained in the art of CDT. Overall, it saves lives and reduces the burden of pulmonary embolism (PE).
