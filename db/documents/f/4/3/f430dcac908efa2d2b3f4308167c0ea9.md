**Therapeutic Drug Monitoring**

- Clinicians may find utility in monitoring antidepressant levels in their patients. This therapeutic drug monitoring strategy is based on serum or plasma concentrations of antidepressants, which researchers believe is a more reliable index than dosage. Therapeutic drug monitoring of antidepressants is beneficial with agents that have a reliable therapeutic range established.

- Nonetheless, it may also be helpful in patients who are refractory to treatment, have adverse effects, or have a history of noncompliance. Therapeutic drug monitoring is expensive, so clinicians must weigh the benefits to the cost of the study.

**Psychiatric Assessment**

- Various scales in clinical practice can assist in trending a patient’s symptoms to determine therapeutic response.

- Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).

- Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression(HDRS-17)

- Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale(MADRS)

- In addition, monitoring for suicidal ideation is of paramount importance.

- Clinicians should monitor for adverse drug reactions, coexisting anxiety, or medical disorders at each visit.

- Clinicians should also assess the response to therapy and consider augmenting or switching antidepressants in an inadequate response.
