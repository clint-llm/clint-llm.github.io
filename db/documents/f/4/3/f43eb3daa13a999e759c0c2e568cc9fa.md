The bulk of causes of in-toeing are most often secondary to physiologic conditions that resolve over time. It is important to elicit pathologies in the history and physical examination to rule out the less common conditions that may present similarly. As mentioned above, developmental dysplasia of the hip can be associated with metatarsus adductus but can present as an isolated finding as well. Careful follow-up and timely imaging can differentiate between the physiologic laxity of the hip and normal hip development, versus hip dysplasia. Deformities of the lower leg can be distinguished from the common physiologic causes through a detailed physical examination. Clubfoot is a foot deformity that is associated with multiple foot findings, including plantarflexion (cavus), adductus, varus, and equinus, made memorable by using the mnemonic CAVE. Secondary causes due to underlying conditions can include cerebral palsy or other neuromuscular diseases. These conditions should be considered when the physical exam is notable for other findings outside of the lower extremities.
