Most liver biopsies are now done on an outpatient basis. However, the outpatient center where a liver biopsy is done should ideally have an easy provision in place for an inpatient stay, laboratory, and blood bank services.Â  Consider scheduling outpatient liver biopsies in the morning so that patients can be easily monitored in the facility for at least four hours following the procedure when all the support staff is available to take care of complications, if any. A brief history and physical examination are done. There is a general consensus to stop antiplatelet and anticoagulation medications prior to the procedure. The duration for stopping these drugs depends on the mechanism of action of the medication. The indications for antiplatelet/ anticoagulation medications should be reviewed prior to advising cessation of therapy. Most centers stop these agents five days prior to the procedure. Most experts obtain a routine complete blood count with coagulation profile to ensure platelet count is within normal range, and there is no evidence of coagulopathy. Abnormalities of the above are associated with an increased risk of post-procedure bleeding. No routine antibiotics need to be given.

Patients can typically take a light snack four hours prior to the procedure. The experts have varying opinions about fasting duration. Anxious patients might require sedation; therefore, the longer duration of fasting is preferred.

Written informed consent should be taken.
