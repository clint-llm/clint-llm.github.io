The most common approach to a triple arthrodesis is a double incision, one lateral incision, and one medial. As such, many structures are encountered during dissection and fixation. The most common structures encountered are discussed here. Laterally, nerves encountered are the sural and intermediate dorsal cutaneous nerve.  Vascular structures encountered on the lateral incision include the artery of the tarsal sinus and venous connections supplying the extensor digitorum brevis.

There has been a discussion of a single medial incision approach with sparing of the calcaneocuboid joint for hindfoot arthrodesis (called a "medial double").
