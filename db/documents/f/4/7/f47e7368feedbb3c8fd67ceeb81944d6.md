According to the study by Finley et al. in the USA, polydactyly is 10 times more common in Black versus White males and 22 times more common in Black females than White females. The incidence of polydactyly is 2.3 per 1000 in White males, 13.5 per 1000 in Black males, and 0.6 per 1000 in White females and 11.1 per 1000 in Black females.

The nature of polydactyly in the world seems to be influenced by genetic and ethnic factors. The incidence of preaxial polydactyly is 0.08 to 1.4 in 1,000 live births. It is more common in Whites and also relatively frequent in Native American and Asian patients.

In contrast, postaxial polydactyly is 10 times more frequent in the Black population compared to Whites. Postaxial polydactyly is more common than preaxial polydactyly and is frequently associated with other congenital defects. Its prevalence is 1-2/1000 live births.
