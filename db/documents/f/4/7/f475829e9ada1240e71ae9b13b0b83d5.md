**Ischemic optic neuropathy (ION)**is classified as either anterior or posterior ischemic optic neuropathy if ischemia is to the optic nerve head or posterior portion of the optic nerve, respectively.

**Orbital compartment syndrome**isÂ seen in conjunction with traumatic injury to the eye. Direct eye compression may cause venous congestion with associated elevation in orbital pressure compromising circulation to the orbit and adjacent intraocular structures.

**Corneal abrasion**may occur if the eye sustains direct trauma intraoperatively.

**Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO),**also called a retinal stroke, is due to decreased retinal perfusion, typically related to direct eye compression. The severity of vision loss depends on the occluded vessel territory, but in most patients, it is extensive.

**Cortical blindness**can result from ischemic stroke involving the cerebral visual cortex or subcortical edema within the parieto-occipital regions, resulting from a condition referred to as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). Cerebral ischemia may result from an altered hemodynamic state or embolism.

**Pituitary apoplexy**results from spontaneous infarction and/or hemorrhage into a pituitary tumor or pituitary parenchyma. Although rare, it has been reported in the setting of spine surgery.
