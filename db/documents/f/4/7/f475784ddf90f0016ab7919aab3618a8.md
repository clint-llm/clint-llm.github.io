The diagnosis and management of dyslexia can be a difficult challenge for health professionals. An interprofessional team involving primary clinicians, optometrists, audiologists, and nursing working together will lead to the best outcomes. Developmental and behavioral pediatricians, child neurologists, psychologists, and or neuropsychologists may be needed as part of the team as well. Additionally, parents, teachers, and school administrators play a major role in improving outcomes in patients with dyslexia.
