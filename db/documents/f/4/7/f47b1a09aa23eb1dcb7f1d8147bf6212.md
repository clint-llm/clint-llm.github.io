Patients with pernicious anemia can present in one or more clinical settings due to this insidious condition's wide array of potential manifestations. They may be seen by providers in the area(s) of nutrition, primary care, hematology, gastroenterology, neurology, psychiatry, rheumatology, and endocrinology, to name a few. Making the correct diagnosis will include laboratory scientists and may also include pathologists. Once diagnosed, the patient's care may involve a medical assistant, nurse, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, physician, and pharmacist.

Patients require a lifelong coordinated effort by an interprofessional team to enhance healthcare team outcomes. For example, a hematologist prescribing B12 supplementation and ordering bloodwork, a medical assistant administering IM B12 injections, a gastroenterologist providing surveillance for gastric cancer, an endocrinologist treating diabetes mellitus, and a pharmacist reconciling medications.[Level 5]
