Initial breast imaging of the patient should include a full clinical breast self-examination (BSE) to assess and validate all palpable masses, either identified by the patient or by the physician. Following BSE, a bilateral breast ultrasound is performed with a sequential sweeping of the breast surface.

The breast is assessed in the four main quadrants, namely outer upper, outer inner, lower outer, and lower inner quadrants. Any lesions identified during the examination should be marked as a breast 'o clock position for future follow up sessions.

The most common imaging technique used is a radial, star-shaped, or superior to inferior sweep of the entire breast, extending to the axillary space, parasternal, and clavicular surfaces.

The retro areolar space should also be evaluated systematically; the dense tissue causes posterior acoustic shadowing, limiting visibility posterior to its surface. This anatomical limitation can be overcome by either angling the probe upwards towards the retro areolar ducts or using a gel standoff pad with decreased focal zone and altering of the tissue gain compensation controls, visualizing the soft tissue posterior to the dense nipple tissue.
