At present, there is no specific treatment to treat cervical dystonias. To minimize and relieve symptoms, pharmacological treatment options include benzodiazepines (treatment of anxiety and spasms), muscle relaxants (muscle relaxant), and anticholinergics (counteracting acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter in the nervous system).Â Another option is botulinum toxin injection.
