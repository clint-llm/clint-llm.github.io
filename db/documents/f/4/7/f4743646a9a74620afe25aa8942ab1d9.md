Patients with hyperhidrosis will report excessive sweating, usually in areas with the highest density of eccrine glands, including the palms, soles, face, head, or axillae. Primary hyperhidrosis is more commonly seen in the younger population, those with symptoms for more than six months, those with a family history of the disorder, and those with bilateral involvement.

Diagnostic criteria for primary hyperhidrosis:

- Excessive sweating for 6 or more months

- Sweating involves axilla, palms, soles, and/or face

- Sweating is bilateral and symmetric

- Decreased or no sweating at night

- Sweating episodes last at least 7 days

- The individual is 25 years of age or younger

- There is a family history

- Sweating impairs daily living activities
