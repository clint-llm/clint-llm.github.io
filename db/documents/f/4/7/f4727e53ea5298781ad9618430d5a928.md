- The most important complications of pneumatoceles are related to errors in diagnosis and subsequent interventions, leading to more complications.

- Rupture resulting in pneumothorax or tension pneumothorax with a mediastinal shift. ConventionalÂ tube thoracostomy is the treatment of choice.

- Pneumomediastinum

- Infection and empyema/ lung abscess formation. It is the most common complication of traumatic pulmonary pneumatocele. Infected pneumatoceles carry a higher mortality than a typical lung abscess. The risk of secondary infection is increased by pulmonary contusion that impairs bacterial clearance. Treatment of infected TPP is similar to that of a lung abscess.

- Pyopneumothorax

- Fistulous pleural extrathoracic communication from incomplete anti-TB treatment

- Hemothorax, hemopneumothorax

- Continuous positive airway pressure may cause TPP enlargement and compression of adjacent lung tissue, leading to hypoxemia and cardiopulmonary instability.
