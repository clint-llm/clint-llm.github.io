The specific electrocardiographic (ECG) findings are tall and peaked P waves in the leads II, III, and avF and a deep prolonged terminal negative deflection of P wave in the lead V1, suggestive of biatrial enlargement. QRS shows right axis deviation, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), and complete or incomplete right bundle branch block. RVH and atrial fibrillation are disproportionately more common in LS when compared to an isolated ASD. Chest x-rays reveal enlarged RA, RV and main pulmonary artery with increased end-on pulmonary vascular markings suggesting increased left to right shunt. Pulmonary venous congestion is usually absent unless the ASD is restrictive. Two-dimensional echocardiography with color flow Doppler establishes the diagnosis of LS.
