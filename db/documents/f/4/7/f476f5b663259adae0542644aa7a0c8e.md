Individuals who are diagnosed with postpartum blues are at increased risk for developing postpartum depression or postpartum psychosis. One particular study completed in Africa demonstrated that women diagnosed with “postpartum blues” on the fifth day after delivery were twelve times more likely to be diagnosed with postpartum depression one month after delivery and ten times more likely to be diagnosed with postpartum depression two months after delivery.

While postpartum depression, which is the most common and widely recognized complication of postpartum “blues,” has many of the same characteristics and is diagnosed using the same criteria as major depressive disorder, women with postpartum depression tend to have higher levels of co-morbid anxiety. These women are also more likely to convert to bipolar disorder in the future than women with major depressive disorder without a peripartum onset.

According to the DSM-5, psychotic features are estimated to occur in 0.1% to 0.2% of women in the peripartum period. The DSM further states that this risk is more common in primiparous women, those with a prior history of depressive or bipolar disorders, and those with a family history of bipolar disorder. The DSM further states that once an individual has had one peripartum-onset depressive episode with psychotic features, the risk of recurrent with subsequent pregnancies and deliveries is 30% to 50%.
