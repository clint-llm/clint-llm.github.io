Causes of sarcopenia are generally attributable to the natural processes of aging, which are not entirely understood and are multifaceted.

Additionally, sarcopenia is associated with and may, in part, be caused by several chronic diseases that negatively affect the musculoskeletal system and physical activity.

Theoretically, the role of these disease processes on sarcopenia may exert themselves primarily through direct effects on muscle function, or secondarily through retardation of physical activity or caloric restriction.
