The hyoglossus is a skeletal muscle and, like all skeletal muscles, derives from the dermatomyotomes of the paraxial mesoderm on both sides of the neural tube. At approximately day 25, the paraxial mesoderm starts to segment, forming structures known as metamers. This indicates the beginning of somite development which progresses along a craniocaudal gradient and in a symmetrical manner. This is what results in the adult body having symmetrical musculature and bones. By around day 32, more than 30 somite pairs are present, with 38 or 39 somite pairs being formed by the end of this process. These pairs can be split up into the following subdivisions:

- Occipital – containing 4 pairs

- Cervical – containing 8 pairs

- Thoracic – containing 12 pairs

- Lumbar – containing 5 pairs

- Sacral – containing 5 pairs

- Coccygeal – containing either 4 or 5 pairs

Of importance to the hyoglossus are the four occipital pairs as these develop into the occipital myotomes. The occipital myotomes move until they reach the floor of what will become the oral cavity. These myotomes go on to form the muscles of the pharynx and anterior neck, including the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the tongue, except for palatoglossus, which is derived from the fourth branchial arch. As the hyoglossus derives from the myoblasts originating in the occipital somites, it is innervated by the hypoglossal nerve (cranial nerve XII).
