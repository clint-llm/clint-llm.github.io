Lupus can occur in all age groups, but DLE occurs more frequently in women in their fourth and fifth decades of life. Twenty-five percent of patients with SLE may develop typical discoid lesions at some point during their illness, and 1% to 5% of patients with discoid lupus may develop SLE.

Ethnicity is also a major risk factor for developing LE, and its effect in some populations is almost as strong as that of gender. SLE prevalence is four-fold higher in African-American women than White-race American women (4 in 1000 versus 1 in 1000). In addition, African-Americans tend to develop the disease at an earlier age and have a higher mortality rate.
