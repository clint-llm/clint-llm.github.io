The anterior mediastinum is the most common location of extragonadal germ cell tumors constituting approximately 50 to 70% of all cases. Germ cell tumors of the posterior mediastinum are a rarity. Primary mediastinal germ cell tumors and gonadal germ cell tumors have biochemical and histologic resemblances with each other, including the detection of isochromosome 12p. Mediastinal germ cell tumors can be classified as teratomas, seminomatous tumors, or non-seminomatous tumors. They have similar histology and treatment regimens to their gonadal variants. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of mediastinal germ cell tumors and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of mediastinal germ cell tumors. 
- Review the epidemiology of mediastinal germ cell tumors.
- Outline the treatment guidelines for mediastinal germ cell tumors. 
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional team strategies for identifying and treating mediastinal germ cell tumors to improve outcomes.
