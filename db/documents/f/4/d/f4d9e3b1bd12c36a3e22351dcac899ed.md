# Continuing Education Activity

A T-tube is a T-shaped tube placed in the common bile duct following procedures involving the duct, such as after choledochotomy. T-tubes can also be used for persistent duodenal fistulas, pancreaticoduodenectomies, or hepaticojejunostomy in liver transplantation. T-tubes provide external drainage of bile via a controlled route the original pathology is resolving. T-tubes should not be confused with tracheal tubes or tympanoplasty tubes. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in placing T-tubes and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of T tube.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to T tube placement and care.
- Recall, analyze, and select appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of T tube and bile duct obstruction.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication regarding management of T-tubes to improve patient outcomes.

# Introduction

Cholelithiasis, or stones formed within the gall bladder, might obstruct the biliary flow into the small bowel. Eventually, cholelithiasis might migrate into the choledochal, and the patient would clinically present with jaundice. Several surgical options have been introduced to manage the choledocholithiasis, including step-wise management with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and consequent or synchronized open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy or laparoscopic choledocotomy and open or laparoscopic approach for cholecystectomy.  The former option with ERCP and either open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy is more commonly used. In contrast, the latter option of laparoscopic choledochal exploration is limited to well-equipped tertiary referral centers.

Following the removal of choledocholithiasis, the gap within the CBD would be repaired with absorbable sutures. To prevent the long-term consequences of the ductal stricture and divert the short-term biliary build-up following suture repairing the CBD and keep a patent duct, surgeons would provocatively place a T-tube in the duct. The T-tube is latex, silicone, or red rubber shaped, similar to the English letter T.  The long handle of the T would pass through the abdominal wall and be connected to a draining bag. Later in the process of choledochal healing, the patency of the duct and the presence of any retained choledocholithiasis would be examined by instilling a contrast media and consequently obtaining an x-ray.

T Tube is a draining tube placed in the common bile duct after common bile duct (CBD) exploration with supra-duodenal choledochotomy. It provides external drainage of bile into a controlled route while the healing process of choledochotomy is maturing and the original pathology is resolving. T tub is named to reflect the shape of the tube used for the CBD drainage. It is not be confused with the Tracheal tube or Tympanoplasty tube.

Other options of managing CBD exploration are stenting, or primary closure in selected patients have been used

# Anatomy and Physiology

The biliary system has the highest potential anatomical variations tracts in the body. Several classification systems have been introduced to categorize the biliary system and the anatomical variations, including Couinaud, Huang et al., Karakas et al., Choi et al., Champetier et al., and Ohkubo.

# Indications

Indications of T Tube can be summarized in one concept that is to stent and drain the common bile duct after choledochotomy

Another less common reason is repairing limited injury of the CBD over a T tube. Simple closure of the CBD injury without stenting and draining is associated with a high rate of stricture and or leak. T tube placement may also be used for CBD drainage when ERCP and PTC fail to clear the CBD intraluminal non-malignant obstruction. This is a rare indication, but it can relieve the obstruction and prevent further complications.

A common misconception is using the word T tube interchangeably with different tubes such as Cholecystostomy tube and PTC drain. The Cholecystostomy tube is a tube that is inserted by interventional radiology method through the abdominal wall into the gallbladder and serves as a drain to an inflamed gallbladder in patients with acute cholecystitis who are otherwise at high risk to undergo formal cholecystectomy. On the other hand, Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiogram (PTC) is a drain inserted through the abdominal wall into a major hepatic duct, also by interventional radiology method. It is an external drain for bile in patients with bile duct obstruction until the underlying pathology is treated.

# Equipment

The special part of the equipment is the T tube itself. As the name refers, it is a special tube in the shape of T with a shorter transverse part (20 cm) that stays inside the CBD (after trimming) and a long longitudinal part (60 cm) that extends from the middle of the transverse part to an end that connects with a drainage bag. This portion extends from the CBD to outside the abdominal cavity when applied. It comes with different circumference sizes (10, 12, 14, 16, 18 Fr). T tubes can be made of different materials like latex, silicone, red rubber, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)

# Preparation

Several factors, including hypoalbuminemia, might predict the post-operative complications with T tube implementation, e.g., T-tube sinus duodenal fistula. Therefore, improving patients' status pre-operatively would prevent the occurrence of mentioned morbidities.

# Technique or Treatment

In patients diagnosed with both cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis, CBD clearance accompanied by a synchronized or consequent cholecystectomy is recommended. Two well-established safe approaches are step-wise ERCP and consequent surgery, or synchronized open or laparoscopic approaches to the CBD exploration, clearance, and cholecystectomy. Current studies have not determined significant differences among the mentioned approaches. In patients who are decided to be managed with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the presence of choledocholithiasis and the successful removal either with cystic duct approach or with a direct choledochotomy should be documented with contrast cholangiogram intraoperatively. Both mentioned approaches demand a set of specialized instrumentation, and in case of lacking the demanding equipment, a consequent ERCP would be scheduled. Following a direct choledochotomy, the size of the CBD should be evaluated. While primary repair might be considered as acceptable management in the large CBDs, the smaller sized choledochal duct should be repaired over an appropriate size T-tube. The T-tube size ranges from 10 to 18 Fr. However, the T-tube length might be customized according to the specific length of the CBD to be implemented. The CBD condition should be checked weeks following the T-tube placement, and in unsuccessful endoscopic choledocholithiasis removal, probably due to the impacted stones, transduodenal sphincterotomy might be recommended. In complete unsuccessful cases of choledocholithiasis disimpaction, a surgical bypass method, including choledochoduodenostomy or Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy, would be preferred.

Placing a T tube in the CBD following a choledochotomy is technically complex.

Choledochotomy site closure around the tube exit should be done cautiously to avoid any tension. A 3-0 or 4-0 absorbable suture would be used to close the site. Non-absorbable suture would potentially serve as a nidus for a couple of complications, including stone formation and infection. The closure would be continued longitudinally along with the incision and CBD. Choledochotomy direction should be designed longitudinally in the anterior aspect of the duct to avoid any vascular damage. Consequently, the T-tube would be flushed to double-check both the complete tube patency and to exclude any leakage. T-tube fixation and the abdominal wall course should be selected in the shortest pattern.

# Complications

Complications of T tube placement can be due to the procedure technique, the nature of the disease, or patients' reasons. T tube placement demands high skills. Optimal techniques may reduce complications. Leak around the tube, tight closure of the choledochotomy, the inclusion of the T tube in the suturing is possible technique complications.

Bile leak is the most common complication with T tube placement and the following period. This could be immediate, delayed, or after removal.

In almost 1.5% of patients with retained intrahepatic stones who had been managed with percutaneous choldocoscopy and T-tube drainage, T tube sinus tract duodenal fistula might occur.

# Clinical Significance

The clinical use of T tubes has been significantly decreased in the last two decades due to the availability of less invasive alternatives for removing CBD stones. Because placement and removal of T tube are technically demanding and the complication rate and complexity are high, it should not be routinely performed. Less aggressive alternatives should be considered first.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

CBD exploration can be managed with other non-T tube options. CBD stenting or primary closure can be used in selected patients. Stenting may provide a better length of stay and hospitalization cost when appropriately and selectively used
