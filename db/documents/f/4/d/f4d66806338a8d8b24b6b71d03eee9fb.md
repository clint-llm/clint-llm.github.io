Bimalleolar fractures are a type of ankle fracture that involve both the lateral and medial malleoli at the distal ends of the fibula and tibia, respectively. These two bones articulate with the talus to form the ankle or tibiotalar joint. The ankle is supported by ligaments on both the medial and lateral sidesÂ that stabilize the foot under the leg and lock the fibula and tibia together. Bimalleolar fractures can affect these ligaments, too. Damage to the ligaments, instead of a fracture of one of the malleoli, still produces an unstable fracture that will likely need surgical intervention.
