Although most compounds that interfere with the ETC have a destructive function, some of them have genuine utility in the body. The uncoupling agent thermogenin is an H+ ion channel protein present in brown adipose (fat), which allows the passage of H+ ions from the intermembrane space back into the matrix. The rapid flow of H+ ions into the matrix generates heat and uncouples the ATP generating and ATP consuming reactions from each other by disrupting chemiosmosis (hence the term uncoupling agent). This heat is a significant contributor to maintaining core body temperature in neonates who would lose significant heat due to their high skin surface area to body volume ratio.
