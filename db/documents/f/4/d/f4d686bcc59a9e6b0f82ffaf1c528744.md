ICG is a relatively safe and well-tolerated dye. It has only a few contraindications in ophthalmological use. In patients who are allergic to iodide or shellfish, ICGA should not be performed. Also, it is contraindicated in patients with uremia and those with a history of severe hypersensitivity.

ICG is exclusively eliminated through the liver. So in patients with liver disease, ICGA is not recommended.
