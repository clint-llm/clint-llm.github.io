Because of the broad range of sometimes vague constitutional symptoms, the differential for the observed symptomatology can be wide. Anatomical location is important in considering the other possible disease processes that have to be ruled out. Pathology in all four surrounding surfaces have to be considered including:

- Diaphragmatic irritation (elicited by thoracic conditions, e.g., empyema, inferiorly located pleural disease)

- Pelvic pathology (e.g.,  cystitis, urinary obstruction)

- Retroperitoneal diseases (e.g.,  pyelonephritis, hematoma)

- Abdominal wall issues (e.g., rectus infection/hematoma).

Also, the following can be causes of inflammation outside of the abdominal cavity:

- Chemical irritants (e.g., bile, gastric juices, blood).

- Systemic inflammatory disease with intra-abdominal manifestations (e.g., SLE, Crohn, allergic vasculitis).

- In addition, some vascular abnormalities can cause widespread inflammatory responses including mesenteric ischemia/thrombosis, ischemic colitis.
