With the increased utilization of prostate-specific antigen as a screening for prostate cancer, and its subsequent overdiagnosis and overtreatment, several national societies have modified their guidelines regarding the use of serum PSA screening. This modification has led to an effort to differentiate between clinically significant prostate cancer versus indolent disease.

Total serum PSA exists in three isoforms of equal concentration: intact and free PSA, pro-PSA, and BPH-associated PSA (BPSA). All three isoforms have been studied as potential biomarkers for differentiating the causes of PSA elevation.

BPSA is generally limited to transitional zone tissue, and this biomarker would, therefore, be expressed by hyperplastic prostatic tissue. A proportional increase in its presence is directly related to prostate volume and suggests BPH.

Several studies have demonstrated the benefit of utilizing pro-PSA, alone or preferably in combination, as a biomarker for more aggressive prostate cancer, as pro-PSA is associated with increasing Gleason scores.
