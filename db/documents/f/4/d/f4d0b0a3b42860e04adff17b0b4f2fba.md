Besides the classic presentation of the celiac trunk trifurcating into its branches, there have been numerous reported cases of variations in the celiac trunk's branching. These cases include, but are not limited to, celiac trunk bifurcation into the hepatic artery and splenic artery, the absence of the trunk itself as it may arise commonly with the superior mesenteric artery (celiacomesenteric trunk).

During surgical procedures in the abdomen, vessel ligation and anastomosis are crucial. Surgeons must have intricate knowledge of the different variations in the vascular anatomy of the celiac trunk, which will help facilitate radiographic interpretations and will also limit complications of surgery.
