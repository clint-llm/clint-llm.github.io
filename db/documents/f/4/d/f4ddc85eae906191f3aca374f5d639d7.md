The differentials of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) include but not limited to the following:

- **Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis**
- Distinguishing features include older age, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and stenosis affecting the ostial and proximal parts of the artery compared to FMD involving the middle and distal portion of the artery in a younger female.

- **Vasculitis**
- Vasculitides like giant cell, Takayasu arteritis, and polyarteritis nodosa are differentiated from FMD by their marked inflammation.

- **Others**
- Rare conditions like Marfan syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, Alport syndrome, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, moyamoya, and Williams syndrome can be confused with FMD, but their phenotypic traits and genetics separate it. Segmental arterial mediolysis has been described in the literature to mimic FMD radiographically due to its noninflammatory and nonatherosclerotic nature. The definitive distinction is by the characteristic histological appearance of vacuolar degeneration of smooth muscles in the outer media.
