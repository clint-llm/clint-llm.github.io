In 2009, C. sinensis was classified as a carcinogen by the international agency for cancer research. The liver flukes reside within the biliary tree and cause obstruction, inflammatory irritation, and fibrosis resulting in the potential development of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).Clonorchis sinensis as a risk factor for hepatic carcinoma, potentially synergistically occurring in a co-infected patient with HBV infection and/or alcohol use disorder.

Long-standing infection also increases the risk of strictures of the bile ducts, and together with the mechanical obstruction caused by the parasite itself, can result in recurrent pyogenic cholangitis, pancreatitis, and liver abscesses.C. sinensis infection increases the risk of intrahepatic and extrahepatic CCA.
