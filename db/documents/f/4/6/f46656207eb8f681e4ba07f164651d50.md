Tarlov cysts or sacral perineural cysts are an uncommon spinal condition that primarily affects adults. They are often asymptomatic and, as a result, are most commonly picked up as incidental findings on imaging. Traditionally they are thought to not be of clinical consequence, but there is mounting clinical evidence to suggest that the morbidity associated with Tarlov cysts responds well with appropriate treatment. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of Tarlov cysts and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the signs and symptoms that can be associated with Tarlov cysts.
- Outline the differential diagnoses in chronic back pain, including Tarlov cyst.
- Identify radiological features on imaging that suggest or confirm Tarlov cysts.
- Explain the management of symptomatic Tarlov cysts.
