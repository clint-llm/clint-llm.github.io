The Bohr equation can be used to calculate the amount of dead space in a lung. Understanding the equation will simplify the concept of dead space greatly. The equation states **VD****is equal to VT multiplied by the partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2) minus partial pressure of expired carbon dioxide (PeCO2) divided by PaCO2**.

Breaking down this equation, there is the tidal volume which is the normal amount of inspired and expired gas equivalent to 500 mL. This inspired air is assumed to contain a relatively zero amount of carbon dioxide. The second half of the equation is representative of the fractional amount of dead space. Simply translating to the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) exchanged for oxygen (O2). The exchange of gases through the respiratory membrane is so rapid that we can assume the arterial CO2 partial pressure is equal to that in the alveoli. The exchanged CO2 will now become PeCO2. PeCO2 will always have a smaller value than arterial CO2 due to the mixture and dilution of CO2 gases with the 150 mL of anatomical dead space sitting in the conductive airway that is assumed to be free of CO2. Thus, by subtracting PeCO2 from PaCO2 and dividing by the PaCO2 one has you have determined a fractional equivalent of the lung is not contributing to gas exchange. Multiply that value by the normal amount of air inspired (VT) you achieve a value for physiologic dead space.
