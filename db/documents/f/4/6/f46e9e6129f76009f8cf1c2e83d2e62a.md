Here are some of the general steps providers should follow when carrying out a blood transfusion:

- Verify Blood Product

- Relay the features of a transfusion reaction to the patient. The patient should inform the nursing staff during the transfusion if these appear.

- Baseline vital signs, lung sounds, urine output, and skin color

- Prepare the Y tubing with 0.9% NaCl and have the blood unit ready in an infusion pump

- The blood should be run slowly for the first fifteen minutes, for instance, 2 ml/min or 120 ml/hr

- Staff should be supervising the patient for the first fifteen minutes as this is when most transfusion reactions happen

- The rate of transfusion can be increased after this period if the patient is stable and does not display any signs of a transfusion reaction

- Document vital signs after fifteen minutes, then every hour, and finally, at the end of the transfusion

- During the transfusion, look for any signs of transfusion reactions

- If a reaction is suspected, stop the transfusion immediately

- Disconnect the blood tubing from the patient

- Inform the provider, stay with the patient and assess the status

- Document everything

- After the transfusion, flush Y tubing with normal saline and dispose of used Y tubing in the biohazard bin

- Obtain post-transfusion vital signs

- After the procedure, some patients could experience soreness at the puncture site, but this should dissipate quickly.
