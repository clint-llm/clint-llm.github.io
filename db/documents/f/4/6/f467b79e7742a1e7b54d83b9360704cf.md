**Management at the Scene**

The care of the patient at the scene depends on the vital signs. If the patient is comatosed and in respiratory distress, airway control must be obtained before doing anything else. Endotracheal intubation is highly recommended for all patients who unable to protect their airways. If there is suspicion of opiate overdose, then naloxone should be administered to reverse the respiratory depression. However, one should be aware that naloxone can also cause agitation and aggression when it reverses the opiate. If the individual is a drug abuser, the lowest dose of naloxone to reverse respiratory apnea should be administered. In the ambulance, the patient may become combative or violent, and use of restraints may be an option. If the individual has no intravenous access, one may administer the naloxone intramuscularly, intranasally, intraosseous or via the endotracheal tube. Data show that the intranasal route is as effective as the intramuscular route in the prehospital setting.

**Emergency Department Care**

When a patient presents to the emergency department with any type of drug overdose, the ABCDE protocol has to be followed. In some cases, airway control has been obtained by emergency medical personnel at the scene, but if there is any sign of respiratory distress or failure to protect the airways in an un-intubated patient with a morphine overdose, one should not hesitate to intubate. Next, if there is any suspicion of occult trauma to the cervical spine, immobilization should be a priority. In most emergency rooms, patients who present with an unknown cause of lethargy or loss of consciousness have their blood glucose levels drawn.

Initial treatment of overdose begins with supportive care. This includes assistance in respiration, CPR if no spontaneous circulation is occurring, and removal of the opioid agent if a patch or infusion are delivering it. If the physician suspects that the individual has overdosed on an opiate and has signs of respiratory and CNS depression, no time should be wasted on laboratory studies; instead, naloxone should be administered as soon as possible.

Naloxone is a competitive antagonist of the opiate receptor. It can be administered by intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intranasal routes. Additionally, it can be used in an off-label manner by administering it via endotracheal tube or in a nebulized form, though research on the efficacy of tracheal absorption has only been performed on animal models.

**Naloxone**

Naloxone is a pure competitive antagonist of opiate receptors and has no agonistic activity. The drug is relatively safe and can be administered intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or via the endotracheal tube. Recently the FDA approved of an intranasal formula which is showing promise especially in patients who do not have intravenous access.

Whether naloxone is administered via the endotracheal tube or intravenously the onset of action is within minutes. A second dose can be administered every 2 to 3 minutes. With subcutaneous or intramuscular injection, the onset may be delayed for 3 to 10 minutes. As soon the patient is alert and awake, the dose of naloxone should be disconnected. For patients overdosed on diphenoxylate, methadone, butorphanol, nalbuphine and pentazocine, higher doses of naloxone are required.

Besides naloxone, the 2 new agents on the market to reverse opiate toxicity are nalmefene and naltrexone. Nalmefene has a half-life of 4 to 8 hours, whereas naltrexone has a half-life of 8 to 12 hours. However, the routine use of these longer-acting opiate antagonist is not recommended because of the fear of precipitating a prolonged period of opiate withdrawal.

**Starting Dose of Naloxone**

The starting dose of naloxone usually administered is between 0.4 to 1 mg in adults and 0.1 mg/kg in children. In suspected chronic opiate abusers, if the patient is somewhat stable, then the naloxone is administered slowly at doses of 0.1 to 0,4 mg IV every 1 to 3 minutes to ensure a more controlled reversal of the opiate effects. If the naloxone is administered rapidly in these patients, the patient may also start to feel the pain which was being suppressed by the opiate. If the respiration is shallow, the patient can be administered 100% FI02 or assisted with bag-valve ventilation until he or she becomes more alert and cooperative. The onset of action of naloxone is immediate with a peak response observed within 3 to 8 minutes. A repeat dose may be indicated if the patient still shows signs of opiate toxicity.

It is important to start with a low dose of naloxone at a dose of 0.05 to 0.1 mg IV and slowly titrate upwards because the risk of withdrawal symptoms (for example, nausea, vomiting, agitation, pain, and aspiration) are real, especially in patients suspected of having ingested opiates in combination with other CNS depressants like alcohol, tricyclic antidepressants, and benzodiazepines.

In some patients with opiate overdose and long-term drug addicts, peripheral intravenous access can be difficult and in such cases, the naloxone can be administered intramuscularly or intranasally (2 mg). Even with this route, there is a reversal of opiate toxicity within 5 to 10 minutes. The recently available intranasal formula releases 0.4 mg per single dose spray and may have to be repeatedly given.

The half-life of naloxone is about 30 to 45 minutes with a duration of action between 90 to 180 minutes. The variations exist because of the route of administration and dose. In a patient with no prior opiate use or history of drug abuse, naloxone can be administered via an intravenous infusion without fear of inducing withdrawal symptoms, but the patient’s pain may quickly return, and one must have alternative ways to manage the pain. Naloxone infusion is usually administered in D5W or isotonic saline and is necessary to manage overdose caused by long action opiates like methadone.

In patients who have taken large doses of propoxyphene, methadone, diphenoxylate/atropine or fentanyl, much larger doses of naloxone are usually required to reverse the toxicity. Repeat doses of 2 mg may be required every 3 to 4 minutes to a total of 10 mg. If the patient fails to respond to a total of 10 mg of naloxone, the diagnosis of opiate toxicity should be reconsidered. Many of the street opiate preparations are adulterated with contaminants, and the response to naloxone is not always complete. If the patient remains in respiratory distress, one must be prepared to intubate the patient. There is a consensus that a steady infusion of naloxone is better than intermittent dosing to treat large overdoses of opiate. While the threat of withdrawal symptoms is real, these symptoms are not life-threatening. A naloxone infusion can be administered at two-thirds of the initial successful dose and administered over an hour.

**Role of Activated Charcoal**

If the patient is alert at the time of admission, activated charcoal can be used to decontaminate the gastrointestinal tract in patients with opiate overdose. While normally activated charcoal usually has to be administered within 1 hour of ingestion of a drug to be effective, with opiates, there is slowing of gastric motility, and hence, activated charcoal can be given as late as 2 to 3 hours after ingestion. As long as there are no contraindications, activated charcoal should be administered to all symptomatic patients with opiate overdose.

If the patient is not alert, then airway protection is necessary; some patients will require endotracheal intubation prior to the administration of activated charcoal to prevent aspiration. If activated charcoal enters the airways, the result can be catastrophic.  In some patients, orogastric lavage may help.

**Bowel Irrigation**

The role of whole bowel irrigation may be considered in people who have ingested drug packets containing opiates, but there are no controlled studies to determine if this treatment has any benefit or improves outcomes. However, whole-body irrigation is not recommended in patients who show signs of ileus, bowel obstruction, have obvious signs of peritonitis, hemodynamic instability, or an unprotected airway.

**Other Measures**

There are some patients with opiate toxicity who may fail to respond to high-dose naloxone treatment. If the cause is determined to be an opiate and the patient appears to be in respiratory arrest, anecdotal reports indicate that buprenorphine may be useful.

**Intranasal Administration**

While naloxone is very effective if given promptly, its use has long been limited to administration by physicians and paramedics. With the increase in opioid overdoses, there has been a push to allow intranasal medication administration by bystanders. Evidence looking at the efficacy of out-of-hospital naloxone administration is promising. The bioavailability of a concentrated naloxone nasal spray was shown to be about 25%. Fifty percent absorption occurs within 6 to 8 minutes, and maximum blood concentration is achieved at 20 minutes making this a viable treatment for the community and prehospital use. A retrospective study looking at BLS crews administering prehospital intranasal naloxone over a 6-year period also showed that 95% of patients who received treatment had documented clinical benefit before arrival at the hospital. Less than 10% of patients needed additional doses in the emergency department, and 70% of patients were eventually discharged.

**Children**

In children less than 5 years of age or those who weigh less than 20 kg, the dose of naloxone is 0.1 mg/kg. In children who are older than 5 or weigh more than 20 kg, the dose is between 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg. Again repeat dosing may be required every 3 to 4 minutes to a maximum cumulative dose of 10mg of naloxone. Repeat dosing is often indicated when the child has ingested the longer-acting opiates like methadone.

**Use of Buprenorphine/Naloxone**

Buprenorphine in combination with naloxone is widely available and is used to treat opiate use disorder. This formula has also been used to used narcotic overdose. The big advantage of using this combination is that it reduces withdrawal symptoms for 24 to 36 hours. Anecdotal data indicate that the risk of overdose is small with buprenorphine/naloxone compared to methadone. Unfortunately, the sublingual preparation of buprenorphine and naloxone can also be easily abused sublingually.

**Naloxone Adverse Effects**

Naloxone has been shown to have a very safe side effect profile. There have been several studies on opiate-naive patients who were given large doses of the drug without significant effects, but when given to patients who are opioid-tolerant, acute, opioid withdrawal symptoms can develop. Individuals administered naloxone in the setting of opioid overdose can experience a sudden withdrawal syndrome, which includes sudden aggression, agitation, restlessness, diaphoresis, and tachycardia. GI symptoms such as nausea and vomiting also occur in about 30% of patients. Most symptoms are not very severe or sustained, and less than 1% of patients require admission. Acute withdrawal symptoms are more likely when larger doses of naloxone are used.

**Inpatient Care**

The majority of patients who have overdosed on opiates and who are reversed with naloxone are admitted for observation for at least 12 to 24 hours. Naloxone has a half-life of one hour, and some long-acting opiates may continue to cause sedation and respiratory depression. The opiate-overdosed patient is best admitted to a monitored floor. When it comes to a heroin overdose, the majority of patients are admitted because this illicit drug can cause acute lung injury at the same time. Most patients with acute lung injury usually present early in the course. Patients with heroin overdose who are asymptomatic may not require 24-hour monitoring, but they still need the 6 to 12-hour monitoring and discharged as long as the patient’s vital signs remain stable.

Others who do require admission are those who need multiple doses or prolonged intravenous infusions of naloxone to reverse the opiate. If there is any doubt about the patient’s clinical status, admission is prudent.

**Outpatient Care**

Because opiate use is often associated with sudden precipitation of respiratory difficulty, some healthcare workers are now promoting take-home naloxone, especially in individuals who are high-risk narcotic users. Unfortunately, at the moment naloxone is not approved for routine use in an outpatient setting. However, with the high number of deaths in the community, this may soon change.

**Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act**

The Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act provision updates federal guidelines to expand the availability of evidence-based treatment to address the opioid epidemic. The MAT Act empowers all health care providers with a standard controlled substance license to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD), just as they prescribe other essential medications. The MAT Act is intended to help destigmatize a standard of care for OUD and will integrate substance use disorder treatment across healthcare settings.

As of December 2022, the MAT Act has eliminated the DATA-Waiver (X-Waiver) program. All DEA-registered practitioners with Schedule III authority may now prescribe buprenorphine for OUD in their practice if permitted by applicable state law, and SAMHSA encourages them to do so. Prescribers who were registered as DATA-Waiver prescribers will receive a new DEA registration certificate reflecting this change; no action is needed on the part of registrants.

There are no longer any limits on the number of patients with OUD that a practitioner may treat with buprenorphine. Separate tracking of patients treated with buprenorphine or prescriptions written is no longer required.

Pharmacy staff can now fill buprenorphine prescriptions using the prescribing authority's DEA number and does not need a DATA 2000 waiver from the prescriber. However, depending on the pharmacy, the dispensing software may still require the X-Waiver information in order to proceed. Practitioners are still required to comply with any applicable state limits regarding the treatment of patients with OUD.  Contact information for State Opioid Treatment Authorities can be found here: https://www.samhsa.gov/medicationassisted-treatment/sota.
