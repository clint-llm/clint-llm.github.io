The Hymenoptera order includes over 150,000 different species of flying and non-flying insects. Some species within this order have modified ovipositors (female reproductive organs) which can also act as stingers. Hymenopteran stings only cause local inflammation in most people. However, they also account for the largest percentage of envenomation-related deaths in the United States. Most deaths result from immediate hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis. This activity reviews Hymenoptera stings and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Hymenoptera stings.
- Outline the presentation of Hymenoptera stings.
- Summarize the treatment options for Hymenoptera stings.
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by Hymenoptera stings.
