Cardiac excitation and contraction directly result in the changes in pressure and volume. The pressure and volume changes are directly related to Ca++ ions entering the myocytes perpetuating conduction. Due to this conduction originating at the sinoatrial (SA) node, the atria contract together and then, after a short pause at the atrioventricular (AV) node, the two ventricles contract together. These contractions come after a slight “lag” concerning the electrical conduction that makes them possible. This lag is due to a time gap between the electrical conduction and the actual application of the myocardial force. In other words, though the depolarization has gone through the myocardium (the ECG tracing), there is little or no contraction because the depolarization read as the electrical signal is the very beginning of the muscle’s movement. This is well-illustrated on a Wiggers diagram where the QRS complex on the ECG directly precedes ventricular systole (represented on the diagram by increased ventricular pressure).
