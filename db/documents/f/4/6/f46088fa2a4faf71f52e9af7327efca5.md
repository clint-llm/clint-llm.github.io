In light of discussions from the 2021 Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) and recognition of updated WHO guidelines, the 2022 International Consensus Classification (ICC) of lymphomas continues to acknowledge the frequent evolution of CL subtype classification.

Clinically, accurate diagnosis of which cutaneous lymphoma subtype is present is essential as different entities have varying expected behavioral patterns and prognostic implications. Practitioners should understand that many CL subtypes have overlapping histopathologic features, which is significant as dermatopathologists rely heavily on the presentation and features of clinical lesions (i.e., clinicopathologic correlation) to determine the most accurate CL subtype diagnosis for each patient.

Although a complete understanding of CL is yet to be determined, continued collaborative extensive cohort studies and advances in biomolecular detective technology (i.e., genetic, epigenetic) may help dermatopathologists, dermatologists, and other practitioners in characterizing and further subclassifying these various entities to provide outstanding patient care.
