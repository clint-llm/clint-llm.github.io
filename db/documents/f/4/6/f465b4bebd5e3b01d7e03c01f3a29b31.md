Persistence of myofibroblasts within scar tissue contributes to hypertrophic scars, keloids, and fibromatoses (Dupuytren contracture). Myofibroblasts usually disappear via apoptosis during the second week of wound healing. The failure of myofibroblast apoptosis allows for excessive matrix synthesis and contraction of normal tissue. Hypertrophic scarring, keloids, and non-healing wounds represent a pathologic healing mechanism. Delayed apoptosis results in scar hypertrophy. Hypertrophic scars are elevated, do not grow past wound boundaries, and can slowly regress over time. Keloid scars have continued growth past wound edges and expand over time.

Dupuytren contracture is a hand deformity that slowly forces fingers into a bent position. Due to an unknown etiology, proliferation of fibroblasts arranged in cords, nodules of myofibroblasts, and disordered collagen deposition causes disfiguration of the hand. Fibroblasts propagate this condition generating profibrotic cytokines in a prolonged manner subsequently leading to myofibroblast activation and continuous cytokine production. The pathophysiology of connective tissue contracture lies not only within the tension produced by myofibroblasts by also by the dynamic shortening of the ECM remodeling itself.
