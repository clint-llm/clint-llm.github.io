When antigens are inside of cells, they are cleaved into peptides, and those peptides bind to MHC class I or class II molecules. MHC molecules then carry the antigen to the plasma membrane and form a complex that can be recognized by T cells. Each MHC molecule can bind to various peptides and present those antigens to T cells. Class I MHC molecules primarily present peptide products that are synthesized inside of the cell to cytotoxic (CD8) T cells.
