Poorly refined endpoint subjective refraction may result in the lead or lag of accommodation with consequent visual and ocular complaints and symptoms.

The diverging effect of a concave lens ensures the further scattering of parallel light rays incident on it, resulting in a blur that serves as a stimulus for accommodation with a consequent increase in accommodative amplitude. This can present clinically as throbbing eye aches and headaches.

When parallel light rays pass through a convex lens, however, the refracted rays are converged to a point in front of the retinal thus, causing accommodation to relax to obtain a perceived clear image. This can present clinically as blurred vision and asthenopic complaints from repeated attempts to over-relax accommodation. Accurate refinement of endpoint subjective refraction is essential in providing an optimum optical correction.
