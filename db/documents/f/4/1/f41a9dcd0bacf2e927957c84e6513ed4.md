Improved outcomes in antepartum infections may be achieved by targeting surmountable barriers to care. These include increased community education in prevention, provider education in risk minimization, and increased vaccination. Providers should seize all opportunities to provide patients with anticipatory care, including recommendations on safe sex practices and vaccination, which can help prevent antepartum infections.Â Congenital rubella, varicella, and hepatitis B can be prevented through maternal immunization.

Barriers to this include vaccine availability, provider failure to offer the vaccine, and vaccine skepticism. The use of standing orders for indicated vaccinations is associated with increased coverage and efficiency in vaccine administration in obstetrics and gynecology.

Unfortunately, data to support an effective communication strategy for changing patient skepticism towards vaccination and increase vaccination uptake is lacking.
