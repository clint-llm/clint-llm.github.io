The risk of complications in both nerve conduction study and EMG needle examinations are rarely severe. Electrical stimulation does not usually cause any permanent or even temporary damage to the nerves tested. As with any needle stick procedures, there is a risk of infection or bleeding with needle insertion during the EMG; however, with proper antiseptic and pressure techniques, the risk is minimal.

Most patients find the electrical stimulation NCS studies uncomfortable, but tolerable. At times a patient may be unable to tolerate the examination due to the unpleasant “shock” sensation, needle exam, or, very rarely, a vasovagal episode. The patient may choose to take breaks during the exam or reschedule the exam for another date. Usually, preparing patients ahead of time regarding what to expect and instructing them to eat and drink before the exam can help avoid these complications.
