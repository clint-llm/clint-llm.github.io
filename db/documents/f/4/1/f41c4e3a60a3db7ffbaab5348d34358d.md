The preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative management of acute pain following hip surgery involves interprofessional and multidisciplinaryÂ teams.

An anesthesiologist with a specialization in regional anesthesia typically performs the PENG block with a nurse's assistance. Communication in this setting is essential for providing optimal care for the patient. Time out should be performed confirming the patient's name, the procedure that is being performed, and the surgical site should be marked prior to beginning the procedure. Sterile technique should be maintained, along with preparation in the event of an emergency.

All involved team members should be familiar with emergency situations that can occur during these procedures and should be able to assist in the event an emergency arises.

Postoperatively, the training of the nursing and surgical team for the assessment of pain (VAS, NRS, etc.) and pain control strategies is essential for the patient's recovery.
