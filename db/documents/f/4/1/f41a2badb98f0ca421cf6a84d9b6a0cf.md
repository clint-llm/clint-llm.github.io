Given the potential interaction of dupilumab with other drugs that are substrates of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450), the FDA suggests monitoring those patients on medications like warfarin which are also CYP450 substrates and can alter the activity of dupilumab.

Patients must monitor for serious and sudden onset reactions when on dupilumab therapy. It is strongly advised to discontinue dupilumab if a systemic hypersensitivity reaction is noted.

Healthcare providers are advised to monitor asthmatic patients with vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and neuropathy in the presence of eosinophilia as dupilumab use in asthmatics may be associated with eosinophilic pneumonia or vasculitis.

It may be helpful to involve social workers to identify reasons for the lack of treatment adherence leading to less than satisfactory outcomes. Sometimes, prior authorization by insurance companies may take longer than anticipated, in which case the patient may not start the medication promptly. Having a nurse or medical assistant from the office follow upÂ with the patient may help drive a positive outcome for patients.
