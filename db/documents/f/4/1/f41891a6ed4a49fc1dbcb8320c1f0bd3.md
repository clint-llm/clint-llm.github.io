Angiography is generally performed when an intervention is planned, such as splenic artery pseudoaneurysm embolization or splenic artery embolization in the setting of splenic trauma. Trauma patients are candidates for splenic artery embolization if they are hemodynamically stable with AAST grade 3 or higher injury, active contrast extravasation on CT, or splenic vascular injury.
