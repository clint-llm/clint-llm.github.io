Total knee arthroplasty provides a safe and effective treatment for patients with end-stage osteoarthritis of the knee. The combination of increased life expectancy, increased activity demands of patients, along with an increasing need for total knee arthroplasty, has led to a simultaneous increase in periprosthetic fractures. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of periprosthetic distal femur fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of periprosthetic distal femur fractures.
- Review the typical imaging findings associated with periprosthetic distal femur fractures.
- Summarize the epidemiology of periprosthetic distal femur fractures.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for periprosthetic distal femur fractures and to enhance postoperative management.
