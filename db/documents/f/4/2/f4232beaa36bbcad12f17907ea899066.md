Outcomes for patients who suffer from different forms of sensory neuropathy will vary. When Wallerian degeneration occurs, a series of events leads to complete structural and chemical disintegration of the nerve and results in a more guarded prognosis. Recovery is contingent on the regeneration of the nerve and depends largely upon how well the transected nerve endings are aligned as well as the severity of any adjacent soft tissue injury and scarring. To achieve a noticeable clinical outcome, the affected muscles and/or organs must become reinnervated after adequate nerve regeneration and remyelination occurs. If the pathology causing any sensory neuropathic symptoms is purely due to segmental demyelination, the prognosis will be much more positive as it entails a shorter recovery with a quicker return to function. Pain and temperature are typically the first sensations to recover.

Regarding those patients with glucose dysregulation, it is vital to monitor their hemoglobin A1c lab value to track the progression of the disease. Current recommendations from the American Diabetes Association underscore maintenance of a value less than 7.0% in conjunction with a healthy lifestyle (diet and exercise) for those with established diabetes.
