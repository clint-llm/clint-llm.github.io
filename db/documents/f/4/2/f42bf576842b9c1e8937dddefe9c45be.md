- Undercorrection and residual esotropia – Residual esotropia may result if a) an inadequate amount of horizontal muscle recession is performed, b) if contracture of MR occurs with time, or c) if inadequate vector force is generated by muscle transposition.

- Consecutive exotropia – This may result if a) excess tension is created by vertical muscle transposition, b) if ipsilateral MR is weak, or c) if co-contraction is worsened by transposition.

- Induced vertical deviation – This may result in a restrictive imbalance between the transposed muscles or if recession or slippage of the transposed muscle occurs. If excess muscle belly is used for transposition, vertical action of the muscle may also be weakened, leading to induced vertical deviation.
