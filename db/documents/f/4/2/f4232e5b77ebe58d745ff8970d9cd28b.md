Measuring jugular venous pressure is perhaps the most difficult but yet important physical diagnostic tool that yieldsÂ vital information about the cardiac status in a patient. It comes with persistent practice and experience. A skilled health care professional should teach other physicians/nurses in identifying and measuring JVP in normal and in elevated JVP patients. Rapid identification can not only aid in the quick diagnosis, but it can also help in taking necessary measures to treat the underlying condition and preventing complications.
