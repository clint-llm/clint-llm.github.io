Hypercoagulability or thrombophilia is the increased tendency of blood to thrombose. A normal and healthy response to bleeding for maintaining hemostasis involves the formation of a stable clot, and the process is called coagulation. Hypercoagulability describes the pathologic state of exaggerated coagulation or coagulation in the absence of bleeding. Arterial thrombosis, such as in myocardial infarction and stroke, is different from venous thromboses, such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). This activity reviews the cause and presentation of hypercoagulability and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management

**Objectives:**
- Identify the causes of hypercoagulability.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with
hypercoagulability.
- Summarize the treatment of
hypercoagulability.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by hypercoagulability.
