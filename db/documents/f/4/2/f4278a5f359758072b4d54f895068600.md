Prehospital care reports and records of patient encounters can be organized in many different formats, but the information is vitally important for many aspects of patient care beyond the scene.  The EMS record should include the patient’s demographics, vital signs, assessment, and information on any interventions performed. The documentation serves an important role as a data repository.  The information can be used to create a bill, to facilitate communication and transitions of care, to track compliance, guide quality initiatives and represent the EMS and other healthcare providers in legal matters.  Without excellent documentation, it is difficult to show excellent care.
