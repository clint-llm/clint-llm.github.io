Doxycycline hyclate is a water-soluble tetracycline antibiotic that kills and prevents the growth of a wide range of gram-positive and -negative bacteria. It plays a role in managing and treating acne, malaria (for prophylaxis and treatment), skin infections, sexually transmitted infections (i.e., chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhea, pelvic inflammatory disease) Lyme disease. Doxycycline hyclate is also effective for treating outbreaks such as cholera, mycoplasma, tularemia, typhus, and Rickettsia infections.

Several studies have also proven that tetracyclines, especially doxycycline, contain immunomodulating properties and can be used to control inflammation in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Doxycycline hyclate has a specific indication for adult periodontal disease for its anti-collagenase and anti-matrix metalloproteinase activity in the gingival crevicular fluid. There is no evidence of changes or antibiotic susceptibility to normal periodontal flora or opportunistic pathogens.
