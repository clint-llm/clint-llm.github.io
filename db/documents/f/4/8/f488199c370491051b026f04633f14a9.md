Cutaneous surgery can be performed in an office setting. Sterile or nonsterile gloves may be used at the surgeon's discretion as the risk of surgical site infections in minor procedures is low, particularly when they are performed on the face, where the blood supply and immune response are robust. The skin is prepped with an antiseptic based on the site of surgery and the surgeon's preference.

**Patient Counseling**

The surgeon should counsel the patient about the risks of the procedure, namely infection, bleeding, unsightly scarring, and the likelihood of recurrence of any lesion being excised. The patient should also receive a thorough explanation of the procedure. This explanation can be supplemented with visual aids such as a picture of the tumor with the planned excision illustrated. Visual aids can also show the patient how the closure will look after the excision is performed. When cosmetically sensitive areas, such as the face, are involved, the patient should also be counseled regarding the risk of dissatisfaction with the ultimate appearance of the scar. Scars located in cosmetically sensitive areas should be protected from sun exposure for roughly 12 months postoperatively to prevent the development of dyspigmentation.
