Boxed warnings (formerly known as Black Box Warnings) are the highest safety-related warning that medications can have assigned by the Food and Drug Administration. These warnings are intended to bring the consumer’s attention to the major risks of the drug. Medications can have a boxed warning added, taken away, or updated throughout their tenure on the market. Over 400 different medications currently have boxed warnings.

Boxed warnings typically apply to a particular drug cohort rather than one specific drug; this is because, commonly, the severe risk is associated with the mechanism of action and its undesired effects on the body, therefore applying to several medications within a class.
