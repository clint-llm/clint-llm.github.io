Strongyloides stercoralis, commonly known as threadworm, is a soil-transmitted human parasite belonging to a group of nematodes called roundworms. Although prevalent almost worldwide, except only in the far north and south, the global burden of this parasitic infection is still underestimated because of the unavailability of precise data from endemic areas.S. stercoralis, therefore,Â becomes one of the most overlooked parasitic infections among the "neglected tropical diseases" (NTDs).

The helminth, S. stercoralis, mainly infects humans but also occurs naturally in domestic dogs, cats, and primates.S. stercoralis present with varying degrees of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic carriers to acute strongyloidiasis and disseminated infections.

Strongyloidiasis is the term used to indicate infection by Strongyloides stercoralis. It differs from other helminth infections by its ability to cause overwhelming hyperinfection in immunocompromised individuals.
