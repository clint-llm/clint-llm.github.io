**Other Issues**

Since April 14, 2021, 17 states, the District of Columbia, and 2 territories have enacted regulations for medical marijuana dispensaries to abide by (https://www.ncsl.org/research/health/state-medical-marijuana-laws.aspx). Regulations are state-dependent and may or may not entail product safety testing, labeling, and packaging requirements. Specifics for labeling may include listing the strain of marijuana, potency, and or health risks associated with its use. Packaging requirements may mandate the use of childproof and tamper-resistant material.

However, until marijuana is approved at the federal level, the regulation of dispensaries will remain at the state level. Despite such variation amongst states, a controlled and legislated environment offers a sense of security to patients seeking medicinal marijuana to alleviate their ailments. In states where marijuana use has not been legalized, patients are faced with the risks involved with obtaining the substance illegally. Such risks may include fines, imprisonment, and alteration of the product that decreases the therapeutic benefits patients seek and, in some cases, causing detrimental effects to their health. As marijuana use continues to gain acceptance and approval within the United States, it may be beneficial to impose regulations to ensureÂ safe and effective products capable of providing the therapeutic benefits sought after with medicinal use.
