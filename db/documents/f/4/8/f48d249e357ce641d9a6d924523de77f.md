The differential diagnosis for TBG deficiency includes central hypothyroidism and euthyroid sick syndrome. Laboratory testing for patients with central hypothyroidism shows low FT4, low Total T4 along with low or inappropriately normal TSH levels. Central hypothyroidism may be congenital or acquired. Some critically ill euthyroid patients with non-thyroidal illness may also present with low FT4, low T4 along with low TSH. However, most of these patients present with high reverse T3 levels due to reduced clearance of Reverse T3. These abnormalities usually resolve with resolution of non-thyroid illness.
