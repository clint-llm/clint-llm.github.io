Animal studies have found that female rats developed mammary tumors when exposed to flibanserin within a two-year time frame and at doses exceeding recommendations by 3Â to 10 times. Clinical significance as it relates to human studies has not been determined, but it has been included in package labeling as a warning.

With the narrow therapeutic window of flibanserin, patients should not exceed the recommended daily dosage of 100mg. It has been found that doses that exceed 250 mg may be intolerable and further exacerbate the effects noted above. Currently, there are no known antidotes to reverse the effects of flibanserin toxicity.
