If left unmanaged, a person with a severe crisis can undergo a significant amount of psychological stress, which carries links to major depressive disorder and other mental health conditions.

Based on prior studies, it is evident that crisis intervention plays a significant role in enhancing outcomes in psychiatric cases. Community Mental Health Centers and local government agencies often have crisis intervention teams that provide support to the local community at times of mental health crisis. These teams can also be helpful at times of natural or man-made emergencies. Crisis intervention teams often assess and triage the situation and can diffuse the situation and triage for urgent attention of medical or mental health personnel in emergency or community care settings. They can call upon local police and other community resources for additional support.

When situations are less urgent, the crisis teams can provide useful resources in the community setting to affected individuals. Crisis intervention plays a significant role to appropriately address crisis scenarios and triaging serious events that need more urgent care besides diffusing situations and providing resources to individuals in need.
