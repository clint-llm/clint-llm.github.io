Neurosarcoidosis may present as either a monophasic illness, a relapsing-remitting course, or as a progressive disease with episodes of deterioration. It is not well known what the long-term effects of neurosarcoidosis are. Usually, patients with facial nerve palsy or other cranial mononeuropathies will improve. In contrast, cases with aseptic meningitis or meningeal/parenchymal mass lesions have a longer course. Hypothalamic vegetative symptoms rarely resolve although may respond to treatment.

Encephalopathy/vasculopathy tends to have a relapsing-remitting course with deterioration. Cases with hydrocephalus may either be asymptomatic or cause rapid deterioration. Facial palsy tends to improve over 4-6 weeks. The optic neuropathy may improve over a few weeks but in others, it may lead to blindness. Remissions are possible in peripheral neuropathy and myopathy cases, however, the course usually is chronic and progressive.
