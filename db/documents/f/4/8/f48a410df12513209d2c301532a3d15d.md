A report on phenothiazine overdose showed that 19% of the cases were accidental; therefore, better communication is needed between all interprofessional healthcare team members to relay the appropriate dosing information to the patients and prevent medical errors. Phenothiazines may initially be administered to patients following a consultation with a neurologist or psychiatrist. Yet, other healthcare professionals, including primary care clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and emergency medical technicians, may play a vital role in the continued care of the patient. Emergency medical technicians and nurses monitor the patient and may have valuable input on any adverse events or the efficacy of the medications. Primary care physicians may review dosing information and reinforce the dosing regimen and compliance. Pharmacists can also verify dosing and perform medication reconciliation to check for drug-drug interactions and further reinforce patient counseling regarding dosing and adverse effects. Appropriate cooperation between all interprofessional team members isÂ essential to ensure that the patient receives the most effective care at all times with phenothiazine therapy. [Level 5]
