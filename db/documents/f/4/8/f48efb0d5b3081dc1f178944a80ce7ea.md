The circadian system regulates sleep consolidation and many other physiologic parameters necessary for health and optimal functioning.  The circadian system is an endogenous cycle entrained by external cues, most importantly light. The circadian rhythm can be measured by evaluating melatonin levels, cortisol levels, and core body temperature. Structurally, the circadian rhythm exists within the suprachiasmatic nuclei of the hypothalamus. The suprachiasmatic nuclei receive direct information on illumination from ganglion cells in the retina. Ganglion cells contain a photopigment called melanopsin and transmit signals to the suprachiasmatic nuclei through the retinohypothalamic tract. The suprachiasmatic nuclei then process this information and stimulate the pineal gland to release melatonin.  Melatonin increases in the evening in response to dim light and peaks around 3 hours before waking. Melatonin receptors are found primarily in the retina, the pars tuberalis of the pituitary gland, and the suprachiasmatic nuclei. This feedback onto the suprachiasmatic nuclei serves as a feedback mechanism, which supports the circadian rhythm.

As sleep pressure accumulates during periods of wakefulness, the circadian rhythm system also works to maintain wakefulness. The circadian rhythm system has an intrinsic cycle, which on average is just over 24 hours. To compensate for the 24 hour day, the system must undergo phase shifts. These shifts are driven by time cues called zeitgebers, of which the light-dark cycle is the most effective. The circadian rhythm system works in harmony with the sleep homeostatic system to ensure proper sleep. Such a complex system that also relies on external stimuli is subject to dysfunction at many levels. The circadian rhythm system disorders can result from intrinsic dysfunction or the result of environmental factors. Six recognized disorders will be discussed below.
