Risks associated with sucralfate overdosing are minimal as sucralfate has minimal absorption from the gastrointestinal system; many patients that overdosed on sucralfate remained asymptomatic. Due to the small amount of aluminum absorbed with oral intake of sucralfate, it can cause aluminum accumulation and toxicity in patients with chronic kidney disease or those receiving dialysis.
