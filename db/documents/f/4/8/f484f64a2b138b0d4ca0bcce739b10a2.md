Cnidaria is a classification of marine life that includes jellyfish, fire coral, stinging hydroids, sea wasps, sea nettle, and anemones. Jellyfish not only cause most marine envenomations in the United States but also worldwide due to the large numbers. The severity and treatment of their stings vary widely. Factors that determine the severity of a bite include the type of jellyfish, the size of the sting, and the individual patient. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of the patients presenting with cnidaria toxicity and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of cnidaria toxicity.
- Describe the pathophysiology of cnidaria toxicity.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with cnidaria toxicity.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for the patients affected by cnidaria toxicity.
