Prognosis is highly variable depending on etiology and varies from benign to lethal. Children usually can tolerate higher intracranial pressure (ICP) for a longer period. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is not associated with any specific mortality risk but surgical treatments may cause morbidity and mortality. The morbidity of IIH is related to effects on visual function due to papilledema. If not treated disc edema can cause irreversible optic neuropathy, and loss of color vision.
