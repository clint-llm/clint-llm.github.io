**Role of DRG in Neuropathic Pain**

DRGs are involved in developing and maintaining neuropathic pain.

The functional consequence of these changes is the sensitization and hyperexcitability of DRG neurons, leading to neuropathic pain.

Normal DRG neurons generate sinusoidal oscillation patterns through voltage-sensitive mechanisms, which increase in frequency after nerve injury. When these oscillations reach a threshold, action potentials are generated. Upregulation of transmembrane sodium ion channels and increased sodium ion transport is thought to play a significant role in the increased oscillations and, thus, the ectopic discharge associated with chronic neuropathic pain.

Spontaneous action potentials are generated in the DRG after peripheral nerve injury and damage to the DRG. However, it does not occur in lesions proximal to the DRG.

**DRG as a Target in Neuromodulation of Pain**

DRG stimulation is a clinically effective intervention. First reported in 2013, DRG stimulation was an effective treatment for chronic, intractable trunk and extremity pain, reducing pain in an average of 70% of subjects in a 4-week feasibility study and reducing drug use.

Multiple reports have suggested stimulation of DRG is likely an ideal treatment for pain in areas such as the foot and the groin.

In a landmark randomized controlled trial of DRG stimulation vs. conventional SCS (the ACCURATE study), outcomes with DRG stimulation were statistically superior to those with SCS after three months of treatment, and pain relief and superiority were sustained through 12 months. Additionally, this trial demonstrated that DRG stimulation, compared with traditional tonic dorsal column SCS, provides greater specificity of stimulation for painful areas, less stimulation intensity with postural variation, and the ability to deliver paresthesia-free analgesia in some subjects.

Outcomes with DRG stimulation are often compared with those with spinal cord stimulation (SCS), a treatment modality that has rightly earned a place in advanced treatment when conservative medical management has failed.
