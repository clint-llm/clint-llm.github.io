The usual source of massive pulmonary hemorrhage is the bronchial vasculature. This high-pressure system is responsible for up to 90% of massive hemoptysis.

The most common causes of massive pulmonary hemorrhage are (based on a retrospective cohort study of 1087 patients at a single tertiary hospital in France

- Tuberculosis (25%; with active being responsible for 12% and sequelae being 13%)

- Bronchiectasis (20%)

- Mycetomas (6%)

- Cryptogenic hemoptysis (18%)

- Bronchogenic carcinomas (17%)

Other sources include trauma and iatrogenic.

A more recent prospective Italian study of 606 patients from five Italian hospitals showed

- Lung cancer (19.1%)

- Pneumonia/lung abscess (18.6%)

- Bronchiectasis (14.9%)

- Acute bronchitis (13.7%)

- Tuberculosis (5%; active (3.3%) and sequelae (1.7%))

There is regional variation seen especially in countries where TB remains a strong concern. In this study and another Greek study bronchiectasis and neoplasms seem to be the leading cause of moderate-to-severe pulmonary hemorrhage (moderate defined as 20 to 500ml in 24 hrs; severe defined as greater than 500ml in 24 hrs).
