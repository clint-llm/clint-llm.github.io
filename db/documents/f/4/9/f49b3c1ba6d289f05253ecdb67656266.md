The human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is recognized as a term to describe four separate isoforms, each with a distinct biological function and produced by a different type of cell within the body.

Hyperglycosylated forms of hCG from cytotrophoblastic cells promote growth and invasion of these cells, thus contributing to the pathogenesis of choriocarcinoma cells. A similar mechanism can occur in hCG free beta-subunits synthesized by non-trophoblastic tumors. The detection of the free-beta subunit hCG is suggestive of malign cancer and poor prognosis.
