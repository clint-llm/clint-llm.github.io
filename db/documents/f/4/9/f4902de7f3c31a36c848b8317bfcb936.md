Investigations for ventriculitis include CSF sampling and imaging.

The CSF sample can demonstrate an elevated protein count (greater than 50mg/dL). This can be related to a decrease in CSF production, as seen in rabbit models of E.Coli ventriculitis.Propionibacterium acnes which require at least ten days, however, treatment should not be delayed.

The presence of oligoclonal immunoglobulin G or M bands, CSF lactate, procalcitonin, and lysozymes help make an early diagnosis.

CSF cultures are the most important test for establishing the diagnosis of healthcare-associated ventriculitis.

Ultrasound, for neonates, can be performed using a high-frequency transducer through the anterior fontanelle in coronal and sagittal planes. Ventriculitis has increased thickness, irregularity and echogenicity of ependyma, with echogenic debris in the ventricle.

Non-contrast CT demonstrated non-specific findings, including dependent hyperdense ventricular debris, hydrocephalus, periventricular low density as well as features of the underlying abnormality (e.g. signs of meningitis â€“ pial or dura/arachnoid signal abnormality or enhancement).

MRI shows the same features as CT, with ventricular debris hyperintense to CSF on T1-weighted images and hypointense to CSF on T2- weighted images.

Ventricular uptake in radionuclide brain scintigraphy using technetium-99 can be used.
