Myotonia can be differentiated from mimicking conditions by a thorough history, physical exam, and basic laboratory testing. Hypothyroidism is one such condition that can present similar to myotonia. However, the patient would likely not describe an episodic muscle weakness. However, routine thyroid function laboratory studies should be performed in any patient being considered for a diagnosis of myotonia to rule out an atypical presentation. Likewise, electrolyte abnormalities can temporarily present similarly to myotonia, and in particular similar to the hyper/hypokalemic periodic paralyses. However, the patient would again not likely suffer such a condition on an episodic basis over an extended period of time, and further workup may reveal a source of electrolyte disturbance.
