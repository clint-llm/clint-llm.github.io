SCC lung disease originates from the transformation of the squamous cells lining the airways. Squamous cells are thin, flat cells that are found lining many organs of the human body. Squamous cell lung tumors often occur in the central part of the lung or the main airway, such as the left or right bronchus. The primary causative agent of cellular transformation is tobacco smoke, which contains more than 300 harmful agents and 40 potential carcinogens. Transformed squamous cells are characterized by keratinization and/or intercellular bridges and often exhibit a high degree of mutation frequency.
