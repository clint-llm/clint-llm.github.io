Treatment of radiation cystitis varies depending on the severity of symptoms. For grade 1 and grade 2 types, symptomatic relief is typically all that is necessary. If frequency and urgency are the predominant symptoms, anticholinergic medications can be used for relief. Additionally, bladder irrigation is usually considered the first-line treatment in all grades of the disease and can be used to remove clots if hematuria is present.

Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) is another form of noninvasive treatment that has become more prevalent in recent years. This therapy not only targets symptom relief but also has the capability of stopping the progression of the pathologic process. HBOT stimulates angiogenesis, which reestablishes blood flow to areas in danger of necrosis, and helps maintain bladder functionality. Studies have shown a complete response rate ranging from 27% to 100% of patients studied, with most showing more than 75% of patients with a complete response.

One study showed that, even with milder symptoms,  patients treated within six months of hematuria onset had  96% complete or partial symptomatic resolution whereas those treated after six months had but a 66% response rate. This is supportive of (albeit not definitive for) the early use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

More invasive measures may be necessary if late-stage complications occur or if the radiation cystitis is resistant to more conservative methods. Such situations include persistent hematuria, fistulas, severe detrusor contraction, or hydronephrosis. Failure of more conservative measures leading to cystectomy is associated with a high risk of complications and mortality. Severe complications in almost half (42%) and 90-day mortality is reported to be 16%.
