Clinicians use hypertonic fluids to increase intravascular fluid volume. Hypertonic saline can be utilized in the treatment of hyponatremia. Hypertonic saline and mannitol are both indicated to reduce intracranial pressure. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse events, and contraindications of hypertonic fluids in the management of hyponatremia and increased intracranial pressure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanisms of action of hypertonic saline and mannitol.
- Review the adverse effects and contraindications of hypertonic saline and mannitol.
- Outline the route of administration and appropriate dosing for hypertonic fluids.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve care for patients with increased intracranial pressure and hypertonic fluids in patient management.
