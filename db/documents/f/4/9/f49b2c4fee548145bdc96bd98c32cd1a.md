The sphincter of Oddi is a muscular valve responsible for controlling the flow of bile and pancreatic secretions through the ampulla of Vater into the second part of the duodenum. It is composed of three layers of concentric smooth muscle that surround the common bile duct, the main pancreatic duct, and the ampulla of Vater. The papilla of Vater includes the sphincter of Oddi and its overlying mucosa. So far, the sphincter of Oddi has been identified to have at least three functions:

- To prevent reflux of duodenal contents, thereby preventing the accumulation of sludge and particulate matter in the bile ducts and thus helps to reduce the risk of cholangitis.

- To regulate the flow of bile and pancreatic secretions.

- To allow retrograde filling of the gallbladder to occur.

The sphincter of Oddi serves as a great example of the hormonal regulation of smooth muscle. The most important of these hormones is cholecystokinin (CCK). ItÂ is released from enteroendocrine cells in response to the digestion of a meal; this stimulates the contraction of the gall bladder, resulting in emptying pancreatic secretions and bile into the common bile duct. CCK has been demonstrated to cause the release of VIP and nitric oxide by intrinsic neurons of the sphincter of Oddi, resulting in a decrease in sphincter tone, ultimately leading to the release of the backed-up contents into the duodenum to aid with digestion. Somatostatin is another noteworthy hormone shown to increase the sphincter of Oddi tone. In contrast, motilin and secretin serve the opposite effect by decreasing the sphincter of Oddi tone and allowing the flow of contents from the gallbladder and pancreas.
