There is little preparation needed when performing the McRobert’s maneuver. Before delivering the patient with a suspicion of dystocia, a briefing with all labor room personnel should occur. This briefing should take place for all patients whose obstetrical risk factors include maternal obesity, large for gestational age, post-date pregnancy, etc.  The briefing should include nursing staff, obstetricians, anesthesiologists, and pediatricians.  The goal is to have all personnel who are caring for the patient be aware of the patient’s personal risk factors.

One measurement that proves helpful in identifying patients at risk for dystocia is the shoulder dystocia risk measurement.  This assessment is performed after a bedside sonogram. Measurements of the abdominal circumference (AC) and head circumference (HC) are taken. The shoulder dystocia risk measurement is as follows: (AC/pi) – HC. The number pi is usually rounded and represented as 3.14. A patient is at a statistically increased risk if the result is greater than 2.6.****If the shoulder dystocia risk measurement is positive, a practitioner should not hesitate to perform the McRobert’s maneuver.
