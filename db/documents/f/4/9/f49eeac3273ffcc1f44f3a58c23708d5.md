Thousands of tons of V-series nerve agents were stockpiled during the 1950s and 1960s in the form of rockets, bombs, artillery shells, aerosol sprays, and landmines. Remnants of VX were detected on warheads used by Saddam Hussein against Iraqi Kurds in Halabja in 1988. The Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo used VX to attack three people in 1994 and 1995, one of whom died. Stockpiles of V-series nerve agents continue to be disposed of following the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. The remaining VX in the United States will be destroyed at the Blue Grass Chemical Agent Destruction Pilot Plant near Richmond, Kentucky. Russian has developed a series of Novichok agents that are more potent than the first generation of V agents. They have been implicated in assassination attempts of Sergei Skripal and Alexei Navalny.
