Overdose is treated based on symptoms with supportive care if a patient has signs of toxicity. Dialysis does not remove zileuton from the bloodstream. Treatment with gastric lavage may be necessary to eliminate any unabsorbed drug. However, there is only limited experience with zileuton when an overdose occurs. A case report of a patient taking between 6.6 gm to 9.0 gm of zileuton and completely recovering without complication is reported. The clinician should consult a medical toxicologist or poison control center for up-to-date information on the management of zileuton overdose.Â The American association of poison control centers' (NPDS) national poison data system research reinforces the importance of expertise and the need for specialized medical toxicology knowledge to manage drug overdose.
