Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can result from trauma ranging from a simple blow to the head to a penetrating injury to the brain. In the United States, around 1.7 million people suffer a traumatic brain injury, with adolescents between ages 15 and 19 and adults age 65 and older among the most likely to sustain a traumatic brain injury. Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also known as a brain concussion, initially was considered to be a benign occurrence. However, mild traumatic brain injury has galvanized tremendous attention for some of the adverse neuropsychological outcomes in contact-sport athletes and military personnel. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of traumatic brain injuries and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of traumatic brain injury.
- Describe the epidemiology of traumatic brain injury.
- Outline the management strategies for traumatic brain injury.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of traumatic brain injury and improve patient outcomes.
