HPV is a double-stranded DNA virus implicated in a host of carcinomas throughout the body. HPV 16 has the greatest association with oropharyngeal cancers, with other oncogenic strains including HPV 18 being less common

The fourth edition of the World Health Organization's Classification of Head and Neck Tumors has made a number of changes to reflect our current understanding of the disease. Oral and oropharyngeal cancers are now separate clinical entities, due to the presence of lymphoepithelial tissues within areas such as the tonsils. Most tonsil cancers are squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). However, the WHO classification now subdivides this into two distinct morphological groups; HPV positive and HPV negative. HPV positive SCCs arise from the deep lymphoid tissue of the tonsillar crypts and have a non-keratinising morphology. HPV negative SCC develops from the oropharyngeal/tonsil surface epithelium and is associated with keratinizing dysplasia.
