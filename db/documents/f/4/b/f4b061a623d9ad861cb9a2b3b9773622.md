The use of catheters is not without complications, and usually, these risks are higher with the more invasive procedure associated with pulmonary artery catheterizations. Complications can result from inserting, manipulating, and maintaining pulmonary artery catheters (PAC). With initial insertion, thrombosis formation is one of the more common complications, with a thrombotic risk of internal jugular catheter placement being 7.6%. There are also relativelyÂ fewer common risks of arterial puncture, hematoma formation, AV fistula, thoracic duct injury, air embolization, and pneumothorax.

Furthermore, complications of PAC manipulation and maintenance include transient cardiac arrhythmias that happen with an incidence ranging between 12.5% to 70%, with PVCs and VTs being the most commonly observed. A catheter-associated infection is also an ongoing challenge, with the incidence of PAC-associated bacteremia being 1.3% to 2.3%. Cases of pulmonary artery rupture, chamber rupture, malposition in the coronary sinus, pulmonary infarction, and PAC knotting have been reported but are relatively rare.
