Most cases of anodontia, hypodontia, and oligodontia can be attributed to developmental disturbances or syndromes. Thus, the healthcare professional managing the syndrome will provide most of the patient education. Patients should be counseled on oral hygiene and the importance of regular maintenance visits to ensure their dentition remains healthy. Additionally, it is important to evaluate the integrity of restorations and/or prosthodontic devices periodically.

The development of supernumerary teeth is not widely understood; however, it has been typically attributed to a disturbance or up-regulation during dental development. These processes cannot necessarily be controlled. If the teeth are maintained in the arch, and dental crowding is a possible risk, great emphasis should be given to oral hygiene to maintain the dentition's appropriate health.
