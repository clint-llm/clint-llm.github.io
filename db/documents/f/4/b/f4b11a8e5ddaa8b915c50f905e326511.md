The significant prognostic factors that affect the survival in cervical squamous cell carcinoma include:

- Stage

- Nodal status

- Tumor volume

- Depth of cervical stromal invasion

- Lymphovascular space invasion

Staging is the most important prognostic factor, followed by nodal status. It was observed that for the same stage of cancer (stage IB or IIA), the 5-year survival after hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy were lower (50 to 74%) in those with lymph node metastases as compared to those without lymph node metastases (88-96%). The involvement of para-aortic nodes is associated with worse outcomes.

As per FIGO 2018 staging of cervical cancer, the 5-year overall survival rates (OS), and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates of patients were determined.

The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates for different stages of cancer were as follows:

- Stage IB1- 95.3%

- Stage IB2- 95.1%

- Stage IB3- 90.4%

- Stage IIA1- 92.4%

- Stage IIA2- 86.4%

- Stage IIIC1- 81.9%

- Stage IIIC2- 56.3%

The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were as follows:

- Stage IB1- 94.0%

- Stage IB2- 91.0%

- Stage IB3- 88.5%

- Stage IIA1- 91.4%

- Stage IIA2- 86.4 %

- Stage IIIC1- 79.5%

- Stage IIIC2- 43.8%

- The 5-year OS and 5-year PFS for patients with 1-2 positive pelvic lymph nodes (PLNs) were 86% and 84%, respectively. The 5-year OS and 5-year PFS for patients with more than two PLNs were 73.7% and 70.2%, respectively.
