Indications for diagnostic facet joint injections include strong suspicion for the pain of facet joint etiology (focal tenderness over the facet joint, pain in response to hyperextension, rotational movement, or bending laterally, leg pain not extending below the knee), chronic low back pain, neck pain not relieved with conservative management, low back pain with normal imaging, neck pain in the setting of a whiplash injury, post-laminectomy syndrome without evidence of arachnoiditis or recurrent disc disease, facet joint synovial cyst rupture, conservative management for vertebral compression fracture, and symptomatic spondylolysis.

Prior to facet joint injections, it is recommended that conservative treatments are trialed for at least 3 months, including multimodal medication management, physical therapy, and behavioral modifications. It is also important to note the presence of moderate to severe pain burden with pain scores > 4/10 on the numeric pain scale, as well as an associated compromise in functionality or quality of life.

Indications for therapeutic facet joint injection include patients with confirmed facet joint pain who responded to diagnostic facet joint injection, adjunct to conservative pain management, in patients who are unable to manage pain with oral or systemic drug therapy, pain due to adjacent segment deterioration after spinal fusion, pain due to spondylolytic defects.
