An interprofessional team approach to antiemetics is the best course of action. As described above, nausea and vomiting is a common symptom and part of a complex pathway. Selecting the appropriate treatment option will require coordination across all areas of healthcare to include nurses, clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nursing staff, pharmacists, and other health professionals. The prescriber would do well to include the pharmacist during agent selection and have the pharmacist perform thorough medication reconciliation as well as verify dosing and duration. The nursing staff can provide counsel on administration, warn about potential side effects (reinforced by the pharmacist), and answer patient questions. They can also verify therapeutic effectiveness on follow-up visits. This interprofessional team methodology will benefit the patient by increasing positive outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.

The current level of evidence for treatment varies for each class and specific drug. Some medications have been thoroughly tested through RCTs, sometimes alone, and sometimes in conjunction with other therapies. Other medications, for example, cannabinoids, lack an in-depth level of testing and investigation. Interprofessional teams and thoughtful, appropriate prescribing methods will increase patient safety and improve outcomes.
