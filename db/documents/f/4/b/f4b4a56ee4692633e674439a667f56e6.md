The term akinesia refers to the inability to perform a clinically perceivable movement. It can present as a delayed response, freezing mid-action, or even total abolition of movement. Akinesia occurs when movement is not perceived either because the amplitude of the movement is small or because the time taken to initiate the reaction is significantly increased. The former is often a consequence of severe bradykinesia, which is commonly mistakenly referred to as akinesia. This makes it difficult to differentiate between the two. In akinesia, there is failureÂ of a rapid build-up of adequate power to initiate the movement.

Akinetic states are associated with numerous etiological causes, that vary with the age of the patient. In adults, akinesia can present alone or as sequelae of neurodegenerative disorders.
