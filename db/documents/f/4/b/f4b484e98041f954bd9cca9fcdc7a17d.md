Macrocytosis affects 2% to 4% of the population, 60% of whom have anemia. Alcohol use accounts for the majority, followed by deficiencies in folate and vitamin B12 and medications. Autoimmune causes are more common in middle-aged women. Hypothyroidism and primary bone marrow disease account for more cases of macrocytic anemia in older patients. The prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency increases in patients older than 60 years.

Mild macrocytic anemia (MCV 100 fL to 110 fL) is more likely to be caused by benign conditions compared to marked macrocytic anemia (MCV more than 110 fL), the latter of which is due to primary bone marrow disease or megaloblastic anemia from folate or vitamin B12 deficiencies.
