Management of rheumatic heart disease can be broken down into prevention and long-term management. Primary prevention of rheumatic heart disease centers on speedy recognition and treatment of group A streptococcal pharyngitis to prevent the development of acute rheumatic fever. Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is the most widely used antibiotic to treat group A streptococcal pharyngitis.

If a patient has a proven diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever, the goal of treatment is to suppress the inflammatory response to minimize the effects of inflammation on the heart and joints. According to the World Heart Federation, the only cost-effective approach to preventing the progression of rheumatic heart disease is secondary prophylaxis in the form of penicillin injections every 3 to 4 weeks to prevent recurrent group A streptococcal infection that causes recurrent episodes of acute rheumatic fever, which leads to progression of rheumatic heart disease.

Percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty is the standard first-line therapy for cases of rheumatic mitral stenosis in the absence of regurgitation, arrhythmias, and left atrial thrombus.

If a patient develops heart failure due to valve disease, the patient should be placed on medical therapy as tolerated for heart failure including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, diuretics, and beta-blockers.

At this time, there is no cure for rheumatic heart disease.

Clinicians should also have appropriate surveillance of patients diagnosed with rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease to allow for the initiation of appropriate therapy as early as possible.
