The diagnostic basis is mostly on key signs and symptoms of acute vestibular dysfunction, as mentioned above. However, because vestibular neuritis is a diagnosis of exclusion, the main focus in patients presenting with acute spontaneous vertigo is to rule out a stroke or other central causes.

Neuroimaging of the brain with MRI or CT imaging is not indicated in most cases but can be helpful when exam findings of a peripheral lesion are inconsistent if risk factors for stroke exist and symptoms do not show improvement within 48 hours.

Other tests like cervical and ocular vestibular evoked myogenic potentials along with video head impulse testing have made it possible to determine which vestibular division is involved in vestibular neuritis.
