The occurrence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in the general population has a frequency between 0.3% and 1.5%.

Studies estimate that 90% of patients with RA develop cervical spondylitis. However, recently RA cervical spondylitis presents with classic patterns of instability, including atlantoaxial subluxation, subaxial subluxation, and basilar invagination.Â  The latter occurs in about 20% of RA patients

Globally, the prevalence varies depending upon the ethnic group and with the prevalence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27. The prevalence of AS is approximately 5% to 6% among people who are HLA-B27-positive.
