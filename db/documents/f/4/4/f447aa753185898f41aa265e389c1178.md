As a classic hallucinogen, LSD does not typically create compulsive drug-seeking behavior as is with most other drugs, but it can still be dangerous in non-clinical settings. Nonmedical use can precipitate prolonged psychiatric reactions in rare cases.

Absolute contraindications are physical conditions that have marked excitatory states like cardiovascular disease, pregnancy, epilepsy, paranoid personality, overt psychosis, and organic-toxic cerebral disorder. The teratogenic effects of LSD are controversial; they have been demonstrated by some but not confirmed by others.
