Preoperative considerations should include:

- Smoking history

- Atherosclerosis

- Peripheral vascular disease

- Steroid use

- Diabetes

- Previous surgeries

- The extent of the defect

- Patient age and skin condition

- Defect location.

Before free or regional flap transfer, a preoperative angiogram may help evaluate circulation and angiosome anatomy. Because larger defects often require more complex reconstruction, and more complex reconstruction often requires more time to complete, ensuring the patient has had the appropriate medical preoperative evaluation can mean the difference between a good outcome and a catastrophe. When flap transfer is planned carefully, paying attention to both the technical aspects of the procedure and the patient's overall health and functional/aesthetic goals, outcomes are generally very satisfactory.
