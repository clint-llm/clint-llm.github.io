Stool culture, enzyme immunoassay (EIA) or PCR can diagnose Campylobacter infection. For a stool culture, colonies of Campylobacter species are grown using selective culture techniques designed to improve isolation of C. coli and C. jejuni. Both C. jejuni and C. coli are thermophilic, growing best at 42 degrees Celsius and are microaerophilic, growing best in an environment containing 5% to 10% oxygen.
