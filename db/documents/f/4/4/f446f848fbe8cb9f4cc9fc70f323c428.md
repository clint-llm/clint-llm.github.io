Cardioplegia is a pharmacological therapy administered during cardiac surgery to intentionally and temporarily arrest the heart. The first solution used during cardiopulmonary bypass was reported by Dr. Melrose in the early 1950s, who identified that high levels of potassium citrate induced a reversible cardiac arrest.

Cardioplegia is an essential component of cardiopulmonary bypass and with the primary goal to reduce myocardial oxygen demand by creating electrical quiescence and cooling the heart to reduce the ischemic effects of being on bypass. The use of cardioplegia, in addition to being cardioprotective, also provides a relatively bloodless and motionless surgical field.Â There are many forms of cardioplegia ranging from the location of administration retrograde vs. antegrade as well as varying components within the solution, temperature, indications, adverse effects, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics.
