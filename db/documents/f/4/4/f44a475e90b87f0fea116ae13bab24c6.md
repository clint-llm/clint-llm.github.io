Most traction splints involve an ankle harness and some sort ofÂ cord or rigging to create the tension. Prior to placement, a neurovascular exam should be assessed to determine the patient's current baseline neurovascular status. Make a note of any abnormalities and make sure the placement of any splint does not further compromise to neurovascular status. Reevaluate the neurovascular states distal to the splint, or any device placed immediately after and with serial exams to ensure changes are promptly discovered and treated appropriately.

Each splint has specific directions for use but can often be deciphered by the need for securing the splint to the patient and the need for traction to be applied. There are 2 basic forms of this and many places the affected limb in the anatomic position, but there are some which use a flexed hip at 30 to 45 degrees and the knee flexed between 60 to 90 degrees.
