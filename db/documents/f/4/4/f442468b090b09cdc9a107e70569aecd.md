The latest equipment should be obtained. This is especially critical in pediatrics as newer scanners offer much higher temporal and spatial resolutions at lower injected doses, minimizing radiation exposure to the patient. Following strict quality control protocols in the radiopharmacy and the scanner, rooms are critical in delivering the highest quality and safe patient care.

Proper planned maintenance and upkeep of the nuclear medicine equipment is also essential in order to avoid equipment failures and artifacts that may affect the interpretation of studies. The latest total-body PET scanners offer the potential of imaging with a radiation exposure equivalent to a chest X-ray.
