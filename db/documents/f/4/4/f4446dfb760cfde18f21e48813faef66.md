Supratrochlear artery (Image 2): The supratrochlear artery is a terminal branch of the ophthalmic artery (intracranial branch of the internal carotid artery).

Course: After emerging from the ophthalmic artery, the supratrochlear artery crosses trochlea along with the supratrochlear nerve; then, it crosses the supraorbital margin, pierces the orbital septum and enters the forehead. In the forehead, it runs between corrugator supercilii, orbicularis oculi, and the frontalis muscle.

Supratrochlear artery anastomoses with the branches of the supraorbital and superficial temporal artery, both ipsilateral and contralateral, to form a rich vascular network.

Branches and area of distribution: the bony****branches of the supratrochlear artery supply the periosteum of the supraorbital rim and glabella. Muscular branches supply the muscle of the upper eyelid, corrugator supercilii, frontalis, and procerus muscle. Cutaneous branches supply the glabellar skin and skin of the medial forehead.

A study by Kleintjes describes nine branches of the supratrochlear artery:(i) the medial communicating branch that communicates with the contralateral artery, (ii) the lateral communicating branch that communicates with the supraorbital artery, (iii) Superior palpebral artery supplying the upper eyelid, (iv) branch to the brow, (v) periosteal branch, (vi) cutaneous branch supplying the skin of the glabella and median forehead, (vii) oblique branch, (viii) a vertical branch, (ix) medial and lateral vertical branches.

Supratrochlear vein: The supratrochlear vein drain the medial forehead, glabellar complex, and periosteum of the medial part of the supraorbital margin. It divides into two branches; one branch accompanies the supratrochlear artery, another branch unites with the supraorbital vein, and forms the angular vein.
