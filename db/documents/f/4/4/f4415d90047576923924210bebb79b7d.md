It was estimated that up to 5 million men suffer from Opioid-induced androgen deficiency in the United States as of 2011. With the high number of opioid prescriptions and prevalence of chronic opioid therapy, it is logical to state that OIE s a very common and prevalent condition.

Unfortunately, there is limited awareness of OIE as a common side effect of chronic opioid therapy and often is not considered nor tested for. Limited data on this often unrecognized phenomenon impedes understanding of the true scope of the condition and the number of cases that are affecting both men and women. Given that opioids affect both the HPA axis as well as the HPG axis, this only underscores the importance of increasing awareness of OIE and indicates that opioid-induced endocrinopathy is a common and important type of endocrinopathy.
