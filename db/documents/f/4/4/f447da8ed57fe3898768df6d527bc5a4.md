All trauma patients should be evaluated in a standard format beginning with the primary survey.

Concurrent with the physical exam, clinicians should monitor vital signs and gather information regarding the mechanism. Understanding the mechanism of injury can provide important information about what type of injury the patient sustained. Additionally, if time allows and the patient is lucid, information regarding medical, surgical, social, allergy and family history should be obtained.
