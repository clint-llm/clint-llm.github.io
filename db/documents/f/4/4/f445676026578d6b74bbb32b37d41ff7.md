Brown-Séquard syndrome is a neurologic syndrome resulting from hemisection of the spinal cord. It manifests with weakness or paralysis and proprioceptive deficits on the side of the body ipsilateral to the lesion and loss of pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral side. As an incomplete spinal cord syndrome, the clinical presentation of Brown-Séquard syndrome varies in severity. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of Brown-Séquard syndrome and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how the mechanism of injury relates to the neurological deficits in Brown-Séquard syndrome.
- Review the diagnostic criteria for Brown-Séquard syndrome. 
- Summarize the treatment protocol for managing patients with Brown-Séquard syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination, with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams, to enhance prompt and thorough delivery of care to patients with Brown-Séquard syndrome.
