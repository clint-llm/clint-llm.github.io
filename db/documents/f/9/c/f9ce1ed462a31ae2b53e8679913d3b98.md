Health care workers have serious concerns about exposure to bodily fluids. Accidental exposures to bodily fluids present a wide variety of issues to healthcare workers. These issues include transmission of communicable diseases such as human immune deficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). This activity reviews the recognition, evaluation, and treatment of patients presenting with bodily fluid exposures and also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with bodily fluid exposures.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of bodily fluid exposures.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of bodily fluid exposures.
- Outline the management options available for bodily fluid exposures.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance bodily fluid exposure treatment and improve outcomes.
