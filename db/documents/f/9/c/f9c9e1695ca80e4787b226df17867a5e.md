Tongue lacerations can occur in any age group with a variety of injuries making the development of a standard of care difficult. Initial assessment for severity of injury, contamination, and barriers to healing can be considered similar to lacerations on other parts of the body. The decision to repair a tongue laceration or allow it to heal by secondary intention has been a hotly debated topic. A large population study comparing the two management methods does not exist, so the decision has been left up to individual clinicians. General descriptions of suture repair and the use of dermabond in repair exist, as well as examples of well-healed wounds that received no intervention. The Zurich Tongue Scheme aims to give the practitioner an idea of factors that favor repair, ways to repair and common complications to consider when they need to care for a patient with a tongue laceration.
