As with most transplant surgeries, an interdisciplinary team is critical for patient outcomes. Depending on the planned en bloc transplantation, both medicine and surgical evaluation are required in the pre and post-transplant phases. Medical teams can consist of hepatologists, dietitians, case management and social work, transplant nurse coordinator, transplant surgeons, and physical and occupational therapists. Each member plays a vital role in long-term recovery. In some cases, psychiatric evaluation is required in the setting of alcohol/drug use; however, a significant number of transplants are those of children's and may not require formal evaluation.
