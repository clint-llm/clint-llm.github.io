The patient history will often be obtained from parents or supervising adults as patients may be obtunded or too young to communicate. Important history findings would include co-administration of other anticholinergic medications, such as tricyclic antidepressants, atropine, and scopolamine, as the unintentional mixture of medications may increase antimuscarinic toxicity.

Physical exam findings will be divided by organ systems. Neurological symptoms, especially with first-generation H1 antihistaminics, can be found two hours post-ingestion and can manifest as drowsiness, hallucinations, and in pediatric populations, may present as ataxia and irritability. At any point following ingestion, seizures may occur, but they typically occur within the first one to two hours. Visual disturbances may manifest as mydriasis, blurred vision, and diplopia. Cardiovascular findings include tachycardia and both hypertension and hypotension. The binding of sodium and calcium channels may prolong QRS complexes and QT intervals, respectively, as well as the appearance of a Brugada-like syndrome. Lastly, with agitation, irritability, and seizures, some reports of rhabdomyolysis have been documented.
