Glycopyrronium is known to have little effect on visual accommodation and heart rate at lower doses, but at higher doses (400 mcg) can result in bradycardia 6 hours post-dose administration (approximately 20% reduction in pulse rate.)

Hyoscine butyl bromide affects heart rate causing tachycardia in a dose-dependent fashion (20% increase at 20 mg and 50% increase at 56 mg) while at higher doses of approximately 200 mcg is known to cause bradycardia.

Both hyoscine and atropine cross the blood-brain barrier and are known to cause confusion, and all of the antimuscarinic agents are generally known to cause dryness of the oral mucosa and may precipitate urinary retention.
