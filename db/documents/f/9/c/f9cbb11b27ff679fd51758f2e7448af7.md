Cardiac catheterization has evolved over the years, and many times it is a life-saving procedure in cases of acute MI where left heart catheterization and selective coronary arteriography are performed in an emergency to find out the culprit vessel, and percutaneous coronary intervention is done to save the life and the myocardium at jeopardy. With new techniques and advancements, the trans-radial approach improves patient comfort compared to the trans-femoral approach. Using ultrasound/fluoroscopy for taking arterial access, using small-sized catheters, and increasing operator experience have further decreased the complications.

In the last two decades, percutaneous valve replacement has revolutionized the left heart catheterization techniques. Measurements of cardiac hemodynamics by left heart catheterization are essential in the diagnosis and prognosis of valvular heart diseases and cardiomyopathies.
