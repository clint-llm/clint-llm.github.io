Any NM department's routine QC procedure is essential as this practice helps maintain high-quality images consistently while also reducing the risk of radiation exposure to patients and staff. Temperature, humidity, equipment mishandling, and radioactive contamination are all factors that can affect the imaging and non-imaging equipment functionality directly. Therefore, it is critical to closely monitor images that appear degraded, as this could indicate faulty QC results.

In addition, it is crucial to keep track of all QC results and look for any significant shifts in trends. Most faulty QC results can be corrected by repeating the QC steps; however, reviewing results with trained service engineers or physicists can be beneficial. Once a year, a QA committee meeting should be held to manage the issue and audit the QC results. Quality is not an individual responsibility and is a collective effort. A QA committee should include radiologists, NMT, pharmacists, medical physicists, radiology managers, and nurses.
