It is uncertain if mammary duct ectasia and periductal mastitis (PDM) are to be considered as a single disease on a spectrum or as two separate, distinct disease processes. More studies on etiology and ultrastructural changes are required to give more information on changes leading to duct ectasia. The presumed pathogenesis is that the affected duct becomes dilated and tortuous, either due to breast involution or other factors, and accumulates granular debris with numerous lipid-laden macrophages. A significant histological difference hinting these may be separate processes is that in MDE, there will be no epithelial proliferation near the opening of the duct, as opposed to PDM, where this is a cardinal feature. Periductal collagenization and fibrosis may eventually produce skin and nipple retraction, which may predispose to one or both conditions.

In periductal mastitis (PDM), the epithelial lining is intact, but there is a proliferative epithelium, in the form of squamous metaplasia, beginning at the distal opening of the duct in the nipple, and progressively extends deeper into the duct system. The resultant keratin production accumulates and then leaks out to interstitial space, inducing severe periductal reactive inflammation culminating in collagen formation and interstitial fibrosis. Accordingly, many clinicians consider mammary duct ectasia and periductal mastitis as distinct disease entities with some shared clinical consequences and manifestations and resultant overlapping differential diagnosis.
