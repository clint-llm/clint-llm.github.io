# Introduction

Amylase is a digestive enzyme predominantly secreted by the pancreas and salivary glands and found in other tissues at very small levels.diastaste but was later renamed amylase in the early 20th century.

Amylases' main function is to hydrolyze the glycosidic bonds in starch molecules, converting complex carbohydrates to simple sugars. There are three main classes of amylase enzymes; Alpha-, beta-, and gamma-amylase, and each act on different parts of the carbohydrate molecule.

In 1908, a study by Wohlgemuth identified the presence of amylase in urine, and this subsequently led to the use of amylase as a diagnostic laboratory test. Amylase is a commonly ordered test along with lipase, especially in suspected acute pancreatitis.

# Etiology and Epidemiology

Elevated amylase can be seen in a variety of conditions, including pancreatic disease, salivary disease, decreased metabolic clearance, intestinal disease, and macroamylasemia.

Abnormally elevated amylase levels are seen in 35% of patients with liver disease.

# Pathophysiology

Amylase is a heterogeneous calcium-dependent metalloenzyme of molecular weights varying from 54-62 kDa.The small size allows it to be easily filtered through the glomeruli.

P-type amylase is synthesized by pancreatic acinar cells and secreted into the intestinal tract via the pancreatic duct system. Its action is favored by the mildly alkaline conditions in the duodenum.

Genetic regulation is likely to play a crucial role in the preliminary determination of salivary amylase.

The function analyte amylase is an endoglycosidase enzyme of the hydrolase class that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1,4-α-glucosidic linkages between adjacent glucose units in complex carbohydrates.

# Specimen Requirements and Procedure

Either serum or heparinized plasma can be used as a sample. However, one study found that heparinized plasma samples gave significantly higher results than serum samples when measured using dry-film technology.

# Diagnostic Tests

For many years, amylase has been primarily used for diagnosing acute pancreatitis. Amylase can be measured with a blood test or urine test. The urine test may be performed by a clean catch or 24-hour urine collection.

The lipase-to-amylase ratio may help to distinguish gallstone-induced pancreatitis from alcoholic pancreatitis. Gallstones cause higher increases in amylase, and alcohol causes higher increases in lipase. A lipase-to-amylase ratio > 2 has 91% sensitivity and 76% specificity for alcoholic pancreatitis, and a ratio > 5 has 31% sensitivity and close to 100% specificity for alcoholic pancreatitis.

# Testing Procedures

The amylase test is performed on semi-automatic or fully automated analyzers which are based on the principle of photometry. Photometry is the measurement of light absorbed in the ultraviolet (UV) to visible (VIS) to infrared (IR) range. This measurement is used to determine the amount of an analyte in a solution or****liquid. Photometers utilize a specific light source and detectors that convert light passed through a sample solution into a proportional electrical signal. These detectors may be photodiodes, photoresistors, or photomultipliers. Photometry uses Beer–Lambert’s law to calculate coefficients obtained from the transmittance measurement.

P-type amylase can be differentiated from S-type amylase by selective inhibition of S-type by a wheat germ inhibitor, temperature inhibition, immunoprecipitation, or immunoinhibition by a monoclonal antibody. However, only the methods based on selective inhibition by monoclonal antibodies have shown sufficient precision, reliability, practicability, and analytical speed to allow reliable measurement of P-type amylase.

# Interfering Factors

Amylase assays are generally not prone to interference from hemoglobin, bilirubin, or triglycerides. Collecting specimens in tubes containing oxalate, citrate, or EDTA may result in falsely decreased values due to the chelation of necessary amylase cofactors.

Increased amylase activity in serum can result from a condition known as macroamylasaemia – a state in which amylase forms macromolecular complexes, usually with immunoglobulin (IgA or IgG in most cases), but also as self-polymerization or association with other proteins.

The circulating pancreatic amylase is higher in female subjects with O blood type than those with A blood type (lower pancreatic amylase in A blood type).

In pancreatitis with associated hypertriglyceridemia, serum amylase levels may be erroneously normal. This is attributed to an inhibitor associated with triglyceride elevations that interferes with the assay for the enzyme. Diluting the serum can reduce the activity of the inhibitor such that a recalculation of serum amylase can uncover the true serum amylase levels.

# Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings

Reference intervals of amylase differ between the various available assays method because of differences in substrates used and reagent preparations.

Blood amylase activity of newborns is approximately 18% of adults. There are no significant differences between males and females in the serum activity of amylase. In healthy adults, P-AMY represents approximately 40% to 50% of total amylase activity in serum. Serum P-AMY activity is not demonstrable in most children younger than six months, but activity rises slowly after that to reach adult concentrations at five years of age, reflecting the postnatal development of the exocrine pancreatic function.

Currently, there is no internationally established reference range for amylase levels. The reference range can be as wide as 20 to 300 U/L. However, elevated amylase levels of more than three times the upper limit of normal strongly support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.

A finding of persistently raised total amylase and normal lipase should raise the possibility of macroamylasemia. Amylase creatinine clearance ratio (ACCR) or polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation are useful screening tests for macroamylase.

# Clinical Significance

Amylase is primarily used in diagnosing pancreatic diseases. Amylase is a commonly measured enzyme due to the availability of inexpensive, easily automated methods. Although amylase is a sensitive indicator of acute pancreatitis, it is not specific as it can be elevated in several conditions unrelated to the pancreas.

Amylase is not useful in predicting the severity of an acute pancreatic episode or monitoring the condition. The magnitude of the increase in serum enzyme activity is not related to the severity of pancreatic involvement; however, the greater the rise, the greater the probability of acute pancreatitis. The lack of specificity of total amylase measurement has led to an interest in the direct measurement of P-type amylase instead of total enzyme activity for the differential diagnosis of patients with acute abdominal pain.

Amylase inhibitors such as acarbose have been used in treating type 2 diabetes and have been shown to reduce hemoglobin A1C and peak postprandial glucose. Acarbose has also been shown to improve the remission of dumping syndrome in bariatric patients. The drug has also been shown to improve the risk of cardiovascular disease by slowing down the thickening of carotid arteries.

Various intra-abdominal events can lead to a significant increase in serum P-type amylase activities, up to a fourfold increase and sometimes beyond. Such increases may be caused by leakage of P-type amylase from the intestine into the peritoneal cavity and then into circulation.

Cases of amylase-producing multiple myeloma have been described. Increased amylase activity is due to salivary-type hyperamylasemia in most patients (sialyl salivary type).

Some patients with phaeochromocytoma/paraganglioma were found to have hyperamylasemia, usually the salivary isotype. Here, hyperamylasemia may be related to the hypertensive crisis and vasoconstriction leading to tissue hypoxia rather than being a result of tumor secretion and is often transient.

Benign pancreatic hyperenzymemia, a syndrome first described by Gullo, is characterized by raised serum amylase, pancreatic isoamylase, lipase, and trypsin activities in asymptomatic subjects with no evidence of pancreatic disease by imaging. The syndrome occurs sporadically or in a familial form, and amylase activity fluctuates significantly with occasional transient normalization in some cases.

Damage of salivary glands, leading to salivary hyperamylasemia, has been seen in trauma or surgery to the salivary gland, radiation to the neck area involving the parotid gland and subsequently causing duct obstruction or calculi of the salivary glands.

Hyperamylasemia in anorexia nervosa is associated with vomiting, and indeed the finding of raised salivary amylase may provide a clue to concealed vomiting.

Hyperamylasemia may be associated with various tumors caused by either an ectopic production of the enzyme by the tumors or perhaps an inflammatory response by the tumor cells resulting in the marked release of the enzyme normally produced in these tissues into the bloodstream.

Gut diseases, including mucosal inflammatory disease of the small intestine, mesenteric infarction, intestinal obstruction, appendicitis, and peritonitis, usually result in increased P-type isoamylase because of increased absorption of amylase from the intestinal lumen.

Rare cases of hyperamylasemia have been reported in association with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as well as with ciprofloxacin treatment.

# Quality Control and Lab Safety

For non-waived tests, laboratory regulations require, at the minimum, analysis of at least two levels of control materials once every 24 hours. If necessary, laboratories can assay QC samples more frequently to ensure accurate results. Quality control samples should be assayed after calibration or maintenance of an analyzer to verify the correct method performance.

Westgard multi-rules are used to evaluate the quality control runs. In case of a rule violation, proper corrective and preventive action should be taken before patient testing is performed. The criteria for acceptable performance for amylase assay by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) and College of American Pathologists (CAP) proficiency program is within ± 30% of the mean value of laboratory peer groups.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Interprofessional healthcare team members must communicate effectively when laboratory results point towards a non-pancreatic cause. Knowing the different conditions that may affect amylase levels is also important.

The 2013 American College of Gastroenterology mentions that co-ordering lipase and amylase is neither cost-effective nor treatment advantageous. It also states that ordering amylase alone is unreliable and does not increase diagnostic efficiency compared to lipase.
