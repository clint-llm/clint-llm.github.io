Although Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is thought to be a benign condition, the recent observation data suggest that cardiogenic shock and death rates are comparable to patients with acute coronary syndrome. Thus initial management should focus on identifying and close monitoring of patients at risk for serious complications. Predictors of adverse in-hospital outcomes include: physical trigger, acute neurologic or psychiatric diseases, initial troponin greater than 10× upper reference limit, and admission left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%.

Guidelines on the management of Takotusbo cardiomyopathy are lacking as there are no prospective randomized data in this regard; thus, management is based on clinical experience and expert consensus (evidence level C). Since the initial presentation of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is similar to an acute coronary syndrome, the initial treatment involves aspirin, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitor, lipid-lowering agent, and coronary angiography to rule out obstructive coronary artery disease.
