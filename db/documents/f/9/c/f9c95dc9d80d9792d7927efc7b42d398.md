Neonatal jaundice or neonatal hyperbilirubinemia results from elevated total serum bilirubin (TSB) and clinically manifests as yellowish discoloration of the skin, sclera, and mucous membrane. The term jaundice derives from the French word "jaune," which means yellow. It is the most commonly encountered medical problem in the first two weeks of life and a common cause of readmission to the hospital after birth.

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia (UHB) is the cause of clinical jaundice in most neonates, but some infants with jaundice have conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (CHB), which is always pathological and signifies an underlying medical or surgical cause. The etiology of pathological UHB and CHB is vast and varied. Preterm infants and those born with congenital enzyme deficienciesÂ are particularly prone to the harmful effects of unconjugated bilirubin on the central nervous system.
