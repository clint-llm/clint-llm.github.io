Current recommendations for drainage of acute (less than 48 hours) subungual hematomas advocate for trephination, a procedure where a hole is made in the nail to drain the hematoma. Previous recommendations were to remove the nail for any hematoma greater than 50% of the nail or greater than 25% of the nail in the presence of a fracture. Several studies have shown that trephination has an equal cosmetic outcome and similar complication rates for the majority of cases.
