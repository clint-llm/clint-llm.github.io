Pericoronitis is an intraoral inflammatory process due to infection of the gingival tissue surrounding or overlying an erupting or partially erupted tooth. Pericoronitis is most commonly associated with the eruption of mandibular third molars, even thoughÂ it can be seen with any erupting teeth. Symptoms of pericoronitis can significantly affect the quality of daily life. If left untreated, it can progress to life-threatening space infections, necessitating early identification, treatment, and prevention of the disease.
