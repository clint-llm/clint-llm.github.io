Visual evoked potentials (VEP)s represent a valid electrophysiological tool in neurological pathologies. VEPs are the expression of the electrical activity of the visual pathways up to the optic nerve to the calcarine cortex.

These potentials provide a non-invasive exploration method of the functionality of the human visual system through detecting neuronal pool activity responding to stimuli independently of the consciousness and attention state of the patient. The measurement of VEP is made possible by applying electrodes on the scalp in the occipital region and administering visual stimuli in a patient with open eyes.

Depending on the characteristics of the stimulus, pattern visual evoked potentials can provide different information on the functionality of the various sectors of the visual field and the integrity of the optical pathways.Â This type of instrumental exploration has a clinical application in ophthalmological retinal pathology and neurological pathology related to the optic nerve and/or brain (inflammatory, atrophic, toxic, tumoral, and genetic disease). VEPs has been used as an alternative method to assess visual acuity in non-verbal infants and adults with low intellectual abilities or potential malingering.
