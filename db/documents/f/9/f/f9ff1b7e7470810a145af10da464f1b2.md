Lipoid pneumonia is largely a diagnosis of exclusion. It can mimic several diseases; therefore, history plays a crucial role in the diagnosis given there is no specific clinical feature linked to the disease. Onset can be acute, insidious, or chronic. This should always be a differential diagnosis for patients presenting with generalized symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hypoxemia, and less commonly hemoptysis and fever, as well as bilateral infiltrates on imaging and may have diffuse crackles on lung exam.
