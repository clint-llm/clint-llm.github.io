Biallelic pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in ARG1 lead to an unstable arginase enzyme, a protein found primarily in hepatic cytosol and responsible for the final step of the urea cycle.

Another gene, ARG2, responsible for arginase activity, can be found mainly in the mitochondria of extrahepatic tissues, the kidney being a significantly affected location with lower levels in the brain and gastrointestinal tract. However, it is not translated in enough quantities to compensate for the primary ARG1 defect.
