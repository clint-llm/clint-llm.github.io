One way to classify benign lacrimal gland tumors is by their cell-type origin:

**Epithelial Tumors**

Epithelial tumors are the most common type of tumor; roughly half of them are benign.

**Lymphoid Tumors**

Lymphoproliferative lesions in orbit are commonly located in or around the lacrimal gland. The benign proliferation of lymphoid tissue is termed reactive lymphocytic hyperplasia, or benign lymphoepithelial lesion, and accounts for around 6% of all biopsied orbital masses. Some cases of lymphoid hyperplasia have been documented in association with IgG-4 related disease.

**Mesenchymal Tumors**

Mesenchymal tumors of the lacrimal gland are primarily vascular-type masses. It has been reported that the most common of these vascular tumors is angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia. Still, otherÂ lesions can also be seen, such as capillary and cavernous hemangiomas and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Other mesenchymal tumors include granular cell tumor, fibrous histiocytoma, solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma, neurofibroma (with or without systemic neurofibromatosis type I), and schwannoma.

Other unlisted benign tumors can exist but are exceedingly rare.
