an interprofessional approach to minimally invasive aortic surgery

Even though there are several ways for cardiac surgeons to operate on the aortic valve, the gold standard is the open procedure. The minimally invasive procedures do offer some advantages but they also require expensive equipment, extensive exposure to radiation and one must have an operating room on standby in case something goes wrong. Healthcare workers who see patients with valvular disorders must be aware that these minimally invasive procedures are only done for very ill patients who are not fit for the open procedure. In the end, a an interprofessional team must fully evaluate the patient and decide which is the ideal procedure for him/her.
