The American Joint Committee on Cancer, 8th Edition Cancer Staging Manual (AJCC) bases primary tumor staging for glottic and supraglottic cancers on local extent as well as the presence or absence of vocal cord fixation.

Table 1: Tumor staging, based on local extent and presence/absence of vocal cord fixation. Pathologic T staging is identical to clinical staging.

Table 2: Clinical and pathologic nodal staging, based on size, number, laterality and presence/absence of extranodal extension (ENE).

Table 3: Stage groupings according to T, N, and M staging. For all subsites, T3-4 disease or any nodal involvement are considered locally advanced.
