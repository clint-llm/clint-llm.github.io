Cerebral toxoplasmosis (toxoplasmic encephalitis), usually with one or more ring-enhancing brain lesions is the typical presentation in HIV patients. Symptoms are often subacute, ranging from a few days to a month. Common symptoms include a headache, confusion, and lethargy. Fever may be present but often absent. There is some suggestion that chronic Toxoplasma infection state may not be completely asymptomatic and in some patients, behavioral changes and neuropsychiatric disorders are possible. Seizures and focal neurologic deficits are also common occurring in up to 30% and 70% of patients respectively. Mental status changes could range from dull affect to stupor and coma often secondary to global encephalitis and/or increased intracranial pressure. On the other hand, the latent/dormant phase is often asymptomatic.

Extracerebral involvement is typically less common than CNS infection. These include pneumonitis, chorioretinitis and less commonly gut, liver, heart, bladder, spinal cord, bone marrow, and testes. Rarely toxoplasmosis may present as a disseminated disease.
