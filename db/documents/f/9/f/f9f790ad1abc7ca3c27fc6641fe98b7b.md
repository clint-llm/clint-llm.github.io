Knowing the utility and variability of different hCG assays is clinically relevant to a wide range of medical providers. False positive and false negative testing has a large impact on patient care. All providers in a patient care team should be aware of common limitations in testing, for example, urine assay false positives with hematuria, false negatives with dilute urine, along with more obscure but still very relevant causes of inaccurate testing. Interpreting results that may be false should be undergone with care to help prevent unnecessary testing and treatment.
