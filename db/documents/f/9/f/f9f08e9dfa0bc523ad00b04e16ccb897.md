Locked-in syndrome is a condition where a person experiences quadriplegia and bulbar palsy due to damage in the brainstem. Cognition and vertical eye movements are preserved in many patients. Survivors of this condition often experience debilitating motor loss, but prompt recognition of the disease, supportive treatment, and early rehabilitation has shown to have a positive effect on people's lives. This activity reviews the evaluation, management, and treatment of this condition for the interprofessional team to recognize the disease early and improve recovery time.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of locked-in syndrome medical conditions and emergencies.
- Outline appropriate evaluation of locked-in syndrome.
- Review the management options available for the locked-in syndrome.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the early diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes for patients with locked-in syndrome.
