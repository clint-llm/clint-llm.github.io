There are no absolute contraindications to temporary cardiac pacing. However, TCP should be avoided or used with caution in certain scenarios. The most common reason to avoid any kind of temporary cardiac pacing is hemodynamically stable bradydysrhythmias with rare or tolerable symptoms. Clinicians should avoid cardiac pacing in hypothermia (unnecessary) and prolonged bradyasystolic arrest (futile). Clinicians should also avoid transvenous pacing in patients with a prosthetic tricuspid valve, as catheter placement may damage the valve or the catheter may become stuck in the valve, and patients with an excessive risk of bleeding, including those with acute myocardial infarction receiving thrombolytics, anticoagulants, and antiplatelet agents.
