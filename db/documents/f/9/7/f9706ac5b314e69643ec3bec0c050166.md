The incidence of stroke, both ischemic and hemorrhagic, in 2010 was approximately 33 million worldwide, with hemorrhagic strokes accounting for nearly a third of cases and over half of all the deaths.****Though the worldwide incidence sits at nearly 20 cases per 100,000 people every year**,**the occurrence of ICH in low/middle-income regions is double compared to the rates in more economically developed countries.****The increased risk in lower-economically developed countries is potentially related to the lack of education regarding primary prevention and inadequate access to medical care.

Stroke, both ischaemic and hemorrhagic, ranks fourth in the list of the leading cause of death in the United States, with just under 20% of cerebrovascular incidents in the United States are ICHs.

ICH is diagnosed more frequently in the elderly (> 55 years of age) and the male population, and a predilection is seen in the African and Asian populations.
