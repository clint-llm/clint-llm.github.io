Nelson syndrome cases are seen as a result of bilateral adrenalectomy for the treatment of Cushing disease.

Another view is that the corticotropic cells that initially led to the Cushing disease's adenoma are stimulated, which then causes tumor progression.

Risk factors for developing Nelson syndrome have been studied in an attempt to achieve early detection and treatment. High levels of plasma ACTH one year after bilateral adrenalectomy have the strongest predictive capabilities.

If a tumor is not detected, then a brain MRI should be performed at regular intervals. High levels ofÂ 24-hour urinary cortisol before the bilateral adrenalectomy is also a predictive factor.
