Latanoprost is an eye drop formulation for treating elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma patients. It is a prostaglandin F2 alpha analog. Prostaglandins are most commonly used as the first line of treatment in glaucoma due to their efficacy in reducing the IOP, convenient once-daily dosing, and acceptable safety profile. In addition, the fixed-dose combination of netarsudil/latanoprost was approved by the US FDA in March 2019 for open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. This activity covers the mechanism of action, pharmacology, indications, adverse event profiles, contraindications, toxicity, and its management for latanoprost. In addition, it highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of conditions where latanoprost holds therapeutic value.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the different proposed mechanisms of action of latanoprost in the ocular tissue.
- Summarize the recommended dosing technique for latanoprost therapy.
- Review the adverse event profile for latanoprost therapy.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients receiving treatment with latanoprost.
