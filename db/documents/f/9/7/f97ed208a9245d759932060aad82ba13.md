Angioneurotic edemaÂ is diagnosed clinically, and the patient is stabilized acutely without waiting for blood investigations. Some routine blood investigations such as full blood count, renal function tests, and liver function tests can be ideally performed, but are unhelpful in establishing a diagnosis. If the ANE attack is due to an allergic reaction, mast cell tryptase levels may be elevated during the attack and can be compared with the convalescence stage. Complement levels C4 may be depleted during the HANE attack, which indicates a deficiency of C1 esterase inhibitor.
