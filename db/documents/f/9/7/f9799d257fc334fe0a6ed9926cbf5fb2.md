The gold standard for diagnosing amebic colitis is the detection of trophozoites of E. histolytica with ulcers in the microscopic examination of colonoscopic biopsies or, more infrequently, in fresh stool examination.Â Patients with diarrhea are most likely to have trophozoites in the stool, which may be visible in direct wet mounts or trichrome-stained smears. Classically the cecum and ascending colon are affected, which show multiple punctate ulcers with intervening normal tissue. The ulcers on histological examination typically appear as flask-shaped. In severe cases of amebic colitis, the ulcers may coalesce to look similar to ulcerative colitis.

Amebic liver abscesses often are detected by ultrasonographic or radiographic tests.E. histolytica are available; the results are positive in more than 90% of patients with the extraintestinal disease. These antibody levels rise after tissue invasion but are not protective. However, antibody tests are not particularly useful in distinguishing between past and current infection because antibodies can persist for years after an infection has resolved. Also, these tests provide limited information on patients from endemic areas. Tests that detect E. histolytica antigen in stool provide evidence of current infection. Point of care testing using immunochromatographic techniques is being developed to assist with the rapid diagnosis of E. histolytica infection.
