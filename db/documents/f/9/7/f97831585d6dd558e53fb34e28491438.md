The International Classification of Headache Disorders has broadly classified headache disorders into primary and secondary based on their origin. Primary headache disorders include migraine, trigeminal autonomic cephalgia, tension-type headache, and other primary headache disorders. Nummular headache categorizes under other primary headache disorders. It may be continuous or with intermittent exacerbations. The involved area is sharply contoured, fixed in size and shape, round or elliptical and about 1 to 6 cm in diameter, which has led to the name “coin-shaped headache.” Unlike migraine headache, nummular headache is not accompanied by nausea, vomiting, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, conjunctival injection, light or sound sensitivity or focal neurologic symptoms.
