There are two types of alpha-adrenergic receptors; alpha-1 and alpha-2. Both are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR); however, the downstream effects of the two are different. The alpha-1 receptor is of the Gq type, resulting in activation of phospholipase C, increasing IP3 and DAG, and ultimately increasing the intracellular calcium concentrations leading to smooth muscle contraction and glycogenolysis.
