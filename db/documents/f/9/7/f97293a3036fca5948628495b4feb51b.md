**Anesthetic**

- Ablative laser procedures may be performed under local anesthesia, using a combination of topical and local anesthetic. This, of course, depends on the patient's demeanor and pain tolerance and the laser operator's ability to employ effective sensory nerve blocks to the face if a full facial skin resurfacing is planned.

- Regarding topical anesthetic, a eutectic mixture of local anesthesia cream (EMLA) can be used by applying 2 mg/cm2 topically under occlusion for 45 to 60 minutes, with removal just before the procedure is performed.

**Laser Selection**

- CO2 or Er:YAG lasers

- Fractional or non-fractional

**Laser-safe Eye Protection**

- The patient's eyes should be protected using a wet gauze or an eye shield

- Healthcare personnel should use wavelength-appropriate spectacles

**Laser-safe Instruments**

- Fire extinguisher

- Wet towels

- Water or saline

**Other Considerations**

- Laser protocols, pre-procedure laser setting check

- Gloves, masks, and a cap should be used by all healthcare personnel

- Povidone-iodine 5% solution for disinfection (alcohol should be avoided because it is inflammable)
