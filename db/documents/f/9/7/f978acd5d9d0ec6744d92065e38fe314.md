Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections usually occur as a nosocomial infection, though community-acquired infections have also been reported.Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is that its clinical manifestations are non-specific and almost cannot be distinguished from other infections. As mentioned above, it is, therefore, essential to identify the most vulnerable population to such infection, most importantly the immunocompromised population.

It is crucial to differentiate between non-invasive colonization from non-sterile samples and an actual infection that warrants treatment, mainly by the clinical judgment on the symptoms, signs, laboratory, and radiographic evidence of infection.

The most common isolates were reported from respiratory infections, namely pneumonia cases, whether sputum or bronchioalveolar lavage cultures, at 55% of the total infections.

The second most common form of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections is bacteremia, at 33% of the infections.Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterococcus faecalis.

There have been less commonly reported cases of other sites of infection, such as skin and soft tissue infections, at 7.8% of the total infections, most notably wound infections, metastatic cellulitis, and ecthyma gangrenosum.
