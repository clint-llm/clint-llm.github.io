Diagnosis of acute or chronic organophosphate poisoning is strictly clinical. You must have a high clinical suspicion for organophosphate poisoning when no history of exposure or ingestion is known. Some organophosphates have a distinct garlic or petroleum odor that may help in diagnosis. If organophosphate poisoning is on the differential but not confirmed, a trial of atropine may be employed. If symptoms resolve after atropine, this increases the likelihood of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor poisoning. Some labs can directly measure red blood cell acetylcholinesterase activity, but these are often sent out to labs that are not available in a timely enough fashion to guide therapy.

Today there is a portable test that can measure AChE in red blood cells within minutes. The blood must be drawn before pralidoxime is administered. The red cell AChE correlates with neuronal AChE and can be used to determine response to therapy.

Plasma AChE is not used as it is a liver acute-phase protein that circulates in the blood and has no correlation to symptoms. Plus, the levels of plasma AChE do vary due to infection, pregnancy, and medical illness.

Other blood work that should be ordered includes CBC, glucose levels, troponin, liver and renal function, and arterial blood gas.

The ECG will reveal sinus bradycardia due to parasympathetic activation.
