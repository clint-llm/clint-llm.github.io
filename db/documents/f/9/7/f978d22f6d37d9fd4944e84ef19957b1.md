Gastrointestinal peristalsis involves the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, and rectum. The peristaltic movement of smooth muscle may also be found elsewhere throughout the body, including within the ureters, vas deferens, bile ducts, and glandular ducts.

Lymph circulates throughout the human body via multiple mechanisms, including arterial pulsation, compression of lymphatic vessels during skeletal muscle contraction, and peristalsis within the lymph capillaries.

Uterine peristalsis is a mechanism that directs sustained and rapid sperm transport from the external cervical os to the isthmus ipsilateral to the dominant follicle. This action of peristalsis changes direction and frequency throughout the menstrual cycle, with its activity lowest during menstruation and highest during ovulation.
