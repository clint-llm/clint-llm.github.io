Patients taking nirmatrelvir/ritonavir requires close monitoring for adverse reactions, such as hypersensitivity and drug-drug interactions.

TDM (Therapeutic drug monitoring) is required for narrow therapeutic drugs like cyclosporine and tacrolimus when coadministered with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir.

Clinicians and healthcare facilities must be aware of mandatory reporting requirements. Prescribers are mandated to use FDA Form 3500 to report all medication errors and serious adverse events related to nirmatrelvir/ritonavir to FDA MedWatch(https://www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm). The adverse event must be reported to Pfizer according to the package insert. In addition, clinicians and healthcare facilities must report therapeutics information and utilization data to the US Department of Health and Human Services.

Clinicians should also monitor patients who complete their regimen of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir for rebound and recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms.
