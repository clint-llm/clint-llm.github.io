Pustular psoriasis is a rare, immune-mediated systemic skin disorder characterized by yellowish pustules on an erythematous base with a variety of clinical presentations and distribution patterns. Pustular psoriasis is considered a variant of psoriasis vulgaris. The pustules can be widespread or localized and are characterized by a sterile, predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of pustular psoriasis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.
