Though hyperbaric therapy is generally well tolerated, it is important to consider potential complications that can arise in patients receiving treatment. Barotrauma to hollow organs of the body is the most frequent side effect for which patients should be carefully monitored. The most common barotraumatic injury is middle ear barotrauma, which includes middle ear effusions and tympanic membrane rupture, with an incidence of about 2%. This side effect can mitigated with careful patient instructions regarding autoinflation techniques during treatment.

Barotrauma can also involve the sinuses, and is typically found in patients who have upper respiratory infections or allergic rhinitis. Patients should be carefully screened for these preconditions and may even be given antihistamines or nasal decongestants to mitigate potential complications during therapy sessions.

Pulmonary barotrauma, though less common, is another important complication to keep in mind. Before hyperbaric therapy is initiated, patients should be fully evaluated for a pre-existing pneumothorax, which should be managed prior to starting treatment. In fact, an untreated pneumothorax is the only absolute contraindication to hyperbaric therapy.

Systemic oxygen toxicity from hyperbaric therapy can also cause a rare, yet concerning side effect: seizures. Hyperic induced seizures have an incidence of about 0.011%, according to a retrospective analysis of 2,334 patients.
