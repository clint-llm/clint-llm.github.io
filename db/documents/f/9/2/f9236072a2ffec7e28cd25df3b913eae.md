One of the most commonly palpated arteries in clinical medicine is the radial artery. This artery runs deep to the majority of the musculature in the forearm, before becoming more superficial as it courses across the radius entering the hand. At the site where it is commonly palpated, the radial artery sits between the skin and the pronator quadratus.

The distal radius receives blood from the radial, anterior interosseous, posterior interosseous, and ulnar artery. The anterior interosseous does the majority of the work as it branches into periosteal and cortical branches at the distal radial metaphysis.

The scaphoid receives a palmar and dorsal blood supply. The palmar surface receives vascular supply by the palmar carpal artery and the superficial palmar artery, while the dorsal surface gets its blood provided by the dorsal scaphoid artery, the dorsal carpal artery, and the styloid artery.

The lunate has a variable blood supply that utilizes branches of the dorsal intercarpal arterial arch and the dorsal radiocarpal arch. The palmar surface of the lunate is supplied by nutrient vessels that traverse the various ligaments that insert on the lunate.

The lymphatics of the radiocarpal joint follow a similar course as the vasculature. These lymphatics divide into a deep and superficial group and further subclassified based on their location of radial or ulnar.
