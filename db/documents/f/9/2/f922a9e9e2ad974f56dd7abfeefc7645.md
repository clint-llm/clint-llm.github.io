Management of macrocytosis depends on the etiology and the presence or absence of associated anemia. If the macrocytosis is relatively mild with MCV < 115 without significant anemia and if no concerning features are identified on a thorough history, physical exam, and initial laboratory testing, then no treatment is necessary.

If the patient regularly consumes alcohol, macrocytosis, and macrocytic anemia may resolve several months after alcohol cessation.

If significant anemia is present or if the MCV is 115 or greater, more investigation should be undertaken to determine the etiology, which in turn dictates the appropriate treatment strategy. Vitamin B12 may be supplemented orally or, if impaired, enteral absorption is present, given IM monthly. Daily oral folic acid may be prescribed. Offending medications should be adjusted or discontinued as clinically appropriate. Pathology responsible for gastrointestinal malabsorption should be identified and treated with referral to the appropriate specialist. Oncology referral may be necessary for cases of dysplasia or hematologic malignancy.
