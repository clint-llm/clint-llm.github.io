The correct diagnosis and management of patients with PDS/PG are imperative to avoid the onset and progression of functional and structural glaucomatous damage. The slit-lamp examination must include tonometry,

Fundus examination is of utmost importance to assess optic nerve cupping and notching typically seen in glaucoma. Retinal tears and degenerations can be found in eyes with PDS/PG considering that eyes at risk tend to be myopic. Genetic testing is usually not performed for the clinical diagnosis of PDS/PG. Baseline and follow-up visual field testing are needed for the initial diagnosis of PG and the management of the disease over time. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can provide structural information regarding peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning indicative of glaucomatous damage. The central corneal thickness should be performed as it affects the measurement of IOP.

Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and anterior segment OCT (AS-OCT) are used to document the concavity of the peripheral iris and the open angle of the anterior chamber. Other UBM features include posterior insertion of the iris (increased distance from scleral spur to the iris insertion); a touch of the iris with lens, zonules, and ciliary body; increased lens thickness, and increased posterior bowing of iris during accommodation.

AS-OCT findings include increased irido-lenticular contact area, high anterior chamber volume, increased anterior chamber depth, and increased trabecular iris space area (TISA) at 500 microns and 750 microns from the scleral spur with increased angle opening distance (AOD).

Phenylephrine provocative test has been used to detect high risk for developing high IOP.
