The meta-analysis of four prospective studies (FHS, LRCF CPPT, MRFIT) concluded that CHD risk is inversely related to HDL-C levels. The FHS, CPPT, and MRFIT studies demonstrated that for each 1 mg/dL increase in HDL, there was a 3% decrease in CHD risk for women and a 2% decrease for men.

The Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Mortality Follow-up Study (LRCF) documented only fatal outcomes. A 1-mg/dL increase in HDL cholesterol decreased cardiovascular disease mortality rates by 3.7% in men and 4.7% in women.
