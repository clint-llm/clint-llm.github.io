Today, trench foot is usually identified early, and the treatment is very straightforward. Keeping the feet dry and warm is imperative. Rest and elevation of the affected foot are encouraged since this will help prevent new wounds and blisters. NSAIDS will help with any discomfort the patient is having and will also help to alleviate the swelling. If the patient cannot take NSAIDS, then acetaminophen or aspirin will help with the pain but may not help with the swelling. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the prevention and treatment of trench foot are straightforward, and their recommendations are as follows:

- Take off socks

- Avoid wearing dirty socks to bed

- Wash the affected area right away

- Dry feet completely

- Apply heat packs to the area for up to 5 minutes

If the above measures do not help the condition, then the CDC recommends further evaluation by a clinician.
