Routes for common opioids include intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SQ), Oral (PO), and transdermal (TD). Intramuscular administration is not recommended for pain management while using the SQ route is limited to circumstances such as lack of IV availability. The most common routes of administration of opioids are PO, IV, and TD. Oral short-acting opioids are dosed 3 to 4 hours apart due to their short half-life. Stable patients on chronic opioid therapy benefit from preventive analgesia and often have regimens that combine a long-acting opioid, dosed 8 to 12 hours apart, and a short-acting opioid, the latter being used as a breakthrough opioid when pain transiently increases in intensity above the pain addressed by the ongoing analgesics. Intravenous opioids are generally dosed for acute pain relief in situations where an oral opioid is ineffective, or the oral route is unavailable. Intravenous opioids are dosed 2 to 3 hours apart or can be dosed as a continuous infusion or as patient-controlled analgesia (PCA).
