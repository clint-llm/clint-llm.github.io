Acute myocarditis is an inflammatory cardiomyopathy. The inflammatory process is initiated after the entry of the virus into the myocardial cells. This entry leads to the activation of an innate immune response over the first week, followed by an adaptive immune response over the next 1-4 weeks. During the chronic stage, chronic inflammation and remodeling of the myocardium lead to myocardial dilation and cardiomyopathy.

The cell damage caused by the virus leads to the release of interleukin and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP). These mediate the recruitment of inflammatory cells of the innate immune system. Additionally, any stress, such as pain or anxiety, triggers the medullary cells for monocytopoiesis. There is a release of myeloid progenitor cells. The spleen is activated to replenish the pro-inflammatory cells. These pro-inflammatory cells mobilize to the damaged myocardium, where interferon-gamma release leads to further recruitment. The exaggerated inflammatory response to the viral damage of the myocardium leads to chronic inflammation, myocardial remodeling, and ventricle dysfunction.

There is also a role of autoimmunity in inflammatory myocarditis.
