Providers typically refer individuals with HIV/AIDS to therapy to address residual musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiovascular deficits that develop as the disease progresses and to address pain related to or exacerbated by this condition. Aerobic and resistance at moderate intensities have been shown to be beneficial to patients while not impairing CD4+ count nor viral load while still allowing patients to make significant strength gains.
