As described in the etiology section, FHCS is a complication of PID. Microorganisms associated with PID are thought to spread in one of three ways:

- Through spontaneous ascending infection, microbes from the cervix or vagina travel to the endometrium, through the Fallopian tubes, and into the peritoneal cavity. Complications include endometritis, salpingitis, tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic peritonitis, and perihepatitis.

- Microbes can also spread via lymphatic channels, such as an infection of the parametrium from an intrauterine device.

- Finally, the hematogenous spread is also possible such as with tuberculosis.
