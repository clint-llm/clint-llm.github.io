Several conditions can predispose to the development of a TIF. These include pressure necrosis caused by the tracheostomy cuff, prolonged use of steroids or immunosuppressants, placement of tracheostomy below the third tracheal ring, tracheitis, prolonged intubation, anomalous/high anatomic location of the innominate artery and extension of a skin infection at the stoma site to the deeper space.
