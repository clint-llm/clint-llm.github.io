Since 1988, the Bethesda System for Reporting Cervical Cytology has been the accepted reporting system in the United States. The 2014 revision is the most recent.

**Specimen type:**Indicates whether it is conventional or liquid-based

**Specimen adequacy:**Indicates if it is satisfactory for evaluation or unsatisfactory for evaluation.

**General Categorization**

- Negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy

- Other: see interpretation/result

- Epithelial cell abnormality: see interpretation/result

**Interpretation/Result**

- Negative intraepithelial lesion (there is no cellular evidence of neoplasia)

- Nonneoplastic findings (nonneoplastic cellular variations, reactive cellular changes, glandular cells post-hysterectomy)

- Organisms (Trichomonas vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis, Candida species, Actinomyces species, cellular changes consistent with herpes virus, cellular changes consistent with cytomegalovirus)

- Other

- Endometrial cells in a woman older than 45 years old

**Epithelial Cell Abnormalities**

Squamous cell

- Atypical squamous cells (ASC)

- Of undetermined significance (ASC-US)

- Cannot exclude high grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) (ASC-H)

- Low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL):  mild dysplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1

- High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL):  moderate and severe dysplasia, CIN 2 and CIN 3

With features suspicious for invasion (if invasion suspected)

- Endocervical cells (not otherwise specified)

- Endometrial cells (not otherwise specified)

- Glandular cells (not otherwise specified)

- Endocervical cells favor neoplastic
