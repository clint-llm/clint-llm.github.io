Splenectomy, a procedure to remove the entire spleen, is performed for a number of indications. It is important to understand the anatomy and physiology of the spleen prior to performing a splenectomy. Splenectomy can be performed via open, laparoscopic, or robotic techniques depending on the patient and diagnosis.
