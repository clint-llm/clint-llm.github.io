The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is the most frequent site in the body for several types of abnormal blood vessels, which represent irregularities in the normal form of the affected arteries, veins, or capillaries. Vascular abnormalities can be benign or malignant such as hemangiomas or angiosarcomas, respectively. Also, they can be congenital, such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or mostly acquired, such as angiodysplasia.
