The list of neurological diseases related to epilepsia partialis continua (EPC) is essentially endless, reflecting the diverse nature of the disease. The causes of EPC are very similar to that of any other form of epilepsy as the basic reason for seizures is abnormal electrical activity in the brain brought on by a myriad of pathologies including architectural damage, cortical dysplasia (such as Tuberous Sclerosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome, and linear sebaceous nevus syndrome), drugs, metabolic abnormalities (hyponatremia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hyperuricemia, uremia), neoplastic process (oligodendroglioma, meningioma, high grade glioma), autoimmune processes (autoimmune encephalitides), or infections. Rasmussen encephalitis or chronic focal encephalitis (CFE), a rare neurological disease seen in children, has shown a strong association with EPC according to the current literature.
