Coronaviruses are a large family of single positive-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses that can infect many animal species and humans. Human coronaviruses can be divided based on their pathogenicity. The types with high pathogenicity include SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and the current novel SARS-CoV2. Cross-species transmission is the most likely model of the initial transmission from bat to human. The initial transfer is believed to have happened in Wuhan, China. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of victims of COVID-19. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition and, in particular, those with cardiac manifestations.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of COVID-19.
- Describe the signs and symptoms of a patient with COVID-19.
- Summarize the treatment options for a patient with COVID-19.
- Outline the prognosis of a patient with cardiac manifestations of COVID-19.
