The time course of aortic rupture occurs in two distinct phases owing to the three histologic layers that compose the vessel wall. Immediately following injury, there is rupture of the inner intima and media layers of the vessel wall. Next, after an indeterminate and unpredictable amount of time, disruption of the outermost adventitial layer occurs resulting in rapid clinical decline. Studies have shown the time interval between disruption of the intima-media and adventitial rupture can vary from seconds to years.
