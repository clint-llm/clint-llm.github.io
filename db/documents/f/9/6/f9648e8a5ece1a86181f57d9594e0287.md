HF may cause multiple complications, including but not limited to:

- Arrhythmias: Atrial fibrillation (Afib) can be a cause or a consequence of HF and may present in 10% to 50% of chronic HF patients, and those patients with HF and Afib have a poor prognosis. Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (like sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and torsades de pointes) are common in end-stage heart failure, especially if precipitating or factors are present like electrolyte disturbance, prolonged QT interval, and digoxin toxicity. Bradyarrhythmias may also happen.

- Thromboembolism: HF is a cause of stroke in 9% of patients.

- Gastrointestinal: liver shock (ischemic hepatitis), liver cirrhosis, and cardiac cachexia due to decreases intestinal blood flow in patients with HF.

- Renal: renal function may get worse in both acute and chronic HF, and that predicts poor prognosis, and even a small transient rise in creatinine will be clinically relevant.

- Respiratory: pulmonary congestion, respiratory muscle weakness, and rarely pulmonary hypertension
