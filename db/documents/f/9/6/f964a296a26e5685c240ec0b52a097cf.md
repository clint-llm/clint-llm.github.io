**Innervation of the great vessels**

The innervation of vessels derives from a network of interconnected plexuses of neuronal fibers that are called the nervi vasorum, which rest upon the tunica adventitia alongside the vasa vasorum externae

**Relation of the great vessels to nerves in the mediastinum**

The heart and great vessels are traversed and surrounded by several important nerves that supply the area and continue inferiorly to the diaphragm and abdominal cavity. For this reason, the position of these nerves must be taken into consideration during surgical instrumentation of the great vessels to avoid iatrogenic injury

The left and right phrenic nerves (C3-C5) run relatively laterally through the mediastinum

The bilateral vagus nerves (cranial nerve X) also descend within the mediastinum. They are initially related to their respective aspects of the aortic arch, having emerged between the common carotid and subclavian arteries on each side. Each gives off the important recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) branch, which ascends to supply the intrinsic muscles of the trachea (expect cricothyroid)
