Avoid nephrotoxic medications such as renal-toxic aminoglycoside antibiotics, NSAIDs, and other potential renal toxins. Administration of N -acetyl-cysteine before and after a radiologic investigation that requires intravenous contrast can help avoid nephrotoxicity. However, providers should consider an alternative radiological investigation, such as ultrasonography or MRI, in such settings to prevent AKI, especially in patients with diabetes.

Patients should be educated that low-protein and plant-based diets are more likely to slow the progression of CKD. At the same time, using prebiotics, synbiotics, probiotics, and laxatives could have beneficial effects on toxin generation.
