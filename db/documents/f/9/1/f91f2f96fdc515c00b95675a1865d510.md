Cylindromas are benign lesions, however they may transform into the malignant cylindrocarcinoma in a rare number of cases. Malignant cylindromas are more frequently associated with Brooke-Spiegler Syndrome. The malignant form exhibits more rapid growth, atypical and asymmetrical architectural features, and invasive pattern of growth. Cytological features may include nuclear pleomorphism and crowding, loss of the characteristic jigsaw puzzle pattern, loss of intervening hyaline sheaths, loss of the biphasic cell population, and development of necrosis. Malignant cylindromas exhibit aggressive local infiltrative growth patterns and have been known to metastasize. Immunohistochemical stains do not help differentiate between benign or malignant lesions.
