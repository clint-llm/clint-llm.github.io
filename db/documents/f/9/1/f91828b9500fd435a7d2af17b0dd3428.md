The exact pathophysiology underlying the sign of Leser-TrelatÂ remains elusive, but there is strong suspicion that the release of cytokines and growth factors from the neoplasm are stimulating the eruptive growth of the seborrheic keratoses. Particularly, the overexpression of EGF-alpha and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) may contribute to the eruptive nature of these lesions. Additional named growth factors include human-growth-hormone, transforming growth factor-alpha, and insulin-like growth factor.
