Developmental dysplasia of the hip involves a spectrum of disorders resulting from abnormal hip development. Abnormal hip development results in acetabular dysplasia, subluxation of the femoral head, and hip dislocation. Evaluation of the pediatric hip with arthrography demonstrates the cartilaginous anatomy of the acetabulum and femoral head. Arthrography aids in evaluating the congruency of the hip joint, joint stability, femoral head sphericity, and reducibility of the femoral head. Pediatric hip arthrograms are performed in developmental dysplasia of the hip to identify any possible blocks to reduction and confirm adequate closed reduction under anesthesia. Soft tissue barriers to successful closed reduction include an inverted labrum, inverted limbus, ligamentum teres hypertrophy, pulvinar, transverse acetabular ligament hypertrophy, and iliopsoas tendon constriction on the hip joint capsule. This activity describes the examination and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating pediatric patients who undergo hip arthrography.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the pediatric hip joint.
- Summarize the technique for performing a pediatric hip arthrogram.
- Review indications and contraindications for a pediatric hip arthrogram.
- Identify normal and abnormal findings on a pediatric hip arthrogram.
