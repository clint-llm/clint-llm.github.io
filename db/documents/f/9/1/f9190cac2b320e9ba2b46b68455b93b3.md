The goal of the history for patients with BPSD is to establish priorities regarding the nature and urgency of interventions, characterize the symptoms, identify potentially reversible exacerbating factors, including environmental factors, medications, discomfort, substance use, and pre-morbid psychiatric disorders; and create a baseline for measuring the effectiveness of treatment. The goal of the physical examination is to confirm historical data and identify alternative or contributing psychiatric or general medical conditions.

Behavioral disturbances often occur in the evening, a phenomenon is known as 'sundowning.' Some studies suggest that this phenomenon affects up to two-thirds of patients with dementia.

**Physical Examination**

The physical examination may document the problematic symptoms, although these are often intermittent. The primary role of the physical exam is to identify factors that may contribute to worsening BPSD, such as superimposed delirium or discomfort. For example, the exam may reveal an altered level of consciousness (somnolence or hyper-alertness), which is frequently a feature of delirium, or grimacing and guarding suggesting pain. Physical findings such as fever, hypoxia, abdominal tenderness, fluid overload, inflammation, or new localizing neurologic deficits may point to an acute medical condition that is causing delirium.
