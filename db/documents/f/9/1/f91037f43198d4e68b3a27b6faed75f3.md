Angioid streaks are usually asymptomatic visually. The visual decline may result from foveal involvement with an angioid streak, rupture at the area of angioid streak causing subretinal bleed at the fovea, or CNV. These hemorrhages do not have evidence of CNV and usually resolve spontaneously. However, the angioid streak may be associated with CNV, which may cause visual decline and/or metamorphopsia.

Patients with PXE may be referred from the dermatology department for ophthalmic evaluation, leading to the diagnosis of angioid streaks. Other systemic associations will have history and clinical examination findings according to the disease.

The history should try to rule out systemic associations.
