The patient is supposed to lie still on the table, breathing normally while the technician takes scans from different angles. The procedure is discussed in detail with the patient as the patient's cooperation is a key element during the whole scanning because the patient's movement can blur the images. The duration of the whole scanning takes about 30-45 minutes though it may take longer. The procedure involves two phases, which can be done simultaneously or one after another. One phase is ventilation, and the other is perfusion. For ventilation scans, radioactive xenon or technetium is breathed through the nebulizer via mouthpiece for a few minutes. A gamma camera is placed close to the patient, and scans at different angles are taken. Similarly, for the perfusion scan, radioactive contrast-containing technetium is given intravenously to the patient, and images are taken. V/Q scan utilizes the novel pulmonary arterial segmental anatomy as a single end-artery perfuses each segment. Each conical bronchopulmonary segment has its base towards pleural surfaces. Classically, thrombi occlude the pulmonary arteries and create characteristic wedge-shaped lobar, segmental, or subsegment defects based on the level of occlusion.

**1) Radiolabelled Aerosols (for Ventilation Scan)**

- 99Tc: 99Tc-DTPA is the most widely used radionuclide with a dosage of 900 to 1,300 MBq (25 to 35 mCi) with a photopeak of 140 keV.

- 81mKr: with a dosage of 40 to 400 MBq (1 to 10 mCi) and with a photopeak of 190

- keV.

- 133Xe: with a dosage of 200 to 750 MBq (5 to 20 mCi) and a photopeak of 81 keV.

The pulmonary clearance of 99Tc-DTPA can be used to estimate the alveolar epithelial membrane integrity. In alveolar inflammatory conditions such as allergic or toxic alveolitis (smoking), the clearance rate would increase, therefore shortening 99Tc-DTPA half-life.

**2) Injectable Radionuclides (for Perfusion Scan)**

-  99mTc-MAA: with a dosage of 40 to 150 MBq (1 to 4 mCi).

The procedure is done in two phases first, the ventilation, then perfusion imaging. A disposable nebulizer is used to deliver the 99Tc-DTPA aerosol to the lung via a mouthpiece to perform the ventilation image. The patient should be upright or in a supine position with the nose occluded. 133Xe is preferred in assessing patients with obstructive airway disease.

**Imaging Protocols:**Different imaging protocols are utilized; V/Q imaging with SPECT (V/Q) is a widely accepted and practiced protocol or, in rare situations, planar scintigraphy (V/Q). Sometimes, perfusion-only scanning is performed. Many institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic opted to perform perfusion only scanning to minimize the dispersion/spread of SARS-CoV-2. V/Q may also be combined with CTPA or computed tomography. A systemic review performed on 23 prospective studies concluded that among 7000 patients in whom D-dimer assessment combined with clinical probability was inconclusive, a normal perfusion scan (Q scan) safely excluded pulmonary embolism.

**1. V/Q SPECT Imaging Technique**

Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) obtains the image through multidetector gamma-cameras to generate three-dimensional images. SPECT showed higher sensitivity than the planar technique.

- Low indetermination rate and more reproducibility

- Greater sensitivity (97%) and specificity (91%)

- New and advanced analytic data processing, such as V/Q ratio qualification

**2. V/Q Planar Imaging Technique**

Planar imaging acquisition is a two-dimensional technique obtained through a dual-head gamma camera for ventilation and perfusion scans, respectively. Limited patient movement between the two scans is crucial.

Disadvantages of the V/Q planar technique:

- Two-dimensional images are compared with the advancing three-dimensional V/Q SPECT.

- Inaccurate determination of lung segmental involvement after the embolic event.

- Inexact determination of the degree of perfusion defects.

**3. V/Q SPECT/CT Imaging Technique**

In this technique, a low-dose CT scan is integrated with the functional SPECT to provide more detailed anatomic information. In practice, the CT image (without contrast) is usually taken after the perfusion scan.

Advantages of SPECT/CT:

- More reliable detection of V/Q mismatch conditions than PE, such as in obstructive lung disease, external vascular compression, or neoplasm.

- Better V/Q matching information due to non-embolic causes (pneumonia, pleural, or pericardial effusion).

- Detection of PE cases in which V/Q is unusually matched, like PE, with an area of pulmonary infarction.

- Carries the highest diagnostic accuracy.

**4. Combined V/Q SPECT with CTPA**

It enables the radiologist to localize the clot site reported in the CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA).
