**Mechanical Obstructions**

Mechanical obstructions will present as dilation of bowel proximal to the obstructed point. Mechanical obstructions include incarcerated hernia, stricture, volvulus, or mass. Typically a "transition point" will be observed where proximal bowel is dilated and distal bowel compressed. If contrast is administered either by mouth or by enema, a cut-off may be seen.

**Toxic Megacolon**

In addition to abdominal distension on physical exam and abdominal radiograph, patients with toxic megacolon typically exhibit systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria including fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered mental status. The patients also more commonly have abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea. Toxic megacolon is commonly seen with ulcerative colitis but may also be seen with other types of colitis, e.g., ischemic, infectious, pseudomembranous. Clinical deterioration requires surgical evaluation for total colectomy with end ileostomy.

**Fecal Impaction**

A dilated rectum and colon is commonly seen with fecal impaction. Patients with these findings should have a digital rectal exam to rule out impacted stool. Additionally, fecal matter can be seen on radiograph and CT imaging. Once the impaction is resolved, patients typically have a resolution of their symptoms.
