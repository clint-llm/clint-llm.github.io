Diagnosis of pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) is ultimately a poor prognosis. Studies have shown high mortality rates of 53 to 67%.

It takes a few weeks for PIE to resolve with proper management; however, this leads to prolonged mechanical ventilator use and complications associated with prolonged ventilator use, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia or chronic lobar emphysema. These may require surgical lobectomies.
