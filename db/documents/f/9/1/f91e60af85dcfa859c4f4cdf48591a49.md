- Oral anticoagulants are classified as high-risk medications and have the potential to cause bleeding.

- Warfarin has been in use for more than 70 years, and while it is known to increase the risk of bleeding, its effects can be reversed with vitamin K.

- While the newer oral anticoagulants are safer than warfarin, they are also prohibitively expensive.

- Tools to predict bleeding with oral anticoagulants are available and can be used in clinical decision-making.

- Unfortunately, none of the tools are highly predictive of bleeding, and none can predict the risk of an intracranial bleed.

- Bleeding tools may help counsel low-risk patients and identify patients who may benefit from closely monitored anticoagulation.

- Each hospital should establish strategies to decrease the risk of bleeding associated with oral anticoagulants.

- Each patient should be assessed individually prior to starting warfarin therapy, and therapy should be personalized to that particularÂ patient, with emphasis on monitoring and patient education.
