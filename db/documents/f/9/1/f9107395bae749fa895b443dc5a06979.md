Diagnosis is often straightforward due to the correlation of timing of device implantation/onset of pacing and the timing of symptoms, as well as more frequent and persistent symptoms in patients who are pacing dependant in the setting of single chamber devices.

In the aging population, however, there might be some confusion in reporting and remembering symptoms, and most of these could be non-specific which can often be attributed to aging.

Symptoms often include the following;

- Neurologic: Fatigability, memory loss, confusion, and often transient blackouts

- Cardiovascular: Low blood pressures, exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, a decrease in exercise capacity, syncope

- Hemodynamic: Prominent neck pulsations, abdominal pulsations, right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain

Examination often yields the following signs:

- Hypotension, tachypnea, low oxygen saturation, lung rales

- Narrow pulse pressure and low pulse volume

- Neck vein distension and cannon wave in JVP tracing

- Precordial examination may reveal regurgitant murmurs and variability in the intensity of first heart sound

- Pulsatile liver and ascites may be present in severe cases

- Lower extremity edema

- Neurologic examination may reveal confusion, dizziness, or altered mental status
