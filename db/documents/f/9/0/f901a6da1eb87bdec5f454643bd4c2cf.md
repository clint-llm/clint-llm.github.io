Most of the symptoms of insulin toxicity are related to hypoglycemia and electrolyte abnormalities. They can categorize into neuroglycopenic and catecholaminergic symptoms. The latter appear first are characterized by tachycardia, sweating, tremors. If blood glucose continues to decrease, neuroglycopenic symptoms appear. They can be from a mild mental status alteration to seizures and coma. Patients that present with hypoglycemia can have diaphoresis, hypotension, and bradycardia. Elevated doses of insulin can lead to water and salt retention and result in dilutional hyponatremia and hypokalemia.

The antidote for insulin toxicity is dextrose with a dose of 400 to 600mg/kg/hr. The antidote for severe insulin toxicity is the use of a glucagon emergency kit plus dextrose infusion.
