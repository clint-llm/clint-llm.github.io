Compressive optic neuropathy can be caused by intrinsic or extrinsic compression anywhere along the optic nerve. In addition to damage by compression, optic nerve damage can occur as a result of demyelination, ischemia, metabolic, and traumatic insult. The most common sign is slow progressive monocular visual loss, sometimes associated with headaches. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of compressive optic neuropathy and highlights the role of the healthcare team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of compressive optic neuropathy.
- Explain the evaluation of compressive optic neuropathy.
- Review the management options available for compressive optic neuropathy.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with compressive optic neuropathy.
