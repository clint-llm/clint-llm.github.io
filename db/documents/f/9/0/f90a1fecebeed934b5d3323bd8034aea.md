Clinical studies have failed to demonstrate evidence of HIV infection causing direct injury in the spinal cord and nerves. It is hypothesized that this syndrome occurs in patients with HIV due to direct infection of cells by the virus or by indirect toxicity of viral gene products and host inflammatory response. The latter is considered more likely; however, data to prove this mechanism is also lacking, although mitochondrial DNA damage has been observed in affected neurons in patients with HIV.

Superimposed CMV infection causes leakage of endothelial capillary tight junctions and loss of integrity of the blood-brain barrier, which also accounts for the presence of latently infected cells in CSF.

Tubercular polyradiculopathy may either start as an extension of TB meningitis or secondary to vertebral or other primary TB lesions. It causes extensive exudate formation, which may encase the spinal root and cause impingement.

Non-infectious polyradiculopathy occurs with infiltration of the leptomeninges, spinal cord, and spinal roots with lymphoma cells.
