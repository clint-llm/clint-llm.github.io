Generally, endovascular papillary angioendothelioma presents as a slow-growing, painless nodule that is typically localized to the subcutaneous tissue of the extremities, dermis, and less commonly on the trunk, head, and neck.

Most cutaneous tumors come to medical attention when they are two to three centimeters in size.

Symptomatology is also variable. Patients may complain of pain, ulceration, or bleeding from the affected site.
