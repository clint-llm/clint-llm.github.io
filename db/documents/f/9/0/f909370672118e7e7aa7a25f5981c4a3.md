Nerve biopsy is not essential for the diagnosis of DLRPN, but cutaneous (sural and/or superficial peroneal) nerve biopsies have undergone analysis utilizing different histochemical stains, which have served for a better understanding of the disease process. As seen with ischemic injury, reports of asymmetrical, multifocal degeneration, loss of fibers within the nerve fascicles, perineurium fibrosis, neovascularization, and hemosiderin build-up have been recorded. Lastly, epineurial microvessel inflammatory infiltrates (mural and perivascular infiltration), vessel wall necrosis, separation of the smooth muscle layer of vessels, and bleeding (hemosiderin-laden macrophages) have also been evidenced.
