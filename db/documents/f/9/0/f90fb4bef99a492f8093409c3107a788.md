Head injury is a very common presentation to the PED and is the most common cause of lethal trauma in children. Fortunately, the majority (80% to 90%) of head injuries can be classified as mild. Very few injuries are life-threatening or require neurosurgical intervention. The incidence of skull fracture in children following head injury ranges from 2% to 20%, and further epidemiological study is needed for more accurate incidence and prevalence rates. Skull fracture has been shown to be more common in children under the age of 2 years following head trauma. A fracture of the calvarium (skull cap) is more common than one at the base of the skull.
