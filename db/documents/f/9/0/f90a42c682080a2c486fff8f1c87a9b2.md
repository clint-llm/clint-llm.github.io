Duodenal ulcers are part of a broader disease state categorized as peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcer disease refers to the clinical presentation and disease state that occurs when there is a disruption in the mucosal surface at the level of the stomach or first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. Anatomically, both the gastric and duodenal surfaces contain a defense system that includes pre-epithelial, epithelial, and subepithelial elements. Ulceration occurs from damage to the mucosal surface that extends beyond the superficial layer. While most duodenal ulcers present with dyspepsia as the primary associated symptom, the presentation can range in severity levels, including gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric outlet obstruction, perforation, or fistula development. Therefore, the management is highly dependent on the patient's presentation at the time of diagnosis or progression of the disease. The diagnosis of duodenal vs. gastric ulcer merits consideration in patients with dyspepsia/upper abdominal pain symptoms who also report a history of NSAID use or previous Helicobacter pylori diagnosis. Any patient diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease and, most specifically, the duodenal ulcer should undergo testing for H. pylori as this is a common cause.
