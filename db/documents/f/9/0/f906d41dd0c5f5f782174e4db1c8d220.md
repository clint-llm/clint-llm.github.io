Gorlin syndrome, also called Gorlin-Goltz syndrome, basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS), or nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome. It is characterized by numerous basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), along with skeletal, ophthalmologic, and neurologic abnormalities. Multiple neoplasms arise starting in childhood. This activity reviews the evaluation of patients with Gorlin Syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the genetic basis of Gorlin syndrome.
- Outline the pathophysiology of Gorlin syndrome.
- Summarize the expected history and physical findings expected in Gorlin syndrome.
- Explain the evaluation needed in patients with Gorlin Syndrome and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.
