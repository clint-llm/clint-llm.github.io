The adaptive (active) immune response takes 1 to 2 weeks to reach its full functioning capacity, much longer compared to the twelve hours required to activate the innate immunity completely. With the development of the adaptive immune response, comes a phenomenon called immunologic memory, an immune defense that can last a lifetime to provide future protection if re-exposed to the same antigen.

Active immunity can be achieved naturally or acquired through vaccines. An example of this is a child who becomes ill with chickenpox or varicella-zoster infection. During this illness, the child’s immune system will mount a specific response to the virus, and the child will have immunity moving forward. This process is a natural, active immune response. An example of acquired immunity against varicella is through vaccination with the live attenuated varicella vaccine. With this method, the individual has never actually had an infection with the organism.
