Calcium is vital for many body functions like cell function, nerve transmission, bone structure, intracellular signaling, and blood coagulation. The amount of calcium absorbed from the GI tract is usually matched with renal excretion. The levels of calcium are rigidly controlled by vitamin D, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and FGF23. Parathyroid hormone enhances osteoclastic bone resorption and distal tubular reabsorption of calcium. PTH also stimulates the hydroxylation of 25 hydroxyvitamin D to the active form 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D and renal excretion of phosphate. Vitamin D stimulates intestinal absorption of calcium, renal absorption of calcium and phosphate, and also bone reabsorption. Calcitonin, on the other hand, lowers levels of calcium by inhibiting osteoclast activity. FGF23 inhibits the conversion of vitamin D to its active form, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D, thus reducing intestinal calcium absorption. Acid-base disturbances alter the binding capacity of calcium to albumin and affect the exchange of calcium and hydrogen ions between the intracellular and extracellular space. Acidosis reduces, and alkalosis increases the binding of calcium to albumin, causing increased or decreased levels of ionized calcium, respectively. An alkaline environment lowers ionized calcium levels by exchanging calcium for hydrogen ions, while an acidic environment increases ionized calcium levels by exchanging hydrogen ions for calcium.
