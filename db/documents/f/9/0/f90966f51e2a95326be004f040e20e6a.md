With uncomplicated arthropod bites or stings resulting in minor localized reactions, no laboratory or imaging evaluation is indicated. However, additional studies may be necessary in cases of arthropod envenomation, secondary infection, or if a vector-borne disease is suspected.

Anaphylaxis is a clinical diagnosis and must be treated emergently with epinephrine.

Severe envenomations may cause multi-organ dysfunctionÂ and require lab studies such as a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function, coagulation, creatine kinase, and urinalysis. An EKG should be included in the evaluation of suspected Lyme disease or the presence of arrhythmias. Thick and thin blood smears may be helpful in the evaluation of suspected malaria or early Chagas disease. Serological tests for arthropod-borne diseases may be required based on clinical presentation and specific arthropod exposure. Diseases associated with specific arthropods include

- Ticks: Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, relapsing fever, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, tularemia

- Flies: tularemia, leishmaniasis, African trypanosomiasis, bartonellosis, loiasis

- Fleas: plague, tularemia, murine typhus

- Chigger mites: scrub typhus (predominantly Asia, not in the US)

- Body lice: epidemic typhus, relapsing fever

- Kissing bugs: Chagas disease

- Mosquitoes: malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, West Nile virus, equine encephalitis, chikungunya, Zika virus
