No prostate-specific antigen value guarantees the presence or absence of prostate cancer. While controversial, nonspecific, and imperfect, PSA testing is currently still the best and most sensitive early indicator of an asymptomatic prostatic malignancy. The decision to screen healthy individuals utilizing the test will likely continue to be controversial. Individuals between the ages of 45 and 75 years should be given the opportunity to be tested following a conversation regarding the risks and benefits of screening, with particular consideration given to patient preference, age, comorbidities, and family history. Following the decision to screen, PSA values will be instrumental in determining the next steps in treatment. It is generally accepted that low PSA values in asymptomatic individuals are reassuring, and significantly elevated PSA values are concerning for prostate cancer. Some of the negative aspects of screening can be minimized by risk stratification strategies and a recognition that it is easy to recommend overtreatment of low-risk disease. All healthcare team members should be aware of the controversies involved and be prepared to assist the patient in the decision-making process.

There is no controversy regarding the utility of PSA testing in patients with known malignant disease. The entire team should encourage patients to be involved in their healthcare decisions and to obtain follow-up PSA tests according to physician recommendations and published guidelines; this will ensure optimal outcomes.
