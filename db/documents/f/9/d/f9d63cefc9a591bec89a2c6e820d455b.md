Most acute kidney injury cases recover entirely with supportive management; however, the prognosis mostly depends on the etiology of AKI and the presence or absence of antecedent kidney disease or declined eGFR. Most pre-renal AKI cases recover completely with correction of the underlying insult if caught early; however, the persistence of underlying insult may lead to acute tubular necrosis, in which case the damage may not be completely reversible. The other consideration to keep in mind is that although recovery from individual episodes may be complete or partial, repeated AKI can lead to a cumulative worsening of renal function. Therefore, it is essential to follow these patients either to the normalization of renal function or until it can be decided that this will be their new baseline renal function. The in-hospital mortality rate for AKI is 40-50%, and the mortality for ICU patients is more than 50%. Other prognostic factors include:

- Older age

- Duration of illness

- Fluid balance

- Diuretic use

- The decline in urine output

- Hypotension

- Inotropic support

- Multiorgan involvement

- Sepsis

- Number of transfusions
