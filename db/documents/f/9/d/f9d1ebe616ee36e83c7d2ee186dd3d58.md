Platelets are transfused at the bedside through intravenous tubing with an in-line filter (screen filter of 170-260 micrometer pore size) to remove fibrin clots and large debris. The tubing can be primed with normal saline or blood product itself.

Emergency equipment such as 0.9% normal saline, oxygen source, and emergency medication to treat anaphylaxis should be available at hand in case of transfusion reaction.
