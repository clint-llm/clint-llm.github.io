Rheumatic fever is the primary cause of acquired heart disease in children and young adults worldwide. Rheumatic fever occurs 2 to 3 weeks after a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngeal infection.

Carditis is the most serious presentation of rheumatic fever. The symptoms and signs of carditis are dependent on the areas of the heart involved, which include the pericardium, myocardium, or heart valves. The presentation of a pericardial friction rub on auscultation leans toward the diagnosis of pericarditis. The presence of signs of congestive heart failure points toward a diagnosis of myocarditis, which includes but is not limited to lower extremity edema, shortness of breath with exertion or rest, abdominal distension, or inability to lay flat due to shortness of breath (orthopnea). Myocarditis in the absence of valvular disease is unlikely to be rheumatic in origin. Therefore, an apical systolic or basal diastolic murmur should be auscultated on physical exam. Mitral regurgitation is the most common valvular lesion, which is an apical pan-systolic murmur on auscultation.
