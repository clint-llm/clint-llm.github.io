Basic laboratory findings include peripheral leukocytosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) usually reports neutrophilic pleocytosis and absent hypoglycorrhachia.

Radiologic findings usually involve basal ganglia, thalami, and cerebral cortex. Neuroimage, specifically brain MRI T2/FLAIR can report a pattern of focal lesions (also described in children) without significant edema as opposed to common autopsy findings, which include severe edema, peaking around day 12 in 60% of the patients with encephalitis. In children, the predominantly affected area seems to be the cortex.
