The management of a diabetic ulcer is very difficult and is best done with a team that includes an endocrinologist, surgeon, wound care nurse, internist, physical therapist, vascular surgeon, an infectious disease expert, and dietitian. Besides ensuring that glucose levels are controlled, one has to ensure that the tissue has an adequate blood supply. All diabetics should be urged to stop smoking and resume an exercise program. Close follow up is required by an interprofessionalÂ team as these ulcers can rapidly lead to necrosis and loss of a digit or a limb. Diabetic ulcers and wounds should be evaluated by a standardized and evidence-based approach. Well established communication and coordination among the health providers can significantly decrease complications such as amputation.
