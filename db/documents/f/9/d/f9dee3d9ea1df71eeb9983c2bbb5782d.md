Gonococcal conjunctivitis (GC), also known as gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum when it occurs in neonates, is an infection that is transmitted by contact of the eyes with infected genital secretions from a person with genital gonorrhea infection. Physical exam findings in patients may reveal conjunctival chemosis, discharge, tenderness of the globe, edema of eyelids, and preauricular lymphadenopathy. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of gonococcal conjunctivitis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of gonococcal conjunctivitis.
- Review the importance of culture on Thayer-Martin media for the evaluation of gonococcal conjunctivitis.
- Outline the appropriate antibiotics used for the treatment of gonococcal conjunctivitis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by gonococcal conjunctivitis.
