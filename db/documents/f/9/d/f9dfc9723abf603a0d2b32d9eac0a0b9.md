The prognosis for mercury exposure is highly variable but is dependent on the level of exposure. Significant exposures can lead to coma and death. Minor symptoms may resolve over time. Neurologic symptoms which can be delayed in the presentation may persist for decades. Fetus and children are highly susceptible and can lead to death, permanent neurologic deficits, or mental retardation.
