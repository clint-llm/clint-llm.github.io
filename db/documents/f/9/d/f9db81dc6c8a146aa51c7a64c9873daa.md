Pernio is mostly thought to be idiopathic; however, while several forms of secondary pernio exist, they are incredibly rare, and the direct association has not clinically correlated with extensive studies due to the rarity. The most common form of secondary pernio is the association with systemic lupus erythematosus and the subsequent development of chilblain lupus erythematosus (CHLE).

Of note, research has found pernio as the presenting symptom of a blast crisis inÂ patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
