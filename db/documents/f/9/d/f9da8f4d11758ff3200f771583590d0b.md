- The most common reported neurological complication after lumbosacral spondylolisthesis surgery is L5 nerve root dysfunction. It is most frequently associated with high-grade slips and attempts of slip reduction as well as foraminal stenosis decompression.

In their cadaveric study, Petraco et al. found out that 71% of total nerve strain occurs during the second half of the reduction.

- Pseudoarthrosis

- Dural tear

- Adjacent segment disease (2 to 3%)

- Surgical site infection (0.1 to 2%)

- Positioning neuropathy: Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve - from a prone position with iliac bolster, ulnar nerve, or brachial plexopathy with inappropriate arm position)
