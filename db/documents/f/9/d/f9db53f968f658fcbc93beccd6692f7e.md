Depressive cognitive disorders, also called pseudodementia (a term founded by Kiloh in the year 1961), is defined as the cognitive and functional impairment imitating neurodegenerative disorders caused secondary to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Depression with cognitive impairment was given less significance in the past. Though the current practice has given heightening attention to these disorders, as it has been found that the cognitive symptoms associated with depression persist, as residual symptoms (in addition to mood symptoms), and in some cases transform into true neurocognitive dementia over time, these cognitive distortions considerably affect the functioning and increase the risk of recurrence of a depressive disorder in the patients. This activity will review the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pseudodementia medical conditions and emergencies.
- Review the evaluation of pseudodementia.
- Outline the management options available for pseudodementia.
- Describe how interprofessional teams can improve communication and care of patients with pseudodementia.
