Tick paralysis is an uncommon, noninfectious, neurologic syndrome characterized by acute ataxia that progresses to ascending paralysis. It is caused by the salivary neurotoxin of several species of tick. Clinical findings are similar to and often confused with Guillain-Barre syndrome. Most human cases of tick paralysis occur in North America and Australia. If recognized early and treated promptly, complete recovery is expected with tick removal and supportive care alone. However, untreated, it can advance to respiratory failure and death. It is important for healthcare workers to be familiar with this relatively rare but readily treatable cause of acute motor weakness and to maintain a high index of suspicion to avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment. Tick paralysis should be considered in all cases of acute ataxia, especially in children. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tick paralysis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review when tick paralysis should be considered on differential diagnosis. 
- Summarize the evaluation of a patient with suspected tick paralysis. 
- Explain the management of a patient with tick paralysis. 
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of tick paralysis.
