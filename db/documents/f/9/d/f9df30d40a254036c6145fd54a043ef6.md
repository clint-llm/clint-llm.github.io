Both microbiological culture and nucleic acid amplification assays can be used to detect the organisms. Blood culture vials (BCV) and other solid media like blood agar permit the growth of the organism, although with inconsistent findings. The bacteria can be cultured from the skeletal system specimens, blood, and respiratory cultures. Â The nucleic acid amplification assays are now in use in advanced countries. It is faster and has higher sensitivity than blood cultures.

Additional workups should include complete blood counts, C- reactive protein (CRP) levels, and radiological investigations as appropriate.
