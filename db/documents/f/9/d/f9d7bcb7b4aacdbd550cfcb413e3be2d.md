The etiology of health care disparities in AIAN includes both policy issues and personal factors. The personal demographic differences in the community (compared to the NHW population) coupled with the policy failure that plagued the health care services for centuries have certainly added to the disparities in healthcare.

**Policy Failures**

- The federal government's initial commitment to provide healthcare to the AIAN community was through a series of treaties. For example, at least 367 treaties were signed between the federal government and the tribes between 1778 and 1868.

- In the 19th century and early 20th-century, several policies were introduced to improve the living standards of the AIAN community's welfare. However, most of these policies were either misguided or were outright attempts to diminish the sovereignty of the indigenous tribes- For example, the New Deal (Launched during the Great Depression), the Termination era (federal attempt at terminating its responsibility toward the AIAN community), and the relocation policies (relocating returning soldiers to urban areas to achieve a better economic status)- led to the increased burden of healthcare in the AIAN community.

**Demographic Differences**

The stark prevalence of poverty, lack of education, and higher unemployment rates in the AIAN community also add to healthcare disparity.

- Poverty and unemployment:

- According to the 2018 US Census, 25.4% of the AIAN population lived in poverty, the highest amongst all ethnicities.
- The median household income for AIAN is $45,448, as compared to $65,845 for NHW households. 30.5 percent of AIAN of the age 16 and over; work in management and professional occupations, compared to 42.9 percent of NHW. Also, 21.9 percent of this racial group live at the poverty level compared to 9.6 percent of NHW in 2017. The scarcity of employment puts pressure on the communities to seek hazardous employment that increases injury and death.
- According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics data, in 2018, the unemployment rate was higher than the national rate (3.9%) for the AIAN community (6.6 percent).
- AIAN are more likely to live in so-called food deserts, which is a major factor contributing to the high rates of diabetes, obesity, and heart disease in the community. For example, in the Navajo Nation, the second biggest tribe in North America, there are 13 grocery stores and 12 medical facilities scattered across more 27 000 square miles of land. One in three inhabitants does not have access to electricity, and one in three does not have access to running water.

- Literacy levels:

- The differences in literacy levels are apparent in the most recent census. In 2017, 83.8 percent of AIAN alone or in combination had at least a high school diploma. In comparison to this, 92.9 percent of NHW had received at least a high school diploma. 19.6 percent of AIAN age 25 and over had at least a bachelor's degree, compared to 35.8 percent of NHW. 6.8 percent of AIAN held an advanced graduate or professional degree than 13.8 percent of the NHW population.

**Mistrust in the Federal System**

- One of the principal reasons for healthcare disparities in the AIAN population is the community's mistrust in the federally supported clinics. The long history of trauma, ethnocide, and genocide has left a deep void in the minds of the AIAN community that is hard to fill.

- Although the situation started to change after the passing of the Snyder Act in 1921 and the establishment of Indian health Services in 1955, there were still periods when federal policies led to discrimination of the AIAN community. For example, the period between 1946 and 1964 was called the 'Termination era' when the federal government attempted to end its trust relationship with AIAN nations. Congress adopted the House Concurrent Resolution 108 (HCR 108) on August 1, 1953, which was designed to terminate the sovereignty of the tribal nations and impose on the federal authority. During the Termination period, 109 tribes were terminated, 12,000 tribes lost affiliations, and approximately 2.5 million acres of tribal land were taken away from the tribes.

- The social injustice continued even after the establishment of IHS. Multiple instances of social injustices (like forced sterilization, unethical research, and clinical misconduct in the name of research) have come forth that explain the mistrust of the AIAN community in the federal health services.Havasupai Tribe v Arizona State University Board of Regents and Tilousi v Arizona State University Board of Regents mark misrepresentation of research projects in the AIAN community.

**Underfunding of the Indian Health Services**

The IHS suffers from chronic underfunding. For example, between 1993 and 1998, although the appropriations of IHS increased by 8%, medical inflation jumped by 20.6%. When adjusted for the growth in the AIAN population, per-capita appropriations decreased by 18% for this period. A level of need-funded (LNF) workgroup created in 1998 reported that the AIAN community's funding falls short by 46% compared with Federal Employee Health Benefits.

Federal funding is divided into discretionary funding and mandatory funding. As the name suggests, discretionary funding is at the discretion of Congress and the President. The funding for AIAN healthcare programs is under the category of discretionary funding. In comparison, Medicare funding comes under mandatory funding. A few illustrative examples of the gaps in the IHS funding are listed here:

- Between 1980 and 2002, the disparity between Medicare and IHS funding and spending is glaring.

- The growth in the per capita spending of IHS (4.8% per year) lags far behind the growth in per capita spending of Medicare (7.8% per year) and Medicaid (6.9% per year).
- The Medicare spending per person grew by $5200, IHS per person appropriations grew by only $1121.
- The gap in the IHS per capita spending and the Medicare per capita spending has widened between 1980 to 2002. The gap was 90% the size of IHS per capita spending in 1980, and the gap has increased to 250% by 2002. 
- In dollars per capita, the gap between IHS and Medicare widened from $569 to $4448. 
- Nothing has changed in 2017 either-According to a report by the National Congress of American Indians, in 2017, the IHS spent $3,332 per patient. In contrast, Medicare spent $12,829 per patient that year, and Medicaid spent $7,789 per patient.

- The salaries paid to physicians and allied health workers working for AIAN have never equaled the national average:

- The Commissioner of Indian Affairs annual report in 1890 stated that clinicians working in the AIAN communities were paid almost a third of the salary ($1028) compared to the army ($2983) and navy clinicians ($2622).

The above examples demonstrate the lack of resources that have plagued the Indian healthcare services. Although many governments have taken steps to increase the funding for IHS, it remains an underfunded organization.
