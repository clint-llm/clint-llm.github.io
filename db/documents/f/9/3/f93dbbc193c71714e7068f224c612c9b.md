The clinical significance of TPK lies in eliminating the infection and providing good anatomical and functional outcomes to the patient. TPK is a boon for patients suffering from severe microbial keratitis and changes the quality of life of the patients. It is an essential surgical procedure in the surgeon's armamentarium for patients' ocular rehabilitation, especially in the developing world.

TPK plays a crucial role when globe integrity is compromised, and preoperative and postoperative antimicrobial therapy is crucial in these cases. A large-sized graft is mandatory in cases where the infiltrate size is larger. TPK with a suitable donor graft can restore visual function and may also obviate the need for second-stage optical keratoplasty.
