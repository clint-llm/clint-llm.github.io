The University of Utah Health Sciences Center undertook a retrospective review of bleeding complications in kidney biopsy five months before and after discontinuation of the bleeding time test. There were no statistically significant differences in post-procedural complications, DDAVP administration, or transfusions between the two groups. Additionally, the clinicians surveyed did not alter their workup and treatment of these patients.
