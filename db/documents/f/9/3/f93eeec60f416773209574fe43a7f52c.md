# Introduction

Chest wall deformities are a set of congenital diseases that span a broad spectrum of disorders. These can manifest as isolated conditions or can correlate with extra-thoracic anomalies and genetic syndromes. Deleterious effects can occur from birth to adolescence, ranging from life-threatening conditions to psychosocial cosmetic concerns. The cornerstone of treatment lies with medical management, surgical repair, and genetic counseling. From a surgical standpoint, repair options are extensive and complex; therefore, a patient’s age and gender, as well as surgical timing and choice of prosthetic materials and grafts, are some factors that play a role in the decision-making process. This activity aims to review the most common chest wall deformities from a general thoracic surgery standpoint. The disorders described below are pectus excavatum, pectus carinatum, sternal clefts, ectopia cordis, and the syndromes of Poland, Jeune, and Jarcho-Levin.

# Etiology

**Pectus Excavatum**

Exact etiology is unknown. The current hypothesis focuses on collagen metabolism impairment; this causes a sternal cartilage overgrowth that results in the sternocostal joint deformity (sternum protrusion). Pectus deformities are mostly isolated diseases; however, research has linked genetic mutation involvement. In inheritance scenarios, syndromic association highlights are; autosomal dominant (Marfan and Noonan syndromes), autosomal recessive (osteogenesis imperfecta I, III, IV types), and X-chromosomal inheritances with an underlying connective tissue strong association. Non-syndromic familiar inheritance highlight is autosomal dominant inheritance.

**Pectus Carinatum**

The same pectus excavatum etiology hypothesis has been proposed. However, a mutation in the COL2A1 gene (collagen type II encoding impairment) links to pectus carinatum deformity. The familiar genetic trigger association is the same as in pectus excavatum.

**Poland Syndrome**

Etiology is thought more to result from an in utero event than an inheritance situation, but familial cases should not be dismissed. The exact etiology remains undefined. The hypothesis with greater acceptance favors an intrauterine vascular insult that consists of embryonic blood supply interruption in subclavian or vertebral arteries, leading to different malformations (limb and chest wall). Another important proposed hypothesis is a lateral plate mesoderm development disruption. Lately, some research has related teratogenicity with drugs, misoprostol, and tobacco use during pregnancy.

**Sternal Clefts**

Sternal cleft etiology consists of ventral cell migration and sternal bands fusion failure in the sixth to the ninth gestational week. This embryonic developmental disorder carries an association with Hoxb gene mutations with dominance possibility.

**Ectopia Cordis**

Etiology is unknown. The deformity core is an embryonic VFM (ventral folding morphogenesis) impairment. Early chorionic and/or yolk sac rupture at third or four gestational weeks have been the most accepted hypothesis to explain this event. Lately, in genetic etiology pathways terms (gene mutation), BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2) expression impairment has been linked to VFM impairment. Genetic trigger association is unknown; however, it has links with major chromosomal anomalies (e.g., Turner syndrome, 18 trisomies). The genetic risk depends on the underlying syndrome association.

**Jeunes Syndrome**

The etiology is an autosomal recessive mutation on chromosome 7 genes, which encode proteins that participle in ITF (intraflagellar transport), specifically IFT80. However, lately, DYNC2H1 gene mutation, which encodes the dynein-2 protein complex (cilia structure component), has been reported as the main etiology core. Genetic risk is 25% (1 in 4), 50% 1 in 2), and 25% do not have the deformity.

**Jarcho-Levin Syndrome**

Etiology depends on the Jarcho Levin syndrome phenotypes. Spondylocostal dysostosis links to DLL3 and MESP2 gene mutations, which can be a dominant or recessive autosomal inheritance. Spondylothoracic dysostosis is an autosomal recessive inheritance without DLL3 gene mutation. PAX1 and/or PAX9 (family PAX genes) mutation also has been linked to Jarcho Levin syndrome. The genetic risk depends on positive genetic carriers.

# Epidemiology

**Pectus Excavatum**

This anomaly represents 90% of chest wall deformities; it is more common in the White race with an incidence of 1 per 400 live births and 5 to 1 male predominance. Pectus excavatum could present as isolated non-familiar deformity; however, familiar non-syndromic positive history is present in up to 40%, highlighting an autosomal dominant inheritance patron. Pectus excavatum deformity can be part of genetic syndromes. Noonan and Marfan are the most important associated syndromes identified by POSSUM (Pictures Of Standard Syndromes and Undiagnosed Malformations version 5.7) and WBDD (Winter-Baraitser Dysmorphology Database version 1.0.14). It is of paramount importance that Poland syndrome rib hypoplasia causes secondary pectus excavatum, which could need modified Ravitch procedure repair. Less than 1% of pectus excavatum cases have an underlying connective tissue disorder. Data shows that 80% of cases get diagnosed at two years of life. Mitral valve prolapse (17%), arrhythmias (15%), and congenital heart disease (2%) are the most important cardiac anomalies related.

**Pectus Carinatum**

Is the second most common chest-wall deformity (5 to 6 times less common than pectus excavatum), has an incidence of 0.06% of live births with a 4 to 1 male predominance. Pectus carinatum could present as an isolated disease with a 25% to 30% positive family history, or can be part of genetic syndromes. As pectus excavatum, Marfan and Noonan are the most prevalent associated syndromes. Cardiac anomalies association could exist. Thoracolumbar scoliosis is linked to an underlying connective disorder in 12% to 14% of cases. Chondrogladiolar type is more common (95%). Pectus carinatum may present at any age; however, patients generally request medical attention at puberty.

**Poland Syndrome**

The average incidence is 1 in 20000 to 1 in 30000 live births with male predominance between 2 to 1 and 3 to 1.

**Sternal Clefts**

Sternal clefts are the most common type of sternal defects and represent 0.15% of chest wall deformities.

**Ectopia Cordis**

It is an extremely rare chest-wall deformity with an estimated prevalence of 1 of 5.5 to 7.9 per million live births. Ectopia cordis types are thoracic (65% to 90%), thoracoabdominal (7% to 20%), and cervical (2.8 %). Ectopia cordis may occur as an isolated condition; however, it has a strong association with congenital heart diseases or other midline defects. Fallot tetralogy is the most common congenital cardiac defect. Thoracoabdominal ectopia cordis highlights include high indices of left ventricle diverticulum and Cantrell pentalogy association. Omphalocele is the most common abdominal defect associated with ectopia cordis.

**Jeunes Syndrome**

The incidence is 1 per 120000 live births. Most deaths occur in half to three-fourths of cases in the first two years of life. Skeletal chest wall growth arrest is the most serious complication core. Clavicle, limbs, pelvis, renal, hepatic, pancreatic are the main malformations that correlate with Jeune syndrome.

**Jarcho-Levin syndrome**

Epidemiological data are scarce. Spondylothoracic dysostosis incidence is unknown. It has an autosomal recessive inheritance patron linked to chromosome 2q32.1, without DLL3 gene mutation, it does not demonstrate gender predilection. Puerto Rican ancestry history is commonly positive. Most deaths (80 to 100%) occur in infancy; however, reports exist of mild phenotypes cases with a good prognosis.

# Pathophysiology

**Pectus Excavatum**

The sternocostal joint deformity causes an abnormal sternum depression that results in a decreased chest anteroposterior diameter. Compression severity is associated with cardiopulmonary impairment and paradoxical chest wall movement that causes dyspnea and pain, especially with physical activity. Other physiologic alterations may be present with a coexisting malformation (congenital heart diseases). Psychosocial issues are of paramount importance.

**Pectus Carinatum**

Impaired sternocostal cartilage collagen arrangement causes an abnormal sternum protrusion. Cardiopulmonary physiology impairment is not associated with this condition; however, respiratory symptoms are attributable to a fixed chest wall with augmented residual lung volumes.

The pathophysiological impact will depend on the expressed phenotype. Poland syndrome usually represents an aesthetic deformity. Organic impairment and associated anomalies are rare conditions; however, some chest wall anomalies and hand deformities could cause functionality impairment (superior limb motion, lung herniation, and flail chest). Therefore, in these scenarios, regardless of age, surgical repair is mandatory. Psychosocial cosmetic issues are of paramount importance, highlighting that these are more prevalent in adolescents females with asymmetric hypoplastic breasts.

**Sternal Clefts**

Sternal clefts cause mediastinum structures exposition with somatic covering. The physiological impairment will depend on the cleft type and anomalies associated, highlighting paradoxical respiration. However, the most physiopathologic impact can occur in the post-surgical stage due to cardiac compression.

Ectopia Cordis

VFM (Ventral folding morphogenesis) impairment causes ventral body wall closure failure; the common denominator effect is an ectopic heart outside the thoracic cavity through a sternal cleft. Thoracic ectopia cordis highlights are; rotated ectopic hearth without somatic covering. Thoracoabdominal ectopia cordis highlights are a non-rotated ectopic heart with a thin membranous or cutaneous layer covering and a coexisting abdominal wall defect. Cervical ectopia is an extremely rare and lethal condition, where the heart is cranially located. In general terms, the lack of cardiac protection at birth causes severe cardiopulmonary impairment. Congenital anomalies association has a strong negative impact on survival.

**Jeunes Syndrome**

The genetic mutation causes a costochondral dysplasia (short rib size). Ribs cannot extend anteriorly, resulting in anteroposterior and lateral thoracic diameters reduction (narrow chest). The highlights include alveolar hypoventilation and lung growth restriction. Respiratory impairment is progressive.

**Jarcho-Levin syndrome**

Mesodermal somite cells signaling induction for axial skeleton development is damaged (somite segmentation failure). Spondylothoracic dysostosis highlights are; All ribs symmetrical fusion at costovertebral union across the entire spine (classic crab aspect). This condition causes a restrictive thorax with progressive respiratory failure. Spondylocostal dysostosis highlights include symmetrical intrinsic ribs anomalies. These can be; bifid, wide, or fused ribs, resulting in progressive scoliosis that cause a restrictive thorax. Both phenotypes converging points include vertebral segmentation and restrictive thorax with progressive lung development arrest.

# History and Physical

**Pectus Excavatum**

This condition is diagnosable at birth but commonly remains unrecognized until early childhood or adolescence. The clinical picture is usually a tall, thin, healthy patient with only a visible pectus defect. Highlighting; type of morphology defect, spine alteration coexistence, pain along the sternal border, and lower ribs margin detection. Psychological distress from body image issues is of paramount importance.

**Pectus Carinatum**

Pectus carinatum assessment is similar to patients with pectus excavatum.

**Poland Syndrome**

Poland syndrome has a wide clinical findings constellation and can be detected during pregnancy or along from birth to adolescence. Physical examination highlights include limbs and torso symmetry and functionality evaluation, and sternal notch to the acromion, olecranon to ulnar styloid, and phalanges lengths measurements. The breast disease spectrum is of paramount importance.

**Sternal Clefts**

Sternal clefts detection can be made with prenatal sonography or at birth. Physical findings would vary depending on the type of cleft. Highlights are; the presence of a bulging skin in a partial cleft, and direct precordial pulse in a total cleft. Identify cardiopulmonary physiologic impairment and other associated anomalies are of paramount importance.

**Ectopia Cordis**

Prenatal evaluation is the recommended approach of ectopia cordis detection. Physical findings at pregnancy and birth highlights are an ectopic heart and associated anomalies coexistence.

**Jeunes Syndrome**

Detection is possible with a prenatal ultrasound examination. Lung area and CT / AC ratio (thoracic circumference / abdominal circumference) measurements are the most specific prenatal evaluation findings. Classic physical findings at birth are narrow chest with short limbs, brachydactyly, micromelia, elevated and fixed clavicles, and small pelvis with hypoplastic iliac bones.

**Jarcho-Levin syndrome**

Detection is possible with a prenatal ultrasound examination. Vertebral anomalies and spine Bifida are the suspicious prenatal evaluation findings (anecdotical). Physical findings highlights are short trunk dwarfism with vertebral and ribs deformities.

# Evaluation

**Pectus Excavatum**

Cardiopulmonary impairment correlates with the severity of defect or coexisting cardiac anomalies coexistence; therefore, pulmonary function tests, echocardiography, and radiological assessment are mandatory with special attention in exercise tolerance.

**Pectus Carinatum**

The same pectus excavatum workup must take place for pectus carinatum. Haller index in pectus carinatum doesn’t have a cutoff value, but in many series, the principal value of their patients is 1.9 and is associated with respiratory distress during exercise. Pectus morphology frequently classifies as symmetrical or asymmetrical chondrogladiolar or chondromanubrial defects, with the presence of normal or narrow thorax.

**Poland Syndrome**

Poland’s syndrome evaluation focuses on soft-tissue, skeletal, and upper extremity malformations, and always thinking in associated anomalies related to a specific phenotype (Right and left-sided, bilateral). TC (Computed tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and angiography with three-dimension reconstruction, cross-sectional, and sagittal views are the most useful imaging tools.

**Sternal Clefts**

The initial evaluation focuses on associated anomalies and life-threating conditions. If indicated, preoperative evaluation tools are; chest TC scan with intravenous contrast with 3-D reconstruction and chest magnetic resonance angiogram. Ophthalmological and cardiological evaluation, lung functional tests, neuro-radiologic imaging, and laryngotracheal-bronchoscopy is often required.

**Ectopia cordis**

Evaluation principles are similar to those of sternal clefts. In this specific condition, evaluation is focused on severity determination and grant neonatal vital support and protection to exposed structures.

**Jeunes Syndrome**

The initial evaluation is focused on respiratory distress support and carry out an extended investigation to detect organic anomalies coexistence. Evaluation tools highlights are; ophthalmoscopy, chest, and extremities radiology imaging (computerized tomography, magnetic resonance, X-rays), abdominal ultrasound, laryngoscopy, and bronchoscopy. If indicated, a preoperative workup is necessary.

**Jarcho-Levin syndrome**

The initial evaluation focuses on respiratory distress support and costovertebral anomalies (vertebrae segmentation and the ribs deformities morphology) identification with imaging test (computerized tomography, magnetic resonance, X-rays). Surgical treatment options are designated on a case-by-case basis. A genetic test is mandatory to inheritance patron determination.

# Treatment / Management

**Pectus Excavatum**

Surgery is indicated in diverse clinic scenarios. These scenarios include protrusion cardiopulmonary impairment, psycho-social stress issues, and Haller index over3.25 with or without cardiopulmonary symptomatology.

**Pectus Carinatum**

Surgical repair is indicated in thoracic pain, respiratory symptoms, psycho-social issues, and non-operative techniques failure.

**Poland Syndrome**

Surgical repair is indicated in psycho-social, and chest wall and/or functionality impairment. Timing and surgical options depend on age, gender, and functionality impairment severity, As a general principle, surgery is recommended after puberty. Surgical correction goals are; chest wall symmetry improvement, anterior axillary fold creation, and hand reconstruction if indicated.

**Sternal Clefts**

The surgical repair depends on the cleft severity and other anomalies association. Follow-up with observation has been recommended in asymptomatic patients with minor defects. Partial and complete clefts surgical goals are; mediastinum structures protection, improve respiratory dynamics, and provide a normal growth thorax development. As a general rule, surgical correction must take place in the neonatal period. The surgical technique is to perform sternal bars dissection with careful perichondrium and pericardium separation to avoid phrenic nerve injury. In partial clefts, perform a complete cleft with a wedge osteotomy in the intact sternum has been recommended to grant symmetrical sternum sides re-approximation. At over three months, the patient's thoracic skeletal structures are more rigid; therefore, a surgical approximation may cause thoracic compartment syndrome to approach this scenario, costal cartilage sliding-plasty, autologous tissue bridges, and prosthetic material protection has been utilized.

**Ectopia Cordis**

Provide vital support to the newborn is global management. There is no better surgical approach for ectopia cordis if it is possible; however, a multi-stage procedure is the recommendation. The first stage is focussed on immediate omphalocele closure if indicated and temporally heart soft tissue covering. Second stage surgery focuses on heart reduction into the thoracic cavity, cardiac defects repair, and chest wall reconstruction.

**Jeunes Syndrome**

Treatment directs towards aggressive respiratory support. Surgery is indicated in severe respiratory distress (thoracic insufficiency syndrome) instauration, and this commonly occurs between 8 and 18 months of age. Providing chest wall diameter augment is the surgical goal.

**Jarcho-Levin syndrome**

Treatment focuses on aggressive respiratory support. In spondylothoracic dysostosis, surgical repair has no benefit due to the deformity being limited to the spine's posterior aspect. In spondylocostal dysostosis phenotype, VEPTR surgical repair has been performed to grant thoracic spine augment, thus permitting expansion of the thoracic volume to allow lung development. Surgery is the recommendation when scoliosis and respiratory distress begins to progress (6 months of age).

# Differential Diagnosis

**Pectus deformities**

Marfan syndrome is the hallmark entity of differential diagnosis; however, all related syndromes to pectus deformities are part of differential diagnosis constellation.

**Poland Syndrome**

Differential diagnoses in Poland syndrome highlights include normal breast asymmetry in females, and Swayer-James syndrome and giant bulla in hyper-lucent hemithorax RX setting.

**Sternal Clefts**

The differential diagnosis depends on syndromic association constellation. Highlights are limb body wall complex, amniotic band syndrome, and Cantrell pentalogy.

**Ectopia Cordis**

Differential diagnosis highlights are; trisomy 18 and Turner syndrome.

**Jeunes Syndrome**

Differential diagnosis highlights are; Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome, short rib polydactyly syndrome (I-IV types), Barnes syndrome, and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.

**Jarcho-Levin syndrome**

Differential diagnosis highlights include spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Morquio syndrome, chondrodysplasia, Klippel-Feil syndrome, and short rib polydactyly syndrome.

# Prognosis

**Pectus Excavatum**

Surgical correction is achieved with open and MARPE surgery with satisfactory results (86% to 98.1%), from a functional standpoint, cardio-pulmonary fitness performance improve at 6 to 12 months after surgery.

**Pectus Carinatum**

Highlighting that minimally invasive surgery still needs more evidence support and acceptance, pectus carinatum surgical repair results are based on the modified Ravitch repair principles, therefore in several series, outcomes, and prognosis (esthetic satisfaction and symptomatology improvement) homogeneity results between both pectus deformities have been demonstrated. For bracing treatment, anatomical changes can be observed within 2 to 3 months of its use, bracing treatment duration is from 2 to 2.5 years; however, there are reports that the bracing device is poorly tolerated.

**Poland Syndrome**

Prognosis will depend on age, gender, phenotype severity, associated cancer if coexisting, and type of surgical reconstruction if indicated.

**Sternal Clefts**

Prognosis and outcomes will depend on defect phenotype, age, and associated anomalies. Superior sternal clefts commonly present as an isolated feature with an orthotropic hearth without significant intra-cardiac abnormalities, so they have a good prognosis. In general, a better prognosis is achievable with an appropriate surgical repair timing (neonatal period); however, survival will depend more on the associated anomalies than sternal cleft.

**Ectopia Cordis**

Ectopia cordis general prognosis is poor. Thoracic ectopia cordis, complex congenital cardiac defects, and Cantrell pentalogy have the poorest prognosis. Thoracoabdominal ectopia cordis has been reported with a better prognosis due to the non-malrotated ectopic heart.

**Jeunes Syndrome**

Generally, Jeune's syndrome prognosis is poor, and it has a reported mortality rate of 60 to 80%; however, some centers have reported up to a 50% chance of survival with surgery in mild cases. Survival prognosis may improve with age progression.

**Jarcho-Levin syndrome**

Prognosis will depend on phenotype. Spondylothoracic dysostosis generally is considered a lethal condition and surgery has no benefit; however, in some cases series, mild forms have been reported with up to 56% survival with aggressive medical treatment focused on respiratory function.

# Complications

**Pectus Excavatum**

Complications related to any thoracic surgery such; bleeding, surgical site infections, seroma, pneumothorax, and other pulmonary issues are equally in open and MARPE surgery. In the NSQIP database, the Nuss procedure morbidity rate complications are of 3.8%. Pectus excavatum recurrence (2 to 37%) is higher due to open surgery resulting from perichondrium surgical disruption, highlighting acquired asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy development in patients under four years old. Underlying connective tissue disease and too early bar removal have been linked to pectus recurrence too. The highlight complication associated with MARPE is bar displacement (5.7 to 12%).

**Pectus Carinatum**

Complications are the same as the modified Ravitch procedure for pectus excavatum; however, it is important to highlight that the recurrence rates are reduced by making less costal cartilage resection with intact growth centers. Bracing treatment recurrence risk is 5 to 15%. Bracing complications highlight is the device's poor tolerance.

**Poland Syndrome**

Complications will depend on phenotype, associated anomalies, and surgical repair (case-by-case basis). Breast cancer risk in a female is a paramount highlight.

**Sternal Clefts**

Will depend more on the associated anomalies than sternal cleft; however, post-surgical complications are of special interest, bein post-surgical repair cardiac compression the most life-threatening complication.

**Ectopia Cordis**

Infection, cardiac failure, and hypoxemia have been reported as the most common causes of death.

**Jeunes Syndrome**

The main cause of death is respiratory failure. Terminal kidney disease can develop in 30% of cases. Associated anomalies highlights are; Liver, pancreatic, and retinal anomalies. The most frequently reported deaths are during the first year of life, while the older the child, the lower the risks.

**Jarcho-Levin syndrome**

Respiratory complications, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension are the leading causes of death.

# Postoperative and Rehabilitation Care

**Pectus Excavatum**

General postoperative care as; pain control, wound/drainage-care, and possible complications vigilance are equal in both surgical techniques. Respiratory exercises with a spirometer is a paramount highlight. Some postoperative care differences exist between open and MARPE surgery. In open surgery, an early regular walk is encouraged, while in MARPE, short interval steps with gradually increasing are recommended, paying special attention that Nuss bar twisting does not occur. Patients get discharged at 3 to 5 postoperative days. Muscle weakness (thorax, limbs, abdomen) and poor posture are a constant feature in pectus deformities and correlate with enhanced deformity recurrence or causing a wrong esthetic post-surgical result perception; therefore physical rehabilitation program is mandatory.

**Pectus Carinatum**

Postoperative management is the same as pectus excavatum open surgery. Specific pectus carinatum post-surgical care highlights are; spirometer using, start lightweights lifting at three weeks, start a gym at five months, and if utilizing a metal strut, it is removable at four months.

**Jeunes Syndrome**

Devries published a follow-up protocol in which the frequency of clinical vigilance and realization of para-clinic studies depends on the patient's age.

**Poland Syndrome, Sternal Clefts,**Ectopia Cordis,**and**Jarcho-Levin syndrome****

Postoperative and rehabilitation care is determined case by case basis.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Chest wall deformities are unpopular diseases for the general population due to their low incidence. Patients' education global approach should focus on genetic conditions due to the syndromic environment of these diseases; therefore, genetic counseling is of paramount importance for all patients and families so that the genetic risks of chest wall deformities can be made clear. From a specific disease standpoint, patient education is determined on a case-by-case basis with special attention on disease prognosis and post-operative rehabilitation if indicated.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Chest wall deformities are a broad set of congenital diseases that can present with different phenotypes and clinical manifestations, ranging from life-threatening conditions to psychosocial cosmetic concerns, with medical assistance searching interval from prenatal to adulthood for these reasons chest wall deformities workup and management is a difficult task that needs an interprofessional team. Medical genetics, maternal-fetal medicine, neonatologist, pediatric, and neonatal intensive care, pediatric surgery, cardiothoracic surgery, plastic surgery, orthopedic surgery, and psychology are the specialties involved in the management of chest wall deformities. Due to the low incidence, level 1 evidence is lacking for these diseases. Meta-analysis for pectus deformities are available, they are focused on differences between Nuss procedure and modified Ravitch procedure with level III evidence.
