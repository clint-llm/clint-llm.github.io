Sodium is important to maintainÂ extracellular fluid (ECF) volume. Changes in the ECF volume provide feedback to maintain total sodium content by increasing or decreasing sodium excretion in the urine. Sodium excretion also involves regulatory mechanisms such as the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems. When serum sodium increases, the plasma osmolality increases which triggers the thirst response and ADH secretion, leading to renal water conservation and concentrated urine.
