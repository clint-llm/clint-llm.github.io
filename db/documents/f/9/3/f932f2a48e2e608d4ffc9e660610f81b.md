Stages 1 to 3 are characterized as localized, and stage 4 is advanced disease. The treatment for localized disease is surgery with curative intent. Radical nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy is preferred depending upon the extent of the disease, patient's comorbidities, and underlying renal function. Cryotherapy and radiofrequency ablation are reserved for unresectable or nonsurgical candidates presenting with a small renal mass. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib and pazopanib) are used in metastatic ccRCC as they act by inhibiting VEGFR. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR inhibitors) everolimus and temsirolimus have been approved for metastatic ccRCC.
