The heart and its venous vasculature engage in autonomic innervation. Located in the brainstem, the medulla plays a significant role in regulating the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves to the heart and its blood vessels. In the sympathetic division, the sympathetic nerves exit the medulla and synapse with preganglionic fibers in the upper thoracic spinal cord. The preganglionic fibers then synapse with postganglionic fibers in the sympathetic ganglia, where the postganglionic nerves finally travel to and synapse with the target sites in the heart and coronary veins.
