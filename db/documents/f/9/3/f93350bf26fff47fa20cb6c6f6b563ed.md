Supportive care is usually all that is required for the treatment of anticholinergic toxicity. The most difficult therapeutic challenge is treating the agitation that can be severe in patients with anticholinergic toxicity. Benzodiazepines administered intravenously should be the first-line therapy for agitation. This may require large doses but is necessary to avoid making symptoms such as hyperthermia and rhabdomyolysis worse. Physostigmine may be indicated in severe cases refractory to benzodiazepines.

Physostigmine is usually only given in the case of both peripheral and central signs and symptoms of anticholinergic poisoning.

Alternatives to physostigmine are rivastigmine and pyridostigmine. Rivastigmine is only available in oral and transdermal formulations. Pyridostigmine is available in an oral and intravenous formulations. Neither has FDA approval for this indication.
