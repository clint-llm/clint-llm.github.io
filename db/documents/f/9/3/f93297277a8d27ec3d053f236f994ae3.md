Angioid streaks are usually asymptomatic and do not need any treatment.

However, these eyes are more prone to develop subretinal hemorrhage after trivial trauma, and protective eyewear should be used.

All patients with angioid streaks should be screened for potential systemic associations. Examination of family members may give clue to the systemic disease.

In cases with subretinal hemorrhage, a fundus fluorescein angiogram should be performed to rule out CNV. If CNV is absent, the hemorrhage usually resolves on its own.

If CNV is detected, the management options include laser photocoagulation, photodynamic therapy (PDT), transpupillary thermotherapy (TTT), macular translocation surgery, and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents. Recurrence of CNV causing vision loss is a concern in the angioid streak.

Among anti-VEGF agents, ranibizumab, aflibercept, and bevacizumab (off-label) have been used with success and may improve or stabilize the visual acuity.  All anti-VEGF agents seem to have efficacy against both macular and juxta-papillary CNV and may rapidly improve the retinal anatomy on OCT. Anti-VEGF agents may help stop the activity of CNV without the formation of a scar.
