Amoxicillin is a broad-spectrum beta-lactam antimicrobial originally derived from penicillin. It is a bactericidal agent that targets and kills bacteria by inhibiting the biosynthesis of the peptidoglycan layer of the bacterial cell wall. This layer makes up the outermost portion of the cell wall and is responsible for the structural integrity of the cell. Peptidoglycan synthesis involves the facilitation of DD-transpeptidases, which are a type of penicillin-binding protein (PBP).  Amoxicillin works by binding to these PBPs and inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis, which interrupts the construction of the cell wall and ultimately leads to the destruction, or lysis, of the bacteria.

Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactamase inhibitor often used in conjunction with amoxicillin to broaden its spectrum and combat resistance.  It has little to no antimicrobial activity of its own and instead works by preventing bacterial destruction of beta-lactams. Over the years, certain bacteria have evolved to develop resistance to standard beta-lactam antimicrobials through the production of enzymes called beta-lactamases.  These enzymes target and hydrolyze the beta-lactam ring, which is necessary for penicillin-like antimicrobials to work. Clavulanic acid prevents this degradation by binding and deactivating the beta-lactamases, thus restoring the antimicrobial effects of amoxicillin.
