The prevalence of HCM in the general population around the world is 0.2% (1 in 500 adults), determined from echocardiographic studies. The morphologic evidence is found in approximately 25% of first-degree relatives of patients with HCM. Newer genetic testing has been developed and can be used to identify asymptomatic family members with same sarcomere mutation. HCM is more common in males than females, however, since the condition is autosomal dominant, genetic inheritance does not follow sex predilection.Â The most common presentation is in the third decade of life but may be present at any age, from newborns to elderly patients.
