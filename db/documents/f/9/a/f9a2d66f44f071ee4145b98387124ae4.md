The principal postural abnormality is the arching of the back and extension of extremities. It occurs due to spastic, sustained dystonic contraction of spinal muscles leading to dorsal extension movement of the spine. There is a rigid backward extension of the head, neck, and trunk. This typical posture occurs due to the simultaneous mass contraction of agonist and antagonist muscle groups along with increased tone.

Symptoms associated with opisthotonos are representative of the causative disease. Fever may be present in tetanus and meningitis, while hydrophobia may be seen in rabies. Tachycardia, pupillary abnormalities, hyperhidrosis, cardiac arrhythmias, fluctuating blood pressure, respiratory abnormalities due to autonomic or muscular pathology can occur. Altered consciousness, vomiting, seizures are not uncommon. Patients may complain of pain or discomfort due to spastic contraction of muscles. Patients may develop fatigue due to multiple factors like poor oral intake, increased muscle activity, fever, and vomiting. Opisthotonus is difficult to be diagnosed in children as they are crying, restless or may develop intermittent contraction of muscle groups.
