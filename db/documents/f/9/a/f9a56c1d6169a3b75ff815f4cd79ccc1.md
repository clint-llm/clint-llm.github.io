There are not specifically true contraindications for breast reconstruction, presuming the patient is medically able to tolerate a general anesthetic for the duration of the chosen case.  However, there are risk factors that might make it unsafe or undesirable to pursue reconstruction.  Age is not a risk for these procedures. However, age over 65 is an increased risk for a hernia after abdominally based surgery and thrombosis.  Obesity with a BMI over 30 is associated with increased overall complications, donor site complications, partial flap loss and fat necrosis, and recipient site complications.  BMI over 40 is at high risk for flap failure and should prompt caution before performing the reconstruction.  ASA class III and increased operative times are also risk factors for complications.  Certain flaps are contraindicated on individual patients depending on their habitus and anatomy; for example, contraindications to DIEP include someone who has had a prior abdominoplasty.  Collagen vascular diseases and thrombotic diseases increase the risk of free flap failure.  Patients on chemotherapy and steroids have an increased risk of delayed wound healing.  It is contraindicated to do an elective free flap during pregnancy.

Radiation needs to be taken into consideration as well.  While autologous methods are the ideal reconstruction in patients who require post-mastectomy radiotherapy, radiating the flap can decrease the aesthetics and risk partial flap loss and fibrosis.
