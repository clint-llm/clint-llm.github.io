Thyrotoxicosis is the clinical state associated with excess thyroid hormone activity, usually due to inappropriately high-circulating thyroid hormones. The clinical presentation varies, ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening thyroid storm. Symptoms are due to the hypermetabolic state induced by excess thyroid hormones and include weight loss, heat intolerance, and palpitations. There are many different causes of thyrotoxicosis. It is important to determine the cause since treatment is based on the underlying etiology. Thyrotoxicosis can lead to serious complications when not diagnosed and treated appropriately, including delirium, altered mental status, osteoporosis, muscle weakness, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, thromboembolic disease, cardiovascular collapse, and death. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of thyrotoxicosis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of thyrotoxicosis.
- Describe the typical history and physical findings in a patient with thyrotoxicosis.
- Summarize the treatment considerations for thyrotoxicosis. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving coordination and communication to advance the management of thyrotoxicosis and improve outcomes.
