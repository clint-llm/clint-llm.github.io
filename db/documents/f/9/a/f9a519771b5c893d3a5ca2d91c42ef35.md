Under light microscopy, Meissner corpuscles appear as coiled, spring-like structures composed of stacked, disk-like lamellar cells. The orientation of the lamellae is variable, but they are typically parallel to the skin surface. The Schwann cell-derived lamellar cells have peripherally displaced nuclei and are contained within a fibroblastic capsule that is incomplete at its apex. The neurites that course through the lamellae are not visible by traditional hematoxylin and eosin staining techniques.
