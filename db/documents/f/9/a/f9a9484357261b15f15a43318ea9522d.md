Histologic diagnosis is performed almost exclusively in a post-mortem autopsy. Diagnostic biopsy in the antemortem patient is rare, and always as a casual finding.

Macroscopic histopathologic features in the corpus callosum (especially in the genu and the body) can consist of necrotizing or cystic lesions. Microscopically there can be white matter necrosis, abundant macrophages (with little inflammatory reaction), foamy histiocyte infiltration (marked by CD68 and CD163), small perivascular lymphocytes (mainly CD3-positive T-cells and incidental CD20-positive B cells), gliosis and prominent demyelination (with relative sparing of the axons) that can extend symmetrically into the centrum semiovale. Oligodendrocytes are reduced in number

Other anatomical sites affected by demyelination can be:

- Anterior and posterior commissures.

- Optic chiasm.

- Middle cerebral peduncles.

- Brachium pontis.

- Cortex (lesions supposed to be secondary to the callosal damage. May cause frontal-lobe syndromes and dementia).
