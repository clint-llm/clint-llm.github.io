While the OBGYN generalist is typically the first line contact for patients attempting conception, all healthcare team members must be aware of their potential to impact a patient's care. Pharmacists play a key role in advising patients regarding their medication choices and the long-term effects some therapies may have on fertility. Additionally, due to the significant potential emotional impact on patients, mental health professionals, as well as chaplains, it can be an immense support to patients dealing with infertility of any kind. A comprehensive, well-rounded health care team will provide important support and appropriate evaluation for the patient dealing with age-related fertility decline.
