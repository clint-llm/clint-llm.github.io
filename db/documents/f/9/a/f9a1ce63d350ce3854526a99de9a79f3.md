The dying cells undergo shrinkageÂ due to disruption of cell cytoskeleton of the cell, mainly caused by caspases. The cells become deeply eosinophilic. The cell shrinks away from its neighbors with loss of cell to cell contact. The nucleus of the dying cell becomes deeply basophilic.

The hallmark of apoptosis is pyknosis in which nuclear chromatin condenses to form one or more dark-staining masses against the nuclear envelope. There is a dissolution of the nuclear membrane, and endonuclease slices the DNA into short fragments that are regularly spaced in size (karyorrhexis). Next, this condensed cytoplasm and nucleus break into fragments called apoptotic bodies that bud off from the cell, as leaves falling from trees. Macrophages then remove these apoptotic bodies in a process named as efferocytosis. Cell membrane remains intact without inflammation, unlike necrosis, where cell swelling and inflammation are common. The apoptotic cells are removed quickly by the macrophages with little or no inflammation occurring in the surrounding tissues.
