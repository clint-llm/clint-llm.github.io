Open repair of femoral pseudoaneurysms requires no special post-op care above normal care of vascular patients, and the need for rehabilitation is largely predicated on the patient’s overall condition prior to intervention.

Endovascular repair of pseudoaneurysms is generally well-tolerated, and the patient should remain flat for 2 to 4 hours post-procedure with monitoring for the development of subsequent access site pseudoaneurysm.  Repairs that involve the deployment of stent/graft devices will require long term follow-up with a vascular surgeon for surveillance imaging.
