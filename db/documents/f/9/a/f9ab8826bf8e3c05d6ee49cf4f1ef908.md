The medial pterygoid muscle receives vascular supply from the maxillary artery through its pterygoid branches and by the facial artery through its muscular branches. The pterygoid branches of the maxillary artery are 2 or 3 in number. They run in an anterior and inferior direction to enter the medial aspect of the medial pterygoid muscle.

The literature describes as many as three different types of muscular branches of facial artery that supply the medial pterygoid muscle.

Sometimes, the medial pterygoid muscle may receive its vascular supply from a direct branch from the external carotid artery that enters the lower part of the muscle posteriorly about 2 cm above the gonion.
