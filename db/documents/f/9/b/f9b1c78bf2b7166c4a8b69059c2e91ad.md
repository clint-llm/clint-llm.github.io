Protein S deficiency is a rare disorder characterized by reduced activity of protein S, a plasma serine protease with complex roles in coagulation, inflammation, and apoptosis. Protein S is an anticoagulant protein discovered in Seattle, WA, in 1979 and was named after that city. Protein S facilitates the action of activated protein C (APC) on activated factor 5 (F5a) and activated factor 8 (F8a). A deficiency in protein S characteristically demonstrates the inability to control coagulation, resulting in the excessive formation of blood clots (thrombophilia) and venous thromboembolism (VTE). This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of protein S deficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of protein S deficiency.
- Outline the evaluation of protein S deficiency.
- Describe how to manage a patient with protein S deficiency.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients with protein S deficiency.
