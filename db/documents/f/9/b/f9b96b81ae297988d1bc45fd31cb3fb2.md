Calf muscle injuries occur commonly in poorly conditioned, middle-aged male athletes. They are common in sports involving explosive lower extremity movements such as football, basketball, tennis, and soccer. They are more common in athletes that are not warmed up adequately or are fatigued. Most injuries occur at the musculotendinous junction of the medial head of the gastrocnemius or the aponeurosis between the medial gastrocnemius and the soleus muscles. A smaller proportion of injuries occur at the lateral head of the gastrocnemius.

Different sports can have a higher predilection for specific calf injuries. An Australian rules football league found that the soleus injury was more prevalent than a gastrocnemius injury, 62% to 24%, respectively. However, a study of US football players found a higher percentage of injuries involving the gastrocnemius (74%), versus the soleus (15%).

Other risks associated with calf injury include a prior history of posterior calf strains and older age. A history of lumbar L5 radiculopathy also correlates with an increased risk of gastrocnemius strain among older soccer players.
