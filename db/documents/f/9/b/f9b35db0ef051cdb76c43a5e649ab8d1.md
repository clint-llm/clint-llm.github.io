Laboratory studies demonstrated hypokalemia (2.5 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (7.7 mg/dL), hyperglycemia (285 mg/dL) and an anion gap metabolic acidosis, gap 20 mmol/L, pH 7.24, lactate 9.2 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 16.7 mmol/L. Initial values for blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, creatine kinase, and myoglobin were normal.  Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed tachycardia and non-specific ST-depression anteriorly, elevation in aVR, and prolonged QTc interval without QRS widening.

Supportive measures we used included placing the patient on a propofol infusion for sedation and seizure control; however, this was held secondary to hypotension. Physicians transitioned the patient to a midazolam infusion which provided good seizure control but did not provide enough sedation. Dexmedetomidine infusion was added and provided appropriate sedation. The patient’s hypokalemia was corrected with intravenous potassium. His hypotension, hyperglycemia, and lactic acidosis improved with intravenous normal saline. The patient was initially placed on an esmolol infusion which improved his tachycardia but was subsequently held secondary to hypotension. There was also a concern for possible aspiration pneumonia from vomiting en route to the hospital, and the patient was started on ampicillin/sulbactam.
