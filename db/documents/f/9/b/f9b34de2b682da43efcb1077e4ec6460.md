The lumbar vertebrae consist of the vertebral body, two pedicles, two transverses process, articular processes (two superiors and two inferiors), lamina, and spinous process. It can be divided into three functional components or columns. The vertebral body represents the anterior column. It is a large block of bone; its flat superior and inferior surfaces are dedicated to fulfilling the weight-bearing function of the vertebra. It is estimated to bear approximated 80% of the weight load. Next, the pedicles are attached to the posterosuperior aspect of the vertebral body and represent the middle column. It acts as a bridge, transmitting tension and bending forces from the posterior column to the anterior column hence contributing to the stability of the spine.

The posterior column refers to the transverse, the spinous, the lamina, and the posterior articular processes (zygapophyseal). The transverse and spinous processes are respectively lateral and medial processes which serve as attachment sites for the para-spinal muscles. The laminas are traditionally described as protective bones covering the neural contents of the vertebrae. They are short, broad, and extend from the spinous process to the posterior articular processes laterally where they become the pars interarticularis. The pars interarticularis divides the posterior articular processes into superior and inferior articular processes. The vertebra articulates with each other by an anterior intervertebral joint, mediated by the intervertebral disc and the posterior zygapophyseal joints. At this site, the lumbar zygapophyseal joints are formed by the articulation of the inferior articular processes of one lumbar vertebra with the superior articular processes of the next vertebra.

The orientation of the zygapophyseal at the lumbar level is critical to understanding the pathologic translation that occurs in traumatic spondylolisthesis. Anatomically, the anterior portions of the lumbar facets orient coronally (promoting side-bend forces). The posterior facets face sagittal and resist rotation and side-bend forces. This configuration depicts, on a transversal plane, a “C” or “J” shape whereas, from a posterior view, it appears as the straight surface. Broadly speaking, lumbar facet joints are arranged in the sagittal plane; in the meantime, the more sagittally-oriented the facet joints, the less they can resist forward slippage.

Numerous ligaments contribute to stabilizing the lumbar spine by restraining the free motion. We categorize them according to their function. Forward flexion is limited by ligament flavum, supra-spinous, infra-spinous, and posterior longitudinal ligaments. The extension is limited by the anterior longitudinal ligament, and contro-lateral flexion is limited by inter-transverse ligaments. Moreover, Ilio-lumbar ligaments provide additional resistance against anterior translation of L5 S1.

Additional stabilization of the lumbar spine is sustained by para-spinal muscles: erector spinae, psoas major, and quadratus lomborum.

Considering the above-mentioned anatomical environment, the incidence of traumatic lumbar spondylolisthesis suggests a high-velocity mechanism able to disrupt the musculo-ligamentous structures.
