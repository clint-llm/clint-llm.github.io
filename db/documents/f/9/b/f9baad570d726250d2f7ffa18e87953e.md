Surgery is rarely indicated for MCL injuries.

In one subset of patients, MCL tears with tibial-sided avulsions or bony avulsions require acute surgical repair.

Surgery is also indicated in patients with chronic valgus instability refractory to rigorous conservative treatment if the injury affects activities of daily living or inability to participate in athletic events. The primary goal is to repair the MCL; however, in cases where scarring or incomplete healing make the torn edges difficult to identify, grafts are used to reconstruct the ligament. Allografts are either Achilles or tibialis anterior tendon, and autografts include the semitendinosus tendon.

Post-repair, the knee is braced in extension for 2 to 4 weeks to allow healing. Rehabilitation begins with motion exercises and progresses to strengthening exercises at 6 weeks. The brace is removed at 6 to 8 weeks. Post-MCL reconstruction follows the same rehabilitation progression as post-cruciate reconstruction with an emphasis on achieving full extension of the knee.
