The cause of iron-deficiency anemia varies based on age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Iron deficiency may result from insufficient iron intake, decreased absorption, or blood loss. Iron-deficiency anemia is most often from blood loss, especially in older patients. It may also be seen with low dietary intake, increased systemic requirements for iron such as in pregnancy, and decreased iron absorption such as in celiac disease. In neonates, breastfeeding is protective against iron deficiency due to the higher bioavailability of iron in breast milk compared to cow's milk; iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia in young children on cow's milk. In developing countries, a parasitic infestation is also a significant cause of iron-deficiency anemia. Dietary sources of iron are green vegetables, red meat, and iron-fortified milk formulas.
