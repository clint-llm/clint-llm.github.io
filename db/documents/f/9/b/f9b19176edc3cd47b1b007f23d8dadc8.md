Reye syndrome is a rapidly progressing disease that may require invasive procedures early on to maintain hemodynamically stability and adequate respiratory function.  These may include placement of central venous access, airway intubation, and placement of a Foley catheter to monitor urine output. Additional specialized procedures such as liver biopsy and intracranial pressure monitoring may also be indicated.

Treatment of Reye syndrome is mainly supportive and requires close monitoring of multiple clinical parameters best accomplished in an intensive care unit setting. Aggressive treatment may be required to correct the following serum abnormalities:

- Hypoglycemia may be treated with dextrose-containing fluids (D50, D10, D5, etc) with a serum glucose goal of 100-120mg/dl.

- Acidosis may be treated with sodium bicarbonate (attention not to over correct or correct too rapidly) and ventilation management.

- Hyperammonemia may be treated with phenylacetate-sodium benzoate (Immunol) or sodium polystyrene sulfate (Kayexalate) but may require hemodialysis if level greater than 500mcg/dl.

- Coaguloathy may be treated (especially before invasive procedures or with clinically significant bleeding) using cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), or Vitamin K.

Measures to target treatment of increased ICP may include:

- Elevating the head of the bed to 30 degrees

- Control of fever to prevent increased cerebral metabolism and rigors

- ICP monitoring

- Lasix administration

- Careful fluid regulation to prevent overhydration

- Sedation and analgesia

- Mannitol or hypertonic saline

- Seizure treatment and subsequent prophylaxis
