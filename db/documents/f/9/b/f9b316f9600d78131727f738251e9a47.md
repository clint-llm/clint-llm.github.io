CRAO typically presents with sudden, painless, monocular vision loss that occurs over seconds. Patients may report anÂ antecedent transient visual loss (amaurosis fugax) and often have a history of atherosclerotic disease.

Patients with CRAO often present with monocular loss of light perception and an afferent pupillary defect. However, visual acuity can vary from loss of light perception to finger counting. Typically, intraocular pressures, anterior chamber exam, and extraocular eye movements are within normal limits. A thorough fundoscopic exam is crucial for accurate diagnosis of CRAO, and a dilated exam should be performed on any patient without contradictions to mydriatic medications who presents with symptoms concerning for CRAO. On fundoscopy, the retina will appear diffusely pale with a cherry red central spot. This spot results from the preserved choroidal circulation visible beneath the thin fovea. Narrowing, "boxcarring" or segmentation of the arterioles also may be appreciated. Rarely, arteriolar emboli may be visualized. Other conditions may present with a cherry red spot on fundoscopic exams (commotio retinae, Tay-Sachs, Niemann-Pick disease) but should be easy to differentiate based on clinical presentation.
