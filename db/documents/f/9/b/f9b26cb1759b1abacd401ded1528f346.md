It is important to avoid this the superior cervical ganglia during open anterior neck surgeries. When the superior cervical ganglia are damaged, Horner syndrome can develop. Horner syndrome comes from tension on the sympathetic trunk during anterior neck surgeries such as anterior cervical disc fusions. The tension causes damage to the fibers along the sympathetic trunk. More about Horner syndrome is described later in this activity.

Anterior surgical procedures to the neck area such as anterior cervical discectomies can cause a disruption of the blood supply to the superior cervical ganglia, causing ischemic damage to the ganglia. This ischemic damage can also cause symptoms similar to Horner syndrome.

To prevent damage to the sympathetic ganglia during an anterior approach to the cervical spine, it is always advisable to create longus colli gutter and then place the retractors within the same, thereby minimizing the risk of inadvertent injury to the ganglia that lie lateral to the muscle.
