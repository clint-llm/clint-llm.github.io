Timely identification of this condition is critical as it can additionally display significant extracutaneous abnormalities, including thrombocytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercalcemia. For the most definitive diagnosis, both clinical presentation and skin biopsy must be considered.

Del Pozzo-Maga√±a and Ho suggested guidelines for monitoring patients with SCFN. Once SCFN is diagnosed, serum levels of triglycerides, renal function tests, platelets, and glucose should be determined. In patients with normal values, only clinical follow-up is required. It is imperative to measure serum levels of ionized calcium in normocalcemic patients, it should be repeated weekly during the first month of life and then monthly until six months of age or after the resolution of skin lesions. Also, it is crucial to perform a renal ultrasound, especially in patients with hypercalcemia. When the initial imaging is normal, it can be repeated at three months of age or after the resolution of skin lesions.
