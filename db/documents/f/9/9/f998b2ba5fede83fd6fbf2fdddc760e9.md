Mucocele of the gallbladder is a condition caused by the prolonged blockage of the cystic duct, usually by an impacted gallstone. Another name for this condition is hydrops of the gallbladder. It is most often not identified before surgery but is an incidental finding at the time of either laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy. This diagnosis is made when the gallbladder is surgically decompressed, and clear mucus-like fluid has replaced the green or brown bile. Patients present with signs and symptoms of acute or chronic cholecystitis.
