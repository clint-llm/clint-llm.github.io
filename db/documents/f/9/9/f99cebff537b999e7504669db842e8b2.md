Alginate is one of the most frequently used materials in dentistry and is the impression material of choice when accurate detail reproduction is not paramount. Alginates can be used to create study casts, preliminary impressions, provisional crown or bridge impressions, opposing arch impressions, and fabricate orthodontic casts, sports mouth guards, occlusal splints, and bleaching trays.
