The most common cause of female infertility in the United States isÂ ovulatory dysfunction, in which a variety of hormonal factors interfere with the complex sequence of hormonal events required to trigger ovulation. Problems can occur at any point in this pathway (hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary) and can lead to failure to ovulate. The most common cause of chronic ovulatory dysfunction in the United States is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, or PCOS, which interferes with ovulation at multiple points.
