Maintenance of the patient's airway and adequate ventilation during upper respiratory tract surgery can be difficult due to the need to maintain an unobstructed view of the operative field. It is usually achieved using a smaller specialized (laser-resistant)Â ETT, jet ventilation devices, and intermittent or spontaneous ventilation techniques. The use of medical lasers is also complicated by the risk of surgical fire in an oxidizer-rich (oxygen, nitrous oxide) environment. Numerous recommendations exist, and comprehensive guidelines must be followed to minimize the risks inherent to these types of surgeries.
