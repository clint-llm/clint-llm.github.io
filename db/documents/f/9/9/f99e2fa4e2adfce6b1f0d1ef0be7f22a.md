Corneal topography, whether Placido based or slit scanning, or a combination of the two techniques, involves placing the patient's chin on the chin rest of the machine, asking the patient to focus on a fixation light, and capturing the image of the Placido mires and /or the slit beam by means of a camera and the machine automatically calculates the dioptric power across the corneal surface.

Different indices are incorporated in the various devices to enable the prediction of ectasias, such as the Rabinowitz indices or the Klyce Maeda indices.

The slit scanning devices such as Orbscan and the Schiempflug-based devices such as the Oculus pentacam have faster acquisition times which means lesser problems with the eye movement of patients during acquisition. The tear film has a major role to play in corneal topography maps.Â It is preferred to remove soft lenses a week before and rigid gas permeable lenses two weeks before doing corneal topography to avoid contact lens-induced warpage.
