The interprofessional approach andÂ multidisciplinary management are necessary for the treatment of breast cancer to increase optimal patient care and satisfaction and minimize risks and complications.

Collaboration and team spirit are necessary between the surgeon and the oncologist in order to establish an optimal clinical path for quality care because the skin incision must be revised by both teams so that the resection can be both with healthy margins and therefore oncological and as cosmetic as possible to satisfy the patients. Radiotherapists are also included in the care team because they must organize and plan the radiotherapy and chemotherapy sessions before breast reconstruction.
