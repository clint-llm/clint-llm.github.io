Swallowing requires precise coordination between many different nerves and muscles, and many problems can arise. As noted above, a common important clinical problem is dysphagia. The prevalence of dysphagia is around 50% in the very elderly and is also 50% in those with neurologic dysfunction. Many severe complications can arise from dysphagia, such as malnutritionÂ or pulmonary aspiration of food or saliva. The prevalence of dysphagia makes it a highly prioritized area of research.

The pharyngeal muscles also can be implicated in other processes such as sleep apnea. During sleep, these pharyngeal muscles may become hypotonic and are unable to prevent the collapse of the airway if increased airway resistance and/or narrowing are present from factors such as generalized hypotonia, obesity, macroglossia (large tongue), lingual tonsil hypertrophy, base of tongue masses, tonsillar hypertrophy, retrognathia (short jaw), pharyngeal masses, etc.).
