There are no reliable laboratory tests that can assess the extent of systemic ammonia toxicity. In patients with preserved liver function, serum ammonia levels do not correlate with the extent of external exposure and are of little diagnostic utility.

The following investigations are routine in patients presenting with exposure to ammonia:

- Complete blood count (CBC)

- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine

- Serum lactic acid levels

- Kidney function tests

- Serum electrolytes

- Prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR)

- Blood type and cross-matching

- Urine output monitoring

In patients with suspected respiratory injury:

- Pulse oximetry

- Cardiac monitoring

- Serial blood gases

- Chest radiography

- Pulmonary function tests (PFTs)

- Bronchoscopy in suspected severe acute inhalation

- Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan

In patients with suspected ingestion:

- Abdominal series to rule out perforation following ingestion

- Early endoscopy (within 12 hours) in patients with stridor, drooling, dysphagia, or significant oral burns. Endoscopy is a safe procedure for these patients.

In patients with suspected exposure to the eye:

- Slit-lamp examination with fluorescein staining

- Tonometry

- Conjunctival pH measurement
