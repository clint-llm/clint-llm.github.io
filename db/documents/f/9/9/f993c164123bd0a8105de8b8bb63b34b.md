The diagnosis of anterior mediastinal mass may be an incidental finding in the asymptomatic patient. However, 60% of patients are symptomatic at presentation.

Manifestations of paraneoplastic syndromes can occur with anterior mediastinal masses, especially thymomas. The constellation of ptosis, dysphagia, weakness, and fatigue point to the most commonly associated paraneoplastic syndrome, myasthenia gravis. Thirty to 50% of patients with thymoma have MG, while 10% to 15% of patients with MG have thymoma.

It is essential to perform a thorough physical exam. When looking at the patient, evaluate for ptosis, proptosis, or signs of facial edema. Voice hoarseness may prompt further evaluation of the vocal cords and upper airway with a laryngoscopy. Palpation of the cervical, supraclavicular, and axillary lymph nodes may reveal palpable bulky adenopathy.  However, palpation of the lymph node regions is imperative, as sites distal to the mediastinum may also be involved.  Heart auscultation may reveal a subtle pericardial rub, which would suggest a pericardial effusion. Lung exam may reveal crackles, which would suggest a possible pleural effusion. Bronchial breathing over the thoracic vertebrae is a positive d’Espine sign, which correlates with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Gynecomastia may occur from the release of beta-hCG, as is common with non-seminomatous germ cell tumors.
