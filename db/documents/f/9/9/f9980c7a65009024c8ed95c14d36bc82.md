There are numerous relative contraindications to the use of stimulants. Patients with advanced arteriosclerosis should use minimal stimulants given the elevated risk of myocardial infarction, as stimulants elevate cardiac demand. Also, patients with severe hypertension will exacerbate their existing elevated high blood pressure when using stimulants and, therefore, should minimize their use. Untreated hyperthyroidism, glaucoma, and a recent stroke are also relative contraindications to stimulant use. Cardiac arrhythmias are also known to worsen and even result from certain stimulants; therefore,Â individuals so affected should avoid stimulant use.

Younger patients under the age of 12 and pregnant patients should avoid using stimulants. From a general perspective, some patients are susceptible to stimulants and should either avoid using or minimize their dose.
