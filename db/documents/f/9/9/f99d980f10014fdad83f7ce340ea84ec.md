Depending upon the specific pathology affecting the anterior fontanelle, surgical intervention may be necessary. For example, an infant with the diagnosis of craniosynostosis (premature cranial suture closure) will have an increase in intracranial pressure, which can lead to devastating brain injury or can even be lethal. Surgical intervention for this specific condition is treated by either a craniotomy or craniectomy, taking special consideration to avoid iatrogenic injury to the superior sagittal sinus.
