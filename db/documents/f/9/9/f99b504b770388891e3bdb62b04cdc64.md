The aortic arch is the section of the aorta between the ascending and descending aorta. As it arises from the ascending aorta, the arch runs slightly backward and to the left of the trachea. The distal segment of the aortic arch then traverses downwards at the fourth thoracic vertebra. From this point on, it continues as the descending aorta.

The aortic arch has 3 major branches. The brachiocephalic trunk is the first branch of the aortic arch and supplies blood to the right arm and right head and neck. The left common carotid artery is the second branch of the aortic arch, which supplies blood to the left side of the head of the neck. The last branch of the aortic arch is the left subclavian artery that distributes blood to the left arm.
