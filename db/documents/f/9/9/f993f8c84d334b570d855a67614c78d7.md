Ileal conduits are used to replace the bladder, and as such, the indications for their use involve conditions whereby it is necessary to remove the bladder to improve or prolong a patients life; for example, neurogenic bladder conditions or severe radiation injury, or more commonly where the bladder is harboring a life-limiting pathology such as muscle-invasive bladder cancer T2-T4a, or non-muscle invasive bladder cancer that has failed less radical management such as BCG therapy or recurred after TURBT. An ileal conduit can also be indicated for patients whose bladder symptoms have a severe impact on their quality of life, such as in chronic pelvic pain syndromes or intractable incontinence in females.
