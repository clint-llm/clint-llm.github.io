The etiology of atypical ductal hyperplasia is unknown; however, ADH is more prevalent in patients with a strong family history of breast cancer.

Additionally, a study from 2009 demonstrated that rates of ADH have declined with the loss of favor of post-menopausal hormonal therapies, suggesting this also may have been a contributing factor.
