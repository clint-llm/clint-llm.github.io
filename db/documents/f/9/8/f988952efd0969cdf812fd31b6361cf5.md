Although there are no absolute contraindications for IVIG products as they are not generic drugs and are not interchangeable, their use in high-risk patients must proceed with caution. Every IVIG product is different, and a patient with a life-threatening reaction to one product may not have any reactions with a different preparation. Thus the contraindications are related to the particular component of the IVIG product.

**Noteworthy C****aveats**

- Sugar-stabilized IVIG products should be avoided in patients with renal failure or diabetes.

- Hyperosmolar IVIG products are not for post-transplantation patients due to the risk of renal failure and osmotic nephropathy.

- High sodium-containing products should be used cautiously for individuals with cardiac conditions and hypertension.

- Severe anaphylactic reactions are rare and have been reportedÂ when using IVIG products due to the presence of IgG or IgE anti-IgA antibodies in patients with IgA deficiency.

- Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine should not be administered in children receiving IVIG therapy, as the IgG could counter the attenuated virus in the vaccine preparation and render them inactive. Thus vaccines should be delayed for at least nine months after the IVIG therapy or vice versa.
