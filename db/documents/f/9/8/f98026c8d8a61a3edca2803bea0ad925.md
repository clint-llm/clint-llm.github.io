Antiplatelet medications are primarily used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) related events. Currently, there are four classifications of these agents based upon the mechanism of action utilized, but all inhibit platelet activation and aggregation ultimately. This activity reviews the indications and actions of these medications, as well as the treatment of toxic exposure to them. The toxicokinetics, adverse event profile, and specific management of these agents will be highlighted for the edification of the interprofessional healthcare team when employing antiplatelet therapy to patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of antiplatelet toxicity.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with antiplatelet toxicity.
- Summarize the recommended management of the main adverse event associated with antiplatelet toxicity.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to improve the delivery of care for patients receiving antiplatelet therapy.
