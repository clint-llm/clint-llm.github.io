Hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal failure is a condition characterized by inappropriate secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH), secondary to a phosphocalcic metabolic disorder. Surgical management represents the only radical treatment of the disease and its indications are well established. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of surgery in case of secondary hyperparathyroidism.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of secondary hyperparathyroidism.
- Review the management options available for secondary hyperparathyroidism.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination for secondary hyperparathyroidism.
