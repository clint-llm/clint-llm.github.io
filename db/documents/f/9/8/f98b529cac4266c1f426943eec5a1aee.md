Insomnia and nervousness are the most commonly reported adverse effects in patients using methylphenidate.

Growth retardation (decreased height, weight, and bone marrow density) is observed when taken long-term in children.

Other frequent side effects mainly involve the CNS (dizziness, headache, tics, restlessness/akathisia), gastrointestinal (nausea/vomiting, dry mouth, decreased appetite, weight loss, abdominal pain), and cardiovascular systems (tachycardia, and palpitations).

Dermatologically, patients can complain of excessive sweating and ulceration of their digits.

Some patients may even develop blurry vision or decreased libido. While it rarely occurs, priapism is a medical emergency that requires immediate attention.

Patients are more prone to become easily agitated, irritable, or depressed and go through mood swings/lability.

While many common side effects can be relieved by adjusting the dosage or avoiding an afternoon or evening dose, some require treatment emergently to prevent complications.

It is important to note that there have been reported cases of sudden death in both children and adults with a pre-existing structural cardiac abnormality.

Drug Interactions: Methylphenidate can inhibit the metabolism of warfarin, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants, or SSRIs and can increase plasma concentration.
