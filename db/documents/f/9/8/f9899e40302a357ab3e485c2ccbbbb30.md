The staging system most utilized for TTTS is the Quintero Staging System, which is based upon two-dimensional ultrasound and doppler study findings and is as follows:

- Stage I: oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios sequence, donor twin bladder is visible, doppler studies of UA/UV/DV are normal in both twins.

- Stage II: oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios sequence, donor twin bladder is not visible, doppler studies of UA/UV/DV are normal in both twins.

- Stage III: oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios sequence and abnormal Doppler study (only one of the following is required in either twin) [absent/reversed end-diastolic flow in UA, pulsatile flow in UV, or reversed a-wave flow in DV].

- Stage IV: oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios sequence, and one or both fetuses have hydrops.

- Stage V: oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios sequence, and one or both fetuses have died.
