Acetaminophen, also called N-**a**cetyl**p**ara-**a**mino**p**henol (APAP) or paracetamol, is one of the most widely used over-the-counter analgesic and antipyretic agents.

Regardless, the reduction of the COX pathway activity by acetaminophen is thought to inhibit the synthesis of prostaglandins in the central nervous system, leading to its analgesic and antipyretic effects. The analgesic properties may be due to a stimulating effect on the descending serotonergic pathways in the central nervous system (CNS). Other studies have suggested that acetaminophen or one of its metabolites, e.g., AM 404, alsoÂ can activate the cannabinoid system e.g., by inhibiting the uptake or degradation of anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglyerol, contributing to its analgesic action.
