The differential diagnoses for inner ear decompression sickness include inner ear barotrauma, arterial gas embolism, oxygen toxicity, and persistent alternobaric vertigo. While treatment should not be delayed if any form of DCS is suspected, if auditory or vestibular symptoms are found in isolation, it may also be beneficial to rule out common causes of hearing loss and vertigo. This includes cerumen impaction and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Other CNS disorders such as a cerebrovascular accident or transient ischemic attacks can also mimic symptoms of IEDCS. This also emphasizes the importance of a detailed dive history and proper physical exam.

It can be challenging to distinguish between IEDCS and inner ear barotrauma, as both conditions present with similar cochlear and vestibular symptoms.
