The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends screening for high-risk populations. They identify two particular subsets of the populations at high risk: first, those who meet the criteria set forth by the NLST, which is adults between 55-80 years of age with a 30-pack-year smoking history who are active smokers or quit within the past 15 years. The second population they identify are adults aged >50 years with over 20 pack year smoking history and an additional risk factor for lung cancer. These additional risk factors include environmental, occupational or residential exposure to carcinogens, family history of lung cancer, COPD or pulmonary fibrosis.

The NLST trial only conducted screening for 3 years, however clinically there is an increased risk of cancer with increased age. Therefore, it is recommended to continue screening annually unless the patient has a life-limiting condition. The NELSON trial confirmed this finding. They foundÂ during this trial that an annual low- dose CT decreased lung cancer deaths in men by 26% and in women by 61% with an overall decrease by 44%.
