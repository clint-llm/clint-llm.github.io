Treatment for TGA is largely supportive. There is no specific therapy for this condition, nor is one necessary. The patient should be examined carefully for any accompanying neurological deficits or evidence of head trauma, both of which would exclude TGA as the diagnosis. The patient should be observed in the hospital until the memory deficit resolves. Consideration should be given for intravenous thiamine. Recurrences, while they do happen, are rare. The patient does not require any restrictions on driving or other activities once the memory deficits resolve.
