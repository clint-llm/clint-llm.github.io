Didanosine is a nucleoside analog that must first undergo conversion to its active form, dideoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate (ddATP). ddATP terminates viral DNA growth by inhibiting HIV reverse transcriptase. Multiple clinical trials showed a decrease in plasma HIV RNA levels while increasing CD4+ cell counts in previously untreated patients.

Didanosine is an acid-liable drug with low bioavailability (20Â to 40%). Due to being water-soluble and degraded in the GI tract into inactive hypoxanthine. To increase bioavailability and remove the need for antacid administration, an encapsulated enteric-coated bead formula was developed.

Oral didanosine administration showed an impaired absorption of pH-dependent medications such as itraconazole, dapsone, and ketoconazole. The fetal concentration of didanosine was 20 to 50 percent of the mother's concentration. During the observation, concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was low.
