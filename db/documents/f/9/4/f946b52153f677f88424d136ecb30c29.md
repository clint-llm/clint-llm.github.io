Case-control studies are prevalent in all fields of medicine from nursing and pharmacy to use in public health and surgical patients.  Case-control studies are important for each member of the health care team to not only understand their common occurrence in research but because each part of the health care team has parts to contribute to such studies.  One of the most important things each party provides is helping identify correct controls for the cases.  Matching the controls across a spectrum of factors outside of the elements of interest take input from nurses, pharmacists, social workers, physicians, demographers, and more.  Failure for adequate selection of controls can lead to invalid study conclusions and invalidate the entire study.
