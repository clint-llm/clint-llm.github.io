Monitoring the depth of anesthesia is very important during any procedure, as anesthesia that's too deep can cause hemodynamic changes. Anesthesia that is too light carries the risk of recall or awareness during anesthesia. Awareness during anesthesia is a very serious complication with potential long-term psychological sequelae such as anxiety and post-traumatic disorder.
