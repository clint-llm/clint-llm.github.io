Because STP can occur in any vessel, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a surgeon, an interventional radiologist, and an infectious disease specialist. Nurses are often the first professionals to note the condition because it is often linked to peripheral vein cannulation. Once the condition is diagnosed, immediate treatment is necessary to prevent metastatic foci of infection in the systemic circulation. Mortality rates between 3 and 78% have been reported depending on the location of the vein and the extent of infection. Infections associated with candida have the highest mortality. When the dural sinuses are involved, the mortality can exceed 70%. Today, with better imaging and improved diagnosis, the mortality rates have dropped, but any delay in treatment is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Pharmacists, particularly those specialized in infectious disease, are involved in helping the team in selecting medications, with the review of medications dosing, and checking for drug-drug interactions. Once discharged, patients often need to follow up to ensure that they have not developed endocarditis or recurrent infection; nursing can provide the needed monitoring and report any issues to the clinician staff. To lessen the mortality, peripheral vein cannulation should be preferred over central vein cannulation. close communication between nurses and other clinicians is vital if one wants to improve the outcomes.
