The patient is positioned per the surgeonâ€™s preference. They are then prepped and draped with an appropriate antiseptic. As mentioned, if using a tourniquet, the limb should be elevated before it is inflated, this is to reduce the risk of exsanguination dislodging or moving the foreign body. If using an imaging modality intraoperatively (ultrasound/image intensifier), have this readily available and sterile at the beginning of the procedure.

**Direct**

If going through the current wound, it will likely need to be extended to improve exposure. Any contaminated wounds need thorough irrigation with sterile saline. Sometimes simple exploration will be enough to find and remove the foreign body. If this is the case, and the wound is clean, it can be closed with interrupted non-absorbable sutures. If infected, it will need to be left open and reviewed following local policy, normally 48 hours, and the aim of healing via secondary intention.

**Indirect**

In chronic foreign bodies, without wounds, deciding on the approach can be more difficult. As the foreign body is likely to have moved, going through the area of original injury may not be helpful. This is where the use of ultrasound or an image intensifier can be beneficial. Ultrasound can be used for initial incision, whereas image intensifiers can be better for triangulation. Using an artery clip, have them open with the tips around the foreign body in two views (anteroposterior and lateral) the clip can then be closed (hopefully around the foreign body) and the foreign body removed. Another novel method is using the image intensifier and a straight metal object in the foreign body's longitudinal axis to guide an incision then use a clip in a similar fashion as described above.

A novel technique of vacuum-assisted foreign body extraction technique using a syringe has recently been described.
