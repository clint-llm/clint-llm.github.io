Fructose 1-phosphate aldolase deficiency or hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the deficiency in aldolase B (fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase), an enzyme responsible for the cleavage of fructose-1-phosphate. To avoid the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and managed. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of HFI and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the role of aldolase B in fructose metabolism.
- Describe the pathophysiology of fructose 1-phosphate aldolase deficiency.
- Review the long term management of patients with fructose 1-phosphate aldolase deficiency.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication and improve outcomes in cases of fructose 1-phosphate aldolase deficiency.
