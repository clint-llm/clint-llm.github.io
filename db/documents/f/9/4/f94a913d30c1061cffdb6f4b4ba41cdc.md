The Mammography Quality Standards Act (MQSA) publishes specific requirements for breast biopsies and accreditations. To summarise, a breast biopsy should be performed by a physician who understands the technology in the machine, physics used to produce an image, limitations of the technology as well as common artifacts associated with breast imaging. Additionally, physicians and technicians must demonstrate knowledge of breast anatomy, and be able to recognize physiologic breast changes and common breast pathologies.
