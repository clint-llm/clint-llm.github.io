The most common adverse effects reported for candesartan are symptomatic hypotension, abnormal renal function, and hyperkalemia. In the CHARM program, symptomatic hypotension, impaired renal function (rise in creatinine), and hyperkalemia occurred with an incidence of 18.8%, 12.5%, and 6.3%, respectively. Hypotension is most common in patients who are volume- or salt-depleted secondary to dietary restriction, dialysis, diarrhea, emesis, or diuretic use.

Other reported side effects include headache, back pain, angioedema, and upper respiratory tract infections, but these are very rare clinically.

Candesartan is considered a teratogen and has a black box warning for fetal toxicity. If used in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy, medications that interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system diminish fetal renal function. There is an increased risk of morbidity and death secondary to oligohydramnios results from decreased renal function. These neonates may develop skull hypoplasia, lung hypoplasia, hypotension, or renal failure and may ultimately expire.
