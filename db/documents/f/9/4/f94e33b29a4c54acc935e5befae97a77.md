In general, iris cysts that are stable and do not cause symptoms or secondary complications can be observed. If an intervention is required, a step-wise approach in terms of invasiveness is recommended.

Laser treatment may be performed, making use of the laser properties of photocoagulation (argon) or photodisruption (neodymium in yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd: YAG)).

Another effective treatment is fine-needle aspiration and injection of a sclerosing agent. The sclerosing agents include ethanol, mitomycin C and 5-fluorouracil.

One of the complications from fine-needle aspiration is when cystic contents are released in the anterior chamber, as this can cause severe inflammation. In addition, recurrence of cysts and intraocular epithelialization could occur.

Other surgical options include excision of the cyst alone or as part of a sector iridectomy or iridocyclectomy, depending on the location of the cyst.  Surgical excision is a more definitive treatment and has the advantage of obtaining a tissue sample for histological analysis. The surgery can be done with a limbal approach or pars plana approach. However, it can be accompanied by serious complications and is usually reserved as a last resort.

The etiology of the iris cysts can also affect the management. With drug-induced cysts, discontinuation is often an effective treatment, and the cyst will resolve. In cysts secondary to a miotic (phospholine iodide), phenylephrine eye drops can be used.
