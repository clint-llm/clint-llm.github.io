The history of a patient presenting with decompression sickness will often involve some aspect of recent diving, flight, non-commercial air travel, or altitude chamber use. The important thing to recognize is that not all individuals will understand the importance of these aspects of their history, so they may not volunteer it.

Specific symptoms patients may complain about depend on the location of the bubbles, with the most common being musculoskeletal symptoms presenting as joint pain – also colloquially known as “the bends” – that can be mild to severe. Respiratory issues can occurs due to vascular bubbles trapped in the pulmonary capillaries causing respiratory distress symptoms called “the chokes.” Patients may also complain of skin changes, headaches, paresthesias, and respiratory issues. A particular skin manifestation of decompression sickness is cutis marmorata, also called livedo reticularis, which is the result of skin tissue damage caused by gas bubbles forming during decompression. More profound presentations, while less common, can occur with altered mentation and severe neurologic or cardiopulmonary presentations possible. If neurologic signs or symptoms occur after exposure to altitude, consider decompression sickness.

Histories of rapid ascent in aviation or recent diving followed by altitude exposure are key components to a patient's history.

Important aspects of the physical exam include vitals, complete skin examination, complete neurological examination, careful lung and cardiac examination, and full evaluation of the joints.
