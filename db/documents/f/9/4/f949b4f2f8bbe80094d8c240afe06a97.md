- Monitor vital signs for changes in temperature or heart rate. Fever and increased heart rate can both indicate infection or inflammation.

- Monitor patient pain level and location. Appendicitis typically presents as pain in the right lower quadrant. However, it is not always specific to those areas, particularly in small children, who may have difficulty localizing pain other than a generalized "belly pain." The appendix may also not be situated in a normal location, which can lead to pain felt in a different quadrant. It is important, as a nurse, to obtain as much information as possible about the location and quality of the pain in order to provide the doctor with as much information as possible. Questions such as "where is the pain located?" "How would you describe the pain, is it burning, stabbing, cramping, etc.?" and "How long has the pain lasted, is it constant or does it come and go?" are important to ask the patient and subsequently relay to the provider.

- Monitor for changes in eating and bowel habits. Appendicitis can lead to patient complaints of loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting, as well as constipation.

- Monitor laboratory values, particularly the white blood cell count, as an increase can signal infection. Please note, however, appendicitis is still possible with normal laboratory values.
