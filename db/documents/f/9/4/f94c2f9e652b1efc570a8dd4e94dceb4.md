Differential diagnoses of AEN include:

- Malignant melanoma

- Acanthosis nigricans

- Coal dust deposition

- Psuedomelanosis

- Melanosis of the esophagus

- Black dye ingestion

- Direct caustic injury

The majority of the above conditions follow a longer-term, more insidious course and are often found during elective gastroscopy rather than in an emergency scenario. The exceptions to this are dye ingestion or direct caustic injury, for which history will be key to determining the underlying cause of black esophagus. If there is doubt over the pathogenesis of a black esophagus, then histology can be performed following an upper GI endoscopy. If it is the result of AEN, then this will show mucosal and submucosal necrosis, necrotic debris, and localized inflammatory response.
