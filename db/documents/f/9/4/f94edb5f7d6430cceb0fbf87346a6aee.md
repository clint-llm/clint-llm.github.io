Cadmium is a heavy metal that causes direct harm to humans in several forms. It is regularly found with other heavy metals such as zinc, copper, and lead. Concentrations increase due to soil disruption/volcanic activity and a byproduct of industrial processes. Industrially, its use is best known for electroplating and in the production of nickel-cadmium batteries. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of cadmium toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of cadmium toxicity.
- Review the features of cadmium toxicity.
- Summarize the treatment of cadmium toxicity.
- Outline the pathophysiology of cadmium toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.
