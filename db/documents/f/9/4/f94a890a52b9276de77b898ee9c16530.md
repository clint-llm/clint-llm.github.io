Primary congenital glaucoma is a treatable disease, provided the condition is diagnosed early, and timely intervention is done. Thus, it is very important to educate the parents, general clinicians, and optometrists to ensure early suspicion and timely referral to the ophthalmologists. Any signs of enlarged eyes, watering, redness, shying away from light should be reported to the health care team at the earliest. Proper parental education about early signs and symptoms can prevent treatable blindness from primary congenital glaucoma.

Management options should be explained to the parents, and a well-informed decision should be made. It is also essential to create awareness about the need for regular follow-ups and compliance with the treatment advised. The need for follow-up with optometrists for regular refraction should also be emphasized. In patients with low vision, appropriate mobilization for low vision clinics should be ensured at an early age to help the child and parents understand the need for lifestyle and educational modifications.
