Other than the cavernous sinus, the superior petrosal sinus receives vascular supply by the superior petrosal venous complex (SPVC). The SPVC is one of the largest veins in the posterior fossa. The tributaries of the SPVC include the veins of the cerebellopontine fissure, veins of the middle cerebellar peduncle, and the transverse pontine and pontotrigeminal veins.
