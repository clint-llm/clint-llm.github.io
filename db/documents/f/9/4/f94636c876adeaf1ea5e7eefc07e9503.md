History and physical are some of the most important aspects of a patient's evaluation. This is because it gives the clinicians a clue of the cause of the patient's presentation. Patients with hyperlipidemia should be asked about current medications, family history of severe hyperlipidemia, or premature cardiovascular disease. Familial hyperlipidemia should be a top differential if the patient has more than one family member with severe hyperlipidemia or pre-mature cardiovascular disease. If not, clinicians need to think about other reasons that could cause severe hyperlipidemia. Such reasons include liver disease, LCAT deficiency, and lipid infusion.

Physical examination findings that could be seen include the presence of jaundice, scleral icterus, right upper quadrant pain, or liver enlargement. Xanthomas could also be present in some of these patients. Xanthomas can be found around the tendon, elbows, and palms. The cause of the xanthomas is a result of the formation of foam cells in macrophages of patients with severe hyperlipidemia.
