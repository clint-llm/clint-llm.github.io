Alpha-1 receptor agonists taken at toxic doses lead to increased sympathetic tone, which results in tachycardia, early hypertension progressing to hypotension, mydriasis, anxiety, and increased glycogenolysis. Recent ingestion or asymptomatic patients require observation; if very recent, then activated charcoal may be an option to attempt to prevent the drug from absorbing if the drug was ingested orally. If symptomatic, the patient should be admitted, generally to the intensive care unit. Symptomatic treatment is the mainstay, with control of the airway, blood pressure, and heart rate. The alpha blockade may be attempted with caution, as well. Once symptoms abate, the patient is considered to have wholly metabolized the drug. The toxicity of alpha-1 blockers and alpha-2 agonists is an unopposed parasympathetic activity, with bradycardia, hypotension, miosis, and sedation. Observation is sufficient in asymptomatic patients. Supportive care is necessary for symptomatic patients. There is no single antidote for either type of toxicities.
