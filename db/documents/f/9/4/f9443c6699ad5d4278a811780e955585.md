Insulin aspart is contraindicated in patients with documented hypersensitivity to the drug or component of the formulation. It is also contraindicated during episodes of hypoglycemia, though it may be resumed at lower doses once the hypoglycemia resolves. Patients with hypersensitivity to other insulin products may try insulin aspart with the appropriate support in case of a reaction (antihistamine and/or epinephrine as needed).
