In general, most cases of alcohol-related psychosis come to light when patients are admitted to the hospital and then develop withdrawal symptoms with or without delirium tremens. The presence of alcohol-related psychosis usually is an indicator of something very serious and if not treated promptly can lead to negative outcomes. Healthcare workers should be familiar with this disorder and make appropriate recommendations to specialists if they have such a patient. Besides psychosis, these patients have a much higher rate of anxiety, depression and suicide. In addition, the patients can be unpredictable and resort to violence. These patients need to be managed by an interprofessional team of allied healthcare workers to mitigate morbidity and mortality. The prognosis for most patients with alcohol-related psychosis is poor, and even with recovery, major neuropsychiatric deficits persist.
