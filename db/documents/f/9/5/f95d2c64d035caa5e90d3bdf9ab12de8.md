Timely identification and management of IRIS are important as severe IRIS can be associated with complications, as outline below:

- TB-IRS and Cryptococcus-IRS can lead to death due to acute hypoxic respiratory failure and CNS complications.

- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) can be a potentially fatal demyelinating CNS disease due to the JC virus-associated IRS.

- Malignancies such as Kaposi sarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma have been associated with the IRIS.

- Permanent blindness in case of severe CMV keratitis.
