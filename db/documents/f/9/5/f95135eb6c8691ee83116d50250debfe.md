Compliance with hand hygiene recommendations is critical to reducing colonization and infection, specifically among healthcare workers (HCW). This will decrease the transmission of microorganisms to patients, ultimately reducing morbidity, mortality, and costs associated with healthcare-associated infections (HCAI). The global burden of HCAI is enormous. Data suggests that more than 1.4 million patients in developed and developing countries worldwide are affected at any time. This activity reviews the indications and contraindications to the usage of alcohol-based sanitizer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the education of patients and colleagues regarding regular hand washing.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the relevant ingredients in alcohol-based sanitizer.
- Describe the indications for the use of an alcohol-based sanitizer.
- Review the contraindications to the use of an alcohol-based sanitizer.
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to prevent the spread of infection by using an alcohol-based sanitizer.
