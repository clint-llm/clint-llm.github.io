Neurulation begins in the trilaminar embryo when part of the mesoderm differentiates into the notochord. The formation of the notochord signals the overlying ectoderm to form the neural plate, the first structure that will become the nervous system. The neural plate folds in on itself, creating the neural tube, initially open at both ends and ultimately closed. From the neural tube comes the primitive brain and spinal cord.

The development of the nervous system begins at approximately 17 days of gestational age. In the fifth week of gestation, myotomes start to form, allowing the development of rudimentary reflex circuitries. Myelination of the motor tracts begins in the first few months of life and continues into adolescence.

Interestingly, reciprocal excitation shifts to inhibition between nine and twelve months of age. Before that age, supraspinal descending fibers activate interneurons, resulting in extension or flexion. During this period of development, glycine and GABA are excitatory.
