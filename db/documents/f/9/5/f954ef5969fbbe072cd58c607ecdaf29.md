In the emergency management service (EMS) field, disordered sleep and work schedules have become a daily routine. With an increase in 911 emergency and non-emergency convalescent calls, there is plenty of work to stay busy.

There is a culture shift that indicates emergency services used more often than in previous years. This growing surge in call volume has placed the additional strains on emergency management service providers who answer the call on a daily basis. This additional responsibility has contributed to a disordered sleep and work schedules. Emergency management service providers sacrifice personal safety and health on a continual basis as they serve the community and patients. Emergency management service providers have a passion for their trade, and often, the sacrifices they make go unnoticed.
