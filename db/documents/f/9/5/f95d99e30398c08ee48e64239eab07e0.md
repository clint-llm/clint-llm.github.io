An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to Actinic keratoses can help achieve the best possible outcomes. To date, there is no superior or best treatment approach for AKs. The choice of treatment is tailored to symptoms, lesion number, compliance, and desired results. If the number of AKs is few, then lesion-directed treatment may be considered by the general practitioner. If the lesions are unresponsive to treatment by the general practitioner, consultation with a dermatologist may be considered. If AKs are numerous or rapidly evolving, and malignant transformation is a diagnostic possibility, referral to skin cancer specialists should be made for evaluation and treatment recommendations.

If non-compliance with self-administered topical medications is of concern, the patient's social support network should be reviewed. Consultation with a social worker and community nurses who can monitor the patient and make referrals as needed may be necessary to optimize patient outcomes. Collaboration, shared decision making, and communication are keyÂ elements for a good outcome. Through interprofessional care, the prognosis and outcome of AKs may be better when AKs are identified and managed before they undergo malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma.
