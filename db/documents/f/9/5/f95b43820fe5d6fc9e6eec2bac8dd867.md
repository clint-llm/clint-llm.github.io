The major clinical indications for a mediastinoscopy are:

- Evaluation of lymph node involvement in patients with carcinoma of the lung

- Tissue biopsy of suspected tumors

- Removal of mediastinal masses and enlarged lymph nodes

The most common indication for mediastinoscopy is as a staging procedure in the diagnosis of non-small cell lung carcinoma. The pathological results obtained from the procedure are very important in tailoring care for the patient amongst the surgeon, oncologist, and radiation oncologist. Other indications for mediastinoscopy include the diagnosis and removal of mediastinal masses and enlarged lymph nodes. Lymphoma, both Hodgkins and non-Hodgkins, can be diagnosed via mediastinoscopy along with sarcoidosis which has similar appearances on imaging. A mediastinal mass, such as a thymoma may be excised via mediastinoscopy depending on its size. A sampling of lymph nodes may diagnose infectious processes such as tuberculosis and fungal infections.

Conditions that may present with mediastinal masses include:

- Tumors

- Thyroid and parathyroid tumors
- Lymphoma
- Esophageal cancer
- Neurogenic tumors

- Benign conditions

- Developmental cysts

- Granulomatous lymphadenopathy

- Tuberculosis
- Sarcoidosis

- Vascular

- Aneurysms
- Aberrant vessels, e.g., persistent left superior vena cava (SVC), anomalous left pulmonary artery
