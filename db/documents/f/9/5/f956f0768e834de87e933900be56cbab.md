Deficiency in vitamin E is uncommon, and therefore monitoring of levels is not routinely conducted. However, disorders leading to fat malabsorption can cause deficiency, and consequently, the measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol is warranted.Â These disorders include cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis, diseases leading to cholestasis, genetic mutations leading to abetalipoproteinemia, and low levels of alpha-tocopherol transport protein. Levels of alpha-tocopherol less than 0.5 mg/dL are considered a deficiency.

The provider must remember that serum alpha-tocopherol depends on serum lipids and proteins. Therefore, in patients with high total lipid levels, the measurement of serum alpha-tocopherol is best estimated by dividing the level by the total lipid. Additionally, since vitamin E and other fat-soluble vitamins require carrier proteins, those with other hypoproteinemic states may have lower measurements of such vitamins.
