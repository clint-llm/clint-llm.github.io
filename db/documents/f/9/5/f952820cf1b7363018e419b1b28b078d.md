Physiologic variants of the papillary muscles can include modifications in muscle morphology, ventricular wall origin, and chordae attachment. Morphological variants can be described based on the number of papillary muscle heads and the presence of shared or separate basal origins.

Usually, the left ventricles have two papillary muscles, but studies indicate that 46% of hypoplastic and 18% of the borderline left ventricle cases had just a single papillary muscle. In these cases, it was also observed that the supporting pedicle had a more extensive attachment over the ventricular wall.
