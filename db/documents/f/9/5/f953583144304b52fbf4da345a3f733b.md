The etiology of urethral strictures is divided into four major groups; idiopathic, iatrogenic, inflammatory, and traumatic, with the idiopathic and iatrogenic being the most common at 33% each. Following them are the traumatic causes comprising 19% and finally inflammatory, causing 15% of them.

With regards to idiopathic causes, there are clinical features that point towards the possibility of them being caused by unrecognized repetitive minor perineal traumas, eventually leading to the stricture.

Iatrogenic causes are divided into five causes. Trans-urethral resections (TUR) comprise 41% of them.

Inflammatory strictures can be the result of post-infectious inflammation leading to narrowing of the lumen and weakening of the epithelium, most commonly from recurrent gonococcal urethritis. These causes are becoming less common in the developed world due to public education, but some are still common in developing countries.Escherichia coli.

Post-traumatic anterior urethral strictures most commonly affect the bulbar urethra and are frequently due to straddle injuries compressing the bulbar urethra against the symphysis pubis. This pattern of injury is rarely associated with a pelvic fracture. Penile urethral strictures due to trauma are rare but can happen following a penile fracture.
