The most common complication with the interpleural block is pneumothorax. A retrospective review of 703 procedures found that the incidence of pneumothorax may be as high as 2%.

As with any procedure involving the use of local anesthetic, the interpleural block carries the risk of local anesthetic toxicity, especially when large volumes or doses are required for effective analgesia. Additionally, given the proximity of the phrenic nerve and upper thoracic sympathetic ganglia, interpleural analgesia may result in hemidiaphragm paralysis or Horner syndrome. The following is a list of other potential complications:

- Bleeding or hemothorax

- Local infection

- Catheter migration, misplacement, or failed block

- Pleural Effusion

- Bronchial trauma or formation of a bronchopleural fistula
