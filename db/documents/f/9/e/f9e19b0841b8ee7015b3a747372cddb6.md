The following equipment is recommended to perform a facial nerve repair:

- Operating microscope (a cross-table arrangement is not necessarily required for neurorrhaphy)

- Microsurgical instruments (jeweler's forceps, straight and curved micro scissors, non-locking micro needle driver)

- 10-0 nylon sutures on cutting spatula-tip needles, such as TG 160-4

- Weck cell spears

- Suction tip, Goodhill is recommended

- Bipolar jeweler's forceps

- Collagen wrap or other nerve sheaths, such as a vein graft

- Straight Iris or tenotomy scissors

- Retractors (Senn, Ragnell, Cummings, or Lone Star)

- Fibrin glue

- Nerve stimulator

Other instruments may be required to perform the approach to the facial nerve, facial nerve exploration, and the approach to any other nerve that will serve as a graft or be transferred. For example, Metzenbaum, Gorney-Freeman, or Reynolds tenotomy scissors may be useful. In addition, petit point Crile clamps, fine right-angle clamps, McCabe dissectors, and DeBakey or Gerald forceps will serve well for nerve dissection.
