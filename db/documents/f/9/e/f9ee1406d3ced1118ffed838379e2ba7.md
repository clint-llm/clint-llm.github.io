The main principle of the pathophysiology of spontaneous pneumothorax revolves around gas leaking into the pleural space. Spontaneous pneumothorax is a multifactorial process and has been associated with rises in transpulmonary pressure and defects in the visceral pleura. Acute increases in alveolar pressure that exceed the pulmonary interstitial pressure can lead to alveolar rupture and pleural air leakage. Furthermore, points of weakness in the visceral pleura due to subpleural blebs, bullae, lung necrosis, and other connective tissue abnormalities can predispose the alveoli to rupture in both types of spontaneous pneumothorax, though the exact mechanism of how is not entirely understood. Intact bullae without an explicit defect in the visceral pleura have been shown to be associated with spontaneous pneumothorax; however, histopathological analyses and scanning electron microscopic studies of tissue obtained from thoracotomies suggest that sloughing of pleural mesothelial cells may play a significant role in the development of spontaneous pneumothorax.
