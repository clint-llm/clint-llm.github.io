Reserpine is an indole alkaloid extracted from Rauwolfia serpentine roots, an Indian climbing shrub. Reserpine has FDA approval since 1955 and is one of the first agents developed to treat hypertension in clinical practice. Reserpine can be prescribed alone or combined with a vasodilator or thiazide diuretic, such as reserpine-hydrochlorothiazide, as commonly used in China for over 40 years.

A recent clinical trial tested the effects of reserpine on refractory hypertension (RfHTN) or uncontrolled blood pressure after â‰¥ five antihypertensive medications from different classes. Out of 45 patients with suspected RfHTN, seven consented to participate in the clinical trial, which only six patients were able to complete.

In the 1960s, reports indicated that depression correlated with the monoamine-depleting activity of reserpine treatment, and a neurochemical model of depression was subsequently developed.

Reserpine has historically had other uses. Reserpine was previously utilized to treat schizophrenia and tardive dyskinesia; however, it is not currently in clinical practice for these indications.
