Many sites can be the source of CRE, including the urinary tract, lungs, abdomen, surgical site, and bloodstream. Typically patients with CRE infections have a history of long term exposure to health care facilities usually due to unrelated comorbidity. This exposure usually coincides with long term and varied antibiotic use leading to the gradual development of more and more resistant bacterial infections. Other risk factors include travel to an endemic area of CRE, immunocompromised state, mechanical ventilation, and advanced age. All these factors combine to make healthcare-associated CRE the most important factor in the spread of carbapenem resistance and are key points in a patientâ€™s history.

CRE genes do not confer increased pathogenicity, making initial presentation similar to other infections caused by a less resistant strain of the same organism. The key indicator of CRE infections may be the uncontrolled progression of the illness, leading to a more advanced disease state despite empiric antibiotic intervention. Therapeutic failure of empiric therapy may indicate a resistant organism, possibly CRE; a definitive diagnosis of CRE takes place in the lab via phenotypic or molecular techniques.
