Lupus pernio is characterized by activation of the cell-mediated immune system, typically CD4+ T lymphocytes. The pathogenesis involves autoimmune dysregulation with activation of the Th1 immune pathway in response to one or more extrinsic antigens. CD4+ helper T lymphocytes amplify the immune response through the release of interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2, and other cytokines, aided by T regulatory cells (Tregs). The release of cytokines interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha promotes macrophage accumulation, activation, and aggregation, resulting in granulomatous inflammation.
