**Allergic Rhinitis**

Allergic rhinitis is an IgE-mediated reaction that leads to irritation, pruritus, sneezing, and congestion. As allergens are introduced to the host, the immune system is sensitized. Repeat exposure causes cross-linking of IgE bound to mast cells, which release histamine, bradykinin, and leukotrienes, ultimately resulting in increased mucus secretion and blood vessel dilation within the nasal cavity.

**Nasal Polyposis**

Nasal polyps are localized expansions of edematous mucosa within the nasal cavity, which can reach 3 to 4 centimeters in length. Chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa can ultimately lead to the formation of nasal polyps. Inflammation leads to disruptions in the tight junctions between epithelial cells within the nasal

**Epistaxis**

Epistaxis, or nosebleed, occurs when a vessel within the nasal cavity is ruptured. The nasal mucosa is home to an abundant blood supply, and rupture can occur spontaneously or due to trauma. Epistaxis in the pediatric population is most often due to digital trauma.

**Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma**

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma arises from the squamous epithelium within the nasal cavity. Epstein-Barr virus, ethnicity (particularly Southeast Asians), and environmental exposures have all shown to play a role in the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
