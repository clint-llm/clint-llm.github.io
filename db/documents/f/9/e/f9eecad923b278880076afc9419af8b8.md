- A diagnostic ultrasound machine is used to perform ultrasound-guided peripheral nerve blocks. Ideally, the device should have a high frequency (5 to 13 MHz) linear probe for superficial structures and the option to use a low frequency (2 to 5 MHz) curved array probe for deeper structures.

- The echogenic short bevel block needle is commonly used for single-injection nerve blocks. Still, a 17-gauge Touhy needle may be used to facilitate the placement of a peripheral nerve catheter if a longer block duration is desired.

- The choice of local anesthetic is left to the practitioner performing the procedure, but various concentrations of bupivacaine or ropivacaine are typical. Other medications are sometimes added to the block solution to enhance the quality or extend the nerve block duration.

- Chlorhexidine 2% or povidone-iodine skin disinfectant solution

- An appropriate syringe with extension tubing

- Sterile ultrasound probe cover and gel

- ASA Standard monitors (non-invasive blood pressure monitoring, EKG, pulse oximetry)
