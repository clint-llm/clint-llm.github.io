Indinavir is an alpha-amino acid amide protease inhibitor used as a treatment therapy for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, which can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The FDA approved indinavir in 1996 as it was among the first HIV protease inhibitors authorized in the United States.

According to guidelines from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents, the use of indinavir is no longer recommended. However, it is used off-label as a part of boosted regimen in combination(ritonavir+indinavir). Indinavir is commonly combined with HIV antiretroviral medications, such as the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. Indinavir is also subject to a high viral protease gene mutation rate. Therefore an Indinavir monotherapy regime is rarely used to prevent the likelihood of drug resistance.

Recent studies have analyzed the effects of indinavir as an anti-cancer agent.
