The biceps brachii is one of the most variable muscles in the human body, this muscle can have more than two heads arising from humerus at the insertion of the coracobrachialis or neck of the humerus. Some reports describe supernumerary bicipital heads fluctuating from 3 to 7 in different groups, being the 3 heads variant the most common type.

Palmaris longus variations have also been described. The reversed palmaris longus is a polymorphic variation where the muscle is fleshy distally and tendinous proximally. Other case reports have documented a variation in its distal attachment of the muscle to the tendon of the adductor pollicis brevis, and long flexor; or to the flexor carpis ulnaris muscle, and muscle of the hypothenar eminence; as well as to the fascias of the forearm or the hypothenar eminence, and at the metacarpophalangeal joint.
