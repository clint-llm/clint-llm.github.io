Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a devastating, hyper-inflammatory condition that results in multi-organ failure and death. The systemic inflammation that characterizes the disease is the result of inappropriate and dysregulated activation of natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, and macrophages. The disease is classified as either primary (the result of inherited genetic mutations) or secondary (an inappropriate host response to infection, malignancy, or autoimmune disease). Patients with primary disease present early in childhood, whereas those with secondary disease present as adults with an associated acute illness, most commonly sepsis or a hematologic malignancy. Treatment is focused on immunosuppression coupled with cytotoxic chemotherapy, without which large proportions of patients inevitably die.
