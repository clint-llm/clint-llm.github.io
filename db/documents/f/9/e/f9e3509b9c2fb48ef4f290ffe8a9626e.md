The cause of HTC is reported to be a functional deficiency of intact fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF 23), which is a criticalÂ hormonal regulator of phosphate metabolism. It is an autosomal recessive disorder with genetic mutations causing a defect in the functioning of FGF23, in either the stage of its production, post-translational processing, or by causing end-organ resistance.
