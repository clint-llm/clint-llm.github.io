As previously mentioned, the two types of somatostatin differ in length of amino acids. While they are a different length, they are both derived from pre-prosomatostatin. This precursor is cleaved into prosomatostatin, which subsequently undergoes post-translational processing at the C-terminal to create somatostatin-14 and somatostatin-28.
