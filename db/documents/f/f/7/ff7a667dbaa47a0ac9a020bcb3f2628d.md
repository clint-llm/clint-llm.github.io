Hamstring injury is one of the most common sports-related injuries in the competitive realm of professional sports. It is also one injury that keeps an athlete out of action for a long time and requires proper rehabilitation before returning to play. Multiple recurrences could complicate the process of rehabilitation. In athletes who are in sports involving running and sprinting as well as non-athletes like dancers, hamstring injury should be considered if they experience acute, sharp posterior thigh pain that restricts further participation in sports unless it is clinically or radiologically ruled out with certainty. It is also important to discuss with the patients about the possible length of time away from the sport. They should also be counseled about the need for surgery in severe injuries and the importance of rehabilitation and physical therapy before returning to play.
