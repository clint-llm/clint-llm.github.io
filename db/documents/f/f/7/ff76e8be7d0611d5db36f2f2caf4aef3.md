Ideally, fluoroscopic guided SI joint injections require a fluoroscopic C-arm device, local anesthetic (lidocaine or bupivacaine), corticosteroids (triamcinolone, methylprednisolone, betamethasone or dexamethasone), contrasts solution, sterile gloves, and drapes, betadine solution. The injection also requires a 25-gauge, 5-inch,Â styletted spinal needle. If the joint is degenerative and sclerotic, a 22-gauge needle may be utilized.
