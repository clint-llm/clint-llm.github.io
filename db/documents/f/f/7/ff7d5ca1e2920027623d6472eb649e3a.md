The ear divides into three distinct parts: the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear.

The external ear includes the auricle (pinna) and the external ear canal; both have a lining keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.

The tympanic membrane is a connective tissue structure that separates the external ear from the tympanic cavity. It is contiguous with skin on the outside (keratinized stratified squamous epithelium) and has a mucous membrane (non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium) inside. The membrane is innervated by cranial nerves V and X laterally and IX medially.

The middle earÂ begins from the tympanic membrane and extends to the oval window of the inner ear, with a lining of non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium.[2] This tympanic cavity is filled with air and is connected to the nasopharynx with the Eustachian tube, meaning the middle ear pressure equalizes with the pharynx. The primary role of the middle ear is to transmit vibration from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear through three small bones, the ossicles. In order from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear are the malleus (attached to the tympanic membrane), the incus, and the stapes (attached to the oval window). There are two clinically essential muscles in the middle ear, the stapedius and the tensor tympani. The stapedius muscle attaches to the stapes and is the smallest muscle in the human body and receives its innervation via the facial nerve (CN VII). The tensor tympani muscle attaches to the malleus, innervated by a branch of the trigeminal nerve's mandibular division. These muscles are necessary for the acoustic reflex, which functions to dampen loud sounds to prevent damage to the organ of Corti in the inner ear. It is important to note that branches of the facial nerve are in the middle ear space, and nerve damage during surgical procedures can lead to ipsilateral facial paralysis.

The inner ear is in the bony labyrinth of the temporal bone and has two distinct parts that serve two separate functions. Within the inner ear exists a cavity filled with semicircular canals which function to sense equilibrium. The cavity in which they lie is called the vestibule and is where the vestibular part of the VIII cranial nerve forms. The cochlea is a spiral cavity containing the organ of Corti that is responsible for converting fluid waves into nerve signals using hair cells that are interpreted by the central nervous system.
