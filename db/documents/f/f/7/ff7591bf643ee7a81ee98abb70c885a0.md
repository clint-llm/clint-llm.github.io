Case studies on millipede are primarily localized to tropical environments, and exposure is unlikely outside of warm, humid environments. Serious consideration should be given to the setting and likelihood of exposure. More common presenting causes of skin discoloration or hyperpigmentation in a clinical setting include burns, chemical exposure, traumatic injuries, non-accidental abuse, and other arthropod bites and exposure.
