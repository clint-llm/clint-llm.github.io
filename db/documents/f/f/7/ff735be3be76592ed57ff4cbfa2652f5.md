The impact of CHIP in enhancing clinical outcomes cannot be overemphasized.  A widely-cited study gives a breakdown of factors that affect mortality and estimates that the lack of access to medical care alone only explains about  10 percent of early mortality in the population as a whole.  Other factors that contribute to mortality are genetics (30 percent), social circumstances (15 percent), environmental exposure (5 percent), and behavioral factors (40 percent).

Relative to its effect on overall mortality, medical care may be an important determinant of children’s health. The role of medical care is also dependent on place, time, as well as context. For example, the routine screening of children for lead exposure may be of more value in an environment with older buildings.

Access to medical care for both underinsured or uninsured might also be an important determinant of morbidity and mortality in infectious disease outbreaks.
