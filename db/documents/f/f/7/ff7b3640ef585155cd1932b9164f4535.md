The UCL injuries can be categorized into 3 grades. A grade I injury refers to a stretched but still intact ligament. A grade II injury refers to a partial thickness tear of the ligament. A grade III injury refers to a complete rupture of the ligament. Most UCL injuries occur at the distal attachment on the proximal phalanx, and associated bony avulsion fractures are seen in 20% to 30% of UCL ruptures. When a grade III sprain occurs, the strong stress force may lead to a retracted proximal end of the UCL, lying superficial to the adductor pollicis aponeurosis. The interposition of the aponeurosis between the ruptured UCL and the proximal phalanx hampers reduction and healing of the torn ligament. This displaced tear, namely the Stener lesion, occurs in 64% to 87% of all grade III injuries.
