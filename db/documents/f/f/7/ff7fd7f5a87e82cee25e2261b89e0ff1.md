The definition of a bulla is an air-filled space of > 1 cm in diameter within the lung which has developed because of emphysematous destruction of the lung parenchyma. Emphysema is a limitation in airflow associated with a loss of the distal lung architecture with permanent enlargement of the alveolar space distal to the terminal bronchiole.
