Following surgery, patients need counsel on minimizing irritation and discomfort and taking steps to promote healing. These can include:

- Washing the area only with water, or if they must use soap, use a mild, unscented variety.

- Avoid scented tampons and douches

- Allow the area to dry well before covering.

- Wear loose-fitting undergarments and clothing, preferably of cotton

- Utilize non-scented talcum powder or moisture barrier creams to keep the area dry
