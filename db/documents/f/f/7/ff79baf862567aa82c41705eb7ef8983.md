Most patients present with asymptomatic microscopic hematuria or proteinuria that can be present for many years. Hypertension is initially found in a minority of patients but becomes common as the disease progresses to chronic kidney disease or end-stage renal disease. IgA nephropathy can present with gross hematuria, nephrotic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease and can escalate to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Episodic gross hematuria is commonly seen in children and young adults after upper respiratory tract infection. Synpharingitic macroscopic hematuria is a classic initial presentation of IgA nephropathy.
