Febrile seizures are seizures that are caused by a sudden spike in body temperature with fevers greater than 38C or 100.4F, with no other underlying seizure-provoking causes or diseases such as central nervous system (CNS) infections, electrolyte abnormalities, drug withdrawal, trauma, genetic predisposition or known epilepsy. Febrile seizures categorize as either simple febrile seizures or complex febrile seizures. Differentiation between simple and complex febrile seizures is important as the approach and workup for each is different.
