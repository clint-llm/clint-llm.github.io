- I: Involvement: One node or a group of adjacent nodes.  Extranodal status: Single extranodal lesions without nodal involvement.

- II: Involvement: Two or more nodal groups on the same side of the diaphragm.  Extranodal status: Stage I or II by nodal extent with limited contiguous extranodal involvement.

**Advanced**

- III: Involvement: Nodes on both sides of the diaphragm; nodes above the diaphragm with spleen involvement.

- IV: Involvement: Additional noncontiguous extra lymphatic involvement.
