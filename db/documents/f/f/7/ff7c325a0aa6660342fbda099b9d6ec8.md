There are 2 types of neuromuscular blocking agents that work at the neuromuscular junction: depolarizing and non-depolarizing. Depolarizing muscle relaxants act as acetylcholine (ACh) receptor agonists by binding to the ACh receptors of the motor endplate and generating an action potential. However, they are resistant to and not metabolized by acetylcholinesterase, leading to persistent depolarization of the muscle fibers, resulting in the patient's well-recognized muscle fasciculations and paralysis. This is in contrast to non-depolarizing muscle relaxants, which act as competitive antagonists. They bind (ACh) receptors but do not produce an action potential. Thus, they prevent ACh from binding, and as a result, neural endplate potentials do not develop.

After a depolarizing agent binds to the motor endplate receptor, the agent remains bound, and thus the endplate cannot repolarize. This is also known as a phase I block. It is during this depolarizing phase that transient muscle fasciculation occurs. After adequate depolarization, phase II (desensitizing phase) sets in, and the muscles are no longer receptive to acetylcholine released by the motor neurons. It is at this point that the depolarizing agent has fully achieved paralysis.

It is also important to recognize that these muscle relaxants target not only nicotinic receptors but also muscarinic receptors.
