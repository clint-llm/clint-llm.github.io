Trauma may be direct or indirect and blunt or penetrating. Direct penetrating traumas may occur by foreign objects, including glass, metal, or some organic materials. Indirect blunt traumas can occur by physical assaults, such as with a fist or bat, a finger poke, or may occur during vehicle accidents, such as an impact against the steering wheel. A dog bite injury represents a mixed blunt and penetrating direct trauma. Injuries from a fistfight represent the most common cause overall, regardless of age, while dog bites represent the most common cause among children. Injuries from falls are the most common cause among the elderly.

One of the first studies researching the etiology of canalicular lacerations demonstrated that 84% of this type of injury was caused by indirect trauma without injury to the eyelid.

A more recent study found that 55% of canalicular lacerations were due to direct, penetrating injuries, and this study further suggested that indirect injuries tend to have more extensive injuries to the facial bones, the globe of the eye, and other parts of the body.
