Amikacin is a beneficial drug to treat aerobic gram-negative infections. Healthcare workers, including the clinicians who prescribe it, should always check renal function regularly as the drug is nephrotoxic. In many inpatient facilities, the clinician or infectious disease specialist will initiate amikacin as part of the antimicrobial regimen and then allow the clinical pharmacist to handle dosing and subsequent dose adjustment. Nursing will perform drug administration and should have open access to both the clinicians and the pharmacists. If problems arise, the nurse or pharmacist must reach out to the clinician to adjust therapy. The interprofessional team, including all clinicians, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, should all be responsible for assessing treatment effectiveness and monitoring for side effects. [Level 5]
