Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (CPH) is a significant headache syndrome for medical providers to be aware of because it can cause significant disability if left untreated, and it generally responds very well toÂ treatment with indomethacin. Taking a thorough history, including headache frequency and duration, as well as the presence of associated cranial autonomic symptoms, is the key to diagnosing CPH. Cranial imaging and laboratory workup can help to rule out alternative diagnoses. A trial of indomethacin is appropriate for patients who meet the criteria for CPH and do not have contraindications to treatment such as peptic ulcers, prior stroke or myocardial infarction, or renal insufficiency. Gastrointestinal side effects can be seen with indomethacin, it is essential to monitor patients for GI side effects and to consider GI prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor while taking indomethacin.
