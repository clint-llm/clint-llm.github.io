The etiology of atypical moles is not well-characterized scientifically. Predisposing factors are a combination of genetic (internal) and environmental (external) factors.

Their presence is associated with specific genetic characteristics, including fair skin, lighter (blond) hair color, lighter shades of eye color, freckling propensity, and sun sensitivity. In particular, epidemiological studies have demonstrated a higher incidence of atypical moles in those with a history of increased ultraviolet (UV) sunlight exposure.

Nevi have been linked genetically to several chromosomal loci. Genome-wide studies have demonstrated that the presence of IRF4, PLA2G6, and MTAP are widely associated with melanocytic nevi count.
