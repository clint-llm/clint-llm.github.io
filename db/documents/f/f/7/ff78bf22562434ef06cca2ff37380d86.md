Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is frequently a transitory, self-resolving condition. It resolves spontaneously within months and is likely to be underdiagnosed. Notwithstanding, it may be complicated by several hazardous hematologic and metabolic alterations that are crucial to monitor, including thrombocytopenia, hypoglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and, most importantly, hypercalcemia. Management of patients with SCFN requires regular clinical follow-up for at least six months and laboratory monitoring of potential complications.

In the study of Mah√© et al., the meantime to recovery from SCFN was 86 days (range 25 to 180). After resolution, patients may develop residual lipoatrophy. Resolution of the thrombocytopenia occurs subsequently to the resolution of SCFN.

Stefanko et al. noticed that in 88% of the patients with hypercalcemia, the condition resolved within the first 84 days of life; nevertheless, one patient still had hypercalcemia at one year of age.

The associated hypercalcemia has the potential to induce significant kidney damage if left untreated, so it is essential to estimate kidney involvement with a renal sonogram. Nephrocalcinosis was present in 83% of patients evaluated by renal ultrasound.
