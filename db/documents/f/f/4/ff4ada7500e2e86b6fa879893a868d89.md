C. difficile is a gram-positive drumstick-shaped bacillus and a spore-forming obligate anaerobe that produces toxins. The organism is commonly found in water, air, human and animal feces, hospital surfaces, and soil. The optimum temperature for organism growth is about the 37-degree Celsius. The primary mode of disease transmission is the fecal-oral route. The organism produces two types of toxins which are major virulent factors: toxin A and toxin B. While a majority of pathogenic strains associated with C. difficile infection produce both toxin A and toxin B, strains that produce only toxin B have been reported globally.

Antibiotic use remains the leading risk factor for C. difficile infection. Several classes of antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolone, and clindamycin are implicated in the disease's cause. Apart from antibiotic usage, other risk factors involved in the causation include advanced age, chemotherapy, use of proton pump inhibitors, chronic renal disease, chronic liver disease, and malnutrition.
