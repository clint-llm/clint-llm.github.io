In spinal stenosis, the anteroposterior diameter of the spinal canal is very significant. The average diameter of a cervical spinal cord is usually greater than or equal to 13mm. When there is a diameter noted to be less than 10mm, this is considered significant for cervical spinal stenosis. The average diameter of a lumbar spinal cord is usually greater than or equal to 15mm. When there is a diameter noted to be less than 12mm, this is considered significant for spinal stenosis.

Radiographic imaging, often magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), is done to help confirm your suspicion of spinal stenosis after doing a thorough history and physical exam. However, CT myelography is the recommended imaging pre-operatively.
