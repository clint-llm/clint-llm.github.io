The main underlying etiology ofÂ linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD) is circulating IgA anti-basement membrane zone antibodies directed against the 97 kDa portion of BPAG2 (bullous pemphigoid antigen 2) in the lamina lucida.

As previously mentioned, drug-induced LABD is a frequent underlying cause in adults. The most frequently incriminated drug is vancomycin, which is responsible for nearly 50% of the cases of drug-induced LABD, but other antibiotics including penicillins, cephalosporins, and rarely, sulfonamides antibiotics may cause the erroneous formation of the IgA antibodies precipitating the clinical presentation of LABD. Other frequently implicated medications include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (specifically, captopril), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) class (diclofenac, naproxen, among others), and phenytoin. Numerous case reports of additional inciting medications are available in the literature, but a few of them include commonly used medications such as allopurinol, amiodarone, furosemide, atorvastatin, glyburide, angiotensin receptor blockers, verapamil, acetaminophen, and the influenza vaccination. Generally, drug-induced LABD typically starts within the first month of drug administration.
