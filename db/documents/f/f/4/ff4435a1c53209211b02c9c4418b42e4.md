The mylohyoid muscle mainly obtains its blood supply from the mylohyoid artery, a branch of the inferior alveolar artery, which is a branch of the first portion of the maxillary artery. The maxillary artery supplies components within the face and is a tributary of the external carotid artery formed deep to the mandible neck. A common course of the maxillary artery is from its origin point deep to the mandible neck extending between the mandible ramus and ligament of the sphenomandibular to the lateral pterygoid muscle and finally to the fossa of the pterygopalatine.Â Hence, one frequently sees references to the maxillary artery as having three divisions, which include the pterygoid, pterygopalatine, and mandibular segments. The mandibular portion (bony portion) has five major branches including the middle meningeal artery, accessory meningeal artery, deep auricular artery, anterior tympanic artery, and the inferior alveolar artery. The inferior alveolar artery yields the mylohyoid branch just before entering the mandibular foramen. The mylohyoid branch runs in the mylohyoid groove where it functions as the primary vascular source for the mylohyoid muscle.
