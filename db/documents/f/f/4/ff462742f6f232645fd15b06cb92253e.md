Piebaldism is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting melanocyte migration and development characterized by isolated congenital leukoderma (white skin) and poliosis (white hair) in a distinct ventral midlineÂ pattern. The most common cause of piebaldism is a mutation in the KIT proto-oncogene. However, researchers have identified other mutations.
