Diagnosis and management of the AP window require interprofessional input from different teams. Fetal cardiologists, perinatal providers, pediatric cardiologists, and pediatric cardiac surgeons play an essential role in the diagnosis and management of these defects. Lifelong follow-ups are often necessary for complex AP window patients to identify residual lesions and further management of these lesions. After a successful repair, aÂ sizeable percentage of patients have normal physical and echocardiographic of the heart and live a completely productive life with no exercise limitations.
