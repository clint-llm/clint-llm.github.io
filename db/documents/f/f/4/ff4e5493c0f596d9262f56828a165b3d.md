Any patient presenting to the outpatient department with an outward deviation of the eyeball, whether congenital or acquired, should be thoroughly evaluated by an ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologists should be well worse with the basic squint evaluation like the cover test, uncover test, and the alternate cover test.

Ideally, all patients should be evaluated by a pediatric ophthalmologist to pinpoint the correct diagnosis and decide about the management. Prompt diagnosis, meticulous management, and timely intervention are essential in these cases to prevent amblyopia and cosmetic disfigurement.
