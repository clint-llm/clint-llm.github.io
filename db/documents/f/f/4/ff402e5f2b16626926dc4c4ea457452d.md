Hair follicles and hair can be identified on skin biopsy under light microscopy. Immediately after a skin biopsy, the tissue is immersed in fixative to preserve tissue structure. Formalin (37% formaldehyde aqueous solution) is the most common fixative used in tissue preparation. Paraffin is used as an embedding medium, allowing the tissue to be thinly sliced into sections using a microtome. Then, the tissue sections are placed on glass slides with an adhesive mounting medium. Finally, the tissue may be stained using standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining protocols.
