Due to the serious toxic effects of daunorubicin therapy, strong interprofessional communication and care coordination are recommended among oncologists, family clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, and pharmacists. Administration of the drug should only be by a team trained in leukemia chemotherapy and centers with training on monitoring drug tolerance, toxic monitoring, and surveillance. There should also be effective resources available to treat any adverse effects related to daunorubicin therapy especially acute fatal infections or severe hemorrhage related to bone marrow suppression and decompensations due to acute congestive heart; in that case, cardiology referral is immediately necessary.

Dexarozoxane is recommended to prevent the cardiotoxic effects of daunorubicin and has shown effective results in large randomized clinical trials.
