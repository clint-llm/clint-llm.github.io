Lithium, a monovalent cation similar to sodium with an unknown mechanism, was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a mood-stabilizing medication for the treatment of mania in the 1970s. Lithium is a very powerful, antimanic medication with a narrow therapeutic index. This activity reviews the indications, mode of action, the toxicity of lithium and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with drug toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of lithium toxicity.
- Review lithium toxicokinetics.
- Summarize the treatment of lithium toxicity.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance care bundle approaches to manage lithium toxicity and improve patient outcomes.
