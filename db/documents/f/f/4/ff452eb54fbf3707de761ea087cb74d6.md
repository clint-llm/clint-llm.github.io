After stopping the patient from contact with the offending bagasse dust, complete resolution of symptoms usually occurs in 1 to 6 months. The chest X-ray returns to normal in 2 to 6 months, while pulmonary function normalizes in 2 to 4 months.

Patients with evidence of lung fibrosis on lung biopsy have a poorer prognosis than those without such changes.

HRCT scan can serve as a tool for predicting prognosis. A retrospective study of 69 patients revealed that the degree of fibrosis on these scans was linked with increased mortality.

Morbidity and mortality related to bagassosis vary widely based on several factors, such as type, duration, and severity of the exposure. Genetic factors may also play an imperative role. The prognosis is generally less favorable once fibrotic changes occur, such as in chronic cases.
