PCH is primarily diagnosed through history and physical examination. However, imaging may be warranted if intracranial pathology is suspected or red flags are found on examination. If so, a non-contrast head CT scan would be an appropriate first step.

According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3 Beta edition, the current criteria for diagnosis are as follows:

A. Any a headache fulfilling criteria C and D

B. Surgical craniotomy has been performed

C. A headache is reported to have developed within seven days after one of the following:

- The craniotomy

- Regaining of consciousness following the craniotomy

- Discontinuation of medication(s) that impair the ability to sense or report a headache following the craniotomy

D. Either of the following:

- A headache has resolved within three months after the craniotomy

- A headache has not yet resolved but three months have not yet passed since the craniotomy

E. Not properly accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

Of note, persistent headache attributed to craniotomy differs from the acute headache criteria by the fact that it persists for more than three months after the craniotomy. About a quarter of patients who develop an acute headache attributed to craniotomy experience a persistent headache attributed to craniotomy. When a headache following craniotomy becomes persistent, the possibility of a medication-overuse headache should be considered.
