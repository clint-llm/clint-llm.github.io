Virtually any diagnostic ultrasound machine can be used to perform a gastric ultrasound. Ideally, the machine should have the ability to measure the cross-sectional area (CSA). Abdominal imaging settings should be selected, if available. An appropriate imaging depth should be chosen to allow visualization of the abdominal aorta.

A low frequency (2 to 5 MHz) curved array probe is suitable for most patients. A higher frequency (5 to 13 MHz) linear probe may be suitable in small children, though care should be taken to ensure penetration is sufficient to allow imaging of the abdominal aorta.
