The location of the fracture is predictive of associated injuries:

- Temporal fractures, which are most common, are associated with carotid injury, injury to cranial nerves VII or VIII, and mastoidÂ cerebrospinal fluid leak.

- Anterior skull base fractures are associated with orbital injury, nasal cerebrospinal fluid leak, and injury to cranial nerve I.

- Central skull base fractures are associated with injury to cranial nerves III, IV, V or VI, and carotid injury.

- Posterior skull-based fractures are associated with a cervical spine injury, vertebral artery injury, and injury to the lower cranial nerves. These injuries are very serious and often the patients have hemiplegia or paraplegia

Associated injuries:

Basilar skull fractures are often associated with other central nervous systems (CNS) pathologies like epidural hematoma due to the weakness of the temporal bone and the close proximity of the middle meningeal artery.

At least 50% of basilar skull fractures are associated with another CNS injury and about 10% have cervical spine fracture.

The majority of basilar skull fractures involve the petrous bone, the external auditory canal, and tympanic membrane.
