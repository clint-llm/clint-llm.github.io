Clinicians need to consider possible side effects, interactions, and associated toxicities should before administering cyclophosphamide. As an immunosuppressive agent, cyclophosphamide toxicity correlates with the development of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. These conditions may lead to the occurrence of recurrent infections and may interfere with wound healing. Other symptoms of cyclophosphamide toxicity include GI disturbances, alopecia, hemorrhagic cystitis, renal tubular necrosis, infertility, pulmonary fibrosis, and cardiotoxicity. The manifestation of cyclophosphamide toxicity becomes aggravated by concurrent use of phenobarbital, other myelosuppressives, radiation, and succinylcholine.

To minimize the negative effects of cyclophosphamide toxicity, recommendations include monitoring the patientâ€™s hematologic profile and modification of treatment as needed. Patients should maintain adequate hydration, and mesna can be prescribed as prophylaxis against the development of hemorrhagic cystitis. If overdose is suspected, the patient or caregiver must seek emergency medical attention immediately.
