Most commonly, lacunar syndromes affect the elderly with long-standing hypertension. Otherwise, younger patients with lacunar syndromes may have a diagnosis of rare genetic conditions, such as CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy). The presenting complaint would usually not include cortical signs such as agnosia, aphasia, neglect, apraxia, or hemianopsia. These lacunar infarcts usually cause symptoms over minutes to hours but may progress with a stuttering course. The clinical features and physical exam findings of lacunar syndromes are characteristic of the type of lacunar syndrome.

Pure motor hemiparesis: The patient presents with weakness on one side of the body (face, arm, and leg) without cortical signs and sensory symptoms.

Pure sensory stroke: The patient presents with unilateral numbness of the face, arm, and leg without cortical signs or motor deficits. All sensory modalities will be impaired.

Ataxic hemiparesis: These patients present with unilateral limb ataxia and weakness that is out of proportion to the strength/motor deficit. Patients may also exhibit other ipsilateral cerebellar signs, such as dysarthria, dysmetria, and nystagmus, without exhibiting cortical signs.

Sensorimotor stroke: Patients present with weakness and numbness of the face, arm, and leg without cortical signs. Cortical function testing must be done meticulously to distinguish between a frontoparietal lobe (MCA) stroke and a subcortical stroke (posterior thalamus and internal capsule).

Dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome: This is the least common of all lacunar syndromes. Patients present with facial weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and dysmetria/clumsiness of one upper extremity.
