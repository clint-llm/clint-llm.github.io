Bile duct strictures are segments of the narrowing of the intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary ductal system. The narrowing impedes the normal antegrade flow of bile, causing proximal dilatation resulting in significant morbidity from the clinical and pathological sequelae of biliary obstruction. The management of these strictures depends on the etiology, which could be benign or malignant. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of bile duct strictures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of bile duct strictures.
- Outline the presentation of a patient with bile duct strictures.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with bile duct strictures.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with bile duct strictures.
