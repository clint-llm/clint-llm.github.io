Dimercaprol is formulated in peanut oil and is contraindicated in any patient with peanut allergies. Peanut oil is lipid-soluble and was inexpensive when dimercaprol came on the market. There is currently no other FDA-approved solvent for dimercaprol.

Dimercaprol is considered contraindicated in chronic inorganic and organic mercury exposure. Berlin and Rylander reported chronic exposure to organic mercury with dimercaprol therapy doubles the amount of mercury deposited in the brain compared to animals only receiving mercury. Therefore, DMSA is the optimal chelating agent in these cases.

Dimercaprol is contraindicated in hepatic insufficiency. In animal studies by Cameron et al., toxic symptoms and death were observed in rabbits and mice with hepatic damage treated with dimercaprol. These results occurred with doses well below the lethal dose in healthy animals.
