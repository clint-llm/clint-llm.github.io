Hypospadias is one of the commonest congenital anomalies in children. Various techniques have been described for its surgical repair. Early reconstruction provides the best functional and cosmetic outcomes. It has been highlighted that around 25% of the patients with hypospadias require a reoperation. Of these, less than half will require a second surgery within one year. Thus, patients and parents should be encouraged to consult skilled pediatric surgeons, not only for the reconstructive surgery but also for adequate follow up to ensure favorable long-term outcomes.
