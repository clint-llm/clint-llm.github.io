Pyogenic granuloma, sometimes known as granuloma pyogenicum, refers to a common, acquired, benign vascular tumor that arises in tissues such as the skin and mucous membranes. It is more accurately called a lobular capillary hemangioma. The lesion grossly appears as a solitary, red, pedunculated papule that is very friable. Less commonly, it may present as a sessile plaque. It shows rapid exophytic growth, with a surface that often undergoes ulceration. It is often seen on cutaneous or mucosal surfaces. Among the latter, it is most commonly seen within the oral cavity. Rarely, it may occur at other sites within the gastrointestinal tract. This activity orients the interprofessional team to this entity and helps them recognize, evaluate, and manage this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe pyogenic granuloma and its identifying features.
- Explain the evaluation of pyogenic granuloma.
- Outline the management options available for pyogenic granuloma.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance pyogenic granuloma care and improve outcomes.
