**General Information**

The term "muscular dystrophy" incorporates an assortment of hereditary disorders that lead to progressive, generalized disease of the muscle prompted by inadequate or missing glycoproteins in the muscle cell plasma membrane.

**Anatomy**

Research has established that the gracilis, semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and sartorius muscles can be affected in patients with muscular dystrophy.

**Natural History**

Onset usually occurs in the third to fourth decades.

Presentations may also incorporate asymptomatic elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK), exertion intolerance, dilated cardiomyopathy, malignant hyperthermia, quadriceps myopathy, language delay, and Turner syndrome (Duchenne in X chromosome monozygotic females).

Since the inheritance of muscular dystrophy can be X-linked, the overwhelming majority of patients are male.

**Patterns of Spread**

Muscular dystrophy can be caused by mutations in numerous genes and can be transferred in an X-linked, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive fashion.

Although the phenotypic characteristics of some of these disorders are definite, the phenotypic spectrum produced by mutations in various genes overlaps, whereby spanning to nonallelic heterogeneity.

Phenocopies are thus produced, which are incidents in which nongenetic diseases simulate a genetic disorder.
