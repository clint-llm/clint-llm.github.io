A thorough nasal endoscopy is performed using a 0 or 30-degree scope.  Then, the lateral nasal wall near the uncinate and the axilla of the middle turbinate are infiltrated with 1% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine using a 3 ml syringe and 27 gauge needle. Following that, oxymetazoline-soaked cotton pledgetts are placed in the middle meatus (though some surgeons prefer 4% cocaine solution).

The side to be operated on first is usually the side with more disease or the side that is more open in the case of septal deviation to one side.

**Excision of concha bullosa:**A concha bullosa within the middle turbinate can occasionally be present; excision of this cell is the first step to obtain better access to the lateral nasal wall. An incision in the anterior part of the middle turbinate is performed using a sharp sickle knife, and the lateral part of the turbinate is removed.

**Uncinectomy:**The middle turbinate is gently medialized using a Freer elevator to access the uncinate process. Uncinectomy can be performed in a retrograde fashion where the uncinate is identified and medialized off the lamina payracea using a ball tip probe. A backbiter is used to cut the uncinate inferiorly to avoid injury to the medial orbital wall. Blakesley forceps are used to grab and remove the free edge of the uncinate. The rest of the uncinate process is removed using biting instruments or the powered debrider until the maxillary ostium is visualized.

Another approach to uncinectomy would be to perform an incision in the uncinate process using a sickle knife or sharp edge of a Freer elevator.

**Maxillary antrostomy:**The natural ostium of the maxillary sinus is visualized after removing the uncinate. It is elliptical in shape and found in the lower part of the infundibulum. It is crucial to distinguish the natural ostium from the accessory ostium. The opening to the maxillary sinus is confirmed using a ball-tip probe and is best visualized with a 30 or 45-degree scope. Once confirmed, the natural ostium is enlarged using a through cutting instrument, punch forceps, and powered debrider. The ostium is enlarged posteriorly and inferiorly to avoid injury to the orbit superiorly and nasolacrimal duct anteriorly.

**Ethmoidectomy:**Ethmoidectomy can be performed using a 0 or a 30-degree scope. The cell that is first encountered in the ethmoid sinus is the ethmoid bulla. This large cell is penetrated medially and inferiorly using the powered debrider, curette, or punch forceps, or it can be removed retrogradely from the retrobullar space. The lamina papyracea is identified, and it is recommended to preserve its mucosa. Dissection should be carried posteriorly until the basal lamella is encountered and penetrated. Posterior ethmoid cells encountered posterior to the basal lamella are dissected between the middle and superior turbinate medially and the lamina papyracea laterally. Once the skull base is identified posteriorly at the face of the sphenoid, then dissection of the ethmoid cells is continued superiorly from posterior to anterior, septations are removed as the dissection moves forward. A 45-degree scope can be used while dissecting the superior cells. It is crucial to identify any dehiscence in the lamina payracea, to identify the ethmoid artery, and identify the skull base with direct vision (or with navigation, if being used) prior to dissecting superiorly; it is also important not to dissect medial to the superior attachment of the middle turbinate to avoid penetrating the fovea ethmoidalis.

**Sphenoidotomy:**The sphenoid ostium can be identified either transnasally medial to the middle turbinate or transethmoidally lateral to the middle turbinate. When identified transethmoidally, the sphenoid ostium is found in the infero-medial part of the posterior ethmoid. The inferior part of the superior turbinate is sometimes removed to have a better visualization of the spheno-ethmoidal recess and of the sphenoid ostium. The ostium is identified by gently sliding a probe along the face of the sphenoid. The probe will slide into the ostium once it is reached. Once identified, the ostium is enlarged inferiorly using Kerrison instruments or curettes. The sphenoidotomy can then be widened with a powered debrider. If sphenoethmoidal cells are present, the navigation system should be used to identify these cells, their septations, the skull base, and other surrounding structures such as the optic nerve and carotid artery and identify any dehiscence of these structures.

**Frontal sinusotomy:**The frontal sinus is the last sinus to be addressed in order to prevent bleeding from the frontal recess area obscuring visualization while working on more posterior and inferior cells. This sinus also has complex anatomy; therefore, navigation is very helpful when approaching the frontal recess. A 45 or 70-degree scope is used for better visualization while dissecting. The posterior wall of agger nasi cells obstructs the outflow of the frontal sinus. It is carefully dissected to relieve the obstruction. As mentioned in the anatomy section, the uncinate can have different superior attachments. When the uncinate process attaches to the middle turbinate, the frontal sinus drains into the infundibulum; therefore, the superior part of the uncinate should be removed to gain access to the frontal recess. A registered frontal probe helps identify the frontal recess, then curved curettes and frontal giraffe instruments are used to remove septations, dissect frontal cells, and widen the frontal recess.

During all steps, sparing the mucosa decreases the risk of scarring postoperatively and of osteogenesis. The middle turbinate’s vertical and horizontal attachments should be preserved to avoid destabilization of the turbinate. In the case of destabilization, there is a high risk of lateralization of the turbinate, causing scarring and obstruction of sinus drainage. In order to avoid lateralization, the anterior part of the turbinate can be removed, suturing of the turbinates to the septum can be performed, or nasal packing can be placed in the middle meatus. These options will help keep the turbinate in a medial position.

At the end of the procedure, any bony septations left are removed, and hemostasis is obtained. A dissolvable nasal pack can be placed as a middle meatus spacer.
