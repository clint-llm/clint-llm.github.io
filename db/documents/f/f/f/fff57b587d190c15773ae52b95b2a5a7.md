CSH can manifest as a syncopal attack that makes it a challenging task to approach it properly, especially when the historical carotid stimulation is not clear in the presentation (in case of sudden neck movement or a rush in blood pressure i.e. the patients will not always mention a carotid stimulation). Here are the most conditions that mimic CSH:

- Vasovagal syncope (preceded by prodromal symptoms and usually evoked via pain, or the scene of blood).

- Situational syncope (evoked via cough, defecation, and micturition ("a sudden increase in intraabdominal pressure").

- Orthostatic hypotension (change in blood pressure between standing and laying down).

- Cardiogenic syncope.

- Arrhythmias (Electrocardiogram and Holter monitor help in diagnosing).

- Myocardial infarction (ECG and cardiac enzymes).

- Massive pulmonary embolism.

- Severe Aortic stenosis.

- Seizures.

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

- Transient ischemic stroke.

- Loss of consciousness due to metabolic and toxic conditions (i.e., hypoglycemia).

- Medication adverse effect.

Hence, a proper wide approach not ignoring critical conditions should take place in the diagnosis process, each syncope case must be scanned and examined well, with the proper diagnostic plan and management. Anyway, some of the syncopal cases remain undiagnosed.
