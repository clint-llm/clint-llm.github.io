IDET is contraindicated for patients who have severe disc degeneration (greater than 50% disc height loss), extruded or sequestered herniated disc, radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, or spinal instability (such as spondylolisthesis). Also, this procedure is not recommended for patients with previous lumbar spine surgery or IDET before (within the last six months at the same level).
