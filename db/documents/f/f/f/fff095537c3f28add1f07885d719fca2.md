The goals of treatment include normalizing blood pressure, electrolytes and aldosterone levels. The treatment depends on the cause

Unilateral adrenalectomy in patients with a unilateral adenoma (Conn syndrome)Â cures hypertension in 30% to 60% of cases, but the mean cure rate is only 19% after unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy in patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism whose treatment mainly is medical. This treatment includes aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone or eplerenone or other potassium-sparing diuretics like amiloride.

To decrease risks of elevated blood pressure during surgery, patients need to be optimized preoperatively. Aldosterone antagonists like eplerenone and spironolactone are associated with survival benefits.

To lower blood pressure, spironolactone is preferred as it also normalizes serum potassium levels and plasma volume. In a small group of patients with glucocorticoid-mediated hyperaldosteronism, low doses of corticosteroids can help with blood pressure control.

Nonsurgical treatment is an option for patients who are frail and have numerous comorbidities. In addition, bilateral adrenal hyperplasia is also managed medically.

Adrenalectomy is used to excise unilateral lesions. Prior to surgery, the patient has to be treated with spironolactone for 4-6 weeks. Today, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is widely used to excise the adrenal gland.

Results

About 2/3rd of patients become normotensive after surgery but the blood pressure may take 6-12 months to stabilize. Over 5 years, only about 50% of patients will remain normotensive. Those who fail to respond to spironolactone prior to surgery will most likely continue to be hypertensive after surgery.
