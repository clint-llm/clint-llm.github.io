In children, the disease is self-limited. It may take anywhere from a few weeks to months for the illness to resolve spontaneously. In children, symptoms improve with treatment of CMV infection with ganciclovir.

In adults, the disease is generally progressive. There are few cases of resolution in adults after treating H. pylori infection.

It is suggested that patients with Menetrier disease are at increased risk of malignancies, including primarily gastric carcinoma and gastric lymphoma, so some recommend endoscopic surveillance on a regular basis for early detection of dysplasia or carcinoma.
