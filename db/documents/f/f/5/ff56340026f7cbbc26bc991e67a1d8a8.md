Pernio has many causes and requires management from an interprofessional team. Pernio caused by exposure to cold is best managed by the primary care provider or the emergency department.

Overall, coordination of care is mostly between the provider and the patient. The key to pernio is patient education. Patients should be told to dress appropriately in cold weather and discontinue smoking.

However, if secondary pernio is thought to be the diagnosis, particularly in association with systemic lupus erythematosus, coordinated care between the primary care physician, dermatologist, and rheumatologist can significantly aid in the treatment of both the pernio and the SLE or CHLE. For secondary causes of pernio, a wound care nurse should have involvement as recurrences are common. The protection of the underlying tissues is vital. The wound care nurse should communicate with the specialist to ensure that the patient is receiving the optimal treatment for the secondary disorder responsible for pernio. Interprofessional coordination between nursing and clinicians will result in better outcomes. [Level 5]
