Small fiber neuropathy presents with burning pain, often beginning in the extremities, most notably in the feet. It is due to the involvement of A-delta and C nerve fibers. It may occur idiopathically or due to metabolic, hereditary, infectious, immune-mediated, or toxic etiologies. It must be promptly diagnosed and treated to avoid pain, debility, or possible large nerve fiber involvement. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of small fiber neuropathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the different etiologies of small fiber neuropathy.
- Review the proper evaluation of small fiber neuropathy, including patient history and examination findings.
- Outline the management options available for small fiber neuropathy.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies useful for enhancing care coordination and communication to improve outcomes in small fiber neuropathy.
