Rhinoplasty remains among the most challenging procedures to master, requiring a sound understanding of nasal anatomy and surgical maneuvers with a focus on improving both nasal appearance and/or function. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients undergoing the open rhinoplasty and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the anatomical structures involved in the open rhinoplasty technique.
- Identify the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to the open rhinoplasty technique.
- Review the potential complications and clinical significance of the open rhinoplasty technique.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the open rhinoplasty technique and improve outcomes.
