During the first 18 to 24 hours of a fast, the vast majority of gluconeogenesis occurs in the liver. Following prolonged periods of starvation, however, the kidneys adapt to generate as much as 20% of total glucose produced. Only the liver and kidney can release free glucose from glucose 6-phosphate; other tissues lack the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase.
