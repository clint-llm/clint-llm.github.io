Although one of the least common knee injuries, physicians should maintain a high index of suspicion in diagnosing LCL and PLC injuries to treat symptoms and prevent complications properly. If LCL injury is suspected, a thorough physical examination is necessary, and an MRI of the knee is ordered. “RICE” therapy and immobilization of the knee should start early in the treatment process. Patients should receive a referral to an orthopedic surgeon for possible surgical intervention.
