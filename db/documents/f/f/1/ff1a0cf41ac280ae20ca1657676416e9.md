Infection results from the consumption of raw or undercooked meat (especially pork). The incubation period is 1 to 6 weeks. In humans, the severity of infection is related to the number of larvae ingested.

Classic trichinellosis symptoms usually occur in 2 weeks after consumption of raw or undercooked meat and can last up to 8 weeks. Symptoms include fevers, chills, myalgias, periorbital or facial edema, weakness, and fatigue. Reports also exist of prolonged diarrhea.
