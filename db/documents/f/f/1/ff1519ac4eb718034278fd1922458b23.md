Patients presenting with akathisia typically have recently started an antipsychotic agent, or their dose has been increased. Akathisia usually develops within the first 2 weeks of antipsychotic therapy. There are subjective and objective components to akathisia. Patients will typically describe a feeling of restlessness with a desire to move. Additionally, patients will be objectively seen manifesting that restlessness by pacing, rocking, and shifting position. Patients with akathisia often feel distressed and uncomfortable.

To assess the severity of akathisia, health care professionals may use tools like the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS).

Providers should be aware that inner restlessness often causes extreme anxiety and dysphoria in the individual. In chronic cases, akathisia has also been associated with a high risk of self-harm or suicidal behavior; therefore, the clinician should obtain a history of depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideations.
