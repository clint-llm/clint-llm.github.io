There are no contraindications for imatinib.

Imatinib gets metabolized through the enzyme cytochrome p450 3A4 (CYP3A4).

- Administration of imatinib with CYP3A4 inducers may reduce total imatinib exposure.

- Administration of imatinib with CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase total imatinib exposure.

- Avoid grapefruit juice as it can potentially increase the plasma concentration of imatinib.

- Imatinib will increase plasma concentrations of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs.
