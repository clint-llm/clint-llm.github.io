Commonly, Spigelian hernias are localized but asymptomatic protrusions through the abdominal wall. Patients may describe a painful or painless “bulge” in their abdominal wall, particularly when standing, that may acute or chronic onset. Depending on the contents contained within the hernia, pain may vary greatly in terms of severity, character, or location. Commonly, patients will present in the urgent setting secondary to complications associated related to a hernia. With this, the timing of symptom onset and evolution of symptoms should be ascertained, especially if a practitioner is concerned about incarceration or strangulation. Additional history should seek information related to chronic increases in abdominal pressure–chronic cough secondary to COPD, ascites, obesity, or pregnancy.

As described above, hernias can be contained deep to the external oblique musculature, which allows them to evade clinical detection and palpation. Physical exam sensitivity may be increased by examining the patient in the standing position and with Valsalva maneuvers.  However, not all patients with a Spigelian hernia present with a palpable mass, despite examining in several positions and with Valsalva. Thus, clinicians may be unable to appropriately diagnose up to 50% of Spigelian hernias with physical exam alone, particularly in obese patients.

These hernias often remain undiagnosed until they become painful or patients experience more sinister symptoms consistent with incarceration, strangulation, or bowel obstruction. Symptoms of a Spigelian hernia may include localized pain at the site of herniation, with or without palpable features. Due to the rigid borders that encase a Spigelian hernia, incarceration rates are significantly higher than other abdominal wall hernias. Several studies have shown that roughly 27% of diagnosed Spigelian hernias will incarcerate.

The manifestation that warrants immediate operative repair includes signs and symptoms consistent with strangulation or peritonitis – including an irreducible hernia with overlying erythema and tenderness, involuntary guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness. These signs coupled with clinical suspicion or objective evidence of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome are also factors that may influence operative urgency.
