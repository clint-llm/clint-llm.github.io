Otitis externa is a common disease and is usually managed by primary care providers. Patients with otitis externa rarely require hospitalization or consultation. Otorhinolaryngology is usually consulted for severe cases presenting with complete occlusion of the external ear canal or cases that do not respond to treatment in 72 hours, or when necrotizing otitis externa is suspected.
