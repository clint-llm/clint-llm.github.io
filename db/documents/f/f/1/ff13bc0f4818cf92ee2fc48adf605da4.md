The most common adverse effects of luspatercept are fatigue, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, dizziness/vertigo, nausea, diarrhea, cough, abdominal pain, dyspnea, hypertension, hyperuricemia, and hypersensitivity. Luspatercept is not a substitute for blood transfusions in the medically necessary. The bone pain, hyperuricemia, and hypertension side effects tend to be the grade 3Â or 4 reactions and can lead to a generalized decline of physical health.

Luspatercept doping is also a concern that may occur as the medication increases erythropoiesis and the formation of red blood cells. However, due to the long half-life of luspatercept, the ELISA screening and western blotting can be used to detect drugs in the human serum in the future. In a more recent study, the use of ammonium sulfate precipitate, immunoaffinity purification, tryptic digestion, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) developed an assay for the combination of sotatercept and luspatercept testing in doping control human serum samples. This assay is optimal and is a better application to use for sports drug testing.
