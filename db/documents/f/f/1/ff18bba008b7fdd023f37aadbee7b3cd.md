Diagnostic tests to consider include:

- Radiographs – PA and lateral and oblique

- CT – rarely needed. May occasionally be helpful in operative planning with complex peri-articular fractures such as pilon fractures at the base of middle phalanx fractures. It can be used to detect foreign bodies like plastic, glass, and wood.

- Ultrasound – detect objects that lack radiopacity

- MRI – unclear diagnosis, foreign material, or tumor

Mostly phalanx fractures are described by location (head, neck, shaft, base) and pattern (transverse, spiral, oblique, comminuted).
