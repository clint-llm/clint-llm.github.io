POCUS has become an integral part of patient care. Effective strategies for ultrasound simulation include developing an effective curriculum that is comprehensive in adherence to the recommended POCUS policy as outlined by ACEP. As such, simulation strategies should include didactics and clinical integration at the bedside. However, merely incorporating simulation into the POCUS curriculum is not sufficient as further understanding of simulation-based POCUS is needed to understand its effectiveness in preparing learners for clinical practice.
