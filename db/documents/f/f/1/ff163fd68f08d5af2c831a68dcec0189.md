Arsenic, a metalloid, naturally occurring in sediments and minerals, is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless chemical carcinogen.

Arsenic enters the bloodstream predominantly through gastrointestinal absorption. Entry through the respiratory route and transcutaneous absorption is also known to occur. A small portion of the absorbed arsenic gets excreted unchanged in the urine. The major portion undergoes hepatic biomethylation to monomethylarsonic acid and dimethyl arsenic acid and gets excreted in the urine.

Most of the accumulated arsenic gets excreted over time; however, keratin-rich tissue like nails, hair, and skin are an exception to this.
