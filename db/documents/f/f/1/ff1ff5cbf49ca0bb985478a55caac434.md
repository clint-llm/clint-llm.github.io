As usual, a thorough history and physical examination should be performed to guide clinical evaluation. Once recurrent laryngeal nerve injury is suspected, imaging can be considered. It is important to consider that the RLN travels from the base of the skull to the thorax, and imaging can involve any or all of these areas. For instance, a screening chest x-ray can be considered if a pulmonary cause is suspected. In general, evaluation with CT is the most common imaging modality and usually involves the entire length of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Evaluation with a CT scan can also show signs of possible vocal cord paralysis.

However, when patients present with vocal cord paralysis, direct laryngoscopy is usually considered before CT, and imaging is generally preferred as an adjunct study.

Laryngeal ultrasonography is also a newer technique that can be considered when evaluating recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. One study evaluated 112 patients for vocal cord palsy using ultrasonography and compared this with laryngoscopy, the current gold standard. It showed that laryngeal ultrasonography was 83.3% sensitive and 97.2% specific for detecting vocal cord palsy and had a negative predictive value of 99%.
