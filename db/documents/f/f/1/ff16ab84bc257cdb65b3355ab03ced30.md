There is no direct clinical significance to the evaluations of faculty debriefing after simulations. Instead, tools such as the OSAD, DASH, PADI, and others allow faculty to receive an assessment of their debriefing skills during a single simulation event, which may work to improve debriefing skills, which may then improve learning and impact clinical care.
