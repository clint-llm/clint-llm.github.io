Empirical treatment for an uncomplicated UTI caused by P. mirabilis (much like other uncomplicated UTIs) involves outpatient treatment with either a 3-day course of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) or an oral fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin).

Acute, uncomplicated pyelonephritis can be treated on an outpatient basis with fluoroquinolones, although a regimen of 7 to 14 days is recommended. An alternative to this treatment is a one-time dose of ceftriaxone or gentamycin followed by either TMP/SMZ, an oral fluoroquinolone, or cephalosporin for 7 to 14 days.

If a patient has a more severe condition or is in an inpatient setting, they may begin antibiotic therapy via intravenous administration of either ceftriaxone, gentamycin, fluoroquinolone, gentamycin plus ampicillin, or aztreonam until fever resolves. At this point, they may switch to oral therapy with either cephalosporin, an oral fluoroquinolone, or TMP/SMZ for up to 14 additional days.

If a patient presents with a complicated UTI (e.g., a man or woman with a history of an underlying condition that may increase the risk of failure of therapy), they may also be treated in an outpatient setting with oral antibiotics for 10 to 21 days as long as they receive adequate follow-up.

Proteus infection can be avoided with proper sanitation and hygiene, such as adequate sterilization of medical equipment and surfaces.Â  Additionally, catheterization should be reserved for patients for whom there is no other option.
