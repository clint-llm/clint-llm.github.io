A good clinical evaluation of allergic contact dermatitis involves a detailed history and physical. The morphology and location of the dermatitis is often the best indicator of the offending agent. Patch testing is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis and should be performed when ACD is suspected in patients with persistent symptoms. Patch testing can help determine the allergen to avoid future exposure. While patch testing is easy to perform, the test may be over-utilized, leading to higher costs for the patient. If the diagnosis is still not certain, a skin biopsy usually demonstrates spongiosis.

One should always rule out tinea as a cause of dermatitis.
