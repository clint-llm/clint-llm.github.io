In 2001, the American College of Sports Medicine recommended at least 150 minutes of PA per week to promote and maintain weight loss. However, they advised that 200 to 300 minutes of PA per week would be more effective in maintaining weight loss. This would correlate to 60 minutes of walking per day.

Multiple large trials have shown that the volume of PA is directly associated with successful maintenance of weight loss.et al. (2004) examined 1079 patients in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) at 1 and 3-year intervals following diet and lifestyle modification. Mean PA levels were 224 and 247 minutes, and weight loss goals were reached in 49% and 37% of patients at 1 and 3 years respectively.et al. (2011) used data from The Action for heath for Diabetes (Look AHEAD) study containing 5145 patients with DM to show a direct correlation between the amount of PA and weight loss over 4 years. Patients in the highest quartile of PA completed a mean 287 minutes of exercise per week and showed significant weight loss and maintenance of weight loss after 3 years.  However, successful maintenance of weight loss was shown in only 25% of the starting cohort after 3 years. Predictors of unsuccessful weight loss included poor adherence to PA and diet programs.et al. (2003) showed that high-intensity PA (approximately 75 minutes per day) improved maintenance of weight loss compared to lower intensity PA (~35 minutes per day).

Key protective factors for weight loss maintenance include adherence to high levels of PA, low calorie and low-fat diets, and self-monitoring of weight, diet, and exercise. Conversely, poor adherence to PA and dietary programs was associated with failure to maintain weight loss. The effectiveness of PA in the maintenance of weight loss is limited by patient adherence, thus becoming a complex issue comprising physical, physiological, and behavioral aspects.

There are several limitations of research into weight loss maintenance. The large studies rely on self-reporting of PA levels rather than direct monitoring. Prescribed PA had poor adherence in most studies, and self-reported adherence remains a key predictor of successful maintenance of weight loss.

PA, independent of calorie restriction, is an effective method for weight loss and weight loss maintenance.

Patients seeking to lose weight without changing dietary habits should be counseled that 225 to 400 minutes of exercise per week could be required, and even then, there is no guarantee of weight loss. This is especially true in patients with a high-calorie intake.

There is less evidence for weight loss in PA alone, rather than in conjunction with calorie restriction. High PA levels alone were shown to improve weight loss in the 1 and 2 Midwest Exercise Trial (MET 1) and (MET 2). MET 1 (131 patients) demonstrated significant weight loss associated with increased PA levels in male but not female patients.

Predictors of successful weight loss and weight loss maintenance include adherence to PA programs, diet control, and self-monitoring of weight, diet, and exercise programs. Whilst maintenance of weight loss is difficult, successful maintenance at 1 year is a good predictor of consistent maintenance into the future.

Independent of weight loss, PA effectively improves cardiovascular fitness and reduces cardiovascular risk factors, thereby reducing the morbidity and mortality of obesity.
