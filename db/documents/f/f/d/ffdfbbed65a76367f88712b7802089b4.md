The volar approach to the flexor tendons is important for the best possible exposure of the flexor tendons within their fibrous sheaths. This approach is used for exploration and repair of the flexor digitorum profundus tendons, repair of digital nerves and vessels, and exposure of the fibrous flexor sheaths for drainage of pus.

Operative treatment for avulsion injury of the flexor digitorum profundus (jersey finger) includes direct tendon repair, tendon reinsertion with a dorsal button, open reduction internal fixation of the fracture fragment, two-stage flexor tendon grafting, and distal interphalangeal arthrodesis.
