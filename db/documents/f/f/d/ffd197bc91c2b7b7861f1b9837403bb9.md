Prognosis of anemia varies based on the cause of anemia. Other factors contributing to the prognosis include:

- Age of the patient

- Severity of anemia

- Duration of anemia

- Comorbidities

- Access to medical care

- Diet

Elderly patients have a poor prognosis due to their advanced age, malnutrition, and multiple comorbidities they tend to have as they age. Patients in the developing world also have a poor prognosis due to malnutrition and lack of access to or delayed medical care.
