The ductus arteriosus derives from the 6th aortic arch. During embryonic development, this connection forms between the first portion of the pulmonary artery and the isthmus of the aorta. This provides a path through which fetal blood can be shunted away from the pulmonary circuit and delivered directly into the systemic circulation.
