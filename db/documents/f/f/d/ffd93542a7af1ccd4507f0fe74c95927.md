As with most personality disorders not included within cluster B, little to no research has been conducted to treat AVPD.

CBT emphasizes the acknowledgment of negative automatic thoughts and how these thoughts can negatively influence behavior. This enlightenment is then followed by the implementation of prosocial behavior to correct the aforementioned dysfunctional schemas. Some experts believe interpersonal therapy (ITP) can be beneficial for overcoming social anxiety and developing trust. Although no FDA-approved pharmacologic agent exists for the treatment of AVPD, anecdotal reports reveal the improvement of symptomatology following administration of psychotropics indicated for SAD, such as serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors.
