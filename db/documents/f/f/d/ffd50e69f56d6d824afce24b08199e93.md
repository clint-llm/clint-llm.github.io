The pyramidal tract, especially the corticospinal tract, plays a significant role in controlling voluntary muscular movements. As a result, severe lesions can cause many devastating consequences. Different insults can cause lesions in the pyramidal tract, which include strokes, tumors, hemorrhage, meningitis, trauma, and even multiple sclerosis.

Understanding the decussation of the corticospinal tract will help localize anatomical sites based on the clinical signs and symptoms and vice versa. Any damage to the tract above the level of decussation will lead to impairment on the contralateral side of the body. Lesions in the spinal cord below the level of decussation will manifest in the ipsilateral side Pyramidal tract lesions will lead to spasticity, hyperreflexia, clonus, and positive Babinski sign, as the pyramidal tract is a part of the upper motor neuron system

Meanwhile, lesions in the corticobulbar tract can manifest as pseudobulbar palsy, which presents as slow speech, dysphagia, dysarthria, spastic tongue. Additional corticobulbar tract lesions can lead to impaired function of cranial nerves VII and XII, which present as contralateral lower facial droop and weakness in the hypoglossal muscles.

Diseases that involve damage to the pyramidal tract include strokes, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), central pontine myelinolysis, Friedreich ataxia, and Brown-Sequard syndrome.
