Whenever a polytrauma patient comes to the emergency department, hospital, or any healthcare setting, the appropriate personnel, and healthcare providers must be available and present to manage and treat complicated and critical cases appropriately. It is essential to communicate and document any information that may be pertinent.  Communication is vital in all of medicine and possibly even more important in a trauma setting. The use of closed-loop communication has shown to decrease the number of medical errors overall and in some studies, decrease the time to complete tasks.

In floating knee injuries, the orthopedist, anesthesiologist or anesthetist, orthopedic nurse, and afterward, the physical therapist will all form the key components of the interprofessional orthopedic team. As outlined above, the nurse will be part of the pre-operative preparation, assist during the surgery, and provide post-op care, reporting any concerns to the surgeon. After appropriate recovery time, physical and/or occupational therapy will seek to restore functions, the patient can resume activities of daily living and return to work. Any setbacks or concerns noted by the therapists need to be communicated to the rest of the team. Only through this type of interprofessional team effort can traumatic injuries such as floating knee achieve optimal results for the patient. [Level 5]
