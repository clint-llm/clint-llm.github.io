An IOFB is a clinical diagnosis. Sometimes trivial trauma is not reported by the patient. They present after a few years with signs of siderosis. This can resemble a retinal degenerative condition such as retinitis pigmentosa with pale disc and retinal pigmentary epithelial degeneration.

In chalcosis, the copper deposition will be seenÂ near the limbus in the Descemet membrane, the Kayser-Fleischer ring similar to Wilson disease.

Sometimes, a fibrous tissue encasing an old retinal IOFB in the periphery can resemble a Toxocariasis granuloma. Ocular Toxocariasis is seen in young children with a history of close contact with a puppy.
