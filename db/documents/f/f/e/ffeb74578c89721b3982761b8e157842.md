Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) is an overlap between idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and connective tissue disease-associatedÂ  ILD, so the following conditions must be ruled out while making a diagnosis of IPAF.

- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)

- Connective tissue disease-associated ILD (CTD-ILD)

- Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP)

- Idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)

- Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP)
