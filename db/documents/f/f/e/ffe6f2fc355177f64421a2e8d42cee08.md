Multiple therapies are described for porokeratosis, including topical, systemic, and surgical. However, there have been no randomized controlled trials, so there are no international guidelines on treatment standards.

- Classical porokeratosis of Mibelli is most successfully treated with imiquimod cream.

- Linear porokeratosis responds well to topical or systemic retinoids.

- Disseminated porokeratosis can be treated successfully with topical vitamin D acid derivatives.

- Surgical interventions or cryotherapy are options for treatment in areas where topical agents are challenging to use or contraindicated.

- Topical steroids, retinoids, and topical diclofenac may provide symptomatic relief even if no lasting benefit occurs.

- In a small study, topical lovastatin was used to improve porokeratosis symptoms.
