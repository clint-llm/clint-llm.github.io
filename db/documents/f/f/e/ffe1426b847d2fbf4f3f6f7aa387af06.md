The clinician should obtain CBC, vitamin B12, folate, iron levels, hematocrit, and reticulocyte count before treatment. CBC usually reveals a macrocytic pattern (MCV > 100 fL) and hypersegmented neutrophils.

When giving cyanocobalamin to treat vitamin B12 deficiency, there is an increase in erythrocyte metabolism, which leads to hypokalemia. As the anemia is corrected, thrombocytosis could also occur. Therefore, clinicians should carefully monitor serum potassium levels and platelet count during therapy. Recommendations are to monitor vitamin B12 blood levels and peripheral blood counts for one month. Methylmalonic acid levels and Serum Transcobalamin II are the most specific laboratory markers of vitamin b12 deficiency. However, hypersegmented neutrophils have a sensitivity of 98% compared to serum cyanocobalamin, with a sensitivity of 90–95%. Thus,  peripheral blood smear analysis is a cost-effective tool for diagnosing and monitoring response to vitamin B12 deficiency.

The neurological symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency can range from paraesthesia and numbness to subacute combined degeneration(dorsal columns, lateral corticospinal tracts, and spinocerebellar tracts), which improves upon cyanocobalamin administration.

Clinicians should also monitor for dermatological manifestations of vitamin b12 deficiency, such as hyperpigmentation, hair and nail changes, and glossitis and improvement with therapy.
