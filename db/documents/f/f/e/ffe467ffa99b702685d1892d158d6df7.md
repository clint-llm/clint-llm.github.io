The superior tarsal muscle, known as Mullerâ€™s muscle, is a structural muscle which functions to maintain the elevation of the upper eyelid. It receives innervation from the sympathetic nervous system and is unique in that it consists of thin fibers of the smooth muscle. Damage to this muscle, or the nerves which supply it, will result in ptosis of the affected eye as seen in Horner syndrome, a condition in which there is damage to the cervical sympathetic chain. Surgeries which involve repair of ptosis, or upper eyelid correction procedures, will usually encounter Muller's muscle and should be very precise in adjustments when resecting portions of the upper eyelid.
