Cutaneous malakoplakia typically presents as a self-limited condition that rarely leads to death. Lesions can undergo spontaneous regression in immunocompetent individuals with a mean duration of 4Â to 6 months. In individuals treated with surgery with or without antibiotics, there has been a reported 81% cure rate. However, the course of the disease can be variable and can relapse, cause local disfigurement, or present with internal organ involvement despite medical and surgical management.
