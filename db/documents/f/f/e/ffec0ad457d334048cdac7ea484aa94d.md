All sexes are affected equally by lidocaine toxicity. Patients who are likely to be more susceptible to local anesthetic toxicity are patients at the extremes of age and women who areÂ pregnant. Rates of severe systemic toxicity (seizures with or without cardiac arrest) occur on the order of 1:10,000 for epidurals and up to 1:2000 for peripheral nerve blocks, depending on the type of block. Patients under sedation at increased risk.
