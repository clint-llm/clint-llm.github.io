The postoperative care for these patients should follow existing local protocol for any bowel resection (if performed) or emergency hernia repair. This would include adequate analgesia, bowel rest (following any early recovery scheme implemented locally), and wound care. This would be followed by early introduction of oral intake and mobilization.

There are no established protocols regarding the routine follow up of these patients. Generally, a postoperative follow up at 2 and 6 weeks following the operation might be required to ensure continued healing and patient satisfaction.
