**History**

Holiday heart syndrome typically refers to atrial fibrillation induced by binge alcohol consumption, frequently observed during long weekends, vacations, and holidays. The most common symptom that patients present with is palpitations.

Long-term alcohol use is often associated with multiple medical problems like chronic liver disease and alcohol-related cardiomyopathy. If co-existing, these conditions can have important prognostic implications.

**Physical Examination**

On presentation, patients may have signs of alcohol intoxication. They may have impaired mental status. Depending on their clinical manifestation, they may have elevated heart rates and low blood pressure. Pulses are thready and irregular. Cardiac auscultation may show irregularly irregular heart sounds. Chronic alcohol misusers with dilated cardiomyopathy may show clinical signs of congestive heart failure like elevated jugular venous pressure, extra heart sound (S3), crackles on lung auscultation, and lower extremity edema. Patients may have hepatomegaly on abdominal examination.
