Trombiculiasis, by definition, is caused by the bite of trombiculid mites and requires exposure to the preferred habitat of these larval mites. Once bitten, digestive enzymes secreted by the mite cause liquefaction of the host's epidermis, leading to a localized hypersensitivity reaction. This causes the papules, erythema, and urticaria that characterize the condition.
