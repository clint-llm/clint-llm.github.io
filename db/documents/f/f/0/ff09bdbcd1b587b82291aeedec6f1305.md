Registry study places the incidence of C2 fracture at 6 per 100000 people. In Sweden, of 6370 patients with C2 fractures: 51% were male, and the average age was 72 years. Those who were younger, male, and presenting with spinal cord injury were more likely to undergo surgical intervention. In the pediatric cohort, C1 to C2 injuries represented 7.7% of spine fractures presenting through a multi-institutional series following after trauma from multiple blunt mechanisms. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of C2 vertebral fractures and reviews the interprofessional team's role in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the unique vertebral anatomy of the second cervical vertebra (axis).
- Outline the components of evaluation/assessment for a patient presenting with a potential second cervical vertebra fracture, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Summarize the management options available for second cervical vertebra fractures, based on the specific fracture type.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving communication to advance medical care and improve outcomes for various types of C2 vertebral fractures.
