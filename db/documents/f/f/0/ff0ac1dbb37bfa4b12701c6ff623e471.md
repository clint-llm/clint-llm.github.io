The blood supply to the elbow joint derives from peri-articular anastomoses. Collateral and recurrent arterial branches from the brachial, deep brachial, ulnar, and radial arteries anastomose to provide consistent blood flow. The superior collateral branches include the radial collateral artery, superior ulnar collateral artery, and inferior ulnar collateral artery. The inferior collateral branches include the anterior ulnar recurrent artery, posterior ulnar recurrent artery, the radial recurrent artery, and the recurrent interosseous artery. The radial, ulnar, basilic, and brachial veins provide the elbow joint's venous outflow system.

There are two different sets of lymph nodes at the elbow, the superficial and deep cubital nodes. They are above the medial epicondyle. The superficial cubital nodes drain the medial side of the hand and the forearm. The deep cubital nodes drain the elbow joint itself. The efferent vessels travel more proximal and drain into the axillary lymph nodes before entering the thoracic duct on the left side and the right lymphatic duct on the right side.
