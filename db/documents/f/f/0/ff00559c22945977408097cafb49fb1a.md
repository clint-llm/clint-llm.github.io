Anticholinergic agents competitively block the binding of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors. Anticholinergics cause minimal blockade at nicotinic receptor sites. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are located in smooth muscle, the ciliary body of the eye, salivary glands, sweat glands, and the central nervous system (CNS). Muscarinic receptors are not found at the neuromuscular junction.
