The primary biomechanical role of the rotator cuff is to stabilize the glenohumeral joint by compressing the humeral head against the glenoid. These four muscles arise from the scapula and insert into the humerus. The tendons of the rotator cuff muscles blend with the joint capsule and form a musculotendinous collar that surrounds the posterior, superior, and anterior aspects of the joint, leaving the inferior aspect unprotected. This arrangement is an important factor since most shoulder luxations occur because the humerus slides inferiorly through the unprotected part of the joint. During arm movements, the rotator muscles contract and prevent the sliding of the head of the humerus, allowing full range of motion and providing stability.

Additionally, rotator cuff muscles help in the mobility of the shoulder joint by facilitating abduction, medial rotation, and lateral rotation.

- Subscapularis: Medial (internal) rotation of the shoulder

- Supraspinatus: Abduction of the arm

- 
              
- Necessary for the initial 0 to 15 degrees of shoulder abduction motion 
              
              
- The deltoid muscle abducts the arm beyond 15 degrees

- Infraspinatus: Lateral (external)  rotation of the shoulder

- Teres Minor: Lateral (external) rotation of the shoulder

During physical examination, each muscle can be evaluated independently based on its specific movements.
