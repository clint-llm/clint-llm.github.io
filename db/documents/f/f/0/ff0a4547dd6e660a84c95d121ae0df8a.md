Osteofibrous dysplasia is a rare form of fibrous dysplasia that primarily affects the tibia and is confined to the cortices. OFD comprises 0.2% of all primary bone tumors. It is most commonly detected during infancy and childhood, and the most frequent site is the cortical bone of the anterior mid-shaft of the tibia.
