The Bundled Payments for Care Improvement initiative (BPCI) by CMS has lead to systematic approaches by many institutions. Clinical care pathways (CCP) include an interprofessional team such as nursing, physical therapy occupational therapy, anesthesiologists, orthopedic surgeons, dietitians, and general surgeons. In patients suffering from obesity who are at increased risk of complications, potential weight loss with the assistance of a dietitian can be achieved. If they are unable to lose the necessary weight, bariatric surgery is a consideration. Immediate access to physical therapy, joint education classes, and improved pain management through nerve blocks and multimodal therapies has led to decreased opioid use and quicker mobilization. The implementation of these CCP's has shown improved patient-reported outcomes, early mobilization, reduced hospital length of stay, and reduction in hospital costs. Appropriate pre-admission testing and evaluation by primary care physicians and cardiac optimization have reduced the length of stay, mortality, and intensive care unit admissions.
