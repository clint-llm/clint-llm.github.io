Patients with active malignancy are at risk of developing venous and arterial thromboembolism. It is important to educate patients on their increased risk of developing cancer-associated thrombosis and possible presenting symptoms, including unilateral leg swelling, palpitations, chest pain, dyspnea, and stroke.

For non-cancer patients with unprovoked venous thromboembolism, it is crucial to perform age-appropriate cancer screening to evaluate for hidden malignancy.
