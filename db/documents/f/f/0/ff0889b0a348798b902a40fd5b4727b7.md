**Normal Vaginal Secretions**

Few vaginal secretions are expected in reproductive age women. The secretions are white and flocculent and consist of the desquamated vaginal mucosa, vaginal epithelium transudate, mucous secretions from the endocervix, endometrial gland secretions, lactic acid, Bartholin gland secretions and sebaceous gland secretions from the vulva. There will be a wide spectrum of what is normal from patient-to-patient.

**History**

Symptoms prompting evaluation include patient reports of abnormal vaginal discharge, malodorous discharge, vaginal irritation, dysuria, and dyspareunia. The differential diagnosis includes bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, trichomoniasis, desquamative inflammatory vaginitis, atrophic vaginitis, allergies, chemical irritation, cervicitis, and foreign bodies.

The evaluation should begin with a patient history noting the character of symptoms (discharge, pruritus, pain, bleeding, etc.) and their timing. The patient should be questioned about previous episodes of similar symptoms. Inquire about hygienic practices including the use of lubricants and douches. Obtain a sexual history and note previous sexually transmitted infections. Search for possible new allergen exposures. Finally, review the medical history looking for immune suppression and recent steroid or antibiotic use.

**Physical Exam**

The gross examination is completed to characterize any discharge present. pH testing should be completed with the testing strip placed directly into the vaginal pool or along the side wall. Cervical mucus, semen, and blood will all falsely elevate the pH.

A speculum exam should be performed with warm water. Lubricants can contain antibacterial agents that will affect the specimens. Make use of polyester-tipped swabs on plastic shafts, or specifically designated swabs from diagnostic test’s manufacturers. Cotton is toxic to Neisseria gonorrhea, and the wood in the shafts of swabs can be toxic to Chlamydia trachomatis.
