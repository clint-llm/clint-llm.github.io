Cyclodiode laser is generally not recommended in phthisical eyes with disorganized internal structures or where other alternative and more effective treatment modalities are available, especially in eyes with good vision or at risk of macular edema.

ECP is not recommended in patients with advanced pseudoexfoliation due to the material obstructing energy uptake.

Uveitic patients or neovascular glaucoma cases must also be considered carefully due to their risk of severe inflammation and hypotony post-operatively.
