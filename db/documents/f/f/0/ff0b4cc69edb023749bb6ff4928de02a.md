In patients with a non-anion gap metabolic acidosis, the following factors should be considered before labeling the diagnosis of RTA:

- As urea is converted to ammonia (NH3) and bicarbonate (HCO3) by urease-positive organisms, urinary tract infections by these organisms can cause a misleading increase in urine pH so a urinalysis and urine culture should be performed before diagnosing RTA, if indicated.

- Severe volume depletion which causes an increase in sodium reabsorption in the proximal tubule and decreased Na delivery to distal tubule also causes reduced proton secretion, raising the pH of urine. Thus, urine Na concentration should be greater than 25 meq/L for diagnosing RTA.

Incomplete distal RTA should be considered in any calcium stone formers with a urine pH persistently 5.5 or higher in the absence of urinary tract infection and normal or near normal serum HCO3 concentration.

The most common cause of type 2 proximal RTA in adults is monoclonal gammopathy which should be excluded in all adults with proximal RTA unless another cause is found.

Patients with proximal RTA should also be evaluated for Fanconi syndrome with serum and urine measurements looking for renal glycosuria, hypophosphatemia, and hypouricemia.
