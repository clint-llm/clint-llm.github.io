A high level of suspicion based on the history of presenting illness, clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory findings are required to make this rare diagnosis. Signs and symptoms of Reye syndrome typically develop between 12 hours and 3 weeks after recovery from a viral illness such as upper respiratory tract infection or gastroenteritis. The most common onset of vomiting occursÂ between 3 and 6 days after a viral illness. The CDC has described clinical progression as 5 distinct stages:

Stage 1

- Persistent, copious vomiting

- Lethargy, nightmares, increased somnolence

- Confusion

Stage 2

- Stupor, disorientation, combativeness, delirium

- Hyperreflexia, positive Babinski sign, lack of appropriate response to noxious stimuli, dilated and sluggish pupils

- Hyperventilation, tachycardia

Stage 3

- Obtunded, comatose, decorticate rigidity

Stage 4

- Pupil dilation with minimal response to light or fixed and dilated pupils, deconjugate gaze with caloric stimuli

- Deep coma with decerebrate rigidity

Stage 5

- Seizures

- Flaccid paralysis, absent deep tendon reflexes, no pupillary response

- Respiratory arrest

- Death
