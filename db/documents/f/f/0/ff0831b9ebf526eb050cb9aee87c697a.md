There is a wide clinical presentation of Meige syndrome. The patients with Meige syndrome usually belong to the age group of 30 to 70 years old (mean age is 55.7 years), but there are reports of teenage patients. There is a variable data available regarding the prevalence of isolated blepharospasm and craniocervical dystonias, estimated to be around 2% to 20%. More cases were reported in females as it has been hypothesized that specific estrogen receptors make females prone to involuntary muscle spasms.
