According to several clinical studies, infiltration of the abdominal cavity by neoplastic cells is inevitable following surgical manipulation during peritonectomy. The main goal of intraperitoneal chemotherapy is to eliminate these free tumor cells and any micrometastases that are not visible to the naked eye. Classically, HIPEC is performed after surgical resection and before reconstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. This potentially curative therapeutic option completes the concept of multimodal therapy, and it is increasingly needed for patients with peritoneal metastatic gastrointestinal and gynecological tumors and mainly peritoneal malignancies.

Several prospective studies have proven the superiority of the concept of multimodal therapy over a single systemic therapy in the treatment of metastatic cancers.

Van Driel et al. published in the New England journal of medicine the results of a multicenter randomized study on the treatment of peritoneal carcinoma in ovarian carcinoma. A statistically significant advantage was clearly demonstrated for the combined treatment compared to cytoreduction alone, especially in improving patient survival.

For peritoneal carcinoma of colorectal origin, Quenet et al. included a prospective randomized study of 265 patients over a period of 6 years who should benefit from HIPEC versus a comparator group with simple cytoreduction; the results are statistically significant.  The survival of patients who underwent HIPEC with a PCI score between 11 and 15 was better.

Despite the widespread use of HIPEC by several oncology centers, there is no consensus described on the method used, particularly the combinations of cytostatics, the concentration of cytostatics, the application time, the temperature, the infusion volume, and infusion duration, and optimal infusion mode.

According to several retrospective studies, the combination of chemotherapy, whether systemic or peritoneal, with surgical cytoreduction is still beneficial.

However, perioperative systemic chemotherapy's benefits in initially resectable peritoneal metastases of colorectal cancer remain a subject of discussion. According to a recent study (Deborah J Reppulo et al., 2021), a retrospective analysis of 125 patients treated with complete CRS  and HIPEC for Peritoneal malignancy (PM) from the colorectal origin with or without perioperative systemic chemotherapy (PCT).  In this study, the authors do not show any clear benefit of PCT in carefully selected patients undergoing  CRS and HIPEC for colorectal PM.

Concerning gastric tumors with peritoneal carcinomatosis, the prognosis is limited. The median survival of only 7 months improved after cytoreductive surgery to 12 months on average; in some studies, additional HIPEC has shown beneficial effects on survival.

For mucinous tumors with peritoneal dissemination, CRS / HIPEC has been well defined as the only effective treatment, based on retrospective and comparative studies (Chua TC et al. 2012), with an improvement in median survival up to 16.3 years.
