Continuous-wave Doppler: It applies the Doppler effect to moving blood red blood cells to assess flow velocity within a vessel. The Doppler probe is coupled to the skin with gel and angled to the direction of blood flow. Sound waves are emitted from and reflected back to the probe. These sound waves return with a different frequency based on blood flow. The changes in frequency are converted to an audible flow signal.

Plethysmography: It measures the volume change within a vessel via light, known as photoplethysmography (PPG). Infrared light is emitted from and reflected back to the probe. The blood volume affects how much light is reflected, which produces a waveform that is recorded and plotted on a graph. This modality is typically performed under normal conditions and then again after inflation of an occlusive cuff.

Pulse volume recording (PVR): A form of plethysmography used to measure arterial flow qualitatively indirectly. To obtain a PVR, a cuff is inflated to about 65mmHg and then attached to a plethysmograph. With each pulse, the blood volume affects the pressure of the cuff, which is then recorded as an arterial contour.

PVR is also used to detect reactive hyperemia or the response in blood flow following a period of ischemia.

During this study, an occlusive cuff is placed above the ankle for up to 5 minutes and then rapidly deflated. PVR is monitored distally once the cuff is taken down.
