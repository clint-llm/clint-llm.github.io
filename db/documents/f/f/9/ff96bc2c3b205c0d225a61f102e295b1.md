While the ERAS pathway seems ideal to implement in the perioperative system, its successful implementation is crucial. The ERAS system was first implemented two decades ago and therefore is not universally used across hospitals. These pathways require uprooting the traditional perioperative pathway and replacing it with evidence-based protocols. Other challenges include having adequate personnel to implement the system, proper communication, and the required collaboration between the different areas in the perioperative period.
