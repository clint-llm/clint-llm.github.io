Patients can receive busulfan either orally or IV. For pre-transplantation, patients who are over 12 kg in weight receive busulfan at a rate of 0.8 mg/kg every six hours for a total of 4 days. Pre-transplantation treatment also includes cyclophosphamide. IV administration is preferable to oral administration because multiple studies show a sizeable therapeutic variability among patientsÂ receiving therapy with oral busulfan.
