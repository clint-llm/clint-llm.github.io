Dr. Miller Fisher first described arterial pathology under lacunes in the mid-1900s. These vessels contained focal enlargements and small hemorrhagic extravasations through the endothelium of the arteries. Fibrinoid tissue replaces subintimal foam cells that then obliterate the vascular lumens. This process was described as fibrinoid degeneration and lipohyalinosis.
