The goal in the management of azotemia is the treat the underlying condition. For prerenal causes, IV fluid hydration and possible vasopressor support are crucial to re-establish adequate perfusion to the kidneys to optimize and salvage the integrity of the renal vasculature and tubules. Intrinsic renal diseases are so multifaceted and variable. Cessation of the toxic substances, avoidance of further use and contrast, followed by hydration, can allow for recovery to the kidney structures. Hypertension and diabetes are two of the most common disease processes that can adversely affect renal vascular and tubular epithelium and renal interstitium if poorly managed. Therefore, optimizing blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c are crucial for renal protection. For port-renal azotemia, relief of any obstruction followed by hydration is the mainstay. A urologic evaluation might be necessary, along with catheter placement.

Along with following BUN/Cr for normalization/stabilization, urine output is very important in ensuring adequate renal function. A minimum of 0.5 mL/kg per hour is considered reassured urine output and a sign of stable kidney function.
