Levator scapulae muscles derive from the paraxial mesoderm along with the rhomboid major and minor. Their development is induced by tailbud neuromesodermal progenitors by fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and Wnt signaling. The dorsal scapular nerve derives from the anterior (motor) rami of C5. The anterior root forms from the basal plate region of the spinal cord.

Anatomic variation of the subclavian artery can be implicated in failed supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks. Clinicians perform supraclavicular brachial plexus blocks for analgesia and anesthesia of the upper limb. Kohli et al. present a case of a variant branch of the subclavian artery visualized on ultrasound, which is hypothesized to be the dorsal scapular artery, passing through the brachial plexus nerve bundle.
