In the United States, there are similarities and variabilities in the function and content of the death certificate. Nevertheless, the death certificate in almost all the states conforms to the U.S. standard death certificate. There are 3 categories of information contained in the death certificate.

**Demographics and Statistics**

- Name

- Age

- Social security number

- Race

- Gender

**Method of Body Disposition**

- Funeral home

- Crematorium

- Burial

- Cemetery site

**Death Information**

- Date of death

- Time of death

- Manner of death

The pronouncement is a terminology that denotes the time when an individual is found to be legally dead. In forensic or medical examiner (ME) cases, this might not always correspond to the actual time of death. An individual living alone or in a remote area might have been dead for days or rarely years before the pronouncement is made.

**Pronouncement of Death**

This is the specific date and time an individual is found to be legally dead. The declaration can be made by a physician, medical examiner, or coroner.

**Date and Time of Death**

This is the date and time that an individual is thought to have actually died. This date and time might be actual or estimated. The date and time of death can be determined by a medical doctor, medical examiner, or coroner.

**Cause of Death**

This is the causal chain of events that ultimately leads to death.

**The Immediate Cause of Death**

This is the final event in the sequences of events that lead to death. This is what is filled in as the top diagnosis in the death certificate.

**The Underlying Cause of Death**

This is the initial event in the causal sequence that is the most remote from the time of death.

This information is filled in last, at the bottom of the death certificate.

**Manner of Death**

This is how death is classified based on the circumstances surrounding the death.

- Natural

- Accident

- Homicide

- Suicide

- Undetermined

**Medical Certifier of Death**

This is the individual responsible for completing the medical portion of the death certificate. This includes the time, date, cause, and manner of death.

**Electronic Death Registry**

The non-medical part of death certification can be filled out by the funeral director after the pronouncement of death. In the United States, most states file the non-medical portion using an electronic death filing system.

The electronic death filing system has several advantages in medical certification:

- Accuracy

- Timeliness

- Better surveillance of mortality

- Efficiency

In the electronic death filing, the funeral director fills in information related to the decedent's demographics, statistics, and bodily disposition. An appropriate medical certifier is then selected. In most states, online training or other forms of formal training is required before a health care practitioner can be a registered certifier of death. Most states have statutes that detail which individuals are certifiers of death. Once the non-medical part is completed, a “Fax Attestation for Medical Certification” is sent to the health care practitioner, who is then required to complete the medical part of the death certificate. The Fax Attestation for Medical Certification has a section that can only be completed by a medical certifier. After the completion of the form, the funeral director can verify the information before it is logged into the state registry. There are differences and variability in this process based on a state’s statute for death certificates.

**Medical Certification of Death**

Accuracy is the most important factor to be considered in the medical death certification. All dates should be indicated by day, month, and year. The time of death should be reported in a 24-hour clock format, military time. For example, if the time of death is 1 p.m., it should be recorded as 1300 on the death certificate.

**Part I**

The cause of death section in the death certificate should be filled out as specifically as possible. Part I reports the causal events that lead to death and is made up of part Ia to part Id.

The most "immediate" or "recent" event that leads to death is listed in line a. The other conditions are listed in Line b to and then sequentially. The last and most remote condition leading to death is listed as the “underlying” cause of death.

All conditions that fall between the immediate and underlying cause of death are known as intermediate or intermediary. The approximate interval between the onset of each of the events and time of death should be listed in hours, days, weeks, or months.

**Part II**

All other diseases and injuries that may have contributed to death but did necessarily precipitate the cascade of events leading to death are listed in part II.

**Examples of Completing a Death Certificate**

Example 1

- Part I

- a. Pulmonary edema (2 days) due to or as a consequence of
- b. Anasarca (2 months) due to or as a consequence of
- c. Chronic renal failure (5 years) due to or as a consequence of
- d. Systemic lupus erythematosus (15 years)

- Part II

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (20 years)
- The manner of death: natural
- Autopsy: yes/no

In this example, the immediate cause of death is pulmonary edema. Anasarca and chronic renal failure are the intermediate cause of death related to systemic lupus erythematosus, the underlying cause of death. The death certificate must be very specific. Edema has to specify the location: pulmonary edema. It is advisable to be as specific as possible when listing the cause of death. Abbreviations and acronyms are also best avoided.

Example 2

- Part I

- a. Fat embolism (2 hours) due to or as a consequence of
- b. Chronic tissue hypoxia (12 years) due to or as a consequence of
- c. Sickle cell anemia (12 years)

- Part II

- Moderate persistent asthma (7 years)
- The manner of death: natural
- Autopsy: yes/no

In this example, the immediate cause of death is a fat embolism. Chronic tissue hypoxia from sickle cell disease is a cause of chronic hypoxia that can cause fatty tissue to dislodge from the bone marrow. This is the intermediate cause of death. The underlying cause of death is sickle cell disease, which is the primary disease causing chronic hypoxia from abnormal hemoglobin with impaired oxygen-carrying capacity. The cause of death is what is required in the death certificate and not the mechanism. The mechanism of most death is usually cardiopulmonary arrest. It is not advisable to use this diagnosis in the death certificate as it does not specify the cause of death.
