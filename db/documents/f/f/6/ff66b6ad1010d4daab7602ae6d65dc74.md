An interprofessional approach to care, including neurosurgery, pediatrics, orthopedics, plastics, optometry, and ophthalmology, yields the most success. Special education programs and plans to identify a child’s strengths and weaknesses; and further development of a plan to improve the weaknesses identified are needed. Patients require holistic care including physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy and help and support for the visually impaired, and for school-age children, appropriately changed curricula and learning space. Development nurses are involved in ongoing care, monitoring patients, and facilitating referrals. [Level 5]
