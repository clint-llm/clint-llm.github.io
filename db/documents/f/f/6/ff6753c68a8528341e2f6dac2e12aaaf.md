The patient should be admitted to a hospital setting until the amnesia resolves. A toxicology screen, alcohol level, and basic labs including glucose and electrolytesÂ should be reviewed. Vitals, including oxygen saturation, should be checked. Because of the possibility of similar presentation with Wernicke encephalopathy, consider administering thiamine. If there are features suggestive of repetitive or seizure-like etiology, EEG could be considered, but it is not routinely recommended. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging is needed to rule out ischemic stroke, which can have a similar presentation in some cases. However, there is no diagnostic test for TGA; rather, it is a diagnosis of exclusion.
