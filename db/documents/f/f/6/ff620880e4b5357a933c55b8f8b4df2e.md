One of the most common safeguards for the ethical conduct of research involves the use of external reviewers known as an Institutional Review Board (IRB). Researchers seeking to begin a study must submit a full research proposal to the IRB, which includes specific data collection instruments, research advertisements, and informed consent documentation. The IRB may perform a complete or expedited review depending on the nature of the study and the risks involved. Until researchers obtain full IRB approval, they cannot contact potential participants or start collecting data. Sometimes, multi-site studies require approvals from several IRBs, all of which may have different forms and review processes.

A significant study aspect of interest to IRB members is the use of any participants from vulnerable groups. Vulnerable groups may include individuals who cannot give fully informed consent or those individuals who may be at elevated risk of unplanned side effects. Examples of vulnerable participants include pregnant women, children younger than the age of consent, terminally ill individuals, institutionalized individuals, and those with mental or emotional disabilities. In the case of minors, assent is also an element that must be addressed per Subpart D of the Code of Federal Regulations, 45 CFR 46.402 which defines assent to mean “a child's affirmative agreement to participate in research; mere failure to object should not, absent affirmative agreement, be construed as assent.”
