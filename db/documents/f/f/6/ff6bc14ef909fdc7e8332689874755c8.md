The suprascapular nerve has a motor and sensory innervation. Its motor innervation is to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. The supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles are two of the four muscles that make up the glenohumeral (shoulder) joint. The supraspinatus muscle originates from the supraspinous fossa of the posterior scapula. It then attaches to the superior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus. With innervation from the suprascapular nerve, the supraspinatus initiates and aids the deltoid in abduction of the arm, and acts in synergy with the rotator cuff muscles. The infraspinatus muscle originates from the infraspinous fossa of the posterior scapula. It then wraps around the lateral proximal humerus to attach to the middle facet of the greater tubercle. The infraspinatus acts to laterally rotate the arm and act in synergy with the rotator cuff muscles.
