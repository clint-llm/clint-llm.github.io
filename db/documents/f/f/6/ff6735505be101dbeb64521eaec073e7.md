Paying attention to changes in the patient’s status, particularly in terms of recurrence of chest discomfort or intractable pain is essential. Serial ECGs should be obtained in patients with chest pain. Furthermore, deliberate reassessment of these patients by physicians, nurses, and other staff members is essential to optimizing outcomes and providing expedient care.

Patients should be counseled on lifestyle modifications including weight loss, smoking/illicit drug secession, and the importance of medication adherence. This is particularly important after an AMI as cessation or non-compliance with antiplatelet agents in particular following PCI can lead to in-stent restenosis and additional AMI events.

The outcomes after a PMI depend on the time to treatment, type of treatment, patient age, the extent of infarct, hemodynamic changes,  and other comorbidities.
