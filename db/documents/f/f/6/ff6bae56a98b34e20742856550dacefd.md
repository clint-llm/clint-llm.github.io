When using a hysterosalpingogram as an imaging modality for infertility regarding tubal blockage, sensitivity and specificity are 53% and 87%, respectively.

The efficacy of hysterosalpingograms is limited to only being able to visualize patent cavities. While this can detect several anomalies, this imaging technique is limited because it cannot comment on the endometrial surface as a possible reason for infertility.
