No contraindications are formally present for performing physical examination techniques that test for Waddell signs. However,Â caution is warranted when performing specific provocative maneuvers. These include the axial loading, acetabular rotation, and distracted straight leg tests. For instance, axial loading should be avoided in patients with a severe neck or cervical spine injury. Avoidance of acetabular rotation is also recommended if there is a pathology in the hip joint, such as labral tears.
