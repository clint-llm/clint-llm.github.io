It is essential to elicit from the patient the timing and duration of any symptoms, any sick contacts, any family or medical history pertinent to the patient's chief complaint, and any recent upper respiratory illness the patient has experienced. Family members may be a good source of information to help narrow down a differential if the patient's mental status is altered or confused for some other reason. Pain is the most common complaint, and it can radiate to the jaw, upper chest, neck, and throat. It can be exacerbated by turning the head, coughing, and swallowing. Fever, malaise, body pains, fatigue, and anorexia are frequently associated with subacute thyroiditis. Patients can also have symptoms of hyperthyroidism like tachycardia, sweating, restlessness, and weight loss, but neck pain is the chief complaint.

A thorough physical exam should include a full HEENT (head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat) exam to rule out any other causes of neck pain. On examination, the thyroid gland is slightly enlarged and always tender to palpate. In most cases, both the thyroid lobes are involved initially; rarely, it can be unilateral, start on one side, and migrate to the side, called "creeping thyroiditis."
