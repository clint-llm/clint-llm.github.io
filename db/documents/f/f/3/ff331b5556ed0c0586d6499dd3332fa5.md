The initial presentation will include a decrease in normal hand function.

The MCP joints will be hyperextended, and the IP joints flexed.

The second and third digits will not be as involved as the fourth and fifth digits with a true ulnar nerve palsy. This is because the median nerve innervates the lumbricals involving the second and third digits, and the ulnar nerve innervates the lumbricals involving the fourth and fifth digits.

The patient may also exhibit functional weakness while attempting a grasp, grip, or pinch.

A provocative test for claw hand is bringing the MCP joints into flexion. This will correct the DIP and PIP joint deformities.

Several other specific tests for ulnar nerve palsy include:

- Froment sign: Hyperflexion of the thumb IP joint while attempting to pinch. This indicates a substitution of flexor pollicis longus (innervated by median nerve) for adductor pollicis (innervated by ulnar nerve).

- Jeanne sign: Reciprocal hyperextension of the thumb MCP joint indicating substitution of flexor pollicis longus (FPL) for adductor pollicis.

- Wartenberg sign: Abduction of the small finger at MCP joint indicating deficient palmar intrinsic muscle (innervated by ulnar nerve) with abduction from extensor digiti minimi (innervated by the radial nerve).

- Duchenne sign: Clawing of the ring and small fingers, hyperextension of MCP joints, and flexion of PIP joints indicating deficient interosseous and lumbrical muscles of the ring and small fingers.
