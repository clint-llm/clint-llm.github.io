Improved quality of patient care is attainable when there are communication and collaborative planning between all interprofessional healthcare team members, including physicians, mid-level practitioners (NPS and PAs), nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare workers involved in patient care. Before prescribing muscarinic receptor antagonists, clinicians should assess the patient’s condition, comorbidities, and current medication list. Furthermore, clinicians must empower their patients by educating them about the potential adverse effects of muscarinic receptor antagonists when prescribing this class of medications.

Patients must be cognizant of the adverse effects and immediately inform their clinician regarding any signs and symptoms of muscarinic antagonist toxicity. Nursing staff will often serve as the gateway to the prescriber and can provide valuable patient counseling and answer questions about new or existing antimuscarinic prescriptions. Pharmacists can contribute to the high quality of healthcare by being attentive to any possible drug-drug interactions that may lead to adverse outcomes, verifying appropriate dosing, educating the patient on the proper use of the medication, and answering patient questions. If the pharmacist or nurse notes a concerning adverse event or interaction, they must contact the prescribing clinician immediately to inform them so appropriate therapeutic intervention can occur.

Ultimately, patients are more likely to receive effective and safe healthcare, with improved outcomes and reduced adverse events, when managed by an interprofessional healthcare team successfully collaborating and communicating to provide integrative care. [Level 5]
