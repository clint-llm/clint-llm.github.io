Toric IOLs result in better patient satisfaction, and uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better is achieved in most patients.

Appropriate pre-operative workups for patient selection, intraoperative IOL alignment, and incidence of intraoperative and postoperative complications determine the outcomes of post-toric IOL implantation. The facilitation of posterior corneal power measurement by newer investigations has made estimations of both anterior and posterior corneal curvature possible. Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery, when combined with implantation of toric IOLs, may significantly reduce higher-order aberrations and superior visual outcomes.

Newer advanced toric IOLs have better stability limiting postoperative rotation and predictable visual outcomes. They may have an extended spectrum of indications like irregular astigmatism, higher corneal astigmatisms, post keratoplasty, and corneal ectatic cases.
