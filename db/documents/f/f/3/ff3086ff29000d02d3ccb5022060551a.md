Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of radiation therapy that is increasingly an option within neurosurgery in the treatment of tumors, vascular pathologies, and functional disorders (e.g. movement disorders, trigeminal neuralgia). This activity reviews the mechanism of stereotactic radiosurgery, evaluates the different devices available, and gives an overview of the indications, procedural technique, and complications. Additionally, this activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care for patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of stereotactic radiosurgery and explain the differences from conventional radiotherapy.
- Identify the types of devices available for stereotactic radiosurgery and their key differences.
- Explain the indications for stereotactic radiosurgery.
- Outline the importance of the interprofessional team in enhancing the delivery of optimal care for patients receiving stereotactic radiosurgery.
