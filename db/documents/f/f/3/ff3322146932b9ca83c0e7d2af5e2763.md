**SetPoint for Temperature Control**

- 37.1 C (98.8 F).

- This optimum temperature is called the "set point" of the temperature control mechanism—that is, all the temperature mechanisms continually attempt to bring the body temperature back to this set point.

**Artificial Hypothermia**

- The temperature of a person can be decreased by first administering a strong sedative to depress the hypothalamic temperature controller reactivity and then cooling the patient with ice or cooling blankets.

- The temperature can then be maintained below 90 degrees F for an extended period by a continual sprinkling of cool alcohol or water on the body.

- Such artificial cooling has been practiced during heart surgery so that the heart can be artificially stopped for many minutes at a time.

- Cooling to this extent does not result in tissue damage, but it does slow heart rate and significantly depresses cell metabolism so that the body's cells can survive one hour without blood flow during the surgical procedure.
