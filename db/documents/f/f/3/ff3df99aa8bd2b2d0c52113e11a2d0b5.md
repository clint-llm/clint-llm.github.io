The differential diagnosis includes:

- Achilles tendon pathology

- Soleus muscle injury

- Plantaris muscle injury

- Deep vein thrombosis

- Compartment syndrome

Among calf muscle injuries, injury of the medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle remains the most frequent. Plantaris strain is relatively rare. Soleus muscle has a lower risk of injury in contrast to the gastrocnemius muscle. The soleus muscle mainly consists of type 1 slow-twitch muscle fibers and crosses only the ankle joint. Soleus strain tends to be less severe than gastrocnemius strain.
