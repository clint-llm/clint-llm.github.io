There are various issues with the thyroid: toxic adenoma, goiter, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and malignancy. This list is not all-inclusive.

Ectopic thyroid tissue may be present in the tumor stroma ovarii, which occurs in the ovary. Another site of ectopic thyroid tissue is at the tongue termed lingual thyroid.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) is also of significance with three (3) types. MEN 1 (Wermer syndrome), MEN 2A, MEN 2B.

MEN1: Autosomal dominant, associated with the 3 Ps of parathyroid, pituitary gland abnormalities, and pancreatic islet cell tumors (insulinoma, glucagonoma, VIPoma, and gastrinoma)

MEN2A: RET mutation, associated with parathyroid, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma.

MEN2B: RET mutation, associated with parathyroid, medullary thyroid carcinoma, pheochromocytoma, and mucosal neuromas.

Graves disease is a primary cause of hyperthyroidism and is diagnosed by an elevated T4 and decreased TSH but, more specifically, antibodies against thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, also known as TRAb.

Hashimoto thyroiditis is a primary cause of hypothyroidism and is diagnosed by a decreased T4 and elevated TSH with antibodies against thyroperoxidase (TPO).
