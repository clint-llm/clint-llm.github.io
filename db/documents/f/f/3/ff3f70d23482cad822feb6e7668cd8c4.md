Over 100 cases have been reported in the literature at the global level. However, due to its overlapping features with other lipid disorders, it is likely underdiagnosed. Given the lack of testing for this condition, the true prevalence remains unknown. Some estimates show the prevalence may be as high as 1 in 50,000.

Given that clinical signs often appear early in life, patients are generally diagnosed in the first two decades of life. Delayed diagnosis can mean that patients may not be diagnosed until after suffering a cardiac event. In addition, given the widespread use of ezetimibe as a lipid therapy medication, false-negative testing may also occur in affected patients.
