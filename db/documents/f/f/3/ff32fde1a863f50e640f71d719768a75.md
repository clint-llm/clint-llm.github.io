A Stener lesion occurs when a complete distal, thumb ulnar collateral ligament tear results in the interposition of the aponeurosis of the adductor pollicis muscle between the metacarpophalangeal joint and torn ligament. Patients with this lesion present with ecchymosis, soft tissue swelling, and focal tenderness of the ulnar aspect of the thumb metacarpophalangeal joint. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of the Stener lesion and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the regional anatomy and pathoanatomy involved in a Stener lesion.
- Describe several conditions that may mimic a Stener lesion.
- Explain the imaging studies needed to identify a Stener lesion.
- Identify the importance of cooperation among the members of the interprofessional team in prompt diagnosis of this condition to prevent complications such as chronic thumb pain, osteoarthritis, and instability.
