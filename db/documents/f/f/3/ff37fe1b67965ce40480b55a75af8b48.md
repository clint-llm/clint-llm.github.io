The literature is currently expanding related to the incidence of seat belt injuries and the sensitivity of currently used diagnostic tests. Though these patterns of injury occur, no one would suggest one is safer without a seat belt. The seat belt sign may predict underlying injury with fairly high likelihood, but it appears that modern generation CT scanners will detect most if not all of these injuries. Disposition of the patient with seat belt injuries will depend on the injuries. No consensus has been established for admission criteria in patients with only soft tissue injury on physical exam or CT.

Clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists should work together to educate the public on the use of seatbelts. Despite the injuries that may occur from their use, the injuries sustained for the belt are usually far less than what might have occurred without their use.
