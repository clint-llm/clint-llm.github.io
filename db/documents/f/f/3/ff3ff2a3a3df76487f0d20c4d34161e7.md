Ampullary cancer patients with T2 or above stage or lymph node-positive tumors are associated with increased recurrence risk and therefore, could be benefitted from adjuvant treatment. A common strategy in the United States is adjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine or fluoropyrimidine for 6 months if systemic therapy alone is chosen. Patients presented with large tumors, positive margins, and node positivity are currently being treated with adding 6 weeks of concurrent chemoradiation eight upfront or the end of systemic chemotherapy.

TheÂ American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system uses the TNM system.
