The diagnosis and management of posterior vitreous detachment are crucial. The patient presenting with complaints of sudden onset floaters or photopsia should be managed by a team, including an optometrist, general ophthalmologist, experienced vitreoretinal expert, and ophthalmology nurses. The nurses participate in patients' education, counseling, and follow up, informing the ophthalmologist of any issues. This collaborative approach can ensure optimal patient outcomes.
