An interprofessional team of clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists should work closely with the patient and family members to obtain a thorough history and physical examination for proper diagnosis. Due to the self-resolving nature of pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta, follow-up visits should occur every three to six months if there is no desire for treatment.

Office visits are useful for reevaluating and ensuring no further disease progression or diagnosis change. Patients who choose to receive treatment, such as antibiotics, phototherapy, or corticosteroids, should be monitored closely to assess efficacy.

Nursing can serve as a liaison contact point for the treating clinicians, specialists, and other healthcare providers, providing patient counseling and keeping all parties informed of changes in patient status. The pharmacist can ensure proper dosing and screen for interactions when pharmaceutical care is opted for, reporting any concerns to the nurse of prescribing clinicians. This interprofessional approach will yield the best patient outcomes. [Level 5]
