Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo recurrence rates are 50% at 5 years. There is the persistence of dizziness related to anxiety in almost a third of patients 1 year after vestibular neuritis.

According to Perrez-Garrigues et al., the number of episodes of vertigo is higher in the first years of the disease and decreases in later years regardless of whether patients receive treatment; most patients reach a "steady-state phase free of vertigo."

As with vertigo, loss of hearing is highest in the early years of the disease and stabilizes in later years. Usually, there is no recovery from hearing loss.

The acute vertigo of labyrinthitis should resolve within a couple of days; however, milder symptoms may persist for a number of weeks. Provided the patient had no serious neurological sequelae, the prognosis is usually good. However, patients with neurological complications may require further interventions. For example, ventriculoperitoneal shunts may be required in patients with hydrocephalus secondary to bacterial meningitis.
