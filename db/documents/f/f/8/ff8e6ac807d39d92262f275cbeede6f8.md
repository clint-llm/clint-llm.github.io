Acute dyspnea typically is due to a more life-threatening process and requires rapid intervention. All patients should be placed on supplemental oxygen, pulse oximetry, and a cardiac monitor. Then the appropriate therapy should be initiated based on the suspected or diagnosed etiology. If respiratory failure is imminent, there should be a low threshold for intubating patients. Diagnostic workup should be performed only once appropriate, and the patient is stable.
