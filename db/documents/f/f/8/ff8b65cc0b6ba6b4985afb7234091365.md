Condyloma acuminata is typically a clinical diagnosis, and histopathologic examination of the lesions is generally unnecessary. Microscopic evaluation of the tissue will display acanthosis with overlying hyperkeratosis. Distinctive cells termed koilocytes are also identifiable. Koilocytes are large keratinocytes with abundant cytoplasm and small pyknotic nuclei. These characteristic cells are often present in the upper layers of the epidermis. Additionally, condyloma acuminata can be differentiated from verruca vulgaris by the type of hyperplasia present. Spiked verrucous hyperplasia is seen in verruca vulgaris, while papillomatosis will display in condyloma acuminata.
