Factors that clinician shouldÂ consider before conducting thyroid uptake and scan are as follows

- Diarrhea that can decrease the absorption of the dye if given orally

- Head CT with oral or intravenous contrast within the past two weeks

- Unacceptable quantity of iodine in the diet

- Hypochloremia that can increase the absorption of the radiotracer

- Iodine containing drugs (amiodarone)

- Thyroid hormone replacement and antithyroid drugs

- Chronic renal failure that impairs iodide clearance, expands the iodide pool, and lowers the %RAIU
