Hyperkeratosis refers to the increased thickness of the stratum corneum, the outer layer of the skin. It is most frequently due to chronic physical or chemical damage such as friction or the use of aggressive soaps but can also derive from chronic inflammation or a side-effect of different drugs, including chemotherapy. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of hyperkeratosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hyperkeratosis. 
- Summarize the major histologic forms of hyperkeratosis.

- Review the different pathologies that can manifest with hyperkeratosis.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate diagnosis and treatment is selected for patients with hyperkeratosis.
