When evaluating a painful tooth, attempting to reproduce the patient's symptoms is essential before beginning any treatment. Reproducing the patient's symptoms helps formulate the correct diagnosis and ensures that the treatment matches the appropriate diagnosis.

Pulp testing typically consists of various measures, including evaluating tooth vitality, sensibility, and sensitivity.

In acute apical periodontitis, the dental pulp may remain vital or have lost vitality and become necrotic. The tooth will be tender and painful on percussion. Radiographic examination is usually unremarkable, or there may be just a small thickening of the periodontal ligament space and a slight loss of lamina dura in the periapex. By contrast, in chronic apical periodontitis, the pulp is necrotic and infected; therefore, pulp sensibility tests will not elicit a response. The tooth is not tender to palpation, pressure, or percussion, but it may have some mobility and feel different. The findingÂ of a radiolucent lesion in the periapex on x-ray marks the stage of chronic apical periodontitis.
