Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme found in the cytoplasm of all cells in the body. It is a housekeeping enzyme that plays a vital role in the prevention of cellular damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS). It does this by providing substrates to prevent oxidative damage. Erythrocytes are particularly vulnerable to ROS due to their role in oxygen transport and inability to replace cellular proteins as mature cells. Inherited deficiencies of G6PD can result in acute hemolytic anemia during times of increased ROS production. This may be caused by stress or exposure to certain foods that contain high amounts of oxidative substances, for example, fava beans, or certain medications.  In particular, anti-malarial agents have a strong association with inducing hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PD deficiency. Below are medications more commonly used in the United States that have been shown to trigger a hemolytic crisis in those with G6PD deficiency; however, a more comprehensive list of medications to be avoided has been published by the Italian G6PD Deficiency Association and can be found at www.g6pd.org.
