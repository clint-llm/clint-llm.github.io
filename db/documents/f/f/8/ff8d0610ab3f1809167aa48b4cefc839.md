Arytenoid subluxation or dislocation is a rare laryngeal injury that occurs as a result of airway instrumentation or direct trauma to the cricoarytenoid joint, leading to the partial (subluxation) or total (dislocation) displacement of the arytenoid cartilage within the cricoarytenoid joint. Patients present with persistent postoperative hoarseness, dysphagia, and occasionally dyspnea. This activity reviews the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of arytenoid subluxation and dislocation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors leading to arytenoid subluxation or dislocation.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with arytenoid subluxation or dislocation.
- Review the treatment and management options available for arytenoid subluxation or dislocation.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients with arytenoid subluxation or dislocation.
