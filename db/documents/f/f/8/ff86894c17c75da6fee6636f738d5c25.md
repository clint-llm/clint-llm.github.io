The diameter and disease status of the external iliac artery plays an important role in planning an endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. Endovascular access to the abdominal aorta usually involves passing guide wires and sheaths from the common femoral artery, through the external and common iliac arteries, and into the aorta. An extremely small caliber, tortuous, or calcified external iliac artery may necessitate alternative vascular access techniques or conversion to open surgery.

Corona Mortis, a vascular connection between the internal and external iliac vessels, can be injured during surgery. Inadvertent transection of the Corona Mortis can cause the vessel to retract inferiorly or through the obturator foramen, severely compromising vascular control for hemostasis. Pelvic osteotomies using the medial approach, as well as acetabular fracture procedures using the ilioinguinal approach, pose the highest risk for severing a Corona Mortis vessel.

Surgical or endovascular manipulation can cause dissection of the external iliac artery.
