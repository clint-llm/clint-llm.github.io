One diagnostic and differentiating feature of amyloidosis is the apple-green birefringence of amyloid on congo red staining. Apart from this, amyloid has an amorphous eosinophilic appearance, when viewed with hematoxylin and eosin staining. On x-ray diffraction analysis, it has a beta-pleated sheet structure.
