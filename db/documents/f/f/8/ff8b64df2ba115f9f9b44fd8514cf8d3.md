Complications of surgery performed for intra-abdominal adhesions are similar to complications from any intra-abdominal surgery. These can include bleeding, infection, damage to surrounding structures including enterotomies, and increased risk for formation of adhesions in the future. Patients who undergo surgery for adhesions are also at risk for cardiopulmonary complicationsÂ related to anesthesia as well as thromboembolic events.
