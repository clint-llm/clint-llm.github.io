Proper oral care, eating foods cleared by a speech and language professional, and practicing appropriate posture and positioning are all important to educate patients on who is at risk for chronic aspiration. Despite several available treatment options, no perfect options exist. There are concerns for micro and macro aspiration in several treatment options. Thus after carefully evaluating all available treatment options, patients should decide whether or not they should pursue any of those available treatment options.

Patients have a right to choose their treatment and may choose to continue to eat/drink despite the risks of aspiration pneumonia. For pediatric patients, it is essential to inform parents of early signs that their child may be aspirating, especially those at higher risk because of cognitive delay or neuromuscular disorders. In the elderly population, it is important to inform both the patient and those closest to them and who spend the most time involved in their care about the signs and symptoms of aspiration so that they can get appropriate help quickly.
