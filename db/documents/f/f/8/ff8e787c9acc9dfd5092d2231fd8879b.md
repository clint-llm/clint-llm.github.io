The paucity of good evidence to support specific values for a normal BAL, leaves us to pay attention to the specific cell line cut offs that certain support diagnoses such as:

- Increased Neutrophils (>5%)

- Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), infection, connective tissue disorders.

- Eosinophilia 

- >25%: suggesting eosinophilic lung diseases such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and Churg-Strauss syndrome

- Lymphocytosis

- > 50% : Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis
- When greater than or equal to 15% Lymphocytes are present, CD4/CD8 ratios can be assessed.

- Elevated CD4/CD8: hypersensitivity pneumonitis (chronic or smoker), sarcoidosis, berylliosis, asbestosis, Crohn disease, connective tissue disorders
- Normal CD4/CD8: Tuberculosis, malignancies
- Low CD4/CD8: acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis, silicosis, drug-induced lung disease, HIV infection, BOOP (COP)

Progressively darkening aliquots of bloody BAL fluid is highly suggestive of DAH. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages can also be evident on BAL analysis.

If chronic berylliosis is suspected, a positive lymphocyte proliferation test will be positive.
