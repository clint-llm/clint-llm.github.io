Most often, patients with epiretinal membrane (ERM) are asymptomatic clinically and are frequently diagnosed during a routine clinical examination. In some patients, ERM progresses to cause metamorphopsia, micropsia or macropsia, photopsia, decreased visual acuity, diplopia, and loss of central vision. Metamorphopsia especially interferes with the quality of life affecting reading, writing, and most of the regular day-to-day activities of living. All asymptomatic patients should be trained to do self-monitoring periodically with Amsler grid charting. History taking should include previous ocular trauma or episodes of floaters or flashes of light, diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesteremia. ERM causes retinal striae, which progresses in some patients to retinal folds, progressive contracture, and macular pseudohole. Rarely spontaneous separation of the membrane occurs, causing premacular floaters.
