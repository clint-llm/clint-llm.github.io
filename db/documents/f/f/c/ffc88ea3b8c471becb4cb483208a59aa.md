Patients presenting with distal clavicular osteolysis typically reveal a history of weight lifting, frequent repetitive overhead movements (typically from various sports), or trauma to the AC joint.

Often, the account includes an increased emphasis on bench pressing or similar activities that increase traction or compression stress on the AC joint. These movements worsen pain (i.e., bench pressing, hang cleans, overhead press). They also likely have a pattern of pain improving with cessation of instigating activities and then worsening on resumption of activity. A typical presentation features the gradual onset of dull aching pain, which may be unilateral or bilateral over the distal clavicle and AC joint.

A physical exam denotes pain with palpation over the area of the AC joint. Strength is often preserved but may have some pain inhibition during testing. Range of motion is also typically complete and pain-free outside of the extremes of shoulder abduction and internal rotation. Loading of the AC joint through Hawkins and Scarf tests elicits pain. Including a cervical spine and neurologic exam helps rule out referred pain.
