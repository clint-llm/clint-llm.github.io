Hepatic adenomas are benign liver lesions and have been linked to anabolic steroids and the oral contraceptive pill. The majority of these lesions are seen in women of childbearing age who are on the pill. Even though the lesions are benign, there is a risk of bleeding and malignant transformation.

While interprofessional management of the disorder is primarily by the gastroenterologist and the surgeon, the primary focus today is on prevention. Both the pharmacist and nurse play a vital role in patient education. Interprofessional management will result in improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]

All women who are prescribed the oral contraceptive should be warned about the possibility of developing this lesion—the lower the dose, the lower the risk. If the female has no other contraception options, she should be educated on the symptoms of a hepatic adenoma and when to seek help. Before getting pregnant, the female should be encouraged to have a liver ultrasound to ensure no lesion is present. Pregnancy in the presence of a hepatic adenoma can significantly increase the risk of hemorrhage and maternal mortality. All females who develop symptoms should be encouraged to have the lesion excised. Finally, the patient should undergo annual screening for liver cancer, especially if the lesion is larger than 5 cm.

**Outcomes**

- In the majority of patients with a hepatocellular adenoma, a complete resolution is not possible.

- About 25% of women will continue to have right upper quadrant pain, and hemorrhage may occur in 30% to 45% of women. The hemorrhage may be within the lesion or the peritoneum. The larger the lesion, the higher the risk of hemorrhage.

- Pregnancy has been associated with hepatic adenoma. Further, the risk of rupture is also known to increase during pregnancy, resulting in high maternal and fetal mortality.

- The overall risk of malignancy ranges from 4% to 10%. The risk of malignancy persists even after the oral contraceptives have been discontinued.
