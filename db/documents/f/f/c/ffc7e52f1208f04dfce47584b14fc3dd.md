The prognosis of hyperoxaluria depends on the type of hyperoxaluria, time of diagnosis, and early initiation of treatment, amongst other things.

Most patients with secondary hyperoxaluria can be controlled by dietary measures combined with increased urinary volume, optimization of all other urinary stone chemistries, and various supplements/treatments as outlined earlier.

Studies suggest that most enteric hyperoxaluria patients have a better prognosis if medical interventions are initiated early, coupled with dietary measures that are strictly followed. The patient is maintained on a low oxalate diet continuously while being treated for their underlying condition. Calcium citrate and potassium citrate are the primary medical treatments, with liquid therapies being preferred. Optimization of all other urinary stone chemistries is also recommended. Cholestyramine is reasonable to help control both hyperoxaluria and chronic diarrhea, often associated with enteric hyperoxaluria. Reasonable control of stone production is usually possible with aggressive treatment. However, if ESRD does occur in these patients, careful monitoring of peri-transplantation and post-transplantation oxalate, along with maintaining an adequate urine output, should be done.

Primary Hyperoxaluria Type 1 reportedly has the worst prognosis, with a very high possibility of the patient developing nephrocalcinosis or ESRD.
