FDA-approved usage of morphine sulfate includes moderate to severe pain that may be acute or chronic. Most commonly used in pain management, morphine provides major relief to patients afflicted with pain. Clinical situations that benefit greatly by medicating with morphine include management of palliative/end-of-life care, active cancer treatment, and vaso-occlusive pain during sickle cell crisis. Morphine also has off-label uses for painful conditions. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of morphine, so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes when pain relief is needed.

**Objectives:**
- Review the mechanism of action of morphine.
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for using morphine.
- Explain the contraindications and adverse events associated with morphine.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to properly use morphine to improve patient outcomes in the varied scenarios where it can be effective.
