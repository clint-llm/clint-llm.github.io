**History**

Symptoms of chronic AR develop gradually, sometimes over decades. Symptoms include exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, angina pectoris, palpitations, and head pounding. Nocturnal angina occurs due to the slowing of the heart rate during sleep causing the arterial diastolic pressure to fall to extremely low levels.

**Physical Examination**

AR is associated with widened pulse pressure as a result of systolic hypertension and decreased diastolic pressure. The apical LV impulse is hyperdynamic and displaced laterally and inferiorly. A prominent systolic thrill may be palpable at the base of the heart or suprasternal notch and over the carotid arteries. It is caused by the large forward stroke volumes and low aortic diastolic pressure. S1 is normal, but S2 is increased (with a dilated aortic root) or decreased (when the aortic leaflets are thickened). A high frequency, blowing, decrescendo, diastolic murmur is heard best third intercostal space along the left sternal border. It is easier to appreciate the murmur of AR at the end of expiration while the patient is leaning forward.  The murmur increases with squatting or isometric exercise and decreases with maneuvers that decrease blood pressure. This murmur is early diastolic with mild AR and becomes holodiastolic with severe AR.

Peripheral Signs of severe chronic AR results from a widened pulse pressure are described below.

- **Austin Flint murmur:**Low pitched rumbling mid-diastolic murmur heard best at the apex. It is thought to be caused by premature closure of the mitral valve due to the jet of AR.

- **Becker sign:**Presence of visible pulsation of retinal arteries through an ophthalmoscope

- **Bisferiens pulse:**Biphasic pulse due to the backflow of blood in early diastole

- **Corrigan sign:**Water-hammer pulse with abrupt distention and quick collapse.

- **de Musset sign:**Head bobbing with each with arterial pulsation.

- **Duroziez sign:**Systolic murmur heard over the femoral artery when it is compressed proximally and a diastolic murmur when it is compressed distally with a stethoscope.

- **Gerhardt sign:**Pulsations of the spleen are detected in the presence of splenomegaly.

- **Hill sign:**Blood pressure in the lower extremity is greater than blood pressure in the upper extremity

- **Mayne sign:**Drop of diastolic blood pressure of greater than 15 mmHg on raising the arm

- **Muller sign:**Systolic pulsation of the uvula

- **Quincke sign:**Capillary pulsation (flushing and paling best seen at the root of the nail when pressure is applied to the tip of the nail).

- **Rosenbach sign:**Pulsation of the liver

- **Traube sign:**Booming "pistol-shot" systolic and diastolic sounds heard over the femoral artery

It should be noted that these eponymous signs have varying sensitivities and specificities. Evidence regarding the impact of severity of aortic regurgitation on the manifestation of these signs is sparse.

In acute AR, symptoms and physical findings are related to decreased stroke volume. Patients present with tachycardia, tachypnea, and pulmonary edema. Because the physical examination findings of acute AR are more subtle than those of chronic AR, the diagnosis is difficult to make when a patient presents with dyspnea and shock. A high index of suspicion is essential for rapid diagnosis.
