Drug effects are measured primarily with clinical response. Examples of assessments utilized in clinical trials to measure efficacy include the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG)-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K), SLE responder index (SRI), Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI), counts of swollen and tender joints, reductions in glucocorticoid dose, and annual flare rates.

Trending IFN titers, IFN gene signatures, anti-dsDNA antibodies, and complement as parameters to monitor disease activity following anifrolumab administration remain unclear.
