Ultrasound (US) guidance for intravenous (IV) access has been well documented for more than 20 years and is now routine in many settings for non-emergent central line placement and for difficult peripheral IV access. The proven safety and high success rate of US-guided IV access have led to the widespread integration of this technique in emergency departments. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique for ultrasound-guided intravenous access. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients in need of intravenous access.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for ultrasound-guided intravenous access.
- Describe the technique for using an ultrasound to assist with securing intravenous access.
- Outline the clinical benefits of using ultrasound to obtain intravenous access.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the timely management of patients in need of ultrasound-guided intravenous access.
