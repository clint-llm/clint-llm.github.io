Workers involved in the production and polymerization of VCM to PVC should undergo routine screening to monitor their level of ongoing exposure. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standard 1910.1017 requires annual occupational medical surveillance of workers exposed to VCM over the action level of 0.5 ppm. The standard requires laboratory monitoring of total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase at least annually. However, derangements of standard measurements of hepatic function may not be observable until late in the course of HAS, and other markers may be more sensitive. Liver biopsy is the most accurate test for the characteristic pattern of vinyl chloride-induced damage, but it is an invasive procedure with risks that limit its utility.
