The prognosis of transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy depends on the severity of the immunodeficiency.  The prognosis for those who are symptomatic or present with mild disease is good with no significant morbidity.  Patients with severe disease may be affected with opportunistic infections, atopy or autoimmunity, and have a more complicated course but, by definition, THI should completely resolve. Few patients may present a condition similar to X-linked agammaglobulinemia and must receive treatment with antimicrobials and IVIG for life.
