**Vascular Anatomy of the Spinal Cord**

Vascular irrigation of the spinal cord is complex and shows significant inter-individual variation, particularly at the thoracolumbar levels.

The major radicular artery of Adamkiewicz (AA) is the principal vascular source of the lower segments of the ASA. The artery of Adamkiewicz most frequently arises on the left between T7 and T12 levels and supplies roughly one-fourth of the entire cord in most patients.

Some have divided the cord supply into four semi-distinct territories; the first extends from C1 to T3 and derives flow predominately from the vertebral arteries. The second region from T3 to T7 is often supplied by a left-sided intercostal artery. The third region receives supply from the artery of Adamkiewicz (T8 to T12, often extending to the conus). A 4th region including the conus sometimes derives flow from an internal iliac branch (Desproges-Gotteron artery).

A potential watershed zone of less robust anastomoses exists between T4 and T8, rendering these levels susceptible to transient perfusion abnormalities. However, aggregated case series show the distribution of spinal cord strokes does not corroborate this hypothesis, and some have suggested that relative hypovascularity of the mid-thoracic cord reflects metabolic parsimony due to relatively decreased oxygen demand at these levels relative to other cord regions.

**Mechanisms of Spinal Cord Ischemia**

Ischemia of the spinal cord may arise from local vascular injury or global hypoperfusion. In the case of acute aortic dissection, injury to the cord occurs due to decreased flow related to increased aortic impedance from the flap itself or via an extension of the flap resulting in occlusion of a critical intercostal feeder.

As with cerebral blood flow, spinal cord vasoregulation is dependent on pH and pCO2. Ischemia triggers an inflammatory response and NMDA-mediated neuronal excitotoxicity. Most cell death occurs at 48 hours following onset, predominately via controlled apoptosis.

Relative cord blood flow is proportional to gray matter density and varies throughout the cord levels. Analogous to the Monro-Kellie hypothesis which describes the zero-sum volume relationship of neural tissue, blood, and CSF in the intracranial space, spinal cord perfusion is affected by relative CSF pressure. This observation has led to the clinical practice of prophylactic CSF drainage during aortic surgery to preserve cord perfusion.

Spinal venous ischemia/infarct is uncommon and often indolent. Venous hypertension and chronic ischemia classically correlate with spinal arteriovenous malformations which result in distension of the perimedullary venous plexus.
