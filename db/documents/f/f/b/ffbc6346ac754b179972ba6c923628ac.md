Since albumin solution is a human-derived blood product, adverse effects are rare. According to the manufacturer's prescribing information, in less than 0.1% of those receiving the drug, anaphylactoid reactions, flushing, urticaria, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, and hypotensionÂ can occur. These reactions normally disappear when the infusion rate is slowed or stopped. Edema and fluid overload are common adverse effects, depending on the volume, speed of the infusion, and the clinical scenario. In sporadic cases, anaphylactic shock may occur (from the pharmaceutical prescribing information).
