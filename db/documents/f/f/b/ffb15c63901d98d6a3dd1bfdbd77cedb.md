Partial seizures, also referred to as "focal seizures," affect a single brain area, with the temporal lobes being the most common occurrence site. They are associated with epilepsy. Despite the vast majority of partial seizures being harmless, sometimes the condition may be severe. To avoid complications, several antiepileptic medications are administered to patients with partial seizures after diagnosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of partial epilepsy and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of partial epilepsy. 
- Explain the clinical exam findings associated with partial epilepsy. 
- List the management options available for partial epilepsy.
