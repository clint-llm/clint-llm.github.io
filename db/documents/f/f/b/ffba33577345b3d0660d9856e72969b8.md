Corneal arcus usually presents asÂ narrow rings of white or gray hazy lipid deposits around the cornea. Although they usually begin in the periphery, they can progress over time and an entire ring can form around the cornea. Further investigation may be needed if they present in patients younger than 40, or if they present unilaterally.
