Carvedilol is an oral medication dosed twice daily for therapy in immediate-release form or once-daily dosing in a controlled release form. The dose is individualized based on blood pressure and heart rate response, although guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) is recommended for heart failure. Dose ranges include from 3.125 mg twice daily to 25 mg twice daily.

Dosing by indication is as follows, per the FDA product insert:

- Heart failure: Start at 3.125 mg twice daily and increase to 6.25, 12.5, and then 25 mg twice daily over at least two weeks intervals. The clinicians should maintain lower doses if the patient does not tolerate higher doses.

- Left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction: Initiate dosing at 6.25 mg twice daily and increase to 12.5 mg then 25 mg twice daily following 3 to 10 days intervals. A lower starting dose or slower titration is an option.

- Hypertension: Start at 6.25 mg twice daily and increase if needed for blood pressure control to 12.5 mg, then 25 mg twice daily over intervals of 1 to 2 weeks. (2.3)

A total dose of up to 100 mg daily is permissible in patients weighing over 85 kg. Per guideline-directed management and therapy for heart failure, carvedilol is up-titrated to 25 mg twice daily as tolerated.

**Use in Specific Patient Populations**

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**Non-selective beta-blockers(NSBB), including carvedilol, can be used for primary prophylaxis in patients with ascites and should be used for secondary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding. However, hypotension, worsening renal function, and potential infection should be monitored, where NSBB may need to be stopped. Due to the increased risk of hypotension, carvedilol should not be used in patients with severe or refractory ascites.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**No dose adjustment is necessary.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**The CHAP (Chronic Hypertension during Pregnancy) study indicated that targeting a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg decreases the incidence of adverse pregnancy consequences without compromising fetal growth.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**Carvedilol has approximately  95% plasma protein binding and a relatively long half-life with only 1% renal excretion; carvedilol doesn't appear to have significant exposure or accumulation in breastfed infants. There is no lack of clinical data with carvedilol during breastfeeding; consequently, other drugs may be preferred, especially in preterm infants.
