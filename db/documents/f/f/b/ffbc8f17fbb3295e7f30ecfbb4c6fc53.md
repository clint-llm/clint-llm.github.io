Immediate-release and sustained-release amphetamine medications are FDA-approved to treat ADHD and narcolepsy in both adult and pediatric populations. Non-FDA-approved clinical uses for dextroamphetamine/amphetamine include cerebrovascular accidents. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, approved and off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions of dextroamphetamine/amphetamine, pertinent for interprofessional team members using these medications for their intended indications.
