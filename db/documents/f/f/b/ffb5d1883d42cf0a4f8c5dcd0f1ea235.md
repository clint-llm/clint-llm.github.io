Gaseous chlorine is poisonous and classified as a pulmonary irritant. It has intermediate water solubility with the capability of causing acute damage to the upper and lower respiratory tract. Chlorine gas has many industrial uses, but it was also once used as a chemical weapon in World War I. Today, most incidents of chlorine exposure are through accidental industrial or household exposures. As for industrial exposures, there have been several instances of train accidents carrying liquid chlorine that caused the release of chlorine gas to the surrounding environment. At home, a mixture of chlorine bleach with other household products that contain acid or ammonia is a common source of exposure to chlorine gas.

Toxicity to chlorine gas depends on the dose and duration of exposure.  At concentrations of 1 to 3 ppm, chlorine gas acts as an eye and oral mucous membrane irritant; at 15 ppm, there is an onset of pulmonary symptoms, and it can be fatal at 430 ppm within 30 minutes.

Because of its strong odor, chlorine gas can be detected easily.  Symptoms of chlorine gas exposure include burning of the conjunctiva, throat, and the bronchial tree. Higher concentrations can produce bronchospasm, lower pulmonary injury, and delayed pulmonary edema.
