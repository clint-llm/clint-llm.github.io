The emergency department physician often does the management of pneumothorax. In some cases, the disorder may be managed by the ICU staff and the thoracic surgeon. The nurse does the care of patients who have a chest tube. All nurses who manage patients with a chest tube should know how a chest drain functions. Patients need to be examined every shift and the patency of the chest tube is important. Patients with small pneumothorax can be observed if they have no symptoms. If discharged the patient should be seen within 24 hours.
