Migraine is a common and well-documented disorder first described in 1882 by Dr. Galezowski. Ocular or retinal migraines are generally defined as a transient monocular scotoma or loss of vision which is accompanied or followed by a headache within 60 minutes of visual symptoms onset. In someÂ cases, persistent monocular visual loss and abnormal ophthalmological findings have been reported. The symptoms are usually transient. The pathophysiology of those persistent deficits is not clear.
