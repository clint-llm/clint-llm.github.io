This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for nephrotoxic drugs as a valuable agent in choosing key treatment strategies. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., dosing, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for healthcare team members in the care of patients with renal pathologies and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the most common drug classes that can contribute to an increased incidence of renal damage.
