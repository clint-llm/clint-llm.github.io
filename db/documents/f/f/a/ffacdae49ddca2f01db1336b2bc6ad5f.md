**PAPVC**

The clinical distinction between ASD and PAPVC can be difficult. Most children are asymptomatic. Imaging techniques are helpful for an accurate diagnosis.Â A single atrium can also present similar to PAPVC.

**TAPVC**

The differential diagnoses for TAPVC includes the following:

- Obstructed TAPVC

- Respiratory Distress Syndrome: Signs typically begin after birth, unlike TAPVC, where the presentation is slightly delayed (typically occurring after 12 hours of life).

- Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn

2. Unobstructed TAPVC:

- Large ASD, VSD

- Truncus arteriosus

- AV canal defects

- Single ventricle lesions
