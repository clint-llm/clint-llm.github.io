Virtually all patients with solitary CHRPE or GPR are asymptomatic, and lesions are benign; they are not associated with an increased risk of systemic disease. The prognosis is very good.

Although rare (2%), there is evidence of benign (adenoma) or malignant (adenocarcinoma) transformation of RPE cells within solitary CHRPE lesions. They initially arise from the CHRPE as a small nodule that grows slowly, eventually invading the sensory retina and spawning its own vasculature. Feeder and drainage vessels carry lipoproteinaceous material to and from the lesion. The nodules may remain stable or lead to extensive intraocular inflammation, subretinal exudation, retinal detachment, and subsequent severe vision loss. Other complications include vitreous traction, cataract, and posterior synechiae. Uncomplicated cases are often monitored, as there is no reported incidence of metastasis.
