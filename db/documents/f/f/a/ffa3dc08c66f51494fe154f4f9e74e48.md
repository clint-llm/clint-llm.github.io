Transient hypogammaglobinemia of infancy may represent an exaggerated physiologic nadir when maternal IgG begins to decrease and before the child begins to synthesize their own immunoglobulin.Â  Although the mechanism is not fully elucidated, the presence of maternal immunosuppressive antibodies (IgG) crossing the placenta, that disrupt the humoral immune system of the neonate is one suggestion. This inhibition can cause a reduced level of not only IgG but also IgM and IgA, as seen in some cases.

Some studies indicate that patients with THI have a normal number of B lymphocytes but a transient impaired function of T-lymphocytes associated with immunoglobulin synthesis. It stresses the importance of B and T cell cooperation to result in a proper immune response.
