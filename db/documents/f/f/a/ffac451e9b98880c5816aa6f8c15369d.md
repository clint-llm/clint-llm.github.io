Invasive zygomycosis, or mucormycosis, are a group of infections caused by fungi in the order Mucorales. The most common species that cause infection are the Rhizopus species from the Mucoraceae family. The disease is highly aggressive and commonly fatal despite appropriate treatment. It is extremely rare for mucormycosis to occur in healthy individuals. It almost always affects the immunocompromised- especially people with diabetes who are in ketoacidosis as acidic environment contributes to fungal growth.
