Reactive perforating collagenosis is a very rare inherited disease. Fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature since it was first described in 1967. The acquired form found in adults is more common and can occur in approximately ten percent of renal patients on hemodialysis. Reactive perforating collagenosis shows no racial predilection, although it has been noted that three of the five cases of the giant variant of acquired reactive perforating collagenosis have been found in Asians. Inherited and acquired reactive perforating collagenosis has been found equally in males and females. Most commonly, the inherited form presents in infancy or childhood, while the acquired form occurs in adults from their third to their fifth decade of life.
