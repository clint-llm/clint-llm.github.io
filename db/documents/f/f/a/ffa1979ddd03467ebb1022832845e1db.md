Takotsubo cardiomyopathy presentation is similar to acute coronary syndrome. This disorder is frequently triggered by intense emotional or physical stress, for example, the unexpected death of a family member, domestic abuse, significant confrontation, medical diagnosis, natural disaster, and/or financial loss. In the International Takotsubo Registry study, the most common symptoms are chest pain, dyspnea, and syncope. Some patients may present with symptoms and signs of heart failure, tachyarrhythmias, bradyarrhythmias, sudden cardiac arrest, or severe mitral regurgitation. On auscultation, there may be a late-peaking systolic murmur due to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. There may also be symptoms and signs of transient ischemic attack or stroke-like presentation due to apical thrombus embolization. Approximately 10% of patients with stress cardiomyopathy develop cardiogenic shock.
