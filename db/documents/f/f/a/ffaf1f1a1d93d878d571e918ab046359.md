The princeps pollicis artery is the predominant blood supply to the thumb. If the thumb appears cyanotic, this could mean the blood supply to the princeps pollicis artery is compromised, which will only happen if it is an isolated insult on the princeps pollicis artery. In some instances, if there is enough traumatic force to the Princeps pollicis artery, an aneurysm will form. While in some cases, a pseudoaneurysm may form in the princeps pollicis artery.

The artery can be affected by vasculitis. Medium-size arteries or small-size arteries can be affected by a condition called "thromboangiitis obliterans or Buerger disease." This condition typically affects smokers. The pathogenesis of this disease is that it creates an inflammatory thrombosis in blood vessels. The thrombosis will lead to autoamputation of the fingers and toes.
