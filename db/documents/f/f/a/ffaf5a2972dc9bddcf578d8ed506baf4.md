There are 2 main conservative treatments:  reducing the frequency of external compression on the nerve and flexion of the elbow joint. This is expected to decrease the stress placed on the ulnar nerve. The use of elbow splints, elbow pads or sleeves, and physical therapy have been suggested. For patients with mild to moderate symptoms, conservative treatment can be administered. It was shown that in patients with mild symptoms, conservative treatments are proven to be beneficial in about 90% of the patients; however, only 38% of the patients with moderate symptoms respond well a non-operative method.

Injection procedures have also been proposed for the treatment of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. However, studies with ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections at the elbow have shown controversial results.

Surgical treatment becomes a consideration for patients with persistent symptoms, with accompanying sensory changes and muscle atrophy. Several surgical methods have been described, for example, decompression, anterior transposition techniques, and medial epicondylectomy. A systematic review showed that simple decompression and decompression with transposition are equally effective in idiopathic UNE. However, the decompression surgery with transposition is associated with more wound infections than simple decompression.
