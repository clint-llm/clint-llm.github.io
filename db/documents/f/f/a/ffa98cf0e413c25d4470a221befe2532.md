Overall urinary stone prevalence in the United States has increased from 3.8% in 1970 to 8.8% in 2010. For patients with a history of a previous urinary stone, recurrence rates approach 50% at ten years. There is traditionally a high incidence of urinary stones in the Southeastern and South Central United States, termed the “Stone Belt,” which probably reflects the hot weather climate and relative dehydration that occurs in these areas. Before the development of modern urologic techniques for treatment, mortality from untreated staghorn (infection) calculi was 27%. Currently, mortality from stone disease is rare, although there is still a significant rate (28%) of renal deterioration with certain stone types, particularly staghorn (struvite or infection) stones.
