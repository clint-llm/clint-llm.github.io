Pellucid marginal corneal degeneration is a progressive peripheral corneal thinning disorder with an adjoining area of ectasia above it. It is a relatively rare ocular condition and usually occurs in males in the 2nd to 5th decades. To avoid ocular morbidity and permanent visual loss associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of pellucid marginal corneal degeneration and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of pellucid marginal corneal degeneration.

- Describe the appropriate evaluation of pellucid marginal corneal degeneration.
- Outline the treatment modalities for patients with pellucid marginal corneal degeneration.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care for patients with pellucid marginal corneal degeneration.
