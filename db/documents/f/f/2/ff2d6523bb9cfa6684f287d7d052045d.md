The pathophysiology of xanthomas is a result of the metabolic breakdown of lipoproteins. Once absorbed into the circulation, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in the adipose and muscle tissue requires lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to cleave it to extract triglycerides forming intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) that is made up of apoprotein B-100 and apoprotein E. IDL can be resorbed into the liver via the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor or converted into apoprotein B-100.  However, alterations in the lipoproteins via genetic mutations result in defective apolipoproteins that yield hypolipoproteinemia or hypercholesterolemia seen visibly as xanthomas, or other systemic metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, or nephrotic syndromes.

The classification of the various hypercholesterolemias based on this is beyond the scope of this summary, but various xanthomas predominantly correlate with different subtypes of hypercholesterolemias.
