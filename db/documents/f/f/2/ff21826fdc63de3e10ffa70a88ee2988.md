Subglottic stenosis may require surgery, and while endoscopic management is often preferred, open reconstruction is better in the cases of more severe stenosis. Tracheostomy, on the other hand, poses multiple complications, and this management option should be avoided if possible.

One study shows that restenosis was an observed complication in approximately a quarter of those patients who received endoscopic or surgical treatment. Revision surgery was also a complication, primarily due to either re-stenosis or peristomial tracheomalacia. Finally, tracheostomy tube insertion also posed a risk of mucosal obstruction.
