Neural tube defects are a spectrum of congenital anomalies that includes cranial defects and open or closed spinal dysraphism. Open spinal dysraphism or spina bifida aperta are visible lesions and include several malformations such as myelomeningocele. The etiology is often multifactorial, which includes environmental, maternal, and genetic factors. It is described as a fluid-contained sac that protrudes at the affected vertebral level. Therefore, early medical and surgical management are essential in preventing further complications and neurological damage. This activity will review the etiology, pathophysiology, presentation, and management options for myelomeningocele.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most common causative factors responsible for the development of myelomeningocele.
- Describe the common physical signs seen in patients with myelomeningocele.
- Outline the treatment and management options for patients with myelomeningocele.
- Summarize how the healthcare system should offer accessible and coordinated care for patients with myelomeningocele. It is usually provided by a specialized team of physicians and therapists to improve the prognosis and quality of life in patients.
