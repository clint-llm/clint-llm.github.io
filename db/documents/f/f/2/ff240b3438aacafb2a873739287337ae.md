The patient with a neurogenic bladder who is on catheter drainage should receive education about Foley care, recognition of a urinary tract infection, and monitoring of urinary output. Urethral Foley catheters should be converted to suprapubic tubes whenever possible. If a patient is on clean intermittent self-catheterization, it is crucial to teach proper techniques to prevent complications. Those using suprapubic tubes should also follow appropriate measures of catheter care, keep the suprapubic site clean, use bladder relaxing medications if necessary, and take steps to avoid urine leakage to prevent dermatitis. They should be made aware that if a suprapubic tube should fall out, this requires immediate, urgent replacement, or the cystostomy passage will quickly close and potentially require an additional surgical procedure to replace. Patients need proper instructions on identifying potential complications, appropriate home care, and periodic follow-up medical evaluations.

Patients who have associated benign prostatic hyperplasia should receive counseling regarding a possible voiding trial without catheterization and necessary follow-up care. Possible surgical options require extensive discussion with the patient and their risks, benefits, and possible complications. If the condition is amenable to drug management, patients should be counseled about the side effects of the medications and the potential need to find alternatives.
