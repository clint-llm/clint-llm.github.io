Precocious puberty is defined as the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of eight years in girls and nine years in boys. Central precocious puberty is gonadotropin-dependent and occurs due to early activation of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis. Peripheral precocious puberty, also known as precocious pseudo puberty, is gonadotropin-independent and occurs due to excess production of sex hormones either from the gonads, the adrenal glands, ectopic or exogenous sources.

Precocious puberty is isosexual if the signs of sexual development are consistent with the phenotypic gender of the child before the earliest accepted age of sexual maturation. If the signs of sexual development are inappropriate for the patient’s gender, then it is considered contrasexual. If left untreated, precocious pseudopuberty can lead to short stature in adulthood and have psychological consequences on the individual. Therefore, early recognition and treatment of this condition are essential to reduce morbidity.
