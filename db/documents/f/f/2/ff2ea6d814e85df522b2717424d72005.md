In typical coughing, use antibiotics only if the patient fails to respond to the symptomatic therapy, and two of the following symptoms are present: purulent nasal discharge, maxillary toothache, abnormal transillumination of any sinus, discolored nasal discharge.

Bacterial sinusitis can present, along with viral rhinitis or rhinosinusitis

Think of bacterial bronchitis and use appropriate antibiotics if an acute exacerbation of COPD with worsening shortness of breath or wheezing is present.

A cough and vomiting are suggestive of Bordetella pertussis. Treating pertussis with antibiotics does not reduce the paroxysmal phase but does reduce the infectivity period.

In the elderly, classic signs and symptoms may be minimal, so consider pneumonia, congestive heart failure, asthma, and aspiration.

Seventy-five percent of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease-induced cough do not have heartburn. An Ing et al. 1994 study demonstrated spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux disease coughing in only 4 out of 12 subjects when they had acid instilled into directly into their distal esophagus. It is determined that two factors are necessary for GERD to induce a cough: spontaneous gastroesophageal reflux disease and the propensity to cough. Therefore, patients with no other cause for cough are likely to have gastroesophageal reflux disease.
