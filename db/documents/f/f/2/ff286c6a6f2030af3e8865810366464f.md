First and foremost, the management of airway, breathing, and circulation followed. An emergent non-contrast CT head followed by aggressive management of intracranial hypertension. Identification of the underlying cause with timely intervention is the key to subsequent management. Basic labs, including CBC, CMP, coagulation profile. If the clinician establishes trauma as the cause of epidural or subdural hemorrhage leading to herniation, then a rapid evacuation of the hematoma should be pursued.

Steps for managing increased intracranial hypertension include:

- Raising the head of bed 30 to 60 degrees.

- Hyperventilation to keep PaCo2 30 to 35 mmHg

- Osmotherapy including hypertonic saline and mannitol therapy

- Intracranial pressure monitoring and to keep ICP < 20 mmHg

- In cases of brain tumors and associated vasogenic edema, dexamethasone might help reduce the mass effect.

- Surgical interventions (decompression of mass, hematoma, etc.)

In the intensive care unit, the goal is to maintain normotension, normovolemia, normonatremia to hypernatremia, normoglycemia, and normothermia to hypothermia. Such patients are followed through serial neurological examinations and CT head in the intensive care unit.
