ECGS are regularly done in clinical practice and sometimes the primary care provider, nurse practitioner and the internist may come across a patient with a RBBB. In isolation and in an asymptomatic patient, RBBB is benign. However, the patient should be referred to a cardiologist to ensure that he or she has no heart disease. In patients wih CHF and RBBB,Â cardiac resynchronization therapy is indicated.
