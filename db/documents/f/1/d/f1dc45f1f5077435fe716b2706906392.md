The performance of a forensic autopsy as a part of the medicolegal death investigation is of paramount significance in understanding the circumstances of death in every civilized society. In many jurisdictions across the globe, the performance of a forensic autopsy is required cases of unnatural deaths, deaths from sudden natural causes, and deaths occurring under suspicious or unusual circumstances. Although the medicolegal death investigation system and forensic autopsy standards differ from country to country, the aims and objectives primarily remain the same.

Forensic experts are proud to note that forensic autopsies have contributed significantly to the cause of justice and service of humanity over the years. All members of the healthcare team, including non-forensic doctors and nurses operating in an interprofessional team environment, should be aware of death from unusual or suspicious circumstances and refer these cases for a forensic autopsy.
