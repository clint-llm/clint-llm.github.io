There are two primary forms of scleroderma: localized scleroderma and systemic scleroderma also called systemic sclerosis (SSc).

**Localized scleroderma**

Localized scleroderma is limited to the skin and underlying tissue. It generally evolves in three consecutive phases: edematous, indurated and sclerotic, and then atrophic. Its outcome is unpredictable and spontaneous improvements are possible. Different clinical forms of localized scleroderma can coexist in the same patient. There are two main groups of localized scleroderma: morphea and linear scleroderma.

- Morphea is the most common clinical form. It presents as a single or multiple plaques. These plaques are initially erythematous and then become sclerous, white, indurated, surrounded by a characteristic erythematous halo called “purple ring” reflecting its inflammatory activity. It is generally painless, but pruritus may be present. Later, hypopigmentation appears, and the lesions become generally atrophic. The lesions are mainly on the trunk and proximal extremities; the face is rarely affected.

Plaque morphea can further classify into other sub-types, according to the shape or depth of the lesions. “Guttate” morphea or “white spot disease” refers to “drop-like”  shaped areas of skin involvement, whereas “subcutaneous” or deep morphea indicates a substantial involvement of deeper tissues with relative sparing of the overlying skin. The subcutaneous type may rarely extend deep into muscle tissues, but this does not indicate internal organ involvement.

Generalized morphea is defined as multiple morphea plaques, confluent or not, affecting more than two anatomical sites.

Bullous morphea is a rare sub-type characterized by blisters or erosions occurring on plaques of morphea.

- Linear scleroderma manifests as thickened and indurated skin bands, which are most often on the face or extremities. It is the most common form of scleroderma in children.

On the scalp or face, linear scleroderma gives an aspect called "en coup de sabre" (a French expression meaning “cut from a sword”). The sclerotic band is generally located on the forehead but can extend to the scalp (causing scarring alopecia), and to the nose as well as the upper lip. The skin is hypo or hyperpigmented, atrophic and adheres to the underlying bone. This form of scleroderma can sometimes be associated with ipsilateral hemiatrophy of the face and is therefore hardly individualizable from Parry-Romberg syndrome.

Linear scleroderma of the limbs is called "monomelic" and often begins in childhood. Sclero-atrophic bands appear gradually and then extend to the muscles and tendons; this may lead to an extreme aspect of pansclerotic morphea with joint and bone deformities sometimes associated with a stop or growth retardation of the limb.

**Systemic scleroderma or systemic sclerosis**

This form of scleroderma is the most severe since it usually affects several internal organs. However, most patients do not have all the symptoms described below.

**Raynaud’s phenomenon**

Raynaud’s phenomenon (RP) is secondary to distal arteries vasospasm after exposure to cold or temperature changes. It is the most common manifestation of systemic sclerosis, occurring in more than 95% of patients. The typical RP crisis includes three phases: syncopal pallor with anesthesia limited to a few fingers, cyanosis paresthesia, and late erythematous, painful phase. Trophic disorders, mainly digital ulcerations, often complicate RP. About 50% of systemic scleroderma patients will have during the course of the of their disease at least one episode of digital ulceration. Digital ischemia can eventually result in distal gangrene that may result in auto-amputation. In more than 95% of patients with SSc, nailfold capillaroscopy shows vascular anomalies, such as architectural disorganization, giant capillaries, hemorrhages, loss of capillaries, angiogenesis and avascular areas.

**Skin manifestations:**

Skin lesions are bilateral and symmetrical, with a distal beginning, involving the fingers and sometimes the toes. Two clinical features should be distinguished

- Diffuse SSc, during which cutaneous sclerosis rises above the elbows and knees, which represents 30 to 40% of all patients.

- Limited SSc, during which the cutaneous involvement limits itself to the fingers, hands, forearms, and face. Swelling of the fingers and hands may precede several months the onset of sclerotic lesions. Moreover, the skin of the fingers appears tense, giving a "sausage-like" appearance. The skin of the fingers becomes dry, thick and rough to the touch: this is called sclerodactyly, making it difficult to close the hand into a fist.

The nails diminish in size, curl and sometimes disappear. The face takes an inexpressive appearance, with a waxy skin in which the folds fade. The nose and the lips thin. Due to skin xerosis, small wrinkles form on the skin around the lips, which become finer. The limitation of oral opening may constitute a limitation for the consumption of solid foods, dental care, and other actions. The ability to open the oral cavity is measured by the inter-incisor distance. Telangiectasias are common during SSc and are usually localized in the face and mucous membranes.

Other cutaneous signs such as calcinosis, pigmentation disorders, and telangiectasia may be present.

Modified Rodnan skin score measures by palpation the extent and importance of cutaneous sclerosis in 17 zones of the body (0: normal cutaneous thickness; 1: minimal thickening; 2: moderate thickening; 3: thickening major). In diffuse forms, this score has a prognostic value, and usually reaches its maximum in the first three years after Raynaud's phenomenon and then tends to improve spontaneously.

**Pulmonary impairment**

The pulmonary lesions include interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). These two complications are the leading causes of death during SSc.

- 
**Pulmonary arterial hypertension**

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) occurs in up to 13% of patients with systemic scleroderma. It occurs more commonly in patients with limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis. By definition, PAH is pulmonary arterial pressure average greater than or equal to 25 mmHg measured at rest by right catheterization. PAH is suspected when pulmonary arterial systolic pressure exceeds 40 mm Hg at rest in echocardiography. Patients can remain asymptomatic for an extended time, especially if they do not have high levels of physical activity. Syncope, hemoptysis, and dysphonia (Ortner's syndrome) are signs of seriousness. An examination may find a systolic murmur of tricuspid insufficiency or diastolic murmur of pulmonary insufficiency, a loud second heart sound and signs of right heart failure.

- 
**Interstitial lung disease (ILD)**

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is common in patients with SSc since up to 90% of patients exhibit evidence of interstitial changes on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). It is more frequent with the diffuse forms of the disease. Pulmonary auscultation reveals crackles in the bases with or without a dry cough and dyspnea. ILD assessment is by pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and HRCT. The most classic finding is the ground-glass, and then appear linear or reticular images, septal or intralobular, then a honeycomb appearance with traction bronchiectasis. SSc-ILD appears in the early years of the disease, and its most marked progression occurs in the first years after diagnosis. ILD progression is usually slow; however, about 12% of scleroderma patients will progress to terminal respiratory failure. An ILD involving more than 20% of the lung parenchyma correlates with poorer survival.

**Gastrointestinal****manifestations**

Gastrointestinal involvement in SSc concerns the whole digestive tract. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs in 75 to 90% of patients. If a patient complains from dysphagia, erosive esophagitis, peptic stenosis, and endo-brachy-esophagus should be ruled out. Motor impairment can also affect the stomach, causing gastroparesis and more rarely watermelon stomach, a condition related to gastric antral vascular ectasia. In the small bowel, the motor impairment leads to bacterial overgrowth, with concomitant nutritional deficiencies (folate and vitamin B12), malabsorption (steatorrhea), and pseudo-obstruction. Anorectal involvement may cause fecal incontinence and rectal prolapse.

**Cardiac manifestations**

They are common in SSc. However, only 15% of patients are symptomatic and then have a poor prognosis (estimated 2-year mortality: 60%). Cardiac involvement includes myocardial disease, conduction system defects, arrhythmias, or pericardial disease.

Usually, only the coronary microcirculation is affected. In the case of pulmonary disease, right heart failure is possible. Pericardial involvement is quite common during SSc, usually without clinical consequence. Conduction disorders are quite rare. Rhythm disorders are detectable by Holter-electrocardiography.

**Renal involvement**

Renal involvement is common in patients with SSc. The most serious manifestation is scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) which is a rare but major complication. It characteristically demonstrates the occurrence of sudden-onset hypertension and oligo/anuric acute renal failure. Clinical signs are those of malignant hypertension. SRC is more common in patients with diffuse SSc and having anti-RNA-polymerase III antibodies. Before the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, SRC was the most common fatal complication of systemic scleroderma.

**Musculoskeletal Manifestations**

Scleroderma may affect joints (arthritis, arthralgia), tendons (rubs, tenosynovitis) and muscles (myalgia, weakness, more rarely myositis). Friction tendon rubs, seen on the hands, knees, and ankles, indicate a poor prognosis. Digital retractions in flexion due to skin sclerosis and calcinosis, lead to major functional disorders.
