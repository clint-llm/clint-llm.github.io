- Aortic coarctation of the aorta is a lifelong disease, and the long-term prognosis is guarded. Follow up care is vital as recurrence of coarctation and hypertension are not uncommon.

- These individuals also need prophylaxis for endocarditis if they undergo any invasive procedure.

- Short-term who fail to manage hypertension tend toÂ have a worse outcome compared to normotensive individuals.

- Long-term data are lacking as most patients are lost to follow up. However, survival is decreased compared to the normal population.

- Individuals who fail to get the coarctation repaired are usually dead by age 50.
