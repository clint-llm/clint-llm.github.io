There are no known diagnostic tests for byssinosis. However, acute exposure to cotton dust can result in a serological increase in leukocyte count. The diagnosis is often difficult because the condition can mimic asthma and many other pneumoconioses. Besides the physical exam, which is nonspecific, a chest x-ray is required to rule out other pathologies. The biggest clue to the disease is that the patient will usually complain that the symptoms get worse when he or she comes to work on Monday (hence the name Monday disease) and gets better when off work.

In a small proportion of the patients, physical examination was notable for the presence of fine basilar rales.

Pulmonary function testing (PFT) can support suspected byssinosis by revealing a decline in forced expiratory volume over 1 second (FEV1) below 80% of their predicted values or a greater than 5% decline in their intrashift FEV1. The normal, physiologic 20 mL to 30mL annual decline in FEV1 seems to be accelerated to a value closer to 50 mL/year in cotton workers.
