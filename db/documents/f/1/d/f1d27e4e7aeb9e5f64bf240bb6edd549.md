Monitoring and routine checkups are lifelong for patients following RAI therapy. Thyroid function tests are to be observed every 4-6 weeks for six months until the patient achieves a euthyroid or hypothyroid state. Free Thyroxine levels should be monitored routinely after treatment, as TSH levels can remain low for an extended duration despite the patient being clinically euthyroid. TFT can be monitored at six to twelve-month periods after achieving the treatment outcome. If treatment failure is suspected, and the patient is still in a hyperthyroid state six months post-therapy, the clinician may reconsider RAI retreatment.
