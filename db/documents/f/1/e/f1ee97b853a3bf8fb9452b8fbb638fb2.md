The neuro-ophthalmologist is often initially involved in diagnosing patients with NMOSD, but patients may also initially present to a primary care provider or neurologist. It is essential to consult with an interprofessional team that includes the ophthalmologist, neurologist, and primary care provider to provide adequateÂ care for these patients. The nurse's role is vital as these patients often require hospital admission with rapid induction of intravenous steroids. The pharmacist will be critical in adjusting the appropriate steroid dose for the patient, which will need to be done considering the other medical issue of the patient. The radiologist is also key in making the appropriate diagnosis based on the MRI results. To date, there are no large randomized clinical trials on the diagnosis and treatment of NMOSD; therefore, we rely primarily on consensus based on expert opinion. Diagnostic criteria are based on historical and case-control studies for diagnosis.
