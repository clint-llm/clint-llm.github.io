These symptoms occur due to abnormal coronary artery spasm. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Prinzmetal angina and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of Prinzmetal angina.
- Outline the risk factors and precipitating factors in Prinzmetal angina.
- Describe the typical patient history associated with Prinzmetal angina.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected with Prinzmetal angina.
