Following a thorough history and physical exam, the next step includes a chest radiograph that can be adequate initial workup to evaluate the size and extension of the tumor. The chest x-ray may provide a prompt evaluation of the lung for any direct invasion, may detect cortical bone destruction, or confirm the tumor is of boney origin; however, computed tomography is more sensitive than chest radiograph for verifying all of the above.
