There are multiple commercial grade devices available for the prehospital providers that combine the flow generator with the face mask as a disposable product. The major brand of devices includes the Pulmodyne and Flow-Safe II. The Pulmodyne CPAP device has an attached PEEP valve that can be adjusted for a maximum of 10 cm of water.  The Flow-Safe II was created using a venturi effect where an increase in airflow turbulence causes an increase in pressure.  Both of these devices have a closed circuit nebulization features. Philips Respironics created a nasal CPAP device (ComfortFusion Nasal) that is supposed to be more comfortable for patients.

Common settings for prehospital NIPPV include an inspiratory pressure of 5 to 10 cm water with an expiratory pressure of 5 cm water.  Patients with asthma, bronchitis, COPD usually start with a pressure of 5 cm water versus those with congestive heart failure (CHF), severe pneumonia and pulmonary edema due to near-drownings at 10 cm water. With these levels, the work of breathing can be reduced by as much as 60% and have an improvement of inspiratory muscle endurance up to 95%.
