The prognosis of VT depends on the underlying etiology and the presence of structural heart disease. As coronary artery disease is the main cause of VT, patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy-related VT have the worst prognosis. The two-year mortality in these patients has been reported to be as high as 30% if they remain untreated.

Patients with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia have excellent prognoses in the absence of other co-morbid conditions, and they are estimated to have longevity almost equal to the general population.
