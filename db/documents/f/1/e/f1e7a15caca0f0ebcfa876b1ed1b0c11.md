An interprofessional team is required to manage patients who are being treated with cholinesterase inhibitors successfully. Since most patients with cholinesterase inhibitor toxicity first present to the emergency department, the triage nurse must be familiar with the symptoms; these patients need immediate admission to a monitored unit. To improve outcomes, a team of nurses, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, physicians, and other healthcare professionals are essential to optimize care, especially when considering cholinesterase inhibitor toxicity. Patients admitted under these circumstances need close monitoring by the nurses and other clinicians. Ordering labs, understanding patient symptoms, and being vigilant to the next treatment steps are necessary to manage patients who are experiencing toxicity due to cholinesterase inhibitor use. Pharmacists should be consulted about the use of atropine, pralidoxime, and benzodiazepines if cholinesterase inhibitor-toxicity is suspected. A toxicologist consult should also occur, with an intensivist, to further manage a patient as many of these cases require further interventional management during the hospital course. Only through this type of interprofessional coordination can patients experiencing cholinergic toxicity achieve optimal clinical results. [Level 5]

Apart from toxicity, cholinesterase inhibitor therapy for conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer disease also requires interprofessional collaboration. Given the status of patients with these conditions being unable to participate in their treatment, the dosing clinician, the administering nursing staff, and the pharmacist must have input and cross-communication to ensure proper agent selection, dosing, administration, and monitoring of side effects. Again, interprofessional collaboration is crucial to patient outcomes. [Level 5]

**Outcomes**

Patients who are managed immediately after poisoning have good outcomes, but delays in treatment can lead to adverse outcomes.
