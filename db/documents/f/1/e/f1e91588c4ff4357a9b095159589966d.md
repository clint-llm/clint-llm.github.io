Carotid bruits can be a significant clue to an underlying carotid artery disease.  Clear lines of communication between the patient and the treatment team are important in expediting referrals and subsequent additional testing to exclude carotid artery disease and promptly institute measures to mitigate the chance of stroke.

While advanced imaging modalities such as carotid ultrasounds are more ubiquitous than ever, carotid auscultation as part of the physical examination is easy, cost-effective, and non-invasive.  These can be compelling reasons to continue including carotid auscultation as part of a routine physical examination, especially in patients at risk for cerebrovascular disease.

Primary care providers should routinely evaluate at-risk patients for carotid bruits. Physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants evaluate this finding. Nurses assist in patient education, facilitating evaluation, and provide feedback to the team. Pharmacists can assist in cardiovascular drug agent selection and monitor for interactions. This type of interprofessional team approach to these patients can improve the odds of successful outcomes. [Level 5]
