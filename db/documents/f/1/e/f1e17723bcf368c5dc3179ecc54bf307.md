**Potential Patient Complications**

As the acquisition of samples for bone turnover marker analysis in itself is relatively non-invasive, the specimen collection carries a low risk of medical complications for the patient.

**Complications With Establishing Use of BTMs as Gold Standard in Osteoporosis Management**

Although promising research is currently underway to help validate the use of BTMs in osteoporosis management, various limitations must be overcome before these tools can be brought into the clinical setting as an adjunct or independent tools in the standard of care. There is a lack of comparability between studies that have explored this topic, making it difficult to compile data for large meta-analyses. This is based on the fundamental heterogeneity between research studies' protocols and data analysis. There is a need for standardization in the analytical methods in studies working to establish reference levels of bone turnover markers. Standardization in protocols for specimen collection and their associated assay is also absent.
