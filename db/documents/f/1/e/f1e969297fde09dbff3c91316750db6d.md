Plasma or serum are commonly used specimens for plasma glucose estimation. Two to three ml of venous blood is collected in a vacutainer containing potassium salt of oxalate or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) as an anticoagulant and sodium fluoride (NaF) as an inhibitor of glycolysis. Sodium fluoride reduces the availability of magnesium (Mg++) ions which are essential for the enolase enzyme activity of the red blood cells. Inhibition of the enolase enzyme leads to inhibition of glucose utilization by red blood cells via glycolysis.

Glycolysis reduces plasma glucose levels by 5 to 7 percent in coagulated-uncentrifuged blood in one hour at room temperature. Thus, adding NaF will reduce the variation in plasma glucose level due to sample storage or delayed estimation. Plasma should be separated by centrifugation and used to estimate plasma glucose as per assay protocol.

Blood can be collected in a plain or vacutainer containing a clot activator for serum samples. Alternatively, a vacutainer with other anticoagulants such as potassium oxalate, potassium EDTA, sodium citrate, or heparin without the addition of sodium fluoride can also be used for the plasma sample. In such cases, plasma or serum should be separated as early as possible and transferred to another sample tube to minimize the effect of glucose utilization by red blood cells.

Analysis of glucose levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be done as early as possible because bacteria and/or pus cells and/or other types of cells may alter the glucose concentration. CSF can be utilized directly as a sample, the same as plasma or serum, for assay without any pre-treatment.

Glucose concentration in 24 hours urine specimen is scarcely prescribed. Variation in glucose concentration is very high in such urine specimens due to bacterial activity, temperature, and pH-related effects. Commercially available diagnostic kits are designed to estimate glucose levels in plasma or serum specimens. Urine glucose levels in a person with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus are too high for these kitsâ€™ linearity. If needed to be processed, urine samples should be adjusted for pH, linearity range, and other interfering substances utilizing NAD+/NADP+ or having absorbance at 340 nm.
