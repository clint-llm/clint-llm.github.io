Oral cutaneous fistula (OCF) is a rare extraoral path of infection that communicates the oral cavity and the skin. Chronic dental infections, trauma, dental implant complications, salivary gland lesions, and neoplasms are the most common causes of oral cutaneous fistulas. Affected patients usually seek help from dermatologists or surgeons rather than from dentists. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of OCF and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the etiology of oral cutaneous fistulas.
- Outline the epidemiology of oral cutaneous fistulas.
- Describe the common presentation of oral cutaneous fistulas.
- Summarize the evaluation and treatment of oral cutaneous fistulas.
