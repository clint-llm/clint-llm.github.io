High suspicion of diagnosis is needed to identify bronchial carcinoid tumors, which often leads to delayed diagnosis.  35% of patients will present with either productive or nonproductive cough. Others may present with wheezing, which is often misdiagnosed as asthma and has a prolonged treatment course without improvement.  Approximately 25 to 50% of patients will report hemoptysis, while 40% will report a history of chest pain or evidence of bronchial obstruction.

Other presentations could be consistent with recurring pneumonia distal to the obstruction caused by the tumor. Rarely will patients experience carcinoid syndrome while the tumor is located in the tracheobronchial tree.  If a patient has neuroendocrine production of ACTH due to the carcinoid tumor, they may present with Cushing's syndrome.  A large portion of bronchial carcinoids, up to 25%, are asymptomatic cases.
