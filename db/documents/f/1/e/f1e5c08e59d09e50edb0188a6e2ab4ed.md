The Jeffrey Modell Foundation implemented public awareness and physician education about primary immunodeficiencies, including severe combined immunodeficiency disease beginning in 2003. The network has implemented population-based newborn screening for SCID and T cell lymphopenia, covering 96% of the total newborns in the US.

The majority of the patients (89%) presented with the first symptoms within six months of age. The clinical manifestations observed were recurrent pneumonia (66%), followed by failure to thrive (60%) and chronic diarrhea (35%).

One US study reported the incidence of SCID as 1 in 58,000 live births.
