Korsakoff syndrome often follows or accompanies Wernicke encephalopathy.

- If treated quickly, Korsakoff syndrome development may be prevented with thiamine treatments.

- Thiamine needs to be administered quickly in both dose and duration.

- Thiamine treatment may result in noticeable improvements in mental status after only 2 to 3 weeks of therapy.

- With treatment, Wernicke encephalopathy will not necessarily progress to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

To reduce the risk of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, limit the intake of alcohol, and ensure that proper nutrition needs are met.

- Proper nutrition, in combination with thiamine supplements, may reduce the risk of development of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.

- Supplemental thiamine and good nutrition may help heavy drinkers who refuse to or are unable to quit.
