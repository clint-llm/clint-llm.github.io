A small coronary arteriovenous fistula that is not jeopardizing myocardial blood supply can remain asymptomatic.Â  However, patients with a large fistula can present with ischemic symptoms like angina from coronary steal phenomenon. Left to right shunt may also cause right ventricular volume overload. They can manifest with features of right-sided heart failure like dyspnea, extremity swelling, orthopnea, and syncope. The clinician should suspect coronary arteriovenous fistula in patients with unexplained heart failure, with a history of chest trauma irradiation, myocardial infarction, or cardiac procedures. On examination, signs of congestive heart failure like raised jugular venous pressure, positive hepatojugular reflux, pedal edema, and pleural effusion can be present. Chest auscultation may reveal continuous murmur from increased flow in the large fistula and collaterals. A loud S2 and early diastolic murmur in the pulmonary area can point to pulmonary hypertension.
