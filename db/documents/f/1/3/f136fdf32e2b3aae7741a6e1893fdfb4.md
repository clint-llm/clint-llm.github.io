Many conditions can cause problems within the pleural cavity and in the pleural fluid.

- Pleurisy - pleura inflammation, causing sharp pain with breathing; most commonly caused by a viral infection

- Pleural effusion - excess fluid in the pleural space; commonly from congestive heart failure or malignancy.

- Pneumothorax - a buildup of air or gas in the pleural space; commonly from acute lung injury, trauma, or chronic diseases such as a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or tuberculosis

- Hemothorax - a buildup of blood in the pleural space; commonly from injury or trauma to the chest

In adults, congestive heart failure and liver cirrhosis are the most common causes of transudative pleural effusions. Pneumonia, malignant pleural disease, pulmonary embolism, and gastrointestinal disease account for almost all exudative pleural effusions. In children, congenital heart disease, pneumonia, and malignancy are the most common causes of pleural effusions.
