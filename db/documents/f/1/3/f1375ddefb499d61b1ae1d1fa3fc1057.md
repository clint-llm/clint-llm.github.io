A mental status examination is a key tool in improving the detection of psychiatric signs and symptoms, diagnosing mental illness, pointing to possible underlying medical conditions, and determining the patient’s level of severity and disposition.

Nursing will often have the most ongoing contact with a patient, particularly inpatients; they can assess and inform the treating clinicians of any concerns. They can consult with the pharmacist regarding the dosing and administration of any psychiatric medications. Pharmacists may encounter patients outside of the institutional setting, and based on their medication profile, be aware of psychiatric conditions. If they can assess and evaluate that the patient is experiencing issues, then they can reach out to the treating clinician who can determine if intervention is necessary, such as a change in medication.

Clear communication and regular meetings of the entire interprofessional healthcare team to discuss their observations on how the patient has been doing from each member’s perspective can point the team in the right direction for the patient’s care and improve patient outcomes. In an outpatient setting, there still needs to be open lines of communication, and each member of the interprofessional team should have some ability to perform mental status assessments so patients can get the help they need promptly, leading to better outcomes.
