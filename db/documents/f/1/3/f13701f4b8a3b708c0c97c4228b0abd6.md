The muscles of the femoral region of the lower limb are divided into three compartments; the anterior or extensor, medial or adductor, and posterior or flexor compartments. Each compartment is separated from the others by an intermuscular septum that runs from the fascia lata to the linea aspera of the femur. The anterior compartment includes the pectineus, iliopsoas, psoas minor, iliacus, sartorius, and quadriceps muscles. These muscles arise from the hip, spine, and proximal femur. The medial compartmentÂ is made up of the adductor magnus, adductor longus, adductor brevis, gracilis, and obturator externus. These muscles originate near the anteroinferior external surface of the bony pelvis and insert at the linea aspera. The posterior compartment is made up of a group of muscles called the hamstrings, including semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris. These muscles arise from the ischial tuberosity and the femur and insert onto the medial tibia and lateral fibula.
