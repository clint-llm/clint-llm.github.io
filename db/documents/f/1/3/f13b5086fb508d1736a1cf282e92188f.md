Approximately 90% of the population will present with low back pain at some point in their lifetime.  Spinal stenosis is a condition that is caused by the narrowing of the central canal, the lateral recess, or neural foramen. This condition can cause significant discomfort, interfere with activities of daily living, and may result in progressive disability.

It is important to appreciate that spinal stenosis is part of the aging process, and predicting who will develop symptoms is not always easy. There is no clear cut association between spinal stenosis and the presence of symptoms. While the degenerative process is not 100% preventable, it can be slowed down with exercise diet or changes in lifestyle. Overall, spinal stenosis is most common in the lumbar and cervical regions.
