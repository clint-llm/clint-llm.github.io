**Sequence of Repair**

When possible, the amputated part should be taken to the operating room before the patient for thorough debridement and examination under the microscope. The quality of the tissue, specifically the nerves and blood vessels, are examined before committing to the replantation. Identifiable structures should be tagged with suture or microclips. The first step in replantation is bone shortening and fixation. The bone should be shortened enough to take all tension off of the subsequent soft tissue repairs. In the pediatric population, any bony shortening should take care not to sacrifice the physis. Bony fixation is followed by extensor tendon then flexor tendon repair. The surgeon should then initiate arterial repair. No matter the level of amputation, anastomosing intact and healthy arterial intima on each side of the repair is paramount to success. If this requires excessive debridement, vein grafts are necessary. Ample vein grafts are typically available from the ipsilateral extremity in the cephalic or basilicÂ vein. However, lower extremity vein grafts may be necessary. Nerve repair is the next step, followed by vein repair. Lastly, the surgeon completes soft tissue coverage of the repair.

In short:
