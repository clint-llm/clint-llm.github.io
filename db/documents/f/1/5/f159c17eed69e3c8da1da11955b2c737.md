The primary monitoring requirement for patients on tolcapone is AST and ALT levels. AST and ALT levels should be checked at baseline, every two to four weeks for the first six months, and then as clinically necessary after that. Prescribers should discontinue tolcapone if AST or ALT levels are greater than two times the upper limit of normal or if a patient presents with signs and symptoms of liver failure.
