Not all patients with hyperlipidemia or hypercholesterolemia develop xanthomas. However, the presence of xanthomatous lesions can serve as a unique and important clinical indicator of these metabolic states.

Normocholesterolemic xanthomatosis is postulated to occur through an alternate sequence of events in which local tissue injury (either through trauma or inflammation) is thought to play a major role. These are the typical "eruptive xanthomas" associated with the type I, IV and V classes of hypercholesterolemias. The increased vascular permeability induced by the injury state is hypothesized to lead to the same common pathway of leaked lipoproteins that are then phagocytosed by dermal cells.

Xanthomatous lesions are also rarely associated with paraproteinemias, including those with normal levels of plasma lipids. In these patients, it is postulated that the typically grouped, flat lesions represent the cutaneous proliferation of lymphoreticular tissue that then subsequently develops xanthomatous characteristics.
