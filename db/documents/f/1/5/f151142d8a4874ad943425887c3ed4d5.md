Retinal traction detachment (RTD) is the separation of the neurosensory retina from the underlying retinal pigment epithelium due to the traction resulting from membranes in the vitreous or over the retinal surface. These membranes result from a number of causes. The most common cause of RTD is diabetes mellitus. Since the number of patients with diabetes is increasing, the number of systemic and ocular complications are increasing. RTD is one of the vision-threatening ocular complications of diabetes. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment for patients with RTD and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of retinal traction detachment.
- Summarize the evaluation of patients with retinal traction detachment.
- Review the treatment of retinal traction detachment.
