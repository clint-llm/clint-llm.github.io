In general, of those with MMP, those with ocular involvement have a worse prognosis than those affected with skin and/or oral mucosa involvement alone. Systemic therapy can stop the progression of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid in about 90% of patients, and the rate of recurrence is about 20% to 30%, but this is variable.

Several studies show that between 25% to 30% of patients progress to blindness due to the pathophysiology leading up to and including corneal opacification.
