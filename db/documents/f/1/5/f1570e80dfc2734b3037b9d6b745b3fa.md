The diagnosis of CKTR starts with clinical evaluation through a thorough history taking and a comprehensive physical exam. Important items to ask for during history taking include medication nonadherence, recurrence of the original cause of nephropathy, previous transplantation, prior AR, and baseline HLA sensitization. Unexplained decreases in immunosuppression levels can also point towards nonadherence as a cause for CKTR.
