Substernal goiter is expected to be diagnosed more frequently and earlier because of the widespread use of chest imaging and cancer screening. The patient with a substernal goiter should be referred to an endocrinologist for evaluation and management. If there is an indication for surgery, a surgical consultation, especially with a surgeon experienced in thyroid surgery is advised. If there are indications for extra-cervical approach, thoracic surgery consultation is required. Surgery for substernal goiter should be performed at tertiary institutions with experience in thyroid surgery and its complications.
