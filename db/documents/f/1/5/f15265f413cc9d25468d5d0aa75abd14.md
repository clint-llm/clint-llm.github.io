The pleural cavity is a sac lined with a serous membrane that encloses the lungs and separates them from the thoracic cage. An inner layer covers the surface of the lungs called the visceral pleura. The outer layer is the parietal pleural. A minuscule amount of fluid that is approximately 10 microliters thick can be found between the 2 layers. The amount of fluid in the pleural cavity is regulated by a fine balance in the oncotic and hydrostatic pressures between the pleural space and the intravascular components coupled with the perilymphatic drainage. The Frank-Starling law controls this process.
This activity reviews the causes, pathophysiology, and presentation of pediatric malignant pleural effusions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pediatric malignant pleural effusions. 
- Describe the history and physical exam findings that are commonly seen in pediatric malignant pleural effusions. 
- Outline the treatment options available for pediatric malignant pleural effusions. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication and improving outcomes for pediatric malignant pleural effusions.
