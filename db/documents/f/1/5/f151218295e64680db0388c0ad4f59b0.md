During the postural assessment of a person standing upright, it is possible to evaluate the medial longitudinal arch of the foot under load quickly and practically. It is sufficient to draw the imaginary line of Feiss to determine if there is a physiological medial longitudinal arch. This line is obtained by joining the medial malleolus and the first metacarpal-phalangeal joint; once this line has been drawn, it is sufficient to observe whether the scaphoid tuberosity is crossed by this line and in this case, the plantar arch will be physiological. If, on the other hand, the scaphoid tuberosity is above this line, it means that the foot is flat/supinated; if the scaphoid tuberosity is below Feiss's line, it means that the foot is flat/pronated.

In obese young/adult subjects, there is an inverse relationship between the thickness of the fascial tissue at the level of the medial arch and the lowering of the latter.

In subjects with a decrease in the medial longitudinal arch, there is an increase in the thickness of the abductor hallucis muscle; this adaptation could, in the long run, create postural alterations.
