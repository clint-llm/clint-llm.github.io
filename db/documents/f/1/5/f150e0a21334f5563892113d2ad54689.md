Total and partial anomalous venous connection comprises a wide spectrum of congenital cardiovascular malformations where one or more pulmonary veins returns to the right atrium or systemic venous circulation instead of draining directly into the left atrium. An understanding of the various anatomical subtypes, physiological assessment, clinical and diagnostic evaluation is important for medical and surgical management. This activity reviews the anatomy, physiology, evaluation, and treatment of total and partial pulmonary venous connections and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of total and partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections. 
- Describe the evaluation of total and partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections.
- Outline the management options available for partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections.
- Summarize the most common complications seen with partial anomalous pulmonary venous connections.
