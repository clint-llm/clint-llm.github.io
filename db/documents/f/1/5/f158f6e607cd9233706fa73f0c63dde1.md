Congenital nipple inversion is a generally benign condition. The prognosis depends on the grade of inversion and the treatment option chosen. Grade 1 inversions have seen a good prognosis with simple non-surgical conservative treatment methods. The establishment of successful lactation normally ensures long term correction. Grade 2 inversions have seen equivocal results with conservative methods. In cases of recurrence or no improvement, surgical correction can be considered after careful discussions with the patient regarding future lactation goals.
