Clinical presentation of renal vein thrombosis varies by the rapidity of venous occlusion and development of venous collaterals. Chronic RVT has an insidious onset and is usually asymptomatic. Rarely, it may present as peripheral edema.

Acute renal vein thrombosis usually presents with symptoms of renal infarction, including flank pain, flank tenderness, rapid deterioration of renal function and worsening proteinuria, micro or macroscopic hematuria. Nausea, vomiting or fever may be present.

In a renal transplant, RVT usually presents within 48 hours of surgery manifesting as sudden anuria and tenderness over the transplanted kidney.

In neonates and infants, acute RVT may present with gross hematuria, flank mass, signs and symptoms of dehydration or shock, and oligo-anuria.

Left-sided RVTÂ can lead to gonadal vein thrombosis manifested as pelvic congestion syndrome in females and whereas in males with painful swelling of the left testis and varicocele.
