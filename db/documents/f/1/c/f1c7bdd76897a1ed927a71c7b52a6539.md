Osteitis condensans ilii (OCI) is a self-limiting condition marked by sclerosis of the iliac bone, found either incidentally on imaging in asymptomatic patients or those presenting with lower back pain. Imaging and clinical findings are localized to the sacroiliac joint(s) and thus, must be differentiated from other conditions that may present in a similar fashion (spondyloarthritis, degenerative arthritis, septic arthritis). Although some of the presenting features at times may overlap, OCI is distinct in that it spares the joint space, is not progressive, and most commonly presents in the absence of lab value abnormalities.
