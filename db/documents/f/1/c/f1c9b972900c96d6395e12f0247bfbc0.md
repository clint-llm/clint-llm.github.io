The precise pathogenesis of EMPD is still the subject of controversy. The literature seems to indicate that extramammary Paget disease does not have a uniform histogenesis. Approximately 25% of cases have a primary cutaneous adnexal carcinoma, mostly of apocrine type, but sometimes derived from periurethral, eccrine, perianal, or Bartholin's glands. An additional 10% to 15% of EMPD patients have an internal carcinoma involving the bladder, rectum, cervix, prostate, or urethra, which appears to be of etiological significance. Recently theories have postulated that EMPD is associated with Toker cells, which are present in both mammary and vulvar tissue.

Due to the histologic extension beyond the clinically abnormal area, local recurrence of extramammary Paget disease is relatively common. The prognosis is favorable, except in cases with an underlying visceral or adnexal carcinoma, in which the mortality rate is greater than 50%. Decreased survival is also associated with increased serum CEA levels, tumor invasion level, the presence of nodules in the primary lesion, and lymph node metastases. Spontaneous regression has been described in the literature after partial surgical excision. Metastatic extramammary Paget disease is rather rare, but it may spread to regional lymph nodes and visceral organs.
