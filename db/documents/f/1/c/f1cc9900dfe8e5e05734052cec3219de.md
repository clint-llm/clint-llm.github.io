In making the diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma, other disease processes that can cause optic neuropathy must be ruled out. Other possible diagnoses to keep in mind are previous ischemic optic neuropathy, optic atrophy, and compressive non-glaucomatous optic neuropathy can cause similar patterns of visual field loss and in some cases “pseudo-cupping” of the optic nerve. In the case that elevated IOP or characteristic glaucomatous optic nerve changes are noted, it’s important to evaluate with gonioscopy to determine if the anterior chamber is open, narrow, or closed. Additionally, it is important to evaluate for the subtle signs of the many types of secondary glaucoma, review the medication list for possible idiosyncratic drug reactions or steroid response, and take a thorough history of prior ocular trauma and surgery.

With an acute presentation like that of acute angle-closure, other possible diagnoses to keep in mind are iritis, traumatic hyphema, conjunctivitis, episcleritis, migraine, cluster headache, conjunctivitis, subconjunctival hemorrhage, corneal abrasion, endophthalmitis, orbital compartment syndrome, corneal ulcer, periorbital infections, and infectious keratitis. With a careful history and slit-lamp examination, the clinician can narrow the differential and arrange for appropriate examination and referral.
