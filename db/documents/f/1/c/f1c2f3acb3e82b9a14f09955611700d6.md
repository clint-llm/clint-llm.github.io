- If entrapment is suspected, radiographs should be performed to detect or rule out a fracture, healing callus, or tumor as the cause of the entrapment.

- Ultrasonography can often provide reliable visualization of injured nerves. For example, axonal swelling, hypoechogenicity of the nerve, loss of continuity of a nerve bundle, formation of a neuroma, and/or partial laceration of a nerve can all be visualized, which may aid in diagnosis.

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful in detecting more subtle causes not found on radiographs or ultrasound, such as small tumors, masses, aneurysms, or compressive synovitis. MRI can also, at times,Â detect nerve changes during acute entrapments.

- A diagnostic nerve block to help define the distribution of pathology and presentation is considered in some situations.

- EMG/nerve conduction studies can also be considered but are inconsistent and should only be considered if surgery is a possibility.

- No standard laboratory work is necessary for establishing the diagnosis.
