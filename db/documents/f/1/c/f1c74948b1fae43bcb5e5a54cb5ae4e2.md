Spiradenomas are well-differentiated, benign, dermal neoplasms originating from the sweat glands. Most spiradenomas occur between the ages of 15 to 35 years. Typically, they present as small solitary nodules that can grow to several centimeters, often with a blue, gray, or purple hue. They are very painful. Spiradenomas usually arise on the head, neck, and trunk; however, cases in other areas such as the breast have occurred. Although spiradenomas are considered benign adnexal neoplasms with low recurrence rates, malignant transformation can occur in long-standing lesions, particularly in patients older than the age of 50. Conservative surgical excision of spiradenomas is therefore recommended. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of spiradenomas and highlights the role of an interprofessional team approach.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of spiradenomas.
- Describe the clinical presentation of a spiradenoma.
- Describe the treatment and management options for spiradenomas.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by spiradenomas.
