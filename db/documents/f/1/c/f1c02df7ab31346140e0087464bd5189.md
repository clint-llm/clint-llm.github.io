Ocular biometry refers to the measurement of anatomical dimensions of the eye, which include corneal curvature (keratometry), axial length, and anterior chamber depth. These measurements are primarily used to calculate the appropriate power of the intraocular lens (IOL) to be implanted during cataract surgery. Given the technological advances in cataract surgery, and the introduction of premium intraocular lens implants, patient expectations continue to rise, and refractive error following cataract surgery is no longer tolerated. Optical and ultrasound biometry are the two different modalities with distinct advantages and disadvantages. This activity reviews ocular biometry, explains the clinical indication for each type and illustrates the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients who undergo cataract surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the commonly measured biometric parameters of the eye.
- Explain the Sanders, Retzlaff, and Kraff formula for calculating intraocular lens power.
- Review the types of ultrasound biometry and the clinical indications of each.
- Outline optical biometry and its advantages and disadvantages.
