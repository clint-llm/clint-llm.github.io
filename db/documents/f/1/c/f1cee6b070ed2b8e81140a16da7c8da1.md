The diagnosis and management of abdominal compartment syndrome require an interprofessional team approach. The condition can present in subtle ways, and the diagnosis can easily be missed. If the abdominal compartment syndrome is not diagnosed or treatment is delayed, the outcome is almost always fatal. Mortality rates of 20 to 70% have been reported in patients with blunt abdominal trauma, even with treatment. The reason for the high mortality is due to the early involvement of multiple organs. Also, the higher the abdominal pressure, the higher the mortality. Other factors associated with mortality include surgery lasting more than 2 hours, developing abdominal compartment syndrome within 48 hours of admission, and an elevated lactic acid level despite treatment. Even those who survive have significant morbidity from residual deficits like renal failure, muscle wasting, respiratory distress, and liver dysfunction.

**The Interprofessional Team**

The diagnosis usually requires a systemic approach and discussion with the interprofessional team. Once the diagnosis is made, all patients require ICU care with continuous monitoring. A wound care nurse should assess the wound every day for healing and report to the clinician if there are any signs of infection or less than optimal healing. Since most patients are kept NPO, a dietary consult for total parenteral nutrition is necessary. Nurses should ensure that all patients have deep venous thrombosis and pressure sore prophylaxis. In addition, nurses need to weigh the patient daily, measure abdominal girth, assess urine output and organ perfusion. If urine output declines, the nephrologist should be contacted and involved early in the care. Any deviation from normal parameters should be immediately conveyed to the interprofessional team. Pharmacists evaluate prescribed medications and check for drug-drug interactions. As the patient improves, physical therapy should be ordered to get the patient out of bed and encouraging ambulation.

Those who go on to develop chronic abdominal compartment syndrome need lifelong support and monitoring. The current recommendations focus on the prevention of abdominal compartment syndrome. Various techniques for the closure of the abdomen and even the fluid used to resuscitate the patient may make a difference in the outcome.

The outcomes for most patients with abdominal compartment syndrome are poor. Those who are diagnosed and treated promptly do have good outcomes, but the recovery is often prolonged. Patients with multiorgan dysfunction have a long road to recovery, marked by wound breakdown, repeated hospitalization, and difficulty performing even the most basic daily living activities.
