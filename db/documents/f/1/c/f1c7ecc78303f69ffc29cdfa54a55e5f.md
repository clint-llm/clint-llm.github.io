Sweet syndrome is a rare disorder of the skin. However, patients may usually present to the primary care provider or nurse practitioner with abrupt onset of tender plaques or nodules, fever, arthralgias, ophthalmologic manifestations, headaches, and, rarely, oral or genital lesions. The role of dermatologists and pathologists is crucial in confirming the diagnosis. The involvement of other subspecialists, including an oncologist, rheumatologist, gastroenterologist, or an infectious disease specialist, may be necessary if an underlying associated condition is present. The goal of pharmacotherapy in acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis is to reduce morbidity and complications. The best first-line option is systemic or topical corticosteroids if the lesions are limited. If corticosteroids are contraindicated, anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive medications may be options. The nursing team can ensure patient compliance, while a pharmacist can help to ensure avoidance of drug interactions. Recommendations include close monitoring and followup of the patient. [Level 2]
