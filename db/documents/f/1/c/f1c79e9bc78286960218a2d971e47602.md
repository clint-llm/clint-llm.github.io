Histopathology in Bloom syndrome often mimics lupus erythematosus. There is a marked vacuolar interface with basalÂ liquefaction degeneration, effacement of the rete ridges, and follicular plugging. Basement membrane thickening may or may not be seen. In the dermis, there is a moderate, superficial infiltrate of lymphocytes, predominately T cells. Capillary dilation is also present in the papillary dermis. Direct immunofluorescence shows non-specific IgM deposits along the basement membrane zone of lesional skin.
