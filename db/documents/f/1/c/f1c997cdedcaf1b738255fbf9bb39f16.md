Clobazam, like other benzodiazepines, does not require any ancillary monitoring, except for clinical monitoring for mental status/behavioral change or suicidality. The Canadian labeling recommends complete blood counts, liver and renal function tests, thyroid testing.

Although some studies have suggested a clobazam range of 30 to 300 ng/ml, there is no established therapeutic index for clobazam.
