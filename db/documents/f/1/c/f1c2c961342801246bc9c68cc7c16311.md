Most flea bites result in papular urticaria, which is a dual Type I and Type IV hypersensitivity reaction. The reactions involve both IgE and cell-mediated responses. This rash appears as small, raised, erythematous, pruritic lesions. It most commonly affects exposed skin, generally, the feet and ankles and appears in clusters and linear patterns known as a "breakfast, lunch and dinner" pattern.

Tungiasis is an inflammatory skin condition caused by T. penetrans which is the smallest known flea. Skin irritation occurs when a female flea embeds itself into the epithelium of the skin. Fleas typically embed themselves in soft areas of skin such as the medial foot, under nails and between toes. In cases of severe disease, the thigh, hands, perianal and groin may be involved. During the first 1 to 2 days of infestation, the host may notice itching or discomfort.  The abdomen of the flea then swell with eggs forming a white pearly lesion. This increased pressure can cause a painful foreign body sensation and irritate surrounding neurovascular structures. Following this, the lesion becomes dark and crusted.  It may create a honeycomb pattern in more extensive infection which is prone to secondary infection and increases the risk of gangrene and tetanus. After healing, scarring can occur.
