- Sequelae of meningococcemia are skin necrosis (ischaemic infarction of skin and soft tissues), hearing loss, deafness, seizure, amputation, and skin scarring. Impaired organ perfusion due to hypovolemia, vasoconstriction, and myocardial failure result in prerenal failure manifesting as oliguria or anuria or acute tubular necrosis.

- Immunologic or reactive complications like arthritis, cutaneous vasculitis, iritis, and pericarditis are due to the deposition of immune complexes with polysaccharide antigen, IgG, and C3 resulting in acute inflammation.
