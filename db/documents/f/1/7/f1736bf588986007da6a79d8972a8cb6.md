Exposure may be chronic or acute and absorbed from the skin, lungs, conjunctiva, mucous membranes, lungs, and GI tract. Dermal absorption appears to be low with increasing absorption in cases of disruption in the skin and exposure to highly toxic carbamates. Rat data shows peak inhibition of cholinesterases by 30 minutes after oral administration.

After massive exposures, patients may become symptomatic within 5 minutes. The time to symptom onset is dependent on the exposure dose and the toxicity of the given carbamate. Highly lipophilic carbamates will redistribute into fat stores from the extracellular fluid quickly and have decreased clinical effects initially.

Carbamates are hepatically metabolized via hydrolysis, hydroxylation, and conjugation, and 90% are renally excreted in a matter of days. Data are conflicting on CNS and cerebrospinal fluid penetration of carbamates. Adults tend to have less CNS toxicity, whereas, in pediatric exposures, CNS depression is often a predominant symptom.  Importantly, carbamates do not undergo the “aging” that occurs during the phosphorylation of organophosphates to acetylcholinesterase**,**and the carbamate-cholinesterase bond hydrolyzes spontaneously within hours.
