FXIII deficiency is a rare bleeding disorder where patients present with a normal coagulation profile. A high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose FXIII deficiency. A strong family history of bleeding disorders, a history of consanguineous marriage, or a history of belonging to high prevalence areas (like Iran) may be present. There is a mismatch between the severity of factor deficiency and clinical presentation. A clot solubility test usually makes a diagnosis. However, this is not a sensitive or specific test, and a lot of variations exist between different institutions. Quantitative assays are preferred screening tests but may not be available in resource-limited settings. Immunologic assays are used only to classify the diagnosis. Cryoprecipitate is used widely in the treatment and prophylaxis for patients with FXIII deficiency. Now a recombinant FXIII is also available for the same purpose. Acquired FXIII deficiency is extremely rare. However, it has been described in elderly individuals and/or in those with numerous comorbidities, especially auto-immune diseases.
