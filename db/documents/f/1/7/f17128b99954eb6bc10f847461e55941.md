Torticollis is posttraumatic 10 to 20% of the time; the remainder is idiopathic. The onset of posttraumatic cervical dystonia is usually within days of injury and 3 to 12 months after injury in the delayed form.

Torticollis is usually a mixture of movements. Torticollis, with some element of rotation, is the most common type. After rotational torticollis, comes laterocollis, then retrocollis, with anterocollis being the rarest type.

There is a female to male predilection of 2 to 1. The onset of idiopathic cervical dystonia typically occurs in the 30 to 50 year age group.  Congenital muscular torticollis is present in less than 0.4% of newborns.
