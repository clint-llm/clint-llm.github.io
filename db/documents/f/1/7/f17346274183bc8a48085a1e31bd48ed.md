The long term disability of MS reflects an accumulation of symptoms from each successive incomplete recovery from relapse.

- Impaired mobility occurs in a majority of patients with long term MS. Reduction in mobility is multifactorial and possibly relates to defective motor control and vestibular symptoms.

- Brain stem lesions involving the oculomotor pathways can cause chronic diplopia. This condition is potentially addressable by prisms and surgery.

- Chronic vertigo is a possible source of morbidity and may respond to meclizine, ondansetron, or diazepam.

- Chronic dysphagia from bulbar dysfunction can be a source of chronic aspiration.

- Cerebellar tremor is a possibly significant source of disability. Wrist weights have a possible role in the management of tremors; however, potential superimposed weakness can preclude the use of wrist weights.

- Urinary tract infections from bladder dysfunction is a known longer-term complication and often requires urology consultation.

- Constipation is the most frequent gastrointestinal complication, and management includes patient education and treatment with increased fiber intake and bulk-forming agents.

- Erectile dysfunction, when present, is often treated with oral phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors

- Cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and generalized fatigue are known long term sources of morbidity and are managed in various ways, often with the help of subspecialty care.
