Hemochromatosis is a disorder associated with deposits of excess iron that causes multiple organ dysfunction. Normally, iron absorption is tightly regulated because the body is incapable of excreting excess iron. Hemochromatosis occurs when there are high pathologic levels of iron accumulation in the body. Hemochromatosis has been called “bronze diabetes” due to the discoloration of the skin and associated disease of the pancreas. Hereditary hemochromatosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in whites. Secondary hemochromatosis occurs because of erythropoiesis disorders and treatment of the diseases with blood transfusions. After the damage of transfused red blood cells by macrophages, iron freed from heme is accumulated in the body. Secondary hemochromatosis is mainly caused by thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, hereditary spherocytosis, X-linked sideroblastic anemia, and pyruvate kinase deficiency.
