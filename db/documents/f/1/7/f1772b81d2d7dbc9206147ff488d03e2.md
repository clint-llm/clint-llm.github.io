The level of severity of symptoms is graded by Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) as follows:

- Grade 1 - any evidence of epithelial damage or atrophy, telangiectasia, microscopic hematuria

- Grade 2 - any moderate frequency, generalized telangiectasia, intermittent macroscopic hematuria, intermittent urinary incontinence

- Grade 3 - any severe frequency or urgency, severe telangiectasia, persistent incontinence, reduced bladder capacity < 150 mL, frequent hematuria

- Grade 4 - any necrosis, fistula, hemorrhagic cystitis, reduced bladder capacity < 100 mL, refractory incontinence requiring either catheter or surgical intervention

Workup focuses on ruling out more common etiologies of urinary symptoms. Urinalysis with urine culture and cytology should always be ordered initially to rule out bacterial infection and cancer. If the patient presents with a history of hematuria, a complete blood count (CBC) should be ordered to assess hemoglobin, white blood cell, and platelet counts. Additionally, if the patient has gross hematuria, it is important to assess volume status as well as order prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) levels. It is also important to assess renal function. A chemistry panel should be ordered to examine electrolyte levels, BUN levels, and creatinine.

Additionally, to further assess the extent of the damage, cystoscopy and renal ultrasound can be utilized. Cystoscopy may show white mucosa with telangiectasia.
