Meckel's diverticulum is a rare diagnosis in adults but should always be on the differential of patients who present with lower abdominal bleeding or abdominal pain.

Meckel's diverticulum, which contains gastric tissue, may be detected with a technetium-99 scan, which is an appropriate first imaging test in patients with painless lower abdominal bleeding.

Remember "the rule of 2s:"

- Occurs in 2% of the population

- Located within 2 feet of the ileocecal valve

- Two centimeters in length

- Two times as likely to be symptomatic in young boys as compared to young girls

- Symptoms often present before the age of 2
