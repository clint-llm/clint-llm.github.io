Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) has a broad differential including vascular, neurodegenerative, autoimmune, infectious, thromboembolic, metastasis/neoplasm, iatrogenic and toxic metabolic conditions. Vascular conditions like strokes or multiple infarcts or cerebral myeloid angioplasty, or hypertensive encephalopathy can lead to rapidly progressive dementia. Vasculitis and intravascular lymphoma can also lead to rapidly progressive dementia. Brain MRI and vascular imaging studies such as MRI angiography and CT angiography can help diagnose vascular etiologies. Infectious causes like viral encephalitis, including herpes simplex virus, HIV dementia, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, fungal infections like central nervous system (CNS) aspergillosis, syphilis, Lyme disease, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, can cause rapidly progressive dementia. Appropriate blood and serological studies can help diagnose infectious causes of RPD. Neurodegenerative conditions like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (iatrogenic, familial), Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, neurofilament inclusion body disease, and progressive subcortical gliosis can also cause RPD.
