The precise etiology of personality disorders continues to elude scientists, giving rise to wide-ranging hypotheses. Psychoanalysts suggest that these disturbances result from a failure to progress through proper psychosexual development. For example, classic Freudian drive theory postulates fixation at different stages manifests as separate disorders; dependent, obsessive-compulsive, and histrionic personality disorders are consequences of fixation at oral, anal, and phallic stages, respectively. Childhood trauma is another etiologic hypothesis. Those with borderline and antisocial disorders suffer from intimacy and trust deficits, both of which may be co-related with childhood abuse and trauma. More recently, researchers have found genetic correlations, specifically in schizotypal, borderline personality disorder (BPD), and antisocial PDs (personality disorders). Genes of interest are those regulating neurotransmission - serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine(NE), which indirectly participate in affect regulation.
