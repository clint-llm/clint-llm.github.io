The presumption is that Reed-Sternberg cells derive from pre-apoptotic germinal center B cells. How the Reed-Sternberg cells escape apoptosis is an interesting topic. First, Reed-Sternberg cells show activity of NF-kappa B transcription factor, and when there is inhibition of the factor, there is an induction of cell death. Other cell lines show inactivating mutations in the inhibitor of NF-kappa B, I-kappa B-alpha or c-Rel amplifications. There have also been suggestions that CD30 receptor may triggerÂ NF-kappa B activity in Reed-Sternberg cells.
