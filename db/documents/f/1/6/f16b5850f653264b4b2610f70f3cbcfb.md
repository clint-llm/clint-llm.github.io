Inert gas narcosis completely resolves upon ascent. It poses no problem in the long term and does not lead to chronic issues or predispose to increased (or decreased) susceptibility to recurrent exposures. However, inert gas narcosis will recur on exposure to pressure, it is unpredictable in severity and can lead to fatalities while diving, due to cognitive impairment in the marine environment.
