**Psoas Abscesses**

The presence of an abscess in the psoas major muscle body is a rare event but needs aspiration. The causes are different, including the proximity to visceral and lymphatic structures, which can invade the muscle and infect the contractile structure.Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, or Escherichia coli. A correct diagnosis requires computed tomography and blood tests; treatment requires abscess drainage and eventual cleaning of necrotic tissue and antibiotic therapy.

**Impingement of the Iliopsoas Tendon**

Following an operation to replace the femoral head, the movement of the artificial head during hip extension may beat against the surrounding soft tissues, including the tendon of the iliopsoas complex. In this case, the surgeon may decide to review the space between the femoral head and the tendon.

**Iliopsoas Bursitis**

Bursitis that involves the tendon of the iliopsoas complex is an inflammation that enlarges the volume of the bursa and produces pain on movement; its etiology is not entirely clarified. It can result from trauma, inflammatory arthritis, excessive use of the tendon in sports actions, or previous hip surgery.

**Other Surgical Motivations**

In the pediatric population, in the presence of spasticity (cerebral palsy and other neurological diseases) and the presence of important contractures, surgery is performed with distal tenotomy.
