Frontal sinus fractures may require an interprofessional team for comprehensive management, depending on the extent of the injury. The emergency response team will be necessary to identify any life-threatening injuries and stabilize the patient upon presentation. Surgical reconstruction will need to be carried out by the appropriate specialists, which will vary depending on associated injuries and surgeon availability. One or multiple board-certified surgeons may be needed to treat these patients, potentially including an otolaryngologist, facial trauma surgeon, oral and maxillofacial surgeon, facial plastic surgeon, neurosurgeon, and/or ophthalmologist. A complete operating room staff, including surgical technicians and circulating nurses, will be imperative to keep the operation moving smoothly and improve surgical outcomes. An intensive care unit or critical care team made up of physicians, nurses, and other staff may be needed to manage the patient medically either pre- or postoperatively.
