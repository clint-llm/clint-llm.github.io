Most cases will not require surgical management. The clinician should seek a surgical evaluation if larvae are too large or difficult to remove; there is the involvement of the eye and/or orbit or scalp infections of pediatric patients.

Effective home remedies found in the literature include the application of petroleum jelly, paraffin oil, pork fat products, or any other thick jelly to suffocate the larva.

Expectant management is also an appropriate means of management if the patient does not desire removal.
