Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare skin disorder associated with zinc deficiency that is most often seen in infants. Zinc is a very important micronutrient that is essential for the proper functioning of the various metabolic and biochemical pathways of the body. Patients treated with zinc have a 100% response, but without zinc, the disorder can lead to premature death. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in identifying and managing these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the classical triad of presentation for acrodermatitis enteropathica.
- Explain the evaluation for acrodermatitis enteropathica and identify the plasma zinc concentration that is diagnostic of acrodermatitis enteropathica.
- Describe the treatment considerations in treating patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica, and explain why patients on therapy require concurrent monitoring.
- Outline the importance of care coordination amongst members of an interprofessional team in evaluating, treating, and monitoring patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica.
