Ova and parasite testing can be performed to help distinguish between different amoebae species. Testing via microscopy will show the presence of protozoa; however, it is essential to differentiate between Entamoeba coli and the pathogenic amoeba, Entamoeba histolytica.Entamoeba coli cyst due to the refractile wall.

On initial microscopy, the cyst of Entamoeba coli typically has eight nuclei, while Entamoeba histolytica typically has four. The peripheral chromatin is coarse and irregularly clumped for Entamoeba coli and fine, evenly distributed for Entamoeba histolytica. The karyosome of Entamoeba coli is irregular, large, and eccentric, with Entamoeba histolytica having a small, round, and centrally located karyosome.

More advanced tests are available, usually to differentiate between pathogenic and nonpathogenic Entamoeba species. These advanced tests include isoenzyme analysis, antibody detection test, antigen detection test, immunochromatographic assays, and electron microscopy.Entamoeba coli.
