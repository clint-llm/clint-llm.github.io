Total joint arthroplasty has transitioned from a fee for service to a bundled payment to incentivize quality of care over quantity of cases. In 2015, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement Model (CJR). Bozic et al. in 2014 demonstrated that 70% of the total cost was post-discharge, and they have created CJR in hopes of stimulating a reduction in cost and complications. This effort has led to the development of standardized protocols and an interprofessional approach for patients undergoing knee replacement. At our institution, personnel integral to the success of a knee replacement include:

- Primary care physician

- Joint class instructor

- Preoperative, intraoperative, and post-anesthesia nurses

- Scrub technician, circulating RN

- Implant representative

- Physician assistant/first assistant

- Resident physician

- Orthopedic surgeon

- Case manager

- Inpatient occupational and physical therapist

- Outpatient physical therapist

- Home health nurse
