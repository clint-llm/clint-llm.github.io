Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a benign, self-limited condition that can present in infants of any gestational age shortly after birth. It is caused by a delay in the clearance of fetal lung fluid after birth, which leads to ineffective gas exchange, respiratory distress, and tachypnea. It often poses a significant, diagnostic dilemma in the care of newborn babies with respiratory distress. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of transient tachypnea of the newborn and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors for transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
- Describe the presentation of an infant with transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
- Describe the management of transient tachypnea of the newborn. 
- Explain the importance of improving coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by transient tachypnea of the newborn.
