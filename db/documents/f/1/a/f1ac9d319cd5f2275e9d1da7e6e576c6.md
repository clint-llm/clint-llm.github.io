The superficial temporal artery runs within the temporoparietal fasciaÂ along with the frontal branch of the facial nerve. The sensory supply to the scalp is from the trigeminal nerve medially and the temporal, auricular, and occipital nerves laterally and posteriorly. Surgical considerations need to account for the course of the frontotemporal branch of the facial nerve in this region. The nerve exits the parotid gland within the parotid-masseteric fascia and will run superiorly within the innominate fascia over the zygomatic arch. At 1.5 to 3 cm above the superior border of the zygomatic arch and 0.9 to 1.4 posterior to the lateral orbital rim, the nerve will transition to a more superficial plane at the undersurface of the TPF. This name for this area is the fascial transition zone.
