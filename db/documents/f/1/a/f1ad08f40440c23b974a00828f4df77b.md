Hernias to the conjoint tendon are common in athletes, commonly known as a sports hernia

Approximately 90% of sports hernias occur in men. The most common patient populations are athletes involved in activities such as running, kicking, sharp turns, changes in direction, or rapid acceleration and deceleration. Football, soccer, and hockey athletes are the most common. The primary symptom is groin pain with exercise. The pain is located on the lower rectus abdominis muscle and may extend to the suprapubic region. It may be subtle in the beginning but can present as a sudden aggravating pain in rare instances. The pain will usually appear the next day following the injury, with a feeling of hardness in the groin and difficulty rising from the bed. The pain wanes with rest and restarts immediately following intensive exercise. Sports hernias can be hard to differentiate from other processes with symptoms of chronic inguinal pain

The diagnosis of a sports hernia is mainly a clinical one. Imaging can be beneficial with an MRI or ultrasound. Patients will often experience severe aching, pain after activity, and upon exertion such as defecation or cough.
