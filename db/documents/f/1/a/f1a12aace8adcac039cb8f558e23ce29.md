Large, nationwide epidemiologic studies published in 2007 and 2008 estimated the point prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the general population at 1.6%, with a lifetime prevalence of 5.9%. No significant difference in rates of borderline personality disorder was found between females and males in the general population. In the clinical setting, however, the ratio of females to males has been reported as 3:1. These studies challenged previous reports that borderline personality disorder was more prevalent in women. The prevalence of borderline personality disorder in the psychiatric outpatient population has been estimated at 11%, and in the psychiatric inpatient population, as high as 20%. Multiple studies examining the relationship between ethnicity and borderline personality disorder have not produced similar results.
