Cortical blindness refers to any partial or complete visual deficit that is caused by damage to the visual cortex in the occipital lobe.

Cortical blindness can result from anyÂ disruption or damage to the normal architecture of the visual cortex. Most commonly, this occurs in patients with a stroke in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery.
