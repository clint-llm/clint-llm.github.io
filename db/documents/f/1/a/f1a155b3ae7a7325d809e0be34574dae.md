The two major disease states characterized by pathologies related to the MNCs of the supraoptic nucleus and/or their product vasopressin are the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and DI.

SIADH results from an inappropriately high activity of vasopressin, which causes excessive renal water absorption leading to hyponatremia and hypervolemia, among other complications. Central SIADH has several etiologies, all of which function to dysregulate hypothalamic vasopressin secretion. Examples of CNS-related causes include meningitis, tumor mass effect, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and multiple sclerosis.

DI results from an inappropriately low activity of vasopressin, causing a lack of renal water absorption leading to severe dehydration, polyuria, hypernatremia, and hypovolemia. Central DI results from either by a lack of vasopressin production by the hypothalamus or by a lack of vasopressin release by the posterior pituitary. The main variants of central DI are idiopathic, acquired, and genetic. Acquired central DI can be the result of tumor mass effect, infection, trauma, and autoimmune damage.Â Genetic central DI is the rarest form resulting from an autosomal dominant mutation to the arginine vasopressin-neurophysin II gene.
