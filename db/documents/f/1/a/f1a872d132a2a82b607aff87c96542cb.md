The diagnosis of retinal dystrophy causes a lot of anxiety to the patient and their family. Patients on knowing the diagnosis are often apprehensive about losing their vision, adding to psychological stress.Â Except for LCA, most conditions are usually slowly progressive, and some have a stationary course.

Another misconception is that these retinal dystrophies are 'not treatable.' These are incurable. However, supportive treatments, such as low vision assessment, support services, and visual rehabilitation can improve a patient's lifestyle to a great extent.
