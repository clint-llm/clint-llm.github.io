Entamoeba histolytica is a protozoan that causes intestinal amebiasis as well as extra-intestinal manifestations. Although 90 percent of E. histolytica infections are asymptomatic, nearly 50 million people become symptomatic, with about 100,000 deaths yearly. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of amebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Entamoeba histolytica medical conditions and emergencies.
- Describe components of evaluation in the work-up for Entamoeba histolytica.
- Summarize the management options available for Entamoeba histolytica.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance Entamoeba histolytica and improve outcomes.
