Circumcision does not lower the risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, or syphilis. However,Â circumcised heterosexual males have an averaged 40% to 60% reduction in acquiring HIV in regions with a high HIV heterosexual population, for example, areas in Africa. There is also a lower prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and herpes simplex virus type 2 transmission.

**Risks**

Surgical risks include, but are not limited to, infection, incision of the glans and urethra, necrosis of the glans, foreskin adhesions, phimosis, or penile loss.
