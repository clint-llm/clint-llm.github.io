The pathophysiology of ectodermal dysplasias involves a complex set of genes and gene products that result in alteration of pathways necessary for proper development of the ectoderm. One such gene us the EDA gene, which is a part of a group of genes that provide instructions for making proteins such as ectodysplasin A. Ectodysplasin A is part of a group of proteins that are important in signaling for the interactions between the ectoderm and the mesoderm. These interactions are essential for the formation of several structures that arise from the ectoderm, including the skin, hair, nails, teeth and sweat glands. Mutations in the EDA, EDAR or EDARADD gene results in defective ectodysplasin A formation thereby preventing normal interactions between these layers and therefore impairing normal ectodermal and mesodermal tissue development. Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is a disorder that has associations with a mutation in the EDA-Ectodysplastin A gene pathway.
