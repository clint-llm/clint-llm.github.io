Up to 5% of patients develop nephropathy related to high-dose methotrexate use. Adequate hydration, urinary alkalinization, avoidance of penicillin, and other drugs that interact with methotrexate are ways to mitigate this toxicity. Recommendations are to observe a two-day gap between iodinated contrast use for imaging and high-dose methotrexate administration. Leucovorin rescue with escalated dosing strategies, as well as the use of the enzyme carboxypeptidase G2 to facilitate methotrexate clearance via the kidneys, are also effective options.

Leuco-encephalopathy following WBRT is due to the involvement of the neural progenitor cells and is observed in up to 24% of cases and can present as subcortical dementia, gait ataxia, and incontinence.

Complications of systemic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma includes:

- Infectious-due to immunosuppressive agents

- Toxic-metabolic- encephalopathy

- Cerebrovascular-strokes

- Paraneoplastic-Â motor neuronopathy and necrotizing myelopathy, and

- Treatment-related complications-radiation myelopathy, or cognitive impairment.
