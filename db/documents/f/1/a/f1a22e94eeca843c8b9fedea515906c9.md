The most informative evaluation for suspected mesenteric venous thrombosis in abdominal imaging. Radiographs are noninvasive and show abnormalities in 50% to 75% of cases. However, they only show evidence of bowel ischemia in less than 5% of cases. CT with contrast medium is the ideal diagnostic tool; its accuracy is approximately 90% for mesenteric venous thrombosis. Bowel wall thickening, thickened mesentery, and ascites which are all indicative of intestinal ischemia, can be observed.

Routine laboratory testing is not helpful for a mesenteric venous thrombosis diagnosis. Although blood screening can be performed for thrombophilic factors, there are no accurate plasma biomarkers for the early detection of intestinal ischemia. Elevated levels of L-lactate dehydrogenase, D-lactate, and L-lactate have been observed in systemic and portal circulation in late-stage intestinal ischemia. These findings suggest an increase in anaerobic glycolysis and intestinal mucosa permeability. Amylase levels can also be elevated with bowel ischemia, but levels higher than 1000 U/L would suggest pancreatitis instead. Abdominal Doppler ultrasonography can detect thrombosis in larger veins but is less sensitive (73% to 80%) and is unable to visualize smaller vena recta.
