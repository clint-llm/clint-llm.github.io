Patients and their families need to be educated on how to recognize the early signs and symptom of bone tumors. Patients with signs of bone pain, swelling of bones or joints, any palpable mass found on the bones, should seek early intervention. Treatment of chondrosarcoma is mainly surgical. Local recurrence can occur after surgery, so long term follow-up is recommended to monitor these patients closely.
