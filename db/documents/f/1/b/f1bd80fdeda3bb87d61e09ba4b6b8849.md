Interstitial lung disease (diffused parenchymal diseases) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by fibrosis (scarring) of the lungs. These are classified on the basis of histopathological, radiologic and clinical parameters. This activity describes the evaluation and management of interstitial lung disease and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the epidemiology of interstitial lung disease.
- Describe the inflammation and fibrosis in the pathophysiology of interstitial lung disease.
- Review the physical exam findings associated with interstitial lung disease.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance delivery of care for patients affected by interstitial lung disease.
