Busulfan is an alkylating antineoplastic agent that has been in use since the 1950s. The FDA-approved indication for busulfan isÂ for use with cyclophosphamide as part of the regimen before allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation, specifically for patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. Non-FDA-approved indications for busulfan are for patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation, but for other malignancies, whether acute or chronic, and other nonmalignant disorders like hemoglobinopathies, congenital metabolic diseases, or inborn errors of the immune system.
