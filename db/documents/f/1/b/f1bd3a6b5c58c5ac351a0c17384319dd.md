Syndactyly often requires an interprofessional healthcare team to achieve good outcomes. At a minimum, a hand surgeon/orthopedic specialist needs to be consulted for evaluation to assess surgical candidacy. If an underlying genetic syndrome is suspected, a referral to a pediatric geneticist or geneticist is warranted. Finally, physical therapy, occupational therapy, or hand therapy consultations may be indicated to assist with postoperative care such as pain, scar, and edema control, as well as mobilization of the digits.
