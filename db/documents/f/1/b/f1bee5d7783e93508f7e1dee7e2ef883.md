Despite awareness of the benefits of pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis, there remain many challenges ahead. Data suggest that less than 5% to 10% of high-risk individuals have access to this therapy in the United States and even fewer outside of North America. In the United States, despite the approval for pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis in 2012, universal adoption has been slow. Similarly, in Europe, the number of individuals at high-risk for HIV have not participated in the treatment by the thousands; they only number in the hundreds. Another US study showed that awareness of pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis in the United States is lowest among young black men who have sex with men.

Pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis has been fully approved in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and several African and European countries, but drug availability is a problem. In some countries, the drug regimen is too expensive, and in other countries, there are are no national guidelines established, which makes it difficult for healthcare workers to prescribe the treatment. Finally, in many countries, despite having a national healthcare system, the drug regimen often is not available for free. Even in Canada, with its well-established, free healthcare system, this drug regimen is not free, but there are plans to cover it under the universal healthcare system in the future.

The other limiting factor is lack of knowledge among healthcare workers about the availability of this treatment. While awareness has increased over the past five years among infectious disease experts, most other healthcare workers outside this specialty remain unaware.

To improve accessibility, in California, patients can get a prescription for pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis via a mobile app without even having to see a healthcare worker. The individual enters their data into an app, and the information is transmitted to a healthcare worker who then determines if the treatment is suitable. Of course, before a prescription is sent to the pharmacy, the individual must undergo blood testing to make sure that he or she is HIV negative.

In South Africa, two pilot programs called UChoose and PlusPills have been developed to reach out to young people who are at high risk for acquiring HIV.

The one other factor that has limited the use of pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis is that many people who could benefit from this treatment are not aware of it. Countless surveys done in Europe, Africa, and the United States indicated that only 30% of young men who have sex with men have heard about pre-exposure chemoprophylaxis. Individuals more likely to have heard about it usually are older, have some health insurance, are better educated, or reported as having acquired at least one STD in the past.
