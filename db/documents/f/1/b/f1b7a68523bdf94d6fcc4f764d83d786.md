While we have talked in detail about what constitutes a 'normal' and 'abnormal' temperature, given the many factors influencing the results of temperature measurements in humans, there can never be a single, universally accepted temperature cutoff defining a fever. This clinical reality, however, does not remove the need for precision in measuring and reporting fever.

**Instruments Used in Diagnosing Fever**

- Digital sublingual thermometer

- A temperature probe is placed under the patient's tongue, with the lips closed around the instrument. The patient should not have recently smoked or consumed hot or cold substances. Digital thermometers are recommended over glass thermometers, as they have a disposable probe cover and give results in approximately 10 to 20 seconds, as opposed to 3 to 5 minutes for a glass probe.

- Digital rectal thermometer

- They are indicated in children and patients who cannot fully cooperate. A lubricated blunt-tipped thermometer should be inserted approximately 4 to 5 cm into the anal canal at a 20-degree angle from the horizontal, with the patient in a prone position. A rectal temperature reading is the preferred method in patients suspected of hypothermia. A rectal probe and a thermocouple are essential for measuring temperatures as low as 25 C (77 F).

Before each new measurement with a digital thermometer, the device should be reset to below 35 C (95 F).

- Infrared forehead thermometer

- This method involves taking a temperature measurement a short distance from the frontal bone without contacting the skin. Devices such as these function by converting infrared radiation from the forehead into an electrical signal, which is then used to determine a temperature reading.

- Infrared tympanic thermometer

- This method detects infrared radiation from the tympanic membrane and converts it into an electrical signal, which is then interpreted as a temperature reading. This method involves patient contact and requires cleaning after each patient.

- Infrared temporal artery thermometer

- This method utilizes a thermometer that records temperature by slowly moving the device from the center of the forehead over to the lateral hairline. This detects infrared radiation emitted from the skin over the superficial temporal artery. This thermometer takes up to 1,000 readings/second and reports the highest temperature.

**Fever Suppression**

- Fevers are typically managed with antipyretics, which work by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), thereby reducing the levels of PGE2 within the hypothalamus. Other mechanisms of antipyretics have been suggested, which include reduction in proinflammatory mediators and enhancement of anti-inflammatory signals at the site of injury. While one may feel inclined to give an antipyretic to all febrile patients, this is not recommended. Some antipyretics may cause patient discomfort, predispose patients to adverse effects from other medications ingested, or interfere with the accurate assessment of patients receiving antibiotics.

While most patients with an elevated body temperature have a typical fever, there are some instances in which the body temperature increases above the fever threshold, termed hyperthermia or hyperpyrexia. Hyperpyrexia may typically be seen in heat-related illnesses such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke, which are usually caused by overexertion and dehydration in a hot environment. Other causes include obesity, metabolic conditions, adverse drug reactions (malignant hyperthermia or neuroleptic malignant syndrome), and age, with individuals under four and greater than 65 years old at an increased risk for a heat-related illness.

**Heat Exhaustion:**Temperature above 38 degrees C (100 degrees F) in the presence of any of the following symptoms

- Increased sweating

- Pale, clammy, cold skin

- Generalized weakness

- Tachycardia with weak pulse

- Nausea or vomiting

- Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting

**Heat Stroke:**Temperature above 40 degrees C (104 degrees F) in the presence of any of the following symptoms

- Hot, red, dry skin

- Tachycardia with a strong pulse

- Delirium, convulsions, or coma
