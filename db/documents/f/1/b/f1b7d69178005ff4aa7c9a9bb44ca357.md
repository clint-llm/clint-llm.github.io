There is limited data on naltrexone hydrochloride overdosage in humans. In one study, patients who received 800 mg daily naltrexone hydrochloride for seven days reported no symptoms of toxicity. Cases of hepatitis and liver dysfunction have been observed; transient asymptomatic hepatic transaminase elevations may also occur. Hepatotoxicity is dose-dependent. Reports exist of depression, suicidal ideation, and suicidal attempts. Monitor the patient for symptoms of depression or suicidality.

**Treatment of Overdosage**

No known antidote for naltrexone exists. Treat patients symptomatically in a closely monitored environment. Clinicians should contact a poison control center for the latest information.
