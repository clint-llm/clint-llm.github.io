Radon is one of the main causes of lung cancer in non-smokers. It is estimated to cause around 21,000 deaths annually. It is a radioactive gas that is tasteless, odorless, and colorless. Naturally occurring in the environment, it is the decay product of uranium-238 and radium-226. As an extremely dense and highly radioactive gas, it can damage the respiratory epithelium through the emission of alpha particles. It can be found in the soil, rocks, and ground throughout the world. It can exist in water supplies and can be entrapped in homes. It has a tendency to build-up in large quantities in areas with poor ventilation, and high levels can eventually cause health concerns. Recently, there has been a statistically significant linear relationship found with increased radon concentrations and an increased risk for lung cancer.

Given that it is imperceptible by color, taste, or smell, and causes no obvious symptoms of irritation or exposure, measuring radon levels is the only way to know if there exists a high level of exposure.
