Hydroxyurea toxicity management requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including nursing staff, pharmacists, emergency medicine physicians, internists, and hematology-oncologist. Emergency medicine physicians should monitor for signs of respiratory depression and stabilize the patientâ€™s airway. Consultation with a medical toxicologist/and or contact the poison center in patients with an unclear diagnosis may be necessary. Hematologists care for inpatients. Critical care and oncology nurses monitor patients and notify the team of issues.

Nurses and pharmacists should educate patients on the side effects of medication and signs of symptoms that require monitoring while taking the drug, and the pharmacist should work with the clinicians to perform medication reconciliation and verify the absence of drug-drug interactions. This interprofessional approach will lead to better outcomes in cases of hydroxyurea toxicity. [Level 5]
