The vast majority of viral conjunctivitis is caused by adenoviruses, and frequent hand washing, disinfection, and isolation of conjunctivitis patients can reduce further community transmission. There is no single treatment modality for viral conjunctivitis. Symptom relief with artificial tears, cold-compresses, and antihistamines can be effective. Antibiotic drops can potentially increase bacterial resistance and membranes or pseudomembrane require removal to reduce discomfort and scarring. The use of topical corticosteroids is indicated in select cases in the presence of membrane formation and subepithelial infiltration associated with photophobia and decreased vision.
