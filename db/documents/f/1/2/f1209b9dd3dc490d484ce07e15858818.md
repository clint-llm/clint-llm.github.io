Histological examination of a skin biopsy in patients suspected to have argyria will reveal numerous, tiny, brown, or black granules, which are deposited in a linear distribution along the basement membrane of eccrine glands.

The epidermis is spared, which is a characteristic that may be used to help distinguish argyria from other pigmentation disorders.
