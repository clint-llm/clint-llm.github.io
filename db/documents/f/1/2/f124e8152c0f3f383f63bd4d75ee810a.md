An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are usually immiscible but under specific transforming processes will adopt a macroscopic homogeneous aspect and a microscopic heterogeneous one. In an emulsion, one liquid is dispersed in the other. There are several types of emulsions:

- An emulsion oil in water (O/W) is composed of an oil phase dispersed in an aqueous one. It is known as a direct emulsion. Stabilization of O/W emulsion is often performed with hydrophilic-hydrophobic particles. The hydrophilic end of the emulsifier molecule has an affinity for water, and the hydrophobic end is drawn to the fat/oil. By vigorously mixing the emulsifier with the water and oil, it creates a stable emulsion. For example, milk is oil in the water type of emulsion. In this mixture, fat globules are dispersed in the water.

- Emulsion water in oil (W/O) is composed of an aqueous phase dispersed in the oil phase. A water in oil emulsion is much fattier than a direct emulsion. Margarine is a water in oil emulsion.

- Other emulsions such as oil in water in oil, or water in oil in water exist as well. Blood is also an emulsion. It consists of negatively charged colloidal particles, which are albuminoid substances.
