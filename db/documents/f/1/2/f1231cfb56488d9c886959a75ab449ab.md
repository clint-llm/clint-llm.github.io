Disruption of vestibulo–ocular reflex results in symptoms such as nausea, head tilt, imbalance during walking, and other daily life activities, dizziness, oscillopsia, and blurred vision during motion. The vestibulo–ocular reflex is testable using various examinations, including head impulse testing, rotational chair testing, velocity step test, impulse angular acceleration, and caloric reflex test. In the caloric reflex test, the examiner irrigates the external auditory canal with 20 to 40 ml of ice water, leading to slow movements of the eyes towards the ear irrigated and corrective horizontal nystagmus towards the contralateral ear under the normal physiological conditions.
