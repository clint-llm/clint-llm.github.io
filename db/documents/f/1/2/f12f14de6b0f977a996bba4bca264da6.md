The optic fissure plays an essential role in the development of a wide variety of ocular structures. As such, its clinical significance is broad. The classic example of an ocular condition due to errors in optic fissure embryogenesis is coloboma.

A coloboma is a congenital hole in a portion of an ocular structure. The etiology of colobomas is defective closure of the optic fissure.

- Trisomy 13

- Trisomy 18

- Oral-facial-digital syndrome (type VIII)

- Lenz microphthalmia syndrome

- MIDAS syndrome

- Catel-Manzke syndrome

Blindness may occur in some cases of coloboma, and care is necessary to manage the condition to preserve vision. Patients often need genetics evaluation for systemic disorders, monocular precautions, and interval monitoring for retinal detachment. Treatment strategies vary based on the case, with a few options being the surgical repair of an iris defect, specialized cosmetic contact lens, prosthetic iris device placement, and refractive correction.
