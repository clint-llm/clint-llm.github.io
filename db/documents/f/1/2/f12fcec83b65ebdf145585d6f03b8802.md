Contraindications to ureteroscopy are few. Active urinary tract infection would require treatment and confirmed resolution before ureteroscopy. This typically involves placement of a percutaneous nephrostomy or a double-pigtail ureteral stent to establish urinary drainage on the affected side as well as the usage of appropriate antibiotics. Contraindication to general or spinal anesthesia would typically prohibit ureteroscopy. Bleeding diatheses or ongoing anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy are relative contraindications and should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Other contraindications would include ureteral kinking or narrowing (usually treatable with double-pigtail stenting) and impassable anatomy involving the ureteral orifice, prostate, trigone, or distal ureter due to cancer or other disorders. Flexible ureteroscopy is considered safe during pregnancy, unlike SWL, which is contraindicated, but thought should be given to anesthesia considerations and the possibility of early induction of labor.

The single most important predictor of postoperative urinary tract infectious complications is the presence of a pre-operative urinary infection. Other risk factors include female gender, pre or postoperative stenting, diabetes mellitus, positive nitrites on pre-operative urinalysis, and longer operative length.
