**Paranasal Sinuses**

The total function of the paranasal sinuses is unclear. The cavities allow for the increase in the bony structure without adding significant mass. They also provide social cues that indicate such things as gender and sexual maturity. Respiratory mucosa lines the paranasal sinuses. This respiratory mucosa is ciliated and secretes mucus.

The ethmoid sinuses are between the orbits. They typically are formed by a series of labyrinths, which vary in number from 3 to 18. These ethmoidal air cells are divided regionally into anterior, middle, and posterior, based on the location of their apertures. The anterior ethmoidal sinus opens into the ethmoidal infundibulum or the frontonasal duct. The middle group opens into the ethmoidal bulla or just superior to it. The posterior group opens onto the lateral wall of the superior nasal meatus.

The largest of the paranasal sinuses is the maxillary sinus. There are two pyramidal-shaped maxillary sinuses located bilaterally in the maxilla of the face. It fills the bone in its entirety to reduce the mass of the maxilla. The maxillary sinus opens into the center of the semilunar hiatus found in the lateral wall of the middle nasal meatus.

The triangular-shaped frontal sinuses are in the frontal bone superior to the orbits. These sinuses vary in size. They open at the lateral wall of the middle meatus, which then continues as the semilunar hiatus, which drains the maxillary sinus.

Finally, the sphenoidal sinuses are in the body of the sphenoid. They open into the posterior wall of the sphenoid-ethmoidal recess.

**Dural Venous Sinuses**

The dural venous sinuses are in the brain. The venous drainage of the brain begins as networks of small canals that drain into the larger vein, which then empty into the dural venous sinuses. These sinuses drain into the internal jugular veins. Of note, the diploic and emissary veins also drain into the venous sinus system.

The superior sagittal sinus is at the superior border of the falx cerebri. It empties into the confluence of sinuses found posteriorly. It typically receives cerebral veins from the superior cerebral hemispheres and veins from the falx cerebri.

The inferior sagittal sinus is on the inferior border of the falx cerebri. As it ends posteriorly at the tentorium cerebelli, the great cerebral veins join it and become the straight sinus. The straight sinus runs along the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli before ending at the confluence of sinuses. The straight sinus usually receives blood from the posterior segments of the cerebral hemisphere surfaces, deep areas of the cerebral hemispheres via the great cerebral vein, superior cerebellar veins, and the falx cerebri.

The cavernous sinuses receive blood from the cerebral veins as well as the ophthalmic veins and emissary veins. The cavernous sinus has several structures that pass through it. They are the internal carotid artery and the abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI). Cranial nerves III, IV, V1, V2, or oculomotor, trochlear, ophthalmic, and maxillary nerves pass through the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus.
