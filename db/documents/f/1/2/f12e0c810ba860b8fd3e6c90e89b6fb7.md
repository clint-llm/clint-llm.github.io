Zoanthids are common in oceans of tropics and subtropics; this includes coastlines of Hawaii, Florida, Brazil, Australia, Japan, and many Atlantic islands. They usually live in the shallow, hard-bottom floors of the ocean up to 12 meters deep. However, zoanthids can be easily purchased online so that the toxicity can occur at any place. The majority of the cases of Coral toxicity are among aquarium enthusiasts. In recent times, an increasing number of cases of inhalational exposures have been reported among aquarium handlers during the cleaning or handling of coral for a prolonged time.
