Oxybutynin is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention, bladder obstruction, poorly controlled narrow-angle glaucoma, obstructive gastric disorders, or gastric dysmotility. In addition, it should not be used in patients who have hypersensitivity to the drug or its components.

Cautious use is recommended for elderly or frail patients, those with dementia treated with cholinesterase inhibitors, Parkinson disease, patients with myasthenia gravis, and those with renal or hepatic impairments.

The dose of the extended-release formulation needs to be reduced or stopped if the patient experiences the anticholinergic central nervous system adverse reactions to oxybutynin. Also exercise caution in patients with autonomic neuropathy,Â with the use of extended-release formulation, as it may aggravate the symptoms of decreased gastric mobility.
