Clinicians involved in the care of newborns should be familiar with the history and physical exam findings of caput succedaneum and be able to differentiate and exclude etiologies of birth-trauma-associated edema. Clinical decision-making and exam findings consistent with a diagnosis of caput succedaneum should be documented in the electronic health record. Parents and caregivers must be educated on the condition. The patientâ€™s primary care provider should be made aware of the finding through the documentation so that they can ensure resolution of the swelling during early well-child checks. [Level 1]
