An intestinalÂ fistula is a complication of an underlying disease, surgical procedure or injury. To better assess, manage, and prevent fistulae a good understanding of the pathophysiology of fistula formation process is needed.

More complex fistulae that result after surgical procedures are formed by a leak of the intestine formation a collection of intestinal content that eventually finds its way to another organ or surface. The similar but slightly simpler process takes place in the fistula-in-ano formation.
