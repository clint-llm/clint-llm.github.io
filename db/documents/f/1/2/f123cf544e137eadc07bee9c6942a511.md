Diagnosis and management of a chance fracture are best done with an interprofessional team. If the fracture is not appropriately treated, it has enormous morbidity.

Identification of a “seat-belt sign” in the setting of trauma should elevate suspicion for possible Chance fracture, and also for mesenteric and/or intestinal injury. When one of these injuries or signs are identified, the radiologist must search for the other associated injuries to make certain they are not overlooked. Awareness of and communication of the important physical findings that suggest important underlying injuries like Chance fractures and mesenteric and intestinal injuries must be discussed between the caregivers, including emergency physicians, surgeons, and nursing staff, and radiologists who may not see the patient’s physical findings. The general surgeon and urologist must be involved early in the care if there is suspicion of bowel or bladder injuries. Nurses need to provide deep venous thrombosis and pressure ulcer prophylaxis. Most patients have significant pain, and hence the pharmacist should educate the patient on pain medication and assess for drug-drug interactions. Physical therapy is an integral part of treatment and determines outcomes. To improve outcomes, team members must communicate with each other. [Level 5]
