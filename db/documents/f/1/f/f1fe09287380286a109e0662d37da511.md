Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a type of congenital heart disease that results in the underdevelopment of the left-sided structures of the heart, including the mitral valve, left ventricle, aortic valve, the ascending aorta, and aortic arch. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of hypoplastic left heart syndrome and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and caring for patients with this condition. The diagnostic echocardiogram findings and the three stages of surgical palliative repair will be discussed in detail.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the echocardiogram findings in a neonate with hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
- Outline and explain the three stages of surgical repair for hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
- Review pharmacologic agents that can also be used to alter pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication amongst interprofessional team members to enhance care coordination for patients affected by hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
