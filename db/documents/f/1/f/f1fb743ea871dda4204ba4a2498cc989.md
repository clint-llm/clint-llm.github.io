Smears can be examined under potassium hydroxide (KOH) wet preparation. Hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Papanicolau stains are used in scrape smears, and air-dried smears are examined with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and May-Grünwald-Giemsa stains. Surgical sections are processed in paraffin and examined with H&E and PAS stains. Histopathology evaluation of the debrided tissue will reveal elongated broad ribbon-like hyphae irregularly branching at right or obtuse angles, with no or scanty septations. Thrombosed blood vessels with significant necrotic areas and giant cells are also noted. Widespread infiltration with lymphocytes, eosinophils, and occasional plasma cells is seen. Calcofour-white or Grocott-Gomori's methenamine silver staining demonstrates twisted septate hyphae.
