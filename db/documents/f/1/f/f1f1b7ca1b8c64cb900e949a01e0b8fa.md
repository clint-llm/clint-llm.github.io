Acute MI still carries a high mortality rate, with most deaths occurring prior to arrival to the hospital. At least 5%-10% of survivors die within the first 12 months after the MI, and close to 50% need hospitalization within the same year. The overall prognosis depends on the extent of muscle damage. Good outcomes are seen in patients who undergo early perfusion- thrombolytic therapy within 30 minutes of arrival or PCI within 90 minutes). In addition, outcomes are good if the ejection fraction is preserved and the patient is started in aspirin, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors.

Factors that negatively affect prognosis include:

- Diabetes

- Advanced age

- Prior MI, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), or stroke

- Delayed reperfusion

- Diminished ejection fraction (the strongest predictor)

- Presence of congestive heart failure (CHF)

- Elevated C-reactive protein and BNP levels

- Depression
