The diagnosis and management of angioedema is best done with an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, anesthesiologist, allergist, pharmacist and an intensivist. Time is of essence as the condition can rapidly lead to respirtaory distress.

Because initially, the cause of angioedema is likely to be unknown, the mainstays of initial medical management include supplemental oxygen, a parenteral H-blocker, a parenteral steroid, and intramuscular epinephrine. Unfortunately, in AAE standard regimens of epinephrine, corticosteroids and antihistamines do not have much effect and are not recommended for AAE. Administration of plasma-derived or recombinant C1-INH can resolve acute attacks, but some patients will become non-responsive
