Various scoring systems have been created to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis based on clinical, laboratory, and radiology findings; however, they have largely demonstrated low specificity and low positive predictive values. These include Ranson’s criteria, the APACHE II score, BISAP, and the CT severity index, among others. Further, the American Pancreatic Association and the American College of Gastroenterology differ in their criteria for prognosticating a severe disease course. While the number of hospital admissions for acute pancreatitis is increasing and 15% to 25% of cases categorize as severe acute pancreatitis, the mortality rate has significantly decreased to 1% to 2% throughout the last ten years. A recent report showed that following an initial episode of acute alcoholic pancreatitis, there was a 24% chance for a recurrent AP episode and a 16% chance of developing chronic pancreatitis
