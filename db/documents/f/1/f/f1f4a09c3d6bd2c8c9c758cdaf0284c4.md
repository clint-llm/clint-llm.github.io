There is very little knowledge available about the etiology of this disorder, but some evidence that has been collected claims it to be a result of impaired immunoregulation that causes abundant proliferation of B lymphocytes and plasma cells in lymphoid organs. These conditions can result from chronic low-grade inflammation, lymphoid-hamartomatous hyperplasia, viral infections, abnormal modulation of cytokines, and angiogenesis.

In addition, a very close association of the disease with HIV has been discovered, which puts immunodeficiency on the list as well. Particularly in MCD, the causative factors include human herpesvirus (HHV)-8, which causes deregulation of the inflammatory mediators like CD20 and interleukin (IL)-6.

Almost all cases of HIV-associated Castleman disease are HHV-8 positive, compared to 40 to 50% of non-HIV CD. The remaining cases unrelated to HIV or HHV-8, termed idiopathic multicentric CD (iMCD), have no established etiology to date.
