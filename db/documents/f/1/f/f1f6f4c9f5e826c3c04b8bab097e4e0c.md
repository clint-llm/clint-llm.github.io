The advent of pneumococcal vaccines has proven to be a significant advancement in treating and preventing a widespread and sometimes deadly disease process. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccines are recommended differently depending on the patient population. While both vaccine types are proven to stimulate long-lasting antibodies in immunocompromised adults, conjugate vaccines have been shown to provide some additional benefits, as will be covered here. This activity describes the mode of action of pneumococcal vaccines, including methods of administration, formulations, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, and monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the types of pneumococcal viruses requiring vaccinations.
- Summarize the absolute and relative contraindications of the pneumococcal vaccine. 
- Review the methods of administering pneumococcal vaccination and eligible patients for each type of vaccine. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance pneumococcal vaccination and improve patient outcomes.
