After obtaining informed consent, position the patient depending on which approach to the radial nerve block is being attempted as outlined below in the technique section. Subsequently, either povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine 2% can be used to prepare the skin over the site of anesthetic injection. Next, applying a sterile probe cover to the ultrasound probe is recommended, followed by the application of sterile gel to the intended injection site. Lastly, a local anesthetic is drawn up into a syringe. Ensure appropriate monitoring and access to 20% lipid emulsion in cases of local anesthetic systemic toxicity.
