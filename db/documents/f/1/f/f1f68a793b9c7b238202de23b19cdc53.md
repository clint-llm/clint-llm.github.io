Risk factors for homonymous hemianopsia are those related to the common causes. Vascular insult being most frequent, patients should be aware of their possible stroke risk. Atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, smoking history, obesity, heavy alcohol intake, and previous vascular injury are all factors.

For patients already experiencing homonymous hemianopsia, driving is a serious concern. It should be made aware to the patient that operating machinery with a visual field loss may put themselves and others at risk.
