Patients on octreotide therapy or somatostatin therapy must stop treatment. Long-acting octreotide should be stopped 4 to 6 months before the scan. These medications may affect the test results, although conflicting results may occur as previously described. Dose alteration may be necessary in cases of renal impairment. This test has a lot of factors contributing to false positive and negative results. A false-positive test may occur in:

- Respiratory tract infections/ other infections

- Pulmonary/pleural collections after radiotherapy

- Recent surgical/colostomy site

- Tracer accumulation in normal sites(pituitary, thyroid, liver, spleen, kidney, intestines, gall bladder, ureter, bladder, stimulated adrenals)

A false-negative test may occur in:

- Unlabeled somatostatin present as a result of octreotide therapy/ production by tumor

- Different somatostatin receptors demonstrate variable affinities for radioligands, particularly insulinomas and medullary thyroid cancers.

- Hepatic metastases of neuroendocrine tumors can look isointense; can correlate along with subtraction scintigraphy along with sulfur colloid or anatomical imaging (CTscan/MRI)
