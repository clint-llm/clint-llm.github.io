**Drug Interactions**

- Pitavastatin is mainly metabolized by glucuronidation via liver UGTs, and there is comparably only minimal metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes.
- The following drugs may decrease the serum concentration of pitavastatin: darunavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ezetimibe, digoxin, and itraconazole.
- The following drugs may increase the serum concentration of pitavastatin: cyclosporine, erythromycin, rifampin, atazanavir, gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, enalapril, and diltiazem.
