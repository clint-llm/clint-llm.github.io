Management of Holmes tremor is particularly challenging as it involves resting, intention, and postural tremors. The quality of life of patients is very affected in those untreated or unresponsive. Collaboration shared decision making, and communication is a crucial element for a good outcome. The interprofessional care provided to the patient by the neurologist, neurosurgeons, and nurses must use an integrated care pathway combined with an evidence-based approach for the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment planning. This will improve patient satisfaction and provide better outcomes.
