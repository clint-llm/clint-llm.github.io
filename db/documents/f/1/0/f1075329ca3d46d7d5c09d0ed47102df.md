Local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) refers to local anesthetics reaching toxic plasma levels. Initial signs of LAST are tinnitus, perioral numbness, and metallic taste. Classically, LAST progresses from central nervous system excitation (anxiety, muscle twitching, seizures) to depression (sleepiness, loss of consciousness, and respiratory depression) followed by cardiac excitation (tachycardia, hypertension) and finally depression (bradycardia, hypotension, arrhythmias, asystole).

Chloroprocaine doses greater than 11 mg/kg may cause LAST. Please note that LAST has been reported with local anesthetic doses below the maximum recommended dose.

Careful attention to the prevention of overdose is necessary, with monitoring of the cardiovascular system and level of consciousness following each injection. If overdose is suspected, full hemodynamic support may be required. Benzodiazepines are the preferred treatment for seizures. Airway management for local anesthetic toxicity may range from supplemental oxygen to assisted ventilation to initiation of invasive airway devices and positive pressure ventilation.

Critical differences in local anesthetic-induced cardiac arrest treatment include reduced doses of epinephrine (<1mcg/kg) and avoidance of vasopressin, calcium channel blocks, beta-blockers, or other local anesthetics. Dosing is 100 ml (or 1.5ml/kg for patients less than 70kg) 20% lipid emulsion given as a bolus followed by infusion is the treatment of choice for LAST.
