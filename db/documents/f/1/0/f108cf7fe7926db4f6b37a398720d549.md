**Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA)**

Posterolateral approach

One of the most common surgical approaches preferred by total joint replacement surgeons is the posterolateral approach.  This dissection does not utilize a true inter-nervous plane. The intermuscular interval involves blunt dissection of the gluteus maximus fibers proximally and sharp incision of the fascia lata distally. The deep dissection involves a meticulous dissection of the short external rotators and the hip joint capsule. Care is necessary to protect these structures as they are later repaired back to the proximal femur via trans-osseous tunnels.

Peripheral nerve injury in THA

Multiple studies have reported the incidence rates and overall risk of peripheral nerve injuries during the most common THA approaches. The incidence rates reported varying widely in the literature.  Reports dating back to the 1980s and 1990s cited up to an 8% incidence rate in THA patients.

Inferior gluteal nerve considerations

While most literature reports focus injury to the sciatic, femoral, obturator, superior gluteal, and lateral femoral cutaneous nerves, much less attention is given to the inferior gluteal nerve.  Also, the exact clinical outcome "definition" varies significantly from study to study, and with the majority of nerve injuries, fortunately, being mild in nature (i.e., mild neuropraxia), the postoperative clinical examination likely underestimates the true incidence of neurologic injuries following THA; this is particularly true in the case of the inferior gluteal nerve.

Multiple cadaveric studies have documented the anatomy and course of the inferior gluteal nerve concerning its anatomic susceptibility during the posterolateral approach to the hip.  Apaydin et al. used 36 cadavers to develop a triangular landmark for the inferior gluteal nerve; this region included: posterior inferior iliac spine, ischial tuberosity, and greater trochanter.

Other technical considerations

While many authors support the utilization of minimal invasive THA techniques, the potential benefits of these procedures can only truly achieve clinical fruition with superior knowledge of nerve anatomy, as trading the benefits of superior visualization during these procedures can potentially be offset by an increased risk of iatrogenic neurovascular injuries.

Techniques to reduce the likelihood of nerve compromise are achievable; one way is through a more minimally invasive total hip arthroplasty, where the surgeon does not dissect the gluteus maximus tendon and removes less tissue significantly reducing nerve compromise.

Marcy et al. describe a different approach to the hip. They do not split the gluteus maximus, but only retracted the muscle backward with little damage to the nerve. This technique, however, has its disadvantages, high mobilization of the muscles, and labor-intensive.
