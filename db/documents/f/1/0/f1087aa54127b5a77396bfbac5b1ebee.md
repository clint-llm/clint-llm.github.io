In the United States, malignant melanoma is now the fifth most common cancer in men and seventh in women, with about 50,000 new cases diagnosed annually. About 15% of these lead to death. At the time of diagnosis, about 80% present with localized disease, 15% with regional disease, and 5% with distant metastasis. When a physician refers a patient with malignant melanoma to a surgeon, and a shave biopsy is used to confirm the diagnosis, it is imperative that the surgeon tactfully educate that physician about appropriate diagnostic measures of the melanoma.
