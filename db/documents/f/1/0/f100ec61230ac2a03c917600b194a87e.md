Although it is a rare illness, there is an estimated 1 in 125,000-250,000 individuals affected by ADEM each year. Though most cases occur in children (majority younger than age ten, and the remainder between the ages ten to 20), ADEM has been documented in adults ranging from ages 18-82 as well. The disease occurs more commonly in males than in females (male to female ratio 1.3:1), and more often seasonally in the winter and spring (historically, the colder months of the year).

The risk of developing ADEM depends on some factors including an individual’s genetics, exposure to infectious organisms, immunization exposure, and lighter skin pigmentation. All ethnic groups are susceptible to developing ADEM, and the condition occurs worldwide.

In 50% - 75% of cases, ADEM is associated with either a preceding infection or vaccination, and the majority of cases follow a viral or bacterial infection (although the causative pathogen is not always identified).
