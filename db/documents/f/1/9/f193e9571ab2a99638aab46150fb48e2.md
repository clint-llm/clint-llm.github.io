Bedbug bites result in various presentations among patients. Some patients show almost no visible sign of bites, with others present with large urticarial wheals greater than 1 cm and in the extremely rare reported cases of anaphylactic reactions. The bites are typically seen most often on the face, neck, hands, but can also appear on any other skin areas exposed while the patient is sleeping. A classic hallmark sign is the “breakfast, lunch, and dinner” sign seen as a grouping of bites, typically three or more, in a line or close cluster.
