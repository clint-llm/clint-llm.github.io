Patellofemoral syndrome is a condition with a relatively good prognosis; however, it can limit a patient quite substantially secondary to pain. In patients with anterior knee pain, the history of present illness is key toÂ determine the correct diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is established, the provider must counsel the patient on the timeline of treatments and the need for rest. Physical therapy is important in the recovery phase of the condition and should be initiated as soon as the patient can tolerate activity. It is important to have a clear line of communication with the physical therapist, to improve patient outcomes better. It is also important to have their input as to when the patient is clear to return to a sports or exercise regimen.
