Mutations in several small LDL raising alleles cause polygenic hypercholesterolemia. Polygenic hypercholesterolemia is asymptomatic. It neither causes severe atherosclerosis nor presents with cardiovascular disease at an early age. Polygenic hypercholesterolemia is asymptomatic and is usually diagnosed during a routine screening and after further evaluation of abnormal lab values. Since it is genetically inherited, it runs in families. But lifestyle factors also play a major role such as a diet rich in saturated fat, lack of exercise, etc.
