The noxious stimulus of a spinal nerve creates ectopic nerve signals that are perceived as pain, numbness, and tingling along the nerve distribution. Lesions of the intervertebral discs and degenerative disease of the spine are the most common causes of lumbosacral radiculopathy. However, any process that causes irritation of the spinal nerves can cause radicular symptoms. The differential diagnosis for lumbosacral radiculopathy should include (but is not limited to) the following:

- Degenerative conditions of the spine (most common causes)

- Spondylolisthesis: in the degenerative setting, this occurs as a result of a pathologic cascade, including intervertebral disc degeneration, ensuing intersegmental instability, and facet joint arthropathy
- Spinal stenosis
- Adult isthmic spondylolisthesis is typically caused by an acquired defect in the par interarticularis

- Pars defects (i.e., spondylolysis) in adults are most often secondary to repetitive microtrauma

- Trauma (e.g., burst fractures with bony fragment retropulsion)

- Clinicians should recognize spinal fractures can occur in younger, healthy patient populations secondary to high-energy injuries (e.g., MVA, fall from height) or secondary low energy injuries and spontaneous fractures in the elderly populations, including any patient with osteoporosis
- Associated hemorrhage from the injury can result in a deteriorating clinical and neurologic exam

- Benign or malignant tumors

- Metastatic tumors (most common)
- Primary tumors
- Ependymoma
- Schwannoma
- Neurofibroma
- Lymphoma
- Lipomas
- Paraganglioma
- Ganglioneuroma
- Osteoblastoma

- Infection

- Osteodiscitis
- Osteomyelitis
- Epidural abscess
- Fungal infections 
- Other infections: Lyme disease, HIV/AIDS-defining illnesses, Herpes zoster (HZ)

- Vascular conditions

- Hemangioblastoma, arteriovenous malformations (AVM)
