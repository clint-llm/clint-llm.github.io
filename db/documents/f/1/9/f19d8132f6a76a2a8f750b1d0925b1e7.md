The downstream effects of placental insufficiency on the developing fetus are complex and multifactorial; however, the major effects tend to be a placental respiratory failure and fetal hypoxemia, both of which contribute to intrauterine growth restriction and its associated effects including prematurity.

The most detrimental complication is obviously a complete lack of placentation and thus miscarriage. For the developing fetus, the degree of umbilical artery abnormalities seen on doppler is correlated with acidosis, resuscitation requirements, pressor support, ventilatory support as well as multisystem organ failure, which tends to occur when there is hypoxemia as this triggers a redistribution of blood flow in the developing fetus to essential organs such the as the brain and heart at the expense of other pertinent organs, such as the bowels and kidneys.

With increasing placental resistance during pregnancy, the already IUGR fetus is at further risk for hypoglycemia, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia.
