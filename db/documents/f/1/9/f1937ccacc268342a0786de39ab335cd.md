Most invasive Kingella kingae infections are benign if diagnosed and treated timely. Most strains of Kingella kingae except the beta-lactamase resistant species are susceptible to commonly prescribed antibiotics for children. Children often recover fully from osteoarticular infections without any complications. Though intravertebral abscess may develop from Kingella spondylodiscitis, it responds well to antibiotics. Complications resulting in narrowing of the intervertebral disks are not common.

Endocarditis from Kingella kingae can be life-threatening, with mortality close to 20%. Aggressive management is often necessary for a favorable outcome.
