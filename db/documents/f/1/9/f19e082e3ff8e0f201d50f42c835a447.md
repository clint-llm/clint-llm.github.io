Cardioplegia following aortic cross-clamping results in many physiological changes that may hinder the recovery of the myocardium. It is essential to understand the electrolyte abnormalities, myocardial stunning, pH imbalance that may occur secondary to cardioplegia administration. Before coming off cardiopulmonary bypass, electrolytes, temperature, glucose, pH, hemoglobin, and hematocrit must be within normal limits. Excessive physiological changes may result in myocardial stunning, arrhythmias, ischemic injury leading to the inability to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass. Prophylactic measures are taken to reduce the complications of cardioplegia, such as frequent blood sampling by the perfusionist and notifying the surgeon and anesthesiologist of derangements while treating abnormalities as they present.
