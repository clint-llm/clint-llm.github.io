The electrical conduction through the heart starts at the sinoatrial (SA), which then travels to the surrounding atrial tissue to the atrioventricularÂ (AV) node. At the AV node, the electrical signal is delayed for approximately 100 milliseconds. Once through the AV node, the electrical signal travels through the His-Purkinje system, which distributes the electrical signal to the left and right bundles, and ultimately to the myocardium of the ventricles. The pause at the AV node allows the atria to contract and empty before ventricular contraction.

The most common cause of SVT is an orthodromic reentry phenomenon, which occurs when the tachycardia is secondary to normal anterograde electrical conduction from the atria to the AV node to the ventricles, with retrograde conduction via an accessory pathway from the ventricles back to the atrial.

A narrow QRS complex (< 120 milliseconds) indicates the ventricles are being activated superior to the His bundle via the usual pathway through the His-Purkinje system. This implies that the arrhythmia originates from the sinoatrial (SA) node, the atrial myometrium, the AV node, or within the His bundle.

In the rarer antidromic conduction, conduction passes from the atria to the ventricles via the accessory pathway, then returns retrograde through the AV node to the atria.
