The diagnosis and management of coronary artery fistulas are highly dependent on an effective interprofessional team. In pediatric patients, it is essential for nursing staff to monitor vital signs of the neonate/infant to check for any signs of tachypnea or tachycardia. Neonatologists and pediatricians are essential to diagnose any murmurs that infant patients might present with, thus referring these patients to a pediatric cardiologist.

In adult patients, hospitalists and cardiologists should work together to appropriately diagnose patients with coronary artery fistulas. These patients might present with symptoms/signs of myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias. Hospitalists should complete appropriate initial workup, and consult the cardiology team. Cardiologists can obtain a coronary CT angiogram to assess for coronary artery fistulas. [Level 3]
