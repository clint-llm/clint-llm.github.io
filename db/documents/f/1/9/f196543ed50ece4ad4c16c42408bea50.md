AAION: In cases of high suspicion treatment with high dose corticosteroids should be started immediately after drawing samples for CBC, ESR, CRP without waiting for results of investigations. Immediate treatment prevents vision loss in another eye as there are high chances of involvement of the second eye within days to weeks. Temporal artery biopsy can be delayed for 7 to 10 days if immediate facilities are not available. Pathological changes in the temporal artery will not be affected as they take weeks to months to change. High-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1 g/day) for 3 to 5 days is preferred. Some studies suggest different duration for intravenous steroid use, a three-day course of high-dose IV steroids, suggesting benefit on visual recovery in the same eye and prevention of disease in the second eye is favored.

There is no proven therapy for NAION. Treatments that are thought to affect, to some extent, include corticosteroids, optic nerve sheath fenestration surgery, levodopa. Prevention of fellow eye is the main concern, and aspirin has shown good results. Adequate control of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking, obstructive sleep apnea has proven benefit in secondary prevention of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and PION.
