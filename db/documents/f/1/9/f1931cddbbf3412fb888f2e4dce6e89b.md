**Cartilage repair:**Cambium layer (deep layer) of the periosteum contains multipotent stem cells that can differentiate in both osteoblasts as well as chondroblasts. The periosteal graft can help to repair the articular cartilage defect.

**Bone repair**: The periosteum is also used to repair a bone defect; the fibula is one of the common bone used for bone grafting. Various reconstructive surgical procedures now require autologous periosteum for repairing lost tissues.

Periosteal grafts and periosteal stripping can be used in limb equalizing procedures in patients with limb length discrepancies.

Periosteum plays a significant role in the recovery from orthopedic and invasive dental procedures.

Excessive periosteal generation contributes to Paget’s disease. A heterogeneous region of osteosclerotic bone models in precincts of the formerly pure osteolytic skeleton. Long bones and patchy sclerosis that superimposes on earlier osteolytic processes directly show this development. Over time, bone traits may evolve into a dominant osteosclerotic appearance. The appearance is coordinated with periosteal new bone formation, increasing bone circumference.
