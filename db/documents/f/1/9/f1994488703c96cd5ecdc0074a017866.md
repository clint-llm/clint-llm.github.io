Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a relatively common tumor; however, with early detection and effective management, the 5-year survival rates are excellent (over 90%). The majority of patients first present to the primary care physician or internist, and if suspected, urologist consultation should be sought early. The key to improved survival is early diagnosis and prompt referral. Stringent adherence to follow-up protocols will catch recurrence early for effective and proper management. The oncology nurse and social worker should be involved in effective post-operative care and follow up as well as assist the provider in monitoring the patient and provide regular follow-up support. The pharmacist needs to educate the patient for drug effects, side effects, and complications of targeted immunotherapy. Thus, an interprofessional team approach is necessary for patientsâ€™ physical and mental health and support and positive outcomes as the recovery and follow-ups are rigorous and prolonged over five or more years.
