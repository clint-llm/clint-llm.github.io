Pregnancy is a physiologic state that requires close monitoring and evaluation from the time of initial diagnosis to the expulsion of the full products of conception. Patients with high-risk pregnancies should be observed and monitored more closely.

**History**

A detailed history should be taken at the initial visit as well as in subsequent prenatal follow-up visits. The obstetric provider should obtain a comprehensive history. The essential components of the medical history should include:

-  The first day of the last menstrual period (LMP)

-  Gestational age

-  Parity

-  Prepregnancy weight

-  Immunization history

-  Previous/existing medical conditions including diabetes mellitus, obesity, polyhydramnios, RH incompatibility

-  Past pregnancies, including previous macrosomic infants’ mode of delivery, associated complications, child gender

**Physical Examination**

A detailed physical examination should include monitoring of patient weight at each prenatal visit that should be correlated with suggested U.S. institute of medicine guidelines (IOM) as follows:

-  A weight gain of 28-40 lbs (12-18 kg) for patients with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18****kg/m^2

-  A weight gain of 25-35 lbs (11.5-16 kg) for patients with body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m^2

-  A weight gain of 15-25 lbs (7-11.5 kg)  for patients with body mass index (BMI) between 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m^2

-  A weight gain of 11-20 lbs (5-9 kg) for patients with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m^2

Any aberrations of the patient’s weight should prompt a repeat abdominal examination with measurement of fundal height correlated with the patient’s gestational age and the subsequent performance of Leopold maneuver by the obstetric provider. According to Tthe (ACOG) Ameican college of obstetrics and gynecology, weighting the newborn after delivery is the most accurate way to diagnose macrosomia, and no singular modality such as Leupold maneuver, fundal height measurement, or an ultrasound scan can effectively diagnose macrosomia. A combination of these factors, on the other hand, should warrant a very high suspicion index.
