Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally, and many interventions are performed to treat it. However, despite the potential benefits of these procedures, they may fail due to restenosis caused by neointimal hyperplasia (NIH). Neointimal hyperplasia refers to post-intervention, pathological, vascular remodeling due to the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells in the tunica intima layer, resulting in vascular wall thickening and the gradual loss of luminal patency which may lead to the return of vascular insufficiency symptoms. This activity describes the pathophysiology of neointimal hyperplasia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of neointimal hyperplasia.
- Describe the presenting features of neointimal hyperplasia. 
- Outline the treatment options available for neointimal hyperplasia.
- Explain the importance of optimizing coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by neointimal hyperplasia.
