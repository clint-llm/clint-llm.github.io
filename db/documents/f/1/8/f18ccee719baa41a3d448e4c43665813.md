The Babinski reflex was described by the neurologist Joseph Babinski in 1896. Since that time, it has been incorporated into the standard neurological examination. The Babinski reflex is easy to elicit without sophisticated equipment. Since it is a reflex, it does not require active patient participation and, therefore, can be performed in patients who are otherwise unable to cooperate with the neurological exam. This activity describes the technique for performing the Babinski reflex test and how to interpret the results. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with upper motor neuron lesions.

**Objectives:**
- Outline how to perform the Babinski reflex test.
- Describe the physiologic pathway of the Babinski reflex.
- Describe the clinical relevance of the Babinski reflex.
- Explain how the facilitation of interprofessional team education and discussion can optimize the effective performance of the Babinski reflex test and inform the need for subsequent evaluations.
