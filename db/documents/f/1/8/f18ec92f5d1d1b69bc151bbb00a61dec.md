**Secretory PLA**

Due to the well-known significance of secretory PLA in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of inflammatory disease processes, attempts at synthesizing inhibitors of the enzyme have been underway for quite some time for the treatment of asthma and atherosclerosis in relation with cardiovascular diseases. Broad-spectrum inhibitors of the enzyme, such as varespladib, have been shown to cause a substantial decrease in the size of atherosclerotic lesions and an increase in HDL in mice. These results indicate that the enzyme remains a viable target for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis, and further research is needed to evaluate safety and efficacy in humans. Other research targets related to the enzyme may be shifted towards upstream or downstream enzymes in the same pathway to achieve similar results, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR).

**Cytosolic PLA**

Cytosolic PLA has received much attention as a target for pharmaceutical drugs being the most potent PLA enzyme studied as playing a pivotal role in inflammatory disease pathogenesis. A wide variety of cytosolic PLA inhibitors have been developed and studied regarding their efficacy in treating inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory-mediated hyperalgesia. Clinical trials are necessary to validate the safety and efficacy of these experimental drugs in human subjects. Future studies are needed to evaluate the pharmacological targeting of this enzyme to affect cell cycle progression for the treatment of various cancers and proliferative glomerulopathies.

**Ca-Independent PLA**

Research regarding the clinical role in Ca-independent PLA inhibitors is much more limited than some of the other more well-studied forms of the enzyme. As further research explains the clinical significance of the enzyme, the development of pharmaceutical targets within the enzyme will become more evident. Of note, a recent study showing the efficacy of 2 Ca-independent PLAÂ inhibitors in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic agents have proved to be effective in inhibiting the development of some forms of ovarian cancer.

**Lysosomal PLA**

One important studied function of lysosomal PLA involves the activation of pulmonary T-cells in response to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This role warrants further investigation of the pharmacological treatment of tuberculosis. More research is needed to evaluate the role of enzymatic manipulation of lysosomal PLA on various other disease processes.

**Adipose-Specific PLA**

Knock-out mice that lack adipose-specific PLA exhibit a high rate of lipolysis and an increase in fatty acid oxidation within adipocytes. These findings suggest that pharmacological inhibition of normal enzymatic function may be useful in the treatment of obesity.

**Platelet-Activating Factor Acetylhydrolase**

Due to its well-studied role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, researchers have studied platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase inhibitors regarding their efficacy in lowering the risk for cardiovascular events. One notable studied inhibitor in clinical trials includes darapladib, which yields promising results in the prevention and attenuation of events related to coronary artery disease.
