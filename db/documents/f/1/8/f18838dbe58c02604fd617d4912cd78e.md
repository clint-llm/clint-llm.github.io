Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is a pathological state that results from bicarbonate loss, rather than acid production or retention. Bicarbonate loss leading to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis occurs in a variety of ways: gastrointestinal (GI) causes, renal causes, and exogenous causes. GI loss of bicarbonate occurs through severe diarrhea, pancreatic fistula, nasojejunal tube suctioning from the duodenum, and chronic laxative use. This activity reviews the causes and presentation of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
- Review the causes of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
- Summarize the treatment of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis.
