Eczematous cheilitis could be due to loss of plasticity, delayed-type hypersensitivity or atopy, depending upon the type.

Angular cheilitis is a result of by softening of tissue from excessive moisture from saliva and secondary infection with Candida albicans or, less frequently, Staphylococcus aureus.

Actinic Cheilitis originates from the proliferation of atypical epidermal keratinocytes due to chronic sun exposure.

Drug-induced cheilitis is mainly caused by excessive dryness of mouth and lips.

Glandular cheilitis results from fibrosis surrounding the salivary glands. Dense chronic inflammatory infiltrates may be found in severe cases.

Cheilitis granulomatosis results from long-standing edema and perivascular inflammation of lip and facial tissue. As the infiltrates become more dense, pleomorphic and small focal granulomas are formed, indistinguishablefrom systemic granulomatosis.
