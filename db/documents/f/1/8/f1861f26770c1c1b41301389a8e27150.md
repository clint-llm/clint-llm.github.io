The diagnostic mode of imaging for GBM is contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Studies have shown that in the majority of cases, tumor diameter is between 5-10 cm at diagnosis.

An intraoperatively removed tumor is required for definitive diagnosis through a histopathological exam.

Testing to assess for the presence or absence of GFAP, IDH mutation status, and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status is usually recommended. MGMT methylation status is useful to predict response to specific chemotherapeutic agents.
