- Summary of risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia and the area of focus for prevention include: (1) treatment factors that promote colonization of oropharynx or stomach, (2) factors that promote gastric reflux and aspiration like depressed mental status, supine position, nasogastric tubes, (3) duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation, and (4) factors that interfere with adequate pulmonary toilet, thoracic or abdominal surgery or immobilization.

- Methods for decreasing the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia include but are not limited to the following, and most institutions utilize “prevention bundles” to reduce the risk: (1) judicious use of reflux medications, (2) removal of unnecessary nasogastric tubes, and (3) daily evaluation of readiness to extubate, pain-control, and maintenance of mechanical ventilation system are all part of protocols ICUs use to decrease the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
