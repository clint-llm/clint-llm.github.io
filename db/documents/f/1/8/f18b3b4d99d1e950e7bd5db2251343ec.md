Primary and secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy possess similar clinical and pathologic features, suggesting they may share similar pathogenicity.

Pathologic examination of digital clubbing in both primary and secondary forms reveals increased capillary density, capillary dilation, edema, and hyperplasia of fibroblasts and vascular smooth muscle. Increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been implicated as a pathophysiological mechanism. Abnormal vascularization, hypoxia, chronic inflammation ultimately result in the stimulation and release of VEGF, and these are implicated in some of the conditions associated with SHO.

Abnormal vascularization is believed to derive from abnormal fragmentation of megakaryocytes into platelets.

In PHO, genomic studies have identified mutations in the 15-hydroxyprostaglandin-dehydrogenase encoding gene (HPGD). HPGD is the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of PGE2 in the pulmonary vasculature. Impaired inactivation due to bypassing of this vasculature or inadequate breakdown of PGE2 by 15-hydroxyprostaglandin hydrogenase leads to higher levels of this prostaglandin. PGE2 induces transcription of VEGF in osteoblasts and stimulates bone formation, activates endothelial cells which increase transcription of VEGF and promote local angiogenesis. These may explain the changes seen in PHO.
