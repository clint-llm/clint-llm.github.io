Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) are cystic neoplasms of the pancreas that grow within the pancreatic ducts and produce mucin. They have the potential to become malignant, for that reason; diagnostic criteria have been published to identify which patients will require surgical resection. The criteria usually involve anatomic identification based on imaging including the size of the cyst, the presence of a nodule, architectural changes, obstruction of the main duct, and presence of symptoms.
