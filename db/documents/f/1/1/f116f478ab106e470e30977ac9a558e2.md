Several anatomical and physiological concepts are essential to comprehend the various techniques of myocardial protection fully. One of the cardinal concepts was arresting. The heart was supporting the need for energy while maintaining cellular integrity. This achieves the two goals of a bloodless still field and avoids air embolism risks upon opening the heart's left side. This concept was the pillar of creating the first cardioplegic solution. The idea was administering a high potassium concentration solution directly into the coronaries to arrest the heart.

**Original physiological foundation concepts of myocardial protection**

- 
(Nernst Equation – Action potential – Electrolyte composition)

The exact interaction between potassium and the myocyte action potential was extremely crucial in developing cardioplegia and its evolution. Walther Hermann Nernst in 1881 created Nernst's equation that enables us to calculate the equilibrium potential (in this case resting potential) of any given membrane (the myocyte membrane) given the concentration of any ion (in this case electrolyte K) on both sides of the membrane. The equation is

- E = 61.5 log 10 (C / C)

Where E is the resting potential, C is the concentration of K outside the membrane, and C is the concentration of K inside. If potassium outside is typically 4 mmol / L, the resting membrane is naturally – 90 mV. If potassium increases to 20 mmol/ L, this makes the resting potential -50 mv. But how will this lead to the arrest of the heart action potential?  Fig 1. The idea essentially relies on the extracellular fluid around the myocyte. If it gets displaced by a cardioplegic solution of a potassium concentration 20 mmol/L instead of the usual 4 mmol/ L, the myocyte becomes "trapped" in a state of resting membrane potential of – 50 mv, which prevents phase 0 from initiating since sodium channels need a threshold of – 70 mv to open. This threshold potential is not achievable as long as the extracellular potassium is 20 mmol rather than 4 mmol as per the Nernst equation. The composition of extracellular and Intracellular fluids accordingly plays a significant role in the action of cardioplegia Table 2

(Calcium load/paradox – Oxygen consumption – Elements of protection)

It was noticed that the histological changes found after only 30 and 60 minutes of ischemia/reperfusion were comparable to the degree of necrosis generally seen after 24 hours of permanent coronary occlusion. Researchers accordingly concluded that there must be effects for reperfusion just as equal to ischemia, and the term ischemia-reperfusion injury then evolved. Unfortunately, this is beyond this paper's scope, yet we mention two of the elements of I/R injury relevant to our topic here. That is calcium overload and calcium paradox. Upon using the first cardioplegic solution, a series of observational studies reported abnormal heart failure, intractable fibrillation, and widespread necrosis. One of the mechanisms proposed for this damage was calcium overload. The idea is summarized in Fig2. Calcium free solutions were then proposed. However, these also showed a similar phenomenon upon reperfusion with physiological calcium levels. This phenomenon was referred to as the calcium paradox, multiple theories were postulated, and one of the widely accepted theories is illustrated in Figure 3. It is essential to mention that the observation of effects preceded the full understanding of the mechanisms.

It was evident that any cardioplegic solution imposes some damage along with its protective effect. To solve this dilemma, researchers launched a careful examination of the elements of protection and injury. One of these critical studies was the oxygen consumption of the myocardium. In a series of experimental studies, Follette et al. and Gerald D. Buckberg described the O2 consumption of the myocardium and compared it in normal hearts, beating decompressed hearts on CPB, fibrillating hearts, and electromechanically arrested hearts Table 3

**Table 3:
** Myocardial oxygen consumption in beating empty heart, fibrillating heart, and arrested heart

Lots of information was deducted from this study. The factor that produces the most reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption is electromechanical arrest regardless of the temperature. The heart in the fibrillating state effectively reduces oxygen consumption than the decompressed beating heart except at normothermia.

Hearse DJ, in his book published in 1981 titled 'protection of ischemic myocardium: cardioplegia, 'described the elements of myocardial protection in detail. Hearse divided the protection into three main items. 1) electromechanical arrest 2) hypothermia 3) additive protective factors to counteract the deleterious effects of the solution used and hypothermia. Magnesium citrate to counteract calcium overload, THAM /HCO to counteract acidosis, mannitol/albumin to counteract cellular edema, local anesthetics such as procaine to counteract membrane instability, and amino acids/glucose counteract reduced energy substrates and nutrient stores, for instance.

**Anatomical Concepts of Myocardial Protection**

The anatomy of coronary circulation and venous drainage of the heart is also essential in understanding the rationale behind myocardial protection strategies. For instance, studies have shown that retrograde cardioplegia alone is suboptimal in protecting the right ventricle because tributaries of the coronary sinus are poorly distributed among the right ventricular muscle mass, and venous drainage of the right ventricle involves the use of Thebesian veins more frequently. Using retrograde cardioplegia in severe proximal coronary artery disease has proven more effective in protecting the left ventricle because of the more widespread distribution of coronary sinus tributaries. It enables the cardioplegic solution to reach beyond the obstruction points.
