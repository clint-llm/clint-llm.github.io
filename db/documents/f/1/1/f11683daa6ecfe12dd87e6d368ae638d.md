Management of hypothyroidism is the mainstay of treating hypothyroid myopathy. It is reversible with timely diagnosis and prompt treatment.

With adequate thyroid hormone replacement and restoration of normal thyroid function, gradual resolution of most neuromuscular symptoms is noted in most of the patients. CK levels fall quickly with thyroxine replacement with a few weeks and could resolve even before TSH comes to a normal range. Hence, this can be used as a surrogate to monitor response to treatment in the initial stages, as the myopathic symptoms can take up to 6 months to resolve. Most of the symptoms resolve within a year of adequate hormone replacement.
