Perianal streptococcal dermatitis (PSD) is a slight misnomer. The term dermatitis is used to describe an irritated and inflamed epidermis. While an irritated epidermis is observable with PSD, the disease is actually most commonly caused by the infection of group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS). Therefore, PSD is more correctly a variant of cellulitis rather than dermatitis.
