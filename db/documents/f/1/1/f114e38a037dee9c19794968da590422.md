Intratympanic steroid injection is used to treat cochleovestibular symptoms of inner ear disease, such as Meniere's disease or idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss. This procedure involves using a syringe needle to penetrate the tympanic membrane to inject the steroid into the middle ear. This activity describes this technique and its role in treating the symptoms of inner ear disease. It is generally well-tolerated and can avoid the potential side effects of systemic steroid administration.

**Objectives:**
