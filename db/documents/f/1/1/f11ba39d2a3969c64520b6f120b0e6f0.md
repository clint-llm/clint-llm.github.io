Epithelial cells are among the most abundant cells covering the skin, body cavities, and blood vessels. They contribute significantly to several aspects of the human life cycle from embryogenesis to adulthood. Their highly specialized histologic feature is critical for their physiological functions in different organs. Disorders of epithelial cells morphology and function have been confirmed in multiple clinical conditions, including cancer, organ fibrosis, celiac disease, andÂ bullous pemphigoid.
