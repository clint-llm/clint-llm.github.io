BM must be distinguished from primary brain tumors. Imaging studies are very useful to further evaluate the symptoms, but rarely some patients may need a definitive brain biopsy for diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging modality for the diagnosis of BM. Non-contrasted MRI or CT scans are less sensitive compared to the contrast MRI.

Radiological features help differentiate BM from other CNS lesions. The following features are helpful to accurately characterize the BM

- Presence of multiple lesions

- Tumor localization at the junction of the gray and white mater

- Large vasogenic edema compared with the size of the lesion

- Circumscribed margins
