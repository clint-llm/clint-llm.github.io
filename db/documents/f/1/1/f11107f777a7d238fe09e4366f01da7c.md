Any patient visiting the outpatient department with a DVD to any general ophthalmologist must be referred to an expert pediatric ophthalmologist for a higher opinion and further management. The pediatric ophthalmologist plays a critical role in deciding for conservative or surgical management in these cases. The skill and expertise of the pediatric ophthalmologists will help in deciding the need for spectacles, patching or occlusion therapy, fusion exercises, or surgical management.
