Since the drug is primarily renally excreted, patients should undergo diuresis to eliminate as much of the drug as possible.

Even though viloxazine intoxication is extremely rare, close monitoring is necessary for children during treatment, as most of the viloxazine studies reported significant adverse side effects in ADHD children. Moreover, higher rates of suicidal ideation and behavior were seen in pediatric patients taking viloxazine versus a placebo. Therefore, closed monitoring is imperative in children who have been prescribed the medication.

There is no established therapeutic index of viloxazine in humans. However, studies show that safety dosage has been defined. Viloxazine can be safely administered and increased up to a maximum of 400 mg for two weeks. In patients with renal failure, the dosage can be increased up to a maximum of 200 mg.
