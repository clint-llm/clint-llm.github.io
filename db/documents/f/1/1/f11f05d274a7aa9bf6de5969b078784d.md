Studies have not shown a predominance of esophageal candida in either sex. Increasing age, HIV infection and the use of corticosteroids have been found to correlate with candidal esophagitis.  The median age of a person with esophageal candidiasis is 55.5 years. Several studies have shown esophageal candidiasis incidence rates ranging from 0.32 to 5.2% in the general population. There is a 9.8% prevalence in HIV-positive patients. The risk of esophageal candidiasis increases in HIV patients when the CD4 count is less than 200. The prevalence of esophageal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients appears to be decreasing due to the effectiveness of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HARRT). However, the incidence in non-HIV patients appears to be increasing, possibly due to comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus or from medications such as antibiotics and corticosteroids. Some studies show that smoking tobacco also correlates with developing esophageal candidiasis.
