Rehabilitation therapy plays a key role in treating and preventing hip bursitis by strengthening the muscles around the hip joints. These muscles support and stabilize the pelvic girdle to lessen tendon irritability and joint reaction forces. Therapeutic, manual, stretching, and strengthening exercises are performed in 3 phases.

Phase 1 management of pain and inflammation includes Ice therapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, acupuncture, topical massage, and brief usage of mobility assistance devices to off-load the afflicted side. Side-lying leg raises, standing hamstring stretching exercises, Clamshells, proprioception, balancing, and piriformis stretching exercises are included in phase 2 rehabilitation. The 3rd phase includes training of core muscles, gait, and biomechanics analysis. Patient education, postural awareness, and return to sports activity are the last rehabilitation phase's main goals.
