Esophageal motility disorders can be broadly subdivided into two categories:

- Primary disorders (due to esophageal diseases per se)

- Secondary phenomena (esophageal dysfunction is part of more global disease, such as in pseudo-achalasia(tumor, compression, etc.), Chagas disease, and PSS (scleroderma).

The motility disorders can also be classified based on the site of pathology:-

I. Oropharyngeal dysphagia (oropharynx is the site)

**Neuromuscular**

- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig disease)

- CNS tumors (benign or malignant)

- Idiopathic UES dysfunction

- Manometric dysfunction of the UES or pharynx†

- Multiple sclerosis

- Muscular dystrophy

- Myasthenia gravis

- Parkinson disease

- Polymyositis or dermatomyositis

- Postpolio syndrome

- Stroke

- Thyroid dysfunction

**Structural**

- Carcinoma

- Infections of pharynx or neck

- Osteophytes and other spinal disorders

- Prior surgery or radiation therapy

- Proximal esophageal web

- Thyromegaly

- Zenker diverticulum

**Neuromuscular (Motility) Disorders**

**Primary**

- Achalasia

- Distal esophageal spasm

- Hypercontractile (jackhammer) esophagus

- Hypertensive LES

- Nutcracker (high-pressure) esophagus

**Secondary**

- Chagas disease

- Reflux-related dysmotility

- Scleroderma and other rheumatologic disorders

**STRUCTURAL (MECHANICAL) DISORDERS**

**Intrinsic**

- Carcinoma and benign tumors

- Diverticula

- Eosinophilic esophagitis

- Esophageal rings and webs (other than Schatzki ring)

- Foreign body

- Lower esophageal (Schatzki) ring

- Medication-induced stricture

- Peptic stricture

**Extrinsic**

- Mediastinal mass

- Spinal osteophytes

- Vascular compression

II. Esophageal dysphagia (mid and lower esophagus is the site)

Dysphagia due to pharyngeal or UES dysfunction can also be included in a discussion of esophageal motor disorders, but this is usually a manifestation of a more global neuromuscular disease process. The major focus of this article will be on primary motility disorders, particularly achalasia. However, mention will be made of the secondary motility disorders and proximal pharyngoesophageal dysfunction when important unique features exist.
