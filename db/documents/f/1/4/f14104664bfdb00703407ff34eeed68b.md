The nose has a rich arterial supply. Most nosebleeds are anterior and come from Kiesselbach's plexus, situated on the anteroinferior nasal septum in a region known as Little's area. Kiesselbach's plexus is an anastomosis of several small arteries, including the sphenopalatine artery, the anterior ethmoidal artery, the posterior ethmoidal artery, the superior labial artery, and the greater palatine artery.

Posterior epistaxis occurs at more posterior sites on the nasal septum or the lateral wall. Bleeding usually comes from the sphenopalatine artery but can also involve terminal branches of the maxillary artery, the descending palatine artery, the posterior ethmoidal artery, and even the internal carotid artery.

Not all epistaxis is arterial. A notable portion of posterior expistaxis arises in Woodruff's plexus on the postero-lateral wall of the nasal cavity, just posterior to the inferior turbinate. This vascular network is not well characterized but is thought to be a submucosal venous plexus.
