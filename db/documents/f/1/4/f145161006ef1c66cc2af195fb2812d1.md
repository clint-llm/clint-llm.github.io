Ginger root is generally considered safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and daily approved intake of up to 4 grams is deemed safe. With higher doses, there is potential for the development of gastrointestinal discomfort, allergic reactions, prolonged pre-existing bleeding, central nervous system depression, and arrhythmia.

Studies have shown that in cases of above 6 grams ingestion, ginger root can exacerbate gastrointestinal disturbances such as gastrointestinal reflux, heartburn, and diarrhea. It can cause warfarin toxicity and potentiate warfarin’s anticoagulant properties, potentially leading to bleeding. It can lower blood pressure and has been shown to cause arrhythmia in a small number of cases. By increasing the bile acid secretion, it can aggravate gallstone formation.
