**Treatment and Antidotes**

**Acetaminophen**: Approximately 4% of acetaminophen gets metabolized to N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), a toxic metabolite that causes hepatic necrosis. NAPQI combines with glutathione to form nontoxic metabolites. In the setting of acetaminophen overdose glutathione gets depleted leading to an accumulation of NAPQI and subsequent hepatic injury.

**Organophosphates**: There are three important medications to remember for treatment of organophosphate poisoning. The first is atropine which blocks the build-up of excess acetylcholine.

**Warfarin**: There are currently three options available for the reversal of warfarin - vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and three or four-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC). Oral vitamin K can be used to reverse warfarin if immediate treatment is not necessary. In the event of more life-threatening bleeding 10mg of IV vitamin K should be given over 20 to 60 minutes. However, it may take several hours to see the full reversal effect after infusion of IV vitamin K. Serious bleeding, therefore, requires administration of clotting factors with either FFP or 4FPCC. FFP is created from whole blood and includes both pro and anticoagulant properties.

**Digoxin**: Anti-digoxin Fab should be given to patients presenting with digoxin toxicity and life-threatening arrhythmias or hyperkalemia. The dose (in number of vials) for both commercially available preparations of anti-digoxin Fab can be estimated by dividing the total amount ingested (in mg) by 0.5 (mg of digoxin bound per vial of Fab).

**Ethylene glycol and methanol**: Both ethylene glycol and methanol are not themselves toxic but are metabolized to toxic intermediates by alcohol dehydrogenase. Ethylene glycol is metabolized to glycolic acid, causing metabolic acidosis, and then to oxalic acid which combines with ionized calcium in the plasma to form calcium oxalate. Calcium oxalate then deposits in the renal tubules leading to acute kidney injury. Methanol is metabolized to formic acid, leading to metabolic acidosis and damage to the retina and optic nerve. Ethanol or fomepizole can be used to as they compete with the active site of alcohol dehydrogenases, decreasing the formation of the toxic metabolites of ethylene glycol and methanol. Treatment is recommended for the following

- Serum ethylene glycol concentration  greater than or equal to 62 mg/dL

- Methanol concentration greater than or equal to 32mg/dL

- Recent ingestion with an osmolal gap higher than 25

- Suspected ingestion plus two or more of the following: 

- arterial pH less than 7.3
- serum bicarb less than 20
- an osmolol gap greater than 25
- presence of urinary oxalate crystals or visual disturbance

While both ethanol and fomepizole can are viable options in toxic alcohol poisoning, fomepizole has become the treatment of choice in the United States since its approval in 1997. It is a potent competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, has few side effects, is easy to use, and may preclude the need for hemodialysis in many patients.

****Hydrofluoric**acid**: Treatment of hydrofluoric acid burns begins with removing the patient from the source of contamination and removing any remaining hydrofluoric acid (removal of contaminated clothing, lavage in the nearest shower for at least 30 minutes). Next, the burns should receive treatment with 2.5% topical calcium gluconate gel (rubbed into the affected area for 15 to 30 minutes ). Gauze moistened with 10% calcium gluconate can also be wrapped around the burns; this neutralizes the fluoride ions and blocks their infiltration into deeper tissues.

**Isoniazid**: Treatment for isoniazid overdose or seizures in a patient with suspected isoniazid toxicity is IV pyridoxine. The dose is generally 1g IV or 1g of pyridoxine per gram of isoniazid ingested.

**Tricyclic antidepressants**: Sodium bicarbonate should be given to patients presenting with TCA overdose and dysrhythmias or hypotension (Grade C evidence). It should also be a consideration in cases of QRS widening over 100ms in association with TCA overdose (Grade E evidence).

**Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers**: Treatment of calcium channel blocker and beta blocker overdose is similar. Treatment consists of calcium, glucagon, and high-dose insulin therapy. Calcium is given as an initial IV bolus of 10 to 20ml of 10% calcium chloride, or 30 to 60ml of 10% calcium gluconate (for pediatric patients the dose is 0.2 ml/kg or 0.6 ml/kg respectively) with repeated boluses can be given every 15 to 20 minutes for up to four additional doses.

**Heavy metals**: Heavy metal toxicity treatment is with chelation therapy. For lead toxicity dimercaprol (British anti-lewisite, BAL), edetate calcium disodium, and succimer are the most common options. A fourth agent, penicillamine is less frequently used as it carries a risk of interstitial nephritis. For severe symptoms including encephalopathy, dimercaprol is the agent of choice at a dosage of 75mg/m2 every 4 hours for five days.

**Iron**: For severe iron overdose IV deferoxamine is the treatment of choice. Deferoxamine acts as a chelating agent that binds with ferric iron forming ferrioxamine which is water-soluble and excreted by the kidneys.

**Cyanide**: Treatment of cyanide toxicity depends on the rapid administration of one of the three currently available antidotes. The first is hydroxycobalamin which binds cyanide to form cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12) which is then renally excreted. Hydroxocobalamin is currently the preferred antidote for severe cyanide toxicity from smoke inhalation.
