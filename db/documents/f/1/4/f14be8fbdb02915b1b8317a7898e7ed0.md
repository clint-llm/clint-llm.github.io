Patients with neurofibromas are often asymptomatic; however, irritation, mild pruritus, pain, or paresthesia, can occur. The presentation may vary by type of neurofibroma, but the most common chief complaint is cosmetic appearance.

Localized lesions commonly present as a painless skin-colored or violaceous papule, nodule, or subcutaneous mass. Solitary lesions are typically less than 2 cm and have a characteristic “buttonhole sign,” where on palpation, the lesion retracts into the subcutis and reappears on the release of pressure. Localized neurofibromas can occur anywhere on the body, with a predilection for the trunk, head/neck, and extremities.

Diffuse neurofibromas most commonly present on the head/neck as ill-defined, indurated plaques with thickened skin. Mild numbness or tingling may occur if the lesion is large.

Plexiform neurofibromas most commonly occur on the head/neck, trunk, and extremities. They surround multiple nerve fascicles and can grow to be large. If superficial, they commonly present as a skin-colored or hyperpigmented nodular swelling. Deeper lesions arising from spinal nerve roots may become highly irregular and tortuous. Deep lesions may present with pain, numbness, paresthesias, mass effect, and sequelae of spinal nerve compression.
