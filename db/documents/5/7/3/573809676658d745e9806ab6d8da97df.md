The majority of patients who present with a head injury will be managed by an interprofessionalÂ team. This will include the emergency clinicians who initially assess the patient, specialists such as neurosurgeons, and rehabilitation professionals. The role of the otolaryngologist in the acute setting is to establish the degree and type of any hearing loss, the state of the facial nerve, and to arrange appropriate follow-up. Only immediate and complete facial nerve palsy would require acute surgical intervention. It is vital that patients are not lost to follow-up as this can result in a delayed presentation of many years.

The management of ossicular chain dislocations should be undertaken by an otologist with extensive experience of middle ear surgery. There are many different approaches to the surgical reconstruction of the ossicular chain, and each case should be assessed individually to establish the most appropriate surgical strategy. Post-operative management should involve otologists and audiologists. Patients should be followed-up for a minimum period of one year post-procedure.
