Ethosuximide is FDA approved for the management of absence seizures in patients over three years of age.

Ethosuximide has level A evidence for childhood absence seizures and has been an effective medication in the management of absence seizures in humans since the 1960s and 1970s.

While ethosuximide is effective for absence seizures, itÂ otherwise has a very narrow therapeutic profile. It has no benefit in symptomatic epilepsies or other generalized epilepsies. If a patient has concurrent generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures, valproic acid is recommended over ethosuximide as initial monotherapy since ethosuximide does not control GTC seizures and can potentially exacerbate them.
