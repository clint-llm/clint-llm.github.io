Therapy for patients with valproate toxicity is mainly supportive and includes initial stabilization and resuscitation. Measures include maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation. Establish early IV access as intravenous fluid administration for the patients presenting with hypotension. Intravenous boluses of isotonic crystalloid are given in hypotensive patients. Vasopressors may be necessary in severe cases.

The patient may need admission to the medical intensive care unit for continuous monitoring and treatment.

Priority is to stabilize all life-threatening conditions. Patients with severe respiratory depression may require endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Benzodiazepines should be administered if there is a seizure due to valproate toxicity.

Gastrointestinal decontamination is performed with a single activated charcoal single dose if the patient presents within 2 hours of valproate overdose. The usual dose of activated charcoal is 1 g/kg up to 50 kg. If the patient is sedated and is unable to protect the airway, the administration of activated charcoal (AC) should be withheld.

As valproate is available in enteric-coated and extended-release preparations, which have slow absorption, activated charcoal can still be given more than 2 hours after ingestion.

The current literature review suggests that it is prudent to consider the use of L-carnitine for patients presenting with an acute overdose of valproate presenting with altered mental status. L-carnitine dosing is by a loading dose of 100 mg/kg by intravenous route. Treatment with L-carnitine continues with 50 mg/kg every 8 hours. Serum ammonia levels should be simultaneously measured, and when serum ammonia levels start decreasing, L-carnitine therapy can stop.

Interestingly, opioid antagonist naloxone in the dose range of 0.8 mg to 2 mg can reverse the central nervous system depression in some cases of valproate poisoning.

Hemodialysis with extracorporeal treatment is indicated for valproate concentration >1300 mg/L (>9000 micromol/L), presence of shock, or cerebral edema. Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion can reduce the elimination half-life of valproate as per the current literature. In one case study, hemodialysis decreased the half-life of valproate from 13 hours before treatment to 1.7 hours after treatment and showed significant clinical improvement within 4 hours of treatment. Intermittent hemodialysis is the preferred extracorporeal elimination technique, although continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is an acceptable alternative if the patient is hemodynamically unstable. Extracorporeal treatment can stop if the serum valproate concentration reduces to 50 to 100 mg/L (350 to 700 micromol/L), and the patient exhibits evidence of clinical improvement as manifested by normal hemodynamic status, improved mental status, and normalizing acid-base and electrolyte balance.
