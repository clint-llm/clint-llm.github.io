While both nicotinic and muscarinic receptors become activated in response to the ligand-binding of acetylcholine, their mechanism of activation differs significantly. As mentioned, nicotinic receptors are ionotropic; this means activation of the receptor leads to the formation of an ion channel within the cell membrane, known as a ligand-gated ion channel.

The generation of calcium and protein kinase C is responsible for further activation of downstream events, which produce the overall effect of receptor activation. Alternatively, the M2 receptor is an inhibitory g-protein (Gi) GPCR, which upon ligand binding, leads to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, resulting in a decrease in the second messenger molecule cAMP.
