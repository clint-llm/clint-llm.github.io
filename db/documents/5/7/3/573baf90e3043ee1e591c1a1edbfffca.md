The management of forearm fractures begins with appropriate evaluation, which requires a good and focused plain radiograph of the affected part. As such, the radiology technicians should be well-trained in getting the appropriate view done so that the fractures are not missed. Also, the consultation with a hand surgeon should be promptly sought to evaluate associated soft tissue injuries, especially in cases with open fractures. The role of physical therapy and rehabilitation cannot be undermined in getting the best functional outcomes after such fractures; hence physiotherapists should be informed about the rehab protocol after each case.
