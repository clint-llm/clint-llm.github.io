The exact etiology is unknown, and various hypotheses have been proposed:

- Melanocytes do not migrate from neural crest cells to the basal layer of the epidermis

- History of previous radiotherapy/radiation exposure/hormonal factors

- The genes BRAF and NRAS of the MAP kinase pathway have been implicated. G-coupled protein, GNAQ is found to be mutated causing the G-coupled protein to be constitutively turned on

- During embryogenesis, the melanoblasts migrate to skin and uvea causing the typical bluish-gray pigmentation in these sites

- Monosomy of chromosome 3 and gain of the long arm of chromosome 8q is a significant risk factor for uveal melanoma and poor outcome.
