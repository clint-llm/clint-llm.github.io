Less frequent than lumbar radiculopathies, cervical radiculopathies occur at an incidence rate of approximately 85 persons per 100,000. Most frequently impacted is the C7 nerve root with greater than half of all cases affecting this level. Approximately a quarter of cases affect the C6 nerve root. Other levels are impacted at a much lower rate. Risk factors for developing the radicular disease include manual labor involving heavy lifting, driving, or operation of vibrating equipment. History of chronic smoking increases the risk of developing radiculopathies.
