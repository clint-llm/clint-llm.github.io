In mild cases, treatment may not be necessary. Supportive care, including antipyretics and anti-inflammatory medications in addition to warm compresses to the inoculation site, may be all that is needed. In mild to moderate presentation in immunocompetent patients, a course of azithromycin may be indicated. Azithromycin for 5 days has been shown to relieve the pain of severe lymphadenopathy but shown no reduction in the overall duration of symptoms. Azithromycin dose is 10 mg/kg day 1 and 5 mg/kg days 2 to 5. Individuals weighing greater than or equal to 45 kg can receive the adult (maximum) dose of 500 mg day one and 250 mg day 2 through 5. Immunocompromised patients should be treated to help prevent the progression to severe systemic disease. Antibiotic regimens including rifampin, trimethoprim-sulfisoxazole, and ciprofloxacin are available for severe, disseminated disease.
