**Stages of Disease**

- Proliferative phase: increased fibroblast activity

- Active/involution phase: maturation of fibroblasts, differentiation of myofibroblasts, increased collagen production

- Residual phase: reduced collagen and fibroblast maturation

**Sammarco and Mangone Classification**

- Grade 1: focal lesion, a small area affected, does not involve skin or muscle

- Grade 2: multiple areas, can extend distal/proximal, does not involve skin or muscle

- Grade 3: multiple areas, can extend proximal/distal, involves the skin and/or muscle

- Grade 4: multiple areas, can extend proximal/distal, involves skin and muscle
