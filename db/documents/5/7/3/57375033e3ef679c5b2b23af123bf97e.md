The cardiac action potential is the cycle of ion movement, which leads to successive depolarization and repolarization of the cardiac myocyte leading to muscle contraction.

- **Phase 0:** "the depolarization" phase of the action potential; occurs by the rapid movement of sodium ions (Na+) into the cell along an electrochemical gradient, which leads to a membrane potential of approximately positive 30 mV.

- **Phase 1:**"The notch,"; the initial or early repolarization phase of the action potential, involves the efflux of potassium (K+) ions.

- **Phase 2:**"The plateau" phase - this phase is a balance of inward calcium ion movement that offsets the outward K+ movement.

- **Phase 3:**"The repolarization" phase of the action potential; this phase is primarily caused by the movement of K+ ions along their electrochemical gradient out of the cell, essentially taking the positive charge of the K+ ion out of the cell. It restores the negative potential of the cardiac myocyte.

- **Phase 4:**Restoration of the Na/K-ATPase, which restores the resting membrane potential of the cardiac myocyte.

**Class 0 Antiarrhythmic**

These are hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel blockers. These agents block funny (I) current. Inhibition of I reducing sinoatrial node (SAN) phase 4 pacemaker depolarization rate, thereby reducing heart rate; potential decreased AV Nodal conduction and Purkinje cell automaticity increasing RR intervals. An example is ivabradine.

**Class I Antiarrhythmics**

**Class Ia, Ib, and Ic:**Class I antiarrhythmics are fast sodium channel blockers. They are responsible for phase 0 of fast-response cardiac action potentials. The three subclasses differ in their efficacy for reducing the slope of phase 0, with Ic drugs having the greatest and Ib drugs having the smallest effect on phase 0. Sodium-channel blockade: Ic > Ia > Ib. Class Ia prolongs the action potential (AP) duration, leading to an increase in QTc interval. Class Ib decreases the duration of AP, causing a shortening of the QTc interval, and class Ic drugs do not affect AP duration; thus, no effect on the QTc interval.

**Class Id:**Ranolazine has a distinct mechanism of action; it causes a reduction in late Na+ current (INaL) and affects AP recovery and refractoriness. As a result, there is a decreased action potential recovery time and reduced early afterdepolarization (EAD)-induced triggered activity.

**Class II Antiarrhythmic**

**Class IIa:**Beta-blockers - These agents inhibit beta-adrenergic activation of adenylate cyclase and reduce intracellular cAMP levels, resulting in decreased sinoatrial node (SAN) pacing and triggered activity.

**Class IIb:**Nonselective beta-agonist- This agent works by activating the adrenergic system(l)-induced Gs-protein effects of increasing adenylyl kinase activity decreases RR and PR intervals. Consequently, there is a suppression of bradycardia-dependent EAD-related triggered activity. Isoproterenol exerts both chronotropic and inotropic effects, improving sinus and AV nodal function without a vasopressor effect. It is indicated for acute treatment of symptomatic sinus bradycardia or atrioventricular block.

**Class IIc:**Muscarinic M2 receptor inhibitors (atropine)- Inhibits supraventricular (SAN, atrial, AVN) muscarinic M2 cholinergic receptors, decreasing RR and PR intervals, thus increasing SA node automaticity and AV nodal conduction.

**Class IId:**Muscarinic M2 receptor activators (pilocarpine, carbachol, methacholine, digoxin)- These drugs activate supraventricular (SA node, atrial, AV node) muscarinic M2 cholinergic receptors, hyperpolarizing the SA node, and shortening action potential duration in atrial and AV nodal tissue. It also displays inhibitory effects on adenylyl cyclase and cAMP activation, resulting in increased RR and PR intervals, reduced SA node automaticity, and decreased AVN conduction. In addition, digoxin is also a Na/K-ATPase inhibitor. Binding with the sodium pump increases intracellular Na+ concentration, which will drive Ca2+ influx. That will lead to increase contractility of the heart and prolongation of phase 4 and phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, thus slowing down conduction through the AVN.

IIe Adenosine A1 receptor activator (adenosine)- Activating adenosine A1 receptors in supraventricular tissue activates G protein-coupled inward rectifying K+ channels hyperpolarizing the SA node; inhibitory effects on adenylyl cyclase and cAMP activation; increased RR and increased PR intervals. Consequently, decreasing SA node automaticity and AV nodal conduction. In addition, decreases early after depolarization (EAD) induced and delayed after depolarization (DAD) induced triggered activity. Terminates SVT via hyperpolarization by increasing K+ efflux and inhibiting Ca2+ current.

**Class III antiarrhythmics (K+ channel blockers and openers)**

Class III antiarrhythmics block potassium channels resulting in prolonged atrial, Purkinje, ventricular myocyte action potential recovery, increased ERP, reduced repolarization reserve, and prolonged QT intervals. Amiodarone also exerts sympatholytic, sodium, and calcium antagonistic properties that decrease conduction through the AV and sinus node. Sotalol shares class II and class III antiarrhythmic properties.

**IIIa:**Nonselective potassium channel blockers (amiodarone, dronedarone): Block multiple potassium channel targets resulting in prolonged atrial, Purkinje, and ventricular myocyte AP recovery, increased ERP, and reduced repolarization reserve; prolonged QT intervals. An increase in AP recovery time and the refractory period, with a decreased reentrant tendency. Note: amiodarone also delays sinus node rate and atrioventricular conduction.

Rapid potassium current (I) blockers: (dofetilide, ibutilide, sotalol)- Prolonged atrial, Purkinje, and ventricular myocyte AP recovery, increased ERP, and reduced repolarization reserve; prolonged QT intervals, increase in AP recovery time and refractory period with a decreased reentrant tendency.

Ultrarapid K current (I) blockers: Venrnakalent increases the refractory period and reentrant tendency. Useful for immediate conversion of atrial fibrillation without structural heart disease.

**IIIb:**Metabolically dependent K+ channel openers(nicorandil)- Opening ATP-sensitive K+ channels, shortening AP recovery, refractoriness, and repolarization reserve in all cardiomyocytes apart from SAN cells; shortened QT intervals. Nicorandil use during PCI could reduce the rate of ventricular arrhythmia in STEMI patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.

**Class IV Antiarrhythmics**

Class IV antiarrhythmic inhibits slow Ca2+ channels and reduces the slope of phases 0 and 4, resulting in inhibited SAN pacing, AVN conduction, prolonged ERP, and PR interval.

**IVa:**Surface membrane Ca2+ channel blockers (bepridil, falipamil, fendiline)- Blockage of Ca2+ current, resulting in inhibition of SA node pacing, increased PR intervals, reduction in AV node conduction. It is useful in atrial fibrillation.

L-type Ca2+ current blockers:(verapamil, diltiazem)- Blockage of Ca++ current, resulting in inhibition of SAN pacing, AVN conduction, and suppression of intracellular Ca signaling; increased PR intervals. Useful for rate control in atrial fibrillation.

**IVb:**Intracellular Ca2+ channel blockers (propafenone, flecainide)-Reduced Ca++ release medicated from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Useful for acute pharmacologic conversion of atrial flutter and fibrillation.

**IVd:**Surface membrane ion exchanger inhibitor (bepridil)- no FDA-approved clinical use in arrhythmias.

**Class V Antiarrhythmics (mechanosensitive channel blockers****)**

The drug under investigation is N-(p-amylcinnamoyl)anthranilic acid, which acts on the transient receptor potential channel (TRPC3/TRPC6).

**Class VI Antiarrhythmic (gap junction channel blockers)**

Drugs under investigation are carbenoxolone and rotigaptid. Action potential conduction depends on local intercellular circuit current spread affecting gap-junction conductances possessing apposed connexin (Cx) hemichannels electrically coupling the intracellular spaces of adjacent cardiomyocytes. Cx43 is present in both atrial and ventricular myocytes and the distal conduction system. Cx45 is present predominantly in the SA node, AV node, and Purkinje conducting system. Modulating gap junction conductance or expression, depending on circumstances, can enhance or reduce arrhythmogenesis. For example, carbenoxolone is a connexin blocking agent, which decreases ventricular/atrial conduction and AVN conduction. Connexin opening agent is the peptide analog rotigaptid. This class currently has no clinically approved indication in the treatment of arrhythmia.

**Class VII antiarrhythmic (upstream target modulators)**

ACE inhibitors, Angiotensin receptor blockers(ARBs), Statins, Omega 3 fatty acids. These agents focus on tissue structure remodeling processes and, consequently, longer-term changes that contrast with the primary focus on the short-term effects of drugs on ion channels.
