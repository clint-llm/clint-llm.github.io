Education is crucial for the prevention of allergic reactions. Patients require information regarding foods likely to cause cross-reactions with latex sensitivity and any products that contain latex. It is also important to notify any members of the healthcare team involved with caring for the patient that there is an allergy. Patients must receive alternatives to latex products, and proper compliance will result in decreased risk of reactions.
