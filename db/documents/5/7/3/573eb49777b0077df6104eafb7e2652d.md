Granulomatous inflammation is seen on histopathology. Degenerated lens remnants are surrounded by polymorphonuclear leucocytes, epithelioid cells, macrophages, and multinucleated giant cells. Later, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells are seen. Phagocytes are found around the lens capsule in cases of phacolytic glaucoma, with the trabecular meshwork getting clogged by macrophages. Iris is involved more than the choroid.

Vasculitis may also be seen in the retina.
