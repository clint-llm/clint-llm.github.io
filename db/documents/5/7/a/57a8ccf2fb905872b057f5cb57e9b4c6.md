On presentation, patients will typically complain of severe pain in the anal area, which has generally been present for several days. This is due to an infection of the anal glands, which are not adequately draining through the anal crypts. The anal glands empty into ducts that traverse the internal sphincter and drain into the anal crypts at the level of the dentate line. If not adequately draining, infection of these glands will form an abscess that can spread along several planes, such as the perianal or perirectal spaces. The perianal space surrounds the anus and is continuous with the fat of the buttock. Once a fluid collection forms, it can spread along the path of least resistance, which is typically into the intersphincteric space and other potential spaces such as the supralevator space or ischiorectal space.

Aerobic and anaerobic organisms are responsible for these abscesses, including Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Clostridium species, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus, and Escherichia coli.
