Using these recommendations, the interprofessional health care team can modify their approach to diagnose and treat patients with dysuria. It will also benefit in terms of increasing efficiency and reducing unnecessary testing. It will improve patient outcomes by educating them about the importance of early detection, adequate follow-up, and timely treatment.

Given the broad spectrum of possible etiologies for dysuria, all healthcare team members must collaborate and function as a unit. The clinician who first encounters the complaint must order appropriate testing, which will often form the basis for referrals. Diagnosis and management can include specialists from several different disciplines. Nursing can serve as a primary contact point for patient questions and offer counsel, while pharmacists can help with medication recommendations, check for interactions, and counsel the patient on proper dosing and administration. Prompt interprofessional care will help discover the underlying cause, allowing earlier, proper treatment, leading to better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
