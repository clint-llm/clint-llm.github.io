Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease affecting several organ systems. The disease is characterized by the growth of cysts and/or tumors. Tumors can either be benign or malignant. The characteristic tumor type in VHL is the hemangioblastoma, which is a benign tumor comprised of newly formed blood vessels. Hemangioblastomas in the central nervous system and retina can cause complications, including ataxia and vision loss. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors are also seen in patients with VHL. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and underscores the interprofessional team's role in improving care for the patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the typical presentation of a patient with Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.
- Outline the typical imaging findings associated with Von-Hippel Lindau lesions.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the management and delivery of care for patients with Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.
