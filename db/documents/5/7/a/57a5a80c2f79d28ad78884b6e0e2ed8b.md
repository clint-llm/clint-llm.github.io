Once PDPH has developed, healthcare workers including nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and primary care physicians should educate the patients. The majority resolve within 2 weeks. Other supportive measures include limiting upright position, hydration, oral analgesics, and intravenous or oral caffeine. Caffeine is a cerebral vasoconstrictor. It is administered as 500 mg sodium caffeine benzoate in 1000 mL of normal saline or lactated Ringer over 1 to 2 hours. This, however, generally produces short-term relief. A patient who chooses conservative therapy should keep well hydrated and consume caffeine-containing beverages and oral analgesics as necessary at home.

The majority of patients who elect to have EBP are those that cannot minimize activity, for example, recent parturients with newborns or younger patients. Also, those patients that are extremely symptomatic (some cephalgia even when supine and cannot tolerate any degree of upright positioning, tearful or crying at rest, photophobia) will likely consent to EBP with or without conservative treatment. It is important to tell the patient that EBP is not 100% effective.

An interprofessional team approach to caring for these patients will produce the best results. [Level 5]
