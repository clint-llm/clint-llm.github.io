Scapholunate dissociation is the most common cause of degenerative arthritis of the wrist. Without early recognition and treatment, there may be a proximal migration of the capitate between the scaphoid and lunate. This results in a degenerative disease known as SLAC wrist (scapholunate advanced collapse).

Wrist osteoarthritis is a common long-term complication after perilunate and lunate injuries. Other complications include chronic carpal instability, rupture of tendons, delayed union, nonunion, malunion, median nerve compression, complex regional pain syndrome, and avascular necrosis of the lunate.
