As with any operation, the labyrinthectomy procedure requires a team approach for optimal outcomes. The surgeon must communicate with the anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist, the circulating nurse, and the surgical technician to coordinate a smooth and expeditious procedure. The surgical time-out confirms the correct patient and laterality and ensures that all team members are in agreement regarding the surgical plan.
