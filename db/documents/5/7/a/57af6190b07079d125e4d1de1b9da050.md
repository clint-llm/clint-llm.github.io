DAI is a clinical diagnosis. Typically, DAI is considered in patients with a GCS of less than 8 for over six hours. The clinical presentation of patients with diffuse axonal injury relates to the severity of a diffuse axonal injury. For example, patients with mild diffuse axonal injury present with signs and symptoms that reflect a concussive disorder. These symptoms most commonly include a headache. The other post-concussive symptoms can include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. However, patients with a severe diffuse axonal injury may also present with a loss of consciousness and remain in a persistent vegetative state. A very small number of those patients with severe diffuse axonal injury will regain consciousness in the first year after the injury.

Other common neurological manifestations include dysautonomia. Dysautonomic symptoms commonly include tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, vasoplegia, hyperthermia, abnormal muscle tone, and posturing.
