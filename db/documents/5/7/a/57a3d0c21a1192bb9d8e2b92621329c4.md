The popliteal vein is located posterior to the knee in the popliteal region that is a major route for venous return from the lower leg. The vein forms from the combination of the anterior and posterior tibial vein at the border of the popliteal artery. The vein is found in the popliteal fossa on the posterior aspect of the knee. The vein crosses from the medial to the lateral side of the popliteal artery in the fossa. It is considered a deep vein of the leg. However, it has both deep and superficial tributaries contributing to its blood flow. The popliteal vein is renamed to the femoral vein after it passes through the adductor hiatus in the thigh.
