The proximity of the transvaginal ultrasound probe to the regions of interest allows for better image quality than its transabdominal counterpart.

The transabdominal counterpart operates at a lower frequency (around 3.5 MHz), allowing for deeper signal penetration (as is required) at the expense of poorer resolution. The transabdominal ultrasound also allows more flexibility to image a larger field of view, such as in the setting of the high-positioned adnexa because the probe may be moved anywhere across the abdomen.

Each modality has its strength and shortcomings. Hence, the combination of the two methods provides more accurate evaluation and earlier detection of pathology.
