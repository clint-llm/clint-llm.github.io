During normal gait, the small gluteal muscles on the standing leg help stabilize the pelvis in the coronal plane. If there is paralysis or weakness of the muscles as a result of injury to the superior gluteal nerve, it can result in a weakened abduction of the affected hip joint. This type of gait deficit is known as the Trendelenburg gait. When the patient is standing on one leg, the opposite pelvis should be lifted upwards by abduction of the ipsilateral hip joint. When the abductors are weak due to superior gluteal nerve paresis, the pelvis will sag which is the basis of the positive Trendelenburg sign. In a patient with a positive Trendelenburg sign, the pelvis sags toward the normal unsupported side, which is the swing leg. When the opposite occurs, and the pelvis raises on the swing side, the deficit is known as the Duchenne limp — bilateral damage to the superior gluteal nerve results in a “waddling” or gluteal gait. Also, the patient may raise the foot of the unsupported side during ambulation as the leg swings forward, leading to a steppage gait. A swing-out gait occurs when the foot on the unsupported side swings out in the lateral direction.
