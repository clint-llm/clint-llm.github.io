When evaluatingÂ Richter type hernias, the clinician must keep a broad differential diagnosis in mind. As previously discussed, these patients often present with abdominal pain. They rarely have symptoms of complete obstruction and may have vague symptoms. Differential diagnosis should include abdominal wall masses such as lipomas and abscesses. Consideration should be given to ileus and bowel obstruction along with their potential underlying causes (i.e., adhesions, hernias, intraluminal masses). It is often unknown until surgical intervention whether patients have a Richter type hernia. Thus differential diagnosis should include a strangulated hernia involving the complete bowel lumen, especially if presenting with sepsis and acute obstruction.
