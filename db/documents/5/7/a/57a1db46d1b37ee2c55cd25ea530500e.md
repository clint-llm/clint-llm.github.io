The optic of the IOL may be covered with a thick membrane composed of inflammatory cells, fibrosis, and red blood corpuscles (RBCs). The optic may get discolored and have brownish color due to the deposition of hemoglobin from RBCs. The inflammatory deposits are usually more severe at the margin of the optic, and the inflammatory debris may cover the whole IOL optic.

The debris may get deposited on the haptic or footplate as well. The inflammatory debris and RBCs may cover the whole IOL optic totally or partially, forming a ‘cocoon membrane.’
