Inverse ratio ventilation (IRV) is an alternative strategy for mechanical ventilation that reverses the classical inspiratory/expiratory paradigm. This is achieved by modifying the inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio, typically to increase oxygenation by increasing the mean airway pressure (MAP). This activity describes the indications for and contraindications to inverse ratio ventilation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of ventilated patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for inverse ratio ventilation. 
- Describe the physiology of inverse ratio ventilation. 
- Explain how inverse ratio ventilation can be useful for acute respiratory distress syndrome patients.
- Explain strategies for improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome by utilizing inverse ratio ventilation.
