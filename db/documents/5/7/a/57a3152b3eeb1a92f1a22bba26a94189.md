Due to its essential role in digestion, the parietal cell is under rigorous modulation by numerous pathways. Gastric acid is necessary for the activation of pepsinogen, as well as for acidification of the gastric lumen that creates a barrier to the transit of possibly pathogenic bacteria.

Somatostatin, which is secreted by antral D cells, is the primary physiological suppressor of gastric acid secretion.

Intrinsic factor (IF) is a glycoprotein produced and secreted by parietal cells. It plays a pivotal role in the transportation and absorption of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum.
