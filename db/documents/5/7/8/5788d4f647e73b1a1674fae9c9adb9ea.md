The fetus depends on maternal metabolism and placental circulation to provide the glucose, ketones, free fatty acids, and amino acids necessary to meet its energy requirements.

Any mechanism that disrupts this sequence of physiologic changes puts the infant at risk of more severe or prolonged periods of low glucose. The risk for hypoglycemia is greatest in the first hours after birth.

Persistent hypoglycemia results from excessive insulin secretion, a deficiency of cortisol or growth hormone, or inborn errors of metabolism.
