During the acute phase of infection, three major cell modifications occur:

The creation of a 'nurse cell' from the transformation of a host cell and disappearance of sarcomere myofibrils

- The larvae become encapsulated (if it is an encapsulated species)

- The infected cell forms a capillary network around it

- Additionally, the sarcoplasm becomes basophilic; there is a central displacement of the cell nucleus, and the number and size of the nucleoli increase

Trichinella larvae and their metabolites cause an immunological reaction from infiltrating inflammatory cells (eosinophils, mast cells, lymphocytes, monocytes). Eosinophils release the enzymes histaminase and arylsulfatase. Increased permeability of capillaries occurs from the release of histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, and prostaglandins PGE2, PGD2, PGJ2; this leads to tissue edema, especially around the eyes. The inflammatory processes also lead to vasculitis and microvascular thrombi. Increased production of IgE leads to allergic manifestations such as a cutaneous rash and edema.
