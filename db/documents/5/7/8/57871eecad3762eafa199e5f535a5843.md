- Pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) patients should avoid pregnancy as there is very high maternal mortality.

- The most common cause of death in PAH is right ventricular failure.

- Poor prognostic factors include age older than 50 years, evidence of right heart failure, and NYHA functional class III or IV.

- Calcium channel blockers should not be used in people with negative vasoreactivity testing.

- Immunizations for influenza and pneumococcus

- Monitor the response to therapy every 3 to 6 months with a 6-minute walk test, echocardiogram, BNP, and functional class.
