In terms of chronic alcohol use, Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff syndrome become expected complications. With Wernicke encephalopathy comes the triad of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia (though usually, only one is present 20% of the time).

Hepatic steatosis is a common complication of chronic alcohol use that results from cholesterol esters, phospholipids, and triglycerides formed ultimately from alcohol-induced ROS formation altering lipid metabolism.

Chronic heavy alcohol consumption is the most important risk factor when considering chronic pancreatitis. The process begins with acute heavy consumption, which through toxic effects of alcohol metabolism, induces inflammatory and fibrotic changes in the pancreas over time. Specifically, the pancreatic stellate cells become activated, resulting in the expected fibrotic changes.

Cardiomyopathy is another documented complication that is expected as a result of chronic alcohol use resulting from oxidative stress, disruptions in proper calcium handling, and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Cocaine addiction and intoxication lead to myocardial ischemia, psychosis, and fatal arrhythmias that require acute management for mitigation of effects.

From a behavioral perspective, addiction leads to multiple episodes of withdrawal and relapses (the average being 7).
