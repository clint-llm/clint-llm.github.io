GHB toxicity is a clinical diagnosis. Blood or urine testing for GHB is not routinely available in the hospital setting. Diagnostic confirmation via gas chromatography and mass spectrometry is possible but may take up to seven to 14 days for results. A urine drug screen may aid in identifying or excluding coingestants. As with any potential intoxicated patient, a fingerstick glucose, blood alcohol level, acetaminophen level, and salicylate level should be obtained. A CT scan of the head or other radiological tests may be indicated if any injury or trauma is suspected.
