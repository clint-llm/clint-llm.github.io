- The Barton fracture is a fracture of the distal radius which extends through the dorsal aspect of the articular surface with associated dislocation of the radiocarpal joint. However, since there is no disruption of the radiocarpal ligaments, the articular surface of the fractured distal radius remains in contact with the proximal carpal row.

- Radiography is the primary imaging modality in diagnosis, although CT and MRI have a role as well.

- In the younger population, males suffer the injury more often than females, typically following high-energy trauma.

- In the elderly, more women are diagnosed with Barton fractures after a fall from standing or other low-energy trauma.

- Most Barton fractures are treated surgically, though recent studies have shown little significant difference in operative versus nonoperative management in the elderly.
