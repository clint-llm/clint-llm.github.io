Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic, autoimmune, blistering disease that causes an extremely pruritic rash that predominantly affects the extensor surfaces. The characteristic vesicles are often not apparent as they are destroyed by excoriation. The disease is closely associated with gluten-sensitive enteropathy (GSE); both conditions are characterized by the development of IgA autoantibodies against transglutaminases that, in the case of dermatitis herpetiformis, are deposited in the superficial papillary dermis. Therapy involves strict gluten avoidance and the use of sulphonamide drugs such as dapsone.
