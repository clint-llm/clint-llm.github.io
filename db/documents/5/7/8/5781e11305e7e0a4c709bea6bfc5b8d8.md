In the operating stage, surgical instrument sets depend on the type and technique of the intestinal stoma. Medical devices such as surgical staplers and staples may be used in place of sutures by many surgeons. There are various sizes and heights of staples in surgical staplers so that the most appropriate can be chosen by the surgeon. The choice of a stapler and staple height depends on the properties of the different types of tissues in the body. Tissue thickness is an important consideration in colorectal surgery. The normal thickness of the colon wall may be up to 3mm thick, whereas the normal thickness of the small bowel wall measures between 1 and 2mm. Laparoscopic tower and laparoscopic instruments such as trocars, bowel grasper, and a laparoscope are required if stoma formation is performed laparoscopically.

In the maintenance stage, well-fitting bags are required as well as paste and rings, spray, adhesive remover wipes, dry wipes, powder, skin protector wipes, and belts.
