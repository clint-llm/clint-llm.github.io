**Capillary Blood Glucose (CBG) Testing**

Steps in undertaking a capillary blood glucose test with a glucometer are outlined below.

Collect all necessary equipment.

Wash and dry the site to be tested.

Prepare the skin or site, if required. The recommended testing site on the palm is the side of the distal fingertips to minimize injury to the underlying bone. Use of the fifth finger should be avoided, as the tissue may not be deep enough to prevent said injury. The thumb and first finger should also be avoided as these are sensitive areas compared to other fingers. Avoid the arm if a recent ipsilateral mastectomy, if any, was performed or an intravenous infusion is underway.

Prepare equipment.

Prime the lancet to no more than 2.0 mm to minimize the risk of bone injury.

Remove the glucose testing strip from its container without touching the sensor tip. Next, insert the glucose testing strip into the glucometer; this often leads to the glucometer turning itself on.

Firmly apply the lancet to the sample collection site and release the trigger on the lancet to pierce the skin.

Recommendations are to wipe away the first drop of blood with clean gauze or tissue as this drop of blood may contain intracellular or interstitial fluid or be hemolyzed, both of which could affect the blood sample. Applying gentle downward pressure close to the puncture site may facilitate blood flow and collection of the second drop of blood.

Collect the second drop of blood as it forms by touching the tip of the glucose testing strip.

Place the glucometer down and cover the skin puncture site with clean gauze or tissue. Pressure may be applied to stop further bleeding from the puncture site.

The machine normally provides a result at this stage unless there have been errors during collection; for example, insufficient sample, low battery, wrong code, or the machine times itself out. If an error displays on the glucometer, troubleshoot as appropriate.

Wash hands and replace equipment in storage bag container. Note test results relative to diet, exercise, and medication use as appropriate.
