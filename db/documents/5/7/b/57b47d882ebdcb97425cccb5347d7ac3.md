Depending on age, health, co-ingestion of other cardiovascular medications, and the magnitude of toxic ingestion, the presentation may vary from asymptomatic to sudden cardiovascular collapse and death. Ingestion of toxic immediate-release CCB formulations is expected to have an onset of effect within 2 to 3 hours of ingestion, with all patients manifesting some symptoms within 6 hours.

Initial symptoms may be as nonspecific as dizziness, fatigue, and lightheadedness, and in severe toxicities, it may rapidly decline to alter mental status, coma, and fatal shock.
