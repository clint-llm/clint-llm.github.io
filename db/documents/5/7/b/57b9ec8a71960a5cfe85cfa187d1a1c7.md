Casirivimab is a recombinant neutralizing human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody to the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. It binds to the S1 subunit of the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), blocking the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 to the human ACE2 receptor. This prevents viral binding to the host cell, thereby preventing entry and replication of the virus, thus decreasing the viral load. Imdevimab binds to a non-overlapping portion of the spike protein RBD similar to casirivimab, and the combination is theorized to limit the development of viral mutations. The cocktail of the two drugs was also found to have retained activity against the Alpha (B.1.1.7; UK), Beta (B.1.351; South Africa), Gamma (P.1; Brazil), Delta (B.1.617.2; India), Epsilon (B.1.427/429; California), Iota (B.1.526; New York), and Kappa (B.1.617.1; India) variants of SARS-CoV-2. The combination drug has no activity to the Omicron variant.
