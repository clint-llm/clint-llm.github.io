The risk rate of the disease progressing to full, invasive squamous cell carcinoma is minimal and around 3% to 5%. A study of previous cases with mutually probable biases reported that of the 3% to 5% develop to invasive squamous cell carcinoma one-third could metastasize. For erythroplasia of Queyrat or genital Bowen disease, the risks are estimated to be higher. After surgical excision, if negative margins are not achieved, there is a risk of recurrence.
