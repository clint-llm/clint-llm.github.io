Not all patients with sickle cell are eligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) because of the significant associated toxicity. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant is only for patients with severe sickle cell disease who have complications including stroke, acute chest syndrome, recurrent pain crisis and exchange transfusions, nephropathy, retinopathy, osteonecrosis of multiple joints, and priapism.
