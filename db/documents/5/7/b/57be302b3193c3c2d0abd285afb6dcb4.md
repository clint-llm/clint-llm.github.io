Like other limb muscles, the gluteus minimus arises from myoblasts that surround the developing bone. The myoblasts are formed due to tissues nearby that release molecular signals that allow somites to differentiate into myoblasts.

The lower limb buds start to form around the end of the fourth week, slightly delayed when compared to the upper limb buds. Additionally, the lower limb will rotate medially as the upper limb rotates laterally.
