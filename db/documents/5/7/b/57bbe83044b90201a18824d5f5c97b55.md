Pulsus alternans is not to be confused with electrical alternans or pulsus paradoxus. Pulsus alternans is beat-to-beat variability of the arterial pressure waveform as identified on physical exam and echocardiogram. Electrical alternans is beat-to-beat variability of the QRS complex on electrocardiogram, often found in the setting of pericardial effusion.
