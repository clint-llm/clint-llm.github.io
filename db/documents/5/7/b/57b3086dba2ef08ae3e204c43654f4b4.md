The supratrochlear nerve block is a special procedure, which can be utilized to relieve pain in the mid-forehead region. It can provide anesthesia for complex laceration repairs and trigeminal neuralgia, among many others. Unlike local infiltration, this regional nerve block does not distort local anatomy and can achieve significant analgesia with a minimum amount of local anesthetic. There is some overlap with the supraorbital nerve block with regard to regional innervation and procedural location/technique. However, it is still a unique block and worthy of discussion for emergency and urgent care providers, plastic surgeons, neurologists, and others who treat patients suffering from painful conditions involving this area of the head/face.
