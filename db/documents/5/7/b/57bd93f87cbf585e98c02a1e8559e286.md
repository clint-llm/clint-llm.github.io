Prognosis is poor. Symptomatic congenital cytomegalovirus leads to long term sequelae including sensorineural hearing loss, mental and developmental disabilities, and impaired vision. Around 10% of symptomatic newborns will die in the neonatal period, a number that may be low. Asymptomatic babies are not spared long-term sequelae, with 10 to 12% developing hearing loss and a smaller percentage of developing neuromotor disabilities and vision problems.
