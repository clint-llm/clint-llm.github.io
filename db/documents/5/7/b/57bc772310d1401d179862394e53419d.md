According to the Center for Disease Control(CDC), 20 to 50% of all antibiotics prescriptions in the acute care hospital setting in the USA are either unnecessary or inappropriate.

The AMS programs have the following goals:

- To work with healthcare practitioners to prescribe **5 ”D”s**of antimicrobial therapy, which is the right**D**rug, correct**D**ose, right**D**rug-route, suitable**D**uration, timely**D**e-escalation to pathogen-directed therapy.

- To prevent antimicrobial overuse, misuse, and abuse in inpatient, outpatient, and community settings, including the agriculture industry.

- To reduce antibiotic-related adverse effects, for example, C.difficile

- To minimize resistance

- To reduce healthcare-associated cost

With the above goals in target, the AMS programs include the following core elements:

- Leadership commitment

- Accountability

- Drug expertise

- Action

- Tracking

- Reporting

- Education

**Leadership Commitment**

Leadership support is crucial for the success of antimicrobial stewardship programs. They can be in different forms, including:

- Formal statements to improve and monitor the antimicrobial use

- Supporting training and education and ensuring that staff from the relevant departments are given sufficient time to contribute to stewardship activities.

- Dedicate financial and information technology resources dedicated to the program.

**Accountability and Drug Expertise**

To identify a single leader as a stewardship program leader who will be responsible for the program outcome. Literature has shown that physician leaders have highly successful programs. Physicians with formal training in infectious disease and AMS benefit stewardship program. Similarly, appointing a single pharmacist leader as co-leader has shown improved outcomes.

**Action**

Action includes implementing policies supporting optimal antibiotic use, utilizing specific interventions to improve antibiotic use, and prioritizing intervention based on the needs of the care setting.

Examples for policies supporting optimal antimicrobial prescription include specifying dose, duration, and indication on documentation. The implementation of policies helps to ensure modification or prompt discontinuation of antimicrobials.

Interventions directed towards stewardship can be categorized into

- Broad intervention includes antibiotics time out, prior authorization, and prospective audit and feedback. Antibiotic "Time Out" by physician 48 hours after initiation of antibiotics helps reassess the need and choice of antibiotics when more diagnostic information is available and early de-escalation.

- Pharmacy-driven interventions, especially for dose adjustments/optimization based on drug, organ dysfunction, therapeutic drug monitoring. The pharmacy interventions also alert the prescriber in cases of the unnecessary overlapping spectrum of antimicrobial coverage, help in detecting and preventing drug interactions related to antibiotics.

- Infection and syndrome-specific interventions focus on improving prescriptions for specific syndromes. For example, many people who get antibiotics for urinary tract infections(UTI) might have asymptomatic bacteriuria and not infection. Interventions for UTI focus on avoiding unnecessary management of asymptomatic cases and ensuring that patients receive the right therapy based on local susceptibilities and for a suitable duration.Clostridoides difficile infection(CDI), and treatment of culture-proven invasive infections.

**Tracking and Reporting of Antimicrobial use and Outcomes**

Keeping track of the evaluation of both policies and outcomes is critical to identify areas of improvement and assess the impacts of improvement efforts. For example, determining if the prescriber has applied the diagnostic criteria accurately; prescribed the antimicrobial agent for a particular indication with documentation of duration and relevant tests before treatment.

CDC has developed an Antibiotic Use (AU) option as a part of the National Healthcare Safety Network(NHSN). AU automatically collects data and monthly reports for the duration of therapy data and is later analyzed in aggregate by specific agents and patient care locations. The AU module is available to facilities with the capability to submit electronic medication administration records.

Likewise, tracking outcomes that measure the impact of interventions help optimize antimicrobial use.

**Education**

Regular updates to prescribers on antibiotic prescribing, antibiotic resistance, and infectious disease management motivate optimization in antimicrobial prescription. However, didactic presentations, electronic messages to staff groups are few options to provide education. Education has been most effective when paired with corresponding interventions and outcome measurements.
