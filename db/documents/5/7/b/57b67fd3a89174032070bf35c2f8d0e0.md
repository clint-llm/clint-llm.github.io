Most long bones in the body contain at least two growth plates. Near both ends of the bone, a hyaline cartilage plate is located between the epiphysis and metaphysis. Once a child or adolescent completes their growth spurt, the plate will eventually ossify and form an epiphyseal line.

In the physis, four zones are described from the epiphysis toward the metaphysis: (1) resting cells, (2) proliferating cells, (3) hypertrophic/maturing cells, and (4) provisional calcification.

Physeal fractures tend to occur through the zone of provisional calcification; however, they may cross several zones depending on the type of injury orÂ the external force applied (e.g., shear vs. compression vs. tension forces).

The zone of hypertrophic/maturing cells is commonly affected when fractures occur. In the event of a fracture, the blood supply, which enters the bone through the epiphysis, may become compromised.
