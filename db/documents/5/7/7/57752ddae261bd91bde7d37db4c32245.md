Cenegermin is the only FDA-approved pharmacologic therapy to treat neurotrophic keratitis (NK). In addition, it is the first-ever topical biologic approved in the field of ophthalmology. Cenegermin ophthalmic solution 0.002% received initial FDA approval in 2018. It is a topical recombinant human nerve growth factor (rhNGF) with high specificity for the anterior segment of the eye to support corneal innervation and integrity.

Although the prevalence of neurotrophic keratitis is low, the impact of such a serious pathologic process and its associated sequelae can be devastating. Before approval, surgical intervention was the only available therapeutic option for neurotrophic keratitis. Cenegermin provides a novel non-surgical treatment that has the potential capacity to offer total corneal healing. Cenegermin may be used as the first-line treatment for patients with neurotrophic keratitis unresponsive to conventional non-surgical treatment for more than two weeks. Recent studies have shown cenegermin's efficacy in treating NK in pediatric populations with various underlying congenital diseases.

There are no non-FDA-approved indications of cenegermin to date. It is important to note that cenegermin received orphan drug designation by the FDA, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases.
