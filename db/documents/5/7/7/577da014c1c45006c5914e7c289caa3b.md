Albinism is a group of heritable conditions associated with decreased or absent melanin in ectoderm-derived tissues (most notably the skin, hair, and eyes), yielding a characteristic decrease in skin pigmentation. Patients with albinism are particularly susceptible to solar damage, and these patients must utilize lifelong sun protection precautions. These patients should be educated on avoidance of prolonged UV light exposure and avoidance of medications that increase photosensitivity. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of albinism and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiologic basis of albinism. 
- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with albinism. 
- List the treatment options available for albinism. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes in patients with albinism.
