Supportive resuscitation and prompt fetal delivery remain the cornerstone of therapy. American College of Gastroenterology clinical guideline recommends prompt delivery for AFLP.

Maternal supportive care and stabilization should be initiated first, with correction of electrolyte disturbance, and therapy for hypoglycemia, coagulopathy, and hypoglycemia. Frequent maternal and fetal evaluation is necessary; including continuous monitoring of fetal heart rate. Fluid replacement should take place if needed.

The delivery route depends on the presence of fetal or maternal decompensation and/ or the presence of other contraindications to vaginal birth. Vaginal delivery and labor induction can be done if no contraindications exist. However, cesarean delivery has to be performed in many cases due to maternal or fetal distress and deterioration. If a cesarean delivery is necessary, platelet transfusions may be necessary as current guidelines recommend transfusions to a level of 40000 to 50000.

After delivery, the patient will require monitoring for bleeding, hypoglycemia, or renal dysfunction. If hepatic dysfunction does not abate rapidly after pregnancy, liver transplantation should be a considered approach, as it may prove life-saving.
