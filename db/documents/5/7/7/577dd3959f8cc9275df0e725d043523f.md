Before administration of luspatercept, hemoglobin levels, liver function tests include alanine transferase, and aspartate transferase levels should have monitoring to ensure proper dosing and metabolism of the medication.

Luspatercept can be detected in the human serum through screening with ELISA and Western blotting. Initially, the serum needed to perform the testing was an increased sample of antibodies requiring 10 μg per sample. However, now ELISA can be used as a fast screening tool with 100 μL of serum; the limit of detection (LOD) is 15.6 ng/mL.

More recent guidelines overcame this obstacle by creating a solution in which the antigen-antibody complex can assist in procuring the complex by undergoing purification and separation of the complex using the anti-antibody-coated magnetic beads. Western blotting uses covalently stable antibodies on agarose beads, leading to immunoprecipitation of ACVR2B-antibody, followed by Sarcosyl-PAGE and western blotting. Western blotting can be used for initial investigation and confirmatory testing of luspatercept use in human serum.
