If not treated adequately, patients with acute Q fever can progress to chronic Q fever, months to years after the initial infection. Chronic Q fever may manifest in the form of bacterial culture-negative endocarditis (75%), osteomyelitis, vascular infection, aortic graft infection, chronic hepatitis in patients with alcoholism, and pseudotumors of the spleen and lungs.

Q fever in pregnancy is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. It can lead to premature delivery, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal growth restriction, or intrauterine fetal death. The effects on the fetus due to the transplacental passage of infection are unknown.
