The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) can assess patients' beliefs on pain and the impact of pain on their lives.

Standard blood work and imaging are not indicated for chronic pain, but the clinician can order it when specific causes of pain are suspected. Thus they can be ordered on a case-by-case basis.

Psychiatric disorders can amplify pain signaling making symptoms of pain worse.

Simultaneously screening for depression is recommended for patients with chronic pain. The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-II (MMPI-2) or Beck's Depression Scale are the most commonly used tools. The MMPI-2 has been used more frequently for patients with chronic pain.
