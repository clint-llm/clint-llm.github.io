The initial management for pathologic conditions affecting the biceps brachii tendon (both proximal and distal) is often nonoperative management modalities. Conditions affecting the distal biceps brachii tendon are beyond the scope of this review. Proximally, shoulder range of motion, rotator cuff strengthening, and periscapular stabilization parameters focus on restoring muscle balance across the shoulder girdle.

For conditions affecting the long head of the biceps tendon proximally, the following physical therapy regimens can be considered:

- Proximal biceps stretching/strengthening exercises

- NSAIDs

- Iontophoresis (e.g., dexamethasone)

Focused stretching on the anterior shoulder structures, including pectoralis minor, should also be considered. Other modalities, such as dry needling, have demonstrated promise in preliminary animal studies.

In refractory conditions or conditions beyond the scope of this review, surgical consideration is warranted.
