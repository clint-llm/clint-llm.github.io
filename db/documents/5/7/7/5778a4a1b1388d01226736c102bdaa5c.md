Once there is a diagnosis of Wyburn-Mason syndrome, the treatment is based on the location of the arteriovenous malformations and the corresponding symptoms. Unruptured arteriovenous malformations without symptoms should be observed. Other options include radiation therapy, embolization, surgical resection, or a combination of these approaches. Intracranial AVM s should be approached as if it is having a risk of rupture of 2.2% per year.

Most retinal arteriovenous malformations do not bleed externally but can produce minute hemorrhages that affect vision. Because of the stability of retinal lesions, ophthalmologists often serve to mainly diagnose Wyburn-Mason, obtain neuroimaging, organize systemic referrals, and perform periodic ophthalmologic assessments. However, complications arising from retinal AVMs need treatment. Patients who develop neovascular glaucoma require retinal photocoagulation to treat retinal ischemia. Pars plana vitrectomy may be done for non-clearing vitreous hemorrhage, and cyclodestructive procedures may be required to treat painful blind eyes with raised intraocular pressure resulting form neovascular glaucoma.
