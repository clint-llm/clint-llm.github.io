Patients must realize that hearing loss, mainly if it is conductive, is treatable and should seek medical help if they noticed it. Hearing aids can be highly effective in cases when hearing loss is not treatable. Parents and teachers must be aware that misbehavior or inattention at school can be a sign of hearing loss, and prompt diagnosis can prevent speech and language delays. Patients should be instructed not to introduce sharp objects to clean the ear. The use of cotton swabs should be restricted to the most outer part of the external ear canal. Cotton swabs can push the wax deeper into the ear canal. In most cases, cleaning the ear canal should not be done with a cotton swab as the wax usually fall out on its own.
