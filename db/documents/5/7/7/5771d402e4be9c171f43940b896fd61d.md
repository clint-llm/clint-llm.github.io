**Genetics and Inheritance**

Migraine has a strong genetic component. The risk of migraines in ill relatives is three times greater than that of relatives of non-ill subjects, but no inheritance pattern was identified.

**Familial Hemiplegic Migraine**

- Hemiplegic migraine can occur in families or sporadically (one individual, as the first member of the family to have a hemiplegic migraine).

- Type 1 is caused by mutations in the CACNA1A gene (calcium voltage-gated channel alpha 1A subunit) on chromosome 19p13.

- Type 2 is caused by mutations in the ATP1A2 gene (ATPase, Na+/K+ transporting alpha two subunit) on chromosome 1q23.

- Type 3 is caused by mutations in the SCN1A gene (sodium voltage-gated channel Type 1 alpha subunit).

- Mutations in the PRRT2 (Proline-Rich transmembrane 2) gene are recognized as a possible cause.

- Mutations in the SLC4A4 (solute carrier family four member 4) gene have also been associated with familial forms of migraine.

**MELAS**

It is a syndrome of mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes,Â a multisystemic disorder by maternal inheritance that can present recurrent migraine headaches.

**CADASIL**

Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) angiopathy by autosomal dominant inheritance, caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene (notch receptor 3) on chromosome 19 that can present migraine with aura (prodrome in 80%) in nearly 50% of carriers.

**RVCL**

Retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy is angiopathy by C-terminal frame-shift mutations in TREX1 (three prime repair exonuclease 1) presents almost 60% of the cases.

**HIHRATL**

Hereditary infantile hemiparesis, retinal arteriolar tortuosity, and leukoencephalopathy

**HERNS**

Hereditary endotheliopathy with retinopathy, nephropathy, and stroke

**Triggers**

Withdrawn or exposure to several factors contribute to the development of migraine headaches.

- Stress in 80% (probable factor)

- Hormonal changes in 65% during menstruation, ovulation, and pregnancy (probable factor)

- Skipped meals 57% (probable factor)

- Weather changes in 53% (probable factor)

- Excessive or insufficient sleep in 50% (possible factor)

- Odors in 40% (perfumes, colognes, petroleum distillates)

- Neck pain in 38%

- Exposure to lights in 38% (probable factor)

- Alcohol ingestion in 38% (wine as a probable factor)

- Smoking in 36% (unproven factor)

- Late sleeping in 32%

- Heat in 30%

- Food in 27% (aspartame as a possible factor, and tyramine and chocolate as unproven factors)

- Exercise in 22%

- Sexual activity in 5%
