There are no current guidelines in place for monitoring the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors; however, PSA concentrations can be useful in assessing the treatment of BPH.  Since the prostate produces excess PSA in patients with BPH, decreases in prostatic volume result in a decreased PSA concentration.  It is, therefore, possible to assess the efficacy of the 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors by measuring PSA concentrations.

Recently controversial studies have emerged suggesting an association between finasteride use and prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial studied the prevalence of prostate cancer in men over 55 receiving finasteride treatment. The study found a 25% reduction in the prevalence of prostate cancer but also an increased incidence of high-grade prostate cancer.  As a result of this study, the FDA placed a boxed warning on finasteride.
