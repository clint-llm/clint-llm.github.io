There are three categories of treatment for trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, including SUNCT and SUNA: acute, preventive, and bridge therapies.

**Short Term Prevention**

A trial of intravenous lidocaine reported some relief in patients with SUNCT and SUNA.

**Long Term Prevention**

In many studies, lamotrigine has shown good results as first-line therapy for these disorders, with up to 80% of patients reporting improvement. Effective daily doses range from 100 mg to 400 mg.

**Non-pharmacological Interventions**

1) Greater occipital nerve block has shown some benefits.

2) Peripheral nerve blocks, including infra and supraorbital nerve blocks, also have shown benefit in previous studies.

3) Peripheral nerve stimulation of the occipital nerve has shown good results.

The lack of response to indomethacin and the response to intravenous lidocaine, are useful in diagnostic and therapeutic terms.
