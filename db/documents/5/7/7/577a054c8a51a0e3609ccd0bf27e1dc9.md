Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a group of neoplasms that can affect individuals at the extremes of age and can originate from any location throughout the human body. These neoplasms can span a range of clinical presentations, from aggressive metastatic angiosarcomas to benign lipomas. These need to be evaluated using imaging studies and biopsy (core needle biopsy or incisional biopsy). The real challenge in diagnosing these conditions is that there are several non-neoplastic conditions that mimic STS. Soft tissue sarcomas are separated categorically as trunk and extremity from retroperitoneum. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of sarcomas and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of sarcoma.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with sarcoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for sarcoma.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to rule out cancer in all patients who present with painless masses, leading to earlier diagnosis and improving survival in those with sarcomas.
