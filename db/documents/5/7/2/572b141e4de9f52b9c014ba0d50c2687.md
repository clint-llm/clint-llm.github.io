Lymphangiomas are uncommon, benign malformations of the lymphatic system that can occur anywhere on the skin and mucous membranes. Lymphangiomas can be categorized as deep or superficial based on the depth and size of the abnormal lymphatic vessels or as congenital or acquired. The deep forms of lymphangioma include two specific well defined congenital entities: cavernous lymphangiomas and cystic hygromas. This activity describes the pathophysiology of lymphangioma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of lymphangioma.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with lymphangioma.
- Summarize the treatment options for lymphangioma.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by lymphangioma.
