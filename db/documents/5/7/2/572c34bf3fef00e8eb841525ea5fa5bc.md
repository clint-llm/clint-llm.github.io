Routine bacterial urine cultures are not always necessary in the evaluation of outpatients with uncomplicated UTIs and simple lower UTIs, such as uncomplicated cystitis.

Additionally, new-onset or worsening sepsis without evidence of an alternate source is also another appropriate indication for urine culture. New-onset or worsening sepsis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients globally and should be swiftly recognized clinically for the purposes of swift urine culture collection.

Urine culture is not indicated and is therefore deemed inappropriate when the urine characteristicsÂ are odorous, cloudy, or discolored in the absence of other localizing signs or symptoms, reflex urine cultures based on results of urinalysis such as pyuria in the absence of other indications, and to document successful response to therapy.
