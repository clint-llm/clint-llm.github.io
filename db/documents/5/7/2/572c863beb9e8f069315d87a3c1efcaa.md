Etiology of diffuse esophageal spasm is unknown. There are various theories proposed.

There is a disruption of coordination in peristalsis which is probably due to an imbalance between the inhibitory and excitatory postganglionic pathways. Muscular hypertrophy or hyperplasia is present in the distal part of the esophagus comprising almost two-thirds of the esophagus in DES.  Although the triggering event is unknown, the Increased release of acetylcholine might be a factor. Other theories include nitric oxide-mediated impairment of inhibitory ganglion neuronal function, gastric reflux or a primary nerve or motor disorder as likely mechanisms of the peristaltic abnormalities seen in DES.

Exposure to acid can also result in esophageal spasm whereas heartburn can lead to esophageal contractions.

There have also been suggestions that total cholesterol and body mass index (BMI) are factors which have a high predictive value for esophageal contractility, at the same time blood glucose and BMI are factors predictive for the function of the lower esophageal sphincter.
