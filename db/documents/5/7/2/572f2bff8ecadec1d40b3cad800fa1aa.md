Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States (US), representing a significant public health problem. Adenoma detection rate (ADR) evaluated by colonoscopy has been used to estimate colorectal cancer risk, which is defined as the percentage of patients aged above 50 years who undergo colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening for the first time and have at least one detected adenoma. ADR is reportedly approximately 12% by the fifth decade of life, which increases to 50% throughout a lifetime. ADR is also profoundly different among populations, reaching about 22% in a large screening population. ADR is a vital risk estimation scoreÂ and is inversely associated with the risk of cancer as each 1% increase in ADR corresponds to a 3% decrease in cancer risk.
