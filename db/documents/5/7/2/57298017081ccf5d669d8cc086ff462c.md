The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been often reported to be complicated with cardiac dysfunction. Preexisting cardiac diseases predispose to the severity of the disease and worsening of the cardiac condition. Early detection of cardiovascular disease by clinical and laboratory parameters and treatment is of paramount importance. Clinical trials are underway, and more research will follow to evaluate the disease and its therapies, which will guide the clinicians in treatment and policymakers to set the guidelines for better management of cardiovascular aspects of COVID-19.
