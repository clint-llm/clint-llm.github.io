Multimodal analgesia involves using medications that act on different sites and pathways in an additive or synergistic manner to give pain relief with minimal or no opiate use. Opioids are associated with adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, and dependence syndromes. Local anesthetics play a large role in multimodal analgesia. Regional anesthesia can significantly reduce post-operative pain frequency and improve overall patient satisfaction. [Level I]

Ropivacaine has additional benefits compared to other local anesthetics because it is less cardiotoxic. This characteristic makes it a safer option as a pain relief option for patients being sent home postoperatively. Administration of ropivacaine often requires a team of health professionals, including prescribing clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), pharmacists, nursing, and home health.
