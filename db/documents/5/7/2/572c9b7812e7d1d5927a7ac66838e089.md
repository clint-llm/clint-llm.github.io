All members of the interprofessional health care team involved in the care of the above patient cohorts who are susceptible to developing pyocytis must be aware of it as a complication. They should also be aware of what puts those patients at higher risk of developing it. The team can be comprised of clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists (infectious disease, urology), nursing staff, and pharmacists, which may include an infectious disease specialty pharmacist. All team members must engage in open communication and meticulous record keeping of each patient encounter and report to other team members if there are any patient status changes or concerns. This interprofessional paradigm will help optimize patient outcomes. [Level 5]

The importance of identification of urethral discharge as opposed to vaginal discharge is an important differentiator for pyocystis to allow correct management to occur. Rapid identification in the community of the condition as a differential is essential for timely investigation, diagnosis, and intervention. Education about this rare condition is crucial to avoidÂ potential complications in this patient cohort.
