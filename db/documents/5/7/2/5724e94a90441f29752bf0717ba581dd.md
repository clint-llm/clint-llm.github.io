**"All That Wheezes Is Not Asthma**"

When caring for an anesthetized patient with asthma, bronchospasm is likely to be at the top of the list of differential diagnoses for an episode of wheezing. However,Â the following list presents other entities to consider:

- Anaphylaxis

- Aspiration of stomach contents

- Aspiration of a foreign body (e.g., tooth, a piece of medical equipment)

- Upper airway obstruction (non-intubated)

- Mainstem intubation

- ETT on carina

- ETT obstruction

- ETT cuff herniation

- Pneumothorax

- Pulmonary edema

- Pulmonary thromboembolism

- Drug-induced (histamine release, anticholinesterase)

- Carcinoid syndrome or crisis
