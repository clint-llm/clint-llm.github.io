Enterobius vermicularis, also called pinworm, is one of the most common nematode infections in the world. Originally, E. vermicularis was named Oxyuris vermicularis. Humans are the only natural host for this infection. Transmission occurs in people who are living in crowded environments and usually occurs within families. The worms are tiny, thread-like, and whitish. The worm is named after the characteristic pin-like tail present on the posterior part of female worms.

Pinworm infestation usually occurs in children. Transmission is via direct contact with contaminated items or even during sexual contact. Most infections are asymptomatic. While the cure rate is high, recurrences are common.
