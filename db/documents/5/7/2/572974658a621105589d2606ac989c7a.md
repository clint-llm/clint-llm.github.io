Angiotensin is a peptide endocrine hormone and an important part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, an inter-related endocrine system important in volume and blood pressure control. Angiotensinogen, an alpha-globulin, and the peptide prohormone is synthesized primarily by the liver and circulates in plasma. Angiotensin II (AT-II) has recently received FDA approval for use in patients in shock. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of AT-II therapy in the clinical setting as relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients presenting with shock.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications approved for II in the therapeutic setting.
- Review the dose forms and dosing parameters for angiotensin II.
- Summarize monitoring, contraindications, and toxicity for angiotensin II.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with angiotensin II therapy to treat shock and drive optimal patient results.
