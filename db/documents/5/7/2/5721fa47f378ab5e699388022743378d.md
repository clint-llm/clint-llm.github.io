Paget disease is aÂ skeletal growth disorder in which abnormalities such as unusual bone growth can occur in several multifactoral ways. This is often manifested by diffuse pain throughout the musculoskeletal system.

The condition presents with excess osteoclastic activity followed by a compensatory increase in osteoblastic activity, leading to the formation of disorganized bone, which is less compact, mechanically weaker, highly vascular and more susceptible to fracture. Fortunately, more than 3/4 of patients with Paget disease are asymptomatic. It is the 2nd most common bone disorder in elderly individuals, after osteoporosis. The condition can affect one or multiple bones but the axial skeleton is most often involved (spine, pelvis, and skull). The condition does not spread to other bones but can progress in the preexisting site. A deadly complication of Paget disease is the development of pagetic sarcoma, which is fatal.

The cause of Paget disease remains unknown but there are both genetic and environmental associations. The disorder is most common in Europe, North America, and Australia but rare in Asia and Africa. A number of viruses have been identified in the diseased bone but what their role is in the disease pathology remains a mystery.
