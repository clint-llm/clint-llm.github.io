Treatment of neutrophilia is based on treating the underlying cause of neutrophilia. In a leukemoid reaction where the WBC count is more than 50,000, emergent leucopheresis, aggressive hydration, and cytotoxic therapy with hydroxyurea are indicated to prevent hypercoagulability-associated complications. Antibiotic and anti-inflammatory therapies should be undertaken for neutrophilia associated with infection/inflammation.

Medications noted to cause neutrophilia should be carefully monitored and may need to be discontinued if leading to complications. MPNs are usually treated with cytoreductive drugs; the commonly used is hydroxyurea with serial monitoring of CBC. Specific treatment options for CML include tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy with imatinib which inhibits bcr-abl tyrosine kinase, the abnormal gene product of Philadelphia chromosome t (9;22) in CML, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT).

Referral to a hematologist should be considered as a part of the workup for MPNs.
