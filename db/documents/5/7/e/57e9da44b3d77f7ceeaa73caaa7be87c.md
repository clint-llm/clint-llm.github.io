LM/LMM presents diagnostic and treatment challenges due to its clinical mimicry of benign lesions, its occurrence on background sun-damaged skin, thus confounding histopathologic differentiation between true tumor and benign melanocytic activation its occurrence on the head/neck, a cosmetically and functionally sensitive area.

Surgical excision is the treatment of choice, with MMS emerging as a surgical option that may prove superior to WLE.
