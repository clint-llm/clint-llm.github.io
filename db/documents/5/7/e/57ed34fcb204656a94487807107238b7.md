When an infant's death is suspicious for SIDS, an investigation as outlined above is required. Parents/caregivers should be comforted and educated regarding SIDS. If a genetic cause is found, genetic counseling may be needed. Anticipatory guidance that educates regarding SIDS risks is preventative; however, cardiopulmonary monitoring is not recommended for SIDS prevention.
