The risk of developing toxicity from imipramine and other tricyclics is greater upon increasing the dose. An overdose of imipramine can result in serious side effects, mainly cardiac dysrhythmia, critical hypotension, convulsions, coma, confusion, hyperactive reflexes, and hypothermia. Imipramine has type 1 antiarrhythmic effects as it blocks the fast sodium channel on the myocardium. Therefore, this will lead to inhibition of depolarization of the heart action potential, which will result in QRS prolongation, which can lead to cardiac arrhythmia.

Acute management must begin with an assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation in addition to ECG monitoring and vital signs. The initial management should primarily focus on the correction of hypoxia and acidosis if present. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate will reverse the fast sodium channel function on the myocardium, which will reverse the cardiotoxicity and will also help in increasing the pH, which can enhance the excretion of TCAs. Therefore, continuous monitoring of imipramine is important to prevent cardiotoxicity and to prevent morbidity and mortality. If patients develop seizures, the recommendation is to use benzodiazepines as first-line therapy. However, dose adjustment is necessary for certain medical conditions as hepatic or renal impairment.
