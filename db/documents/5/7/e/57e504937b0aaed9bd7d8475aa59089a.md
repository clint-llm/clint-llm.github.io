The diagnosis and management of TOF are with an interprofessional team that includes a pediatrician, pediatric cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, and radiologist. In general, all children with TOF need surgery; the timing may vary depending on symptoms. In the US, the majority of infants born with TOF undergo a primary repair within the first 12 months of life. The outcomes for TOF patients are good but after two decades a significant number of them will require pulmonary valve replacement. Unlike in the past, today there is a percutaneous method of implanting a pulmonary valve, but long-term results are not known. After surgery, most children remain free of symptoms. It is important to remember that surgery for TOF is not curative but palliative; the structural disease continues to progress at a variable rate.
