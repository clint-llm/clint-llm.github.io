An anal fissure is a common benign anorectal condition affecting both children and adults. It is defined as a painful linear tear in the posterior anoderm extending superiorly to the dentate line. Classically, anal fissures are caused by forceful expulsion of large, firm bowel contents. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and management strategies for anal fissures, as well as the indications for and technique involved in performing an internal anal sphincterotomy. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the anal canal. 
- List the indications for an anal sphincterotomy.
- Describe the complications associated with anal sphincterotomies.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the safe performance of anal sphincterotomies and optimize patient outcomes.
