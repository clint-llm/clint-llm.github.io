There are toxicological and non-toxicological conditions that can potentially mimic digoxin toxicity.

Toxicological causes include calcium channel blocker, beta-blocker, and clonidine overdose, which can present with bradycardia and hypotension, similar to digoxin overdose. Elevated digoxin levels will help in narrowing it down to digoxin toxicity. Hyperglycemia is seen with a calcium channel blocker overdose, whereas clonidine overdose has features of respiratory depression, CNS depression, and miosis. These features, however, should not be solely used to rule out digoxin toxicity.

Non-toxicology causes include hypothermia, hypothyroidism, myocardial infarction, sick sinus syndrome, and hyperkalemia.

Patients with reduced renal clearance, volume expanded conditions, and increased inotropic need may have high digoxin levels secondary to endogenous digoxin-like immunoreactive substances (DLIS) that cross-react with digoxin assay. There are reports of exogenous DLIS after ingestion of spironolactone, potassium canrenone, and certain Chinese medicines. Exogenous and endogenous DLIS interfere in the digoxin serum concentration, and this can be overcome by monitoring digoxin concentration in the protein-free ultrafiltrates.
