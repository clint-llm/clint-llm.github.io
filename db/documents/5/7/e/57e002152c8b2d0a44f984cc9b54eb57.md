**Results**

POCT results that yield critical values are typically acted upon promptly, leading to potential changes in clinical management.

Critical values, unlike urgent or STAT tests, are defined as test results that significantly deviate from the established normal range, irrespective of the patient's condition. STAT or urgent tests are designated as such by the individual ordering the test, and therefore prior knowledge of the patient's status is generally needed.

**Reporting Critical Findings**

Critical values should be treated as reportable events, even if previous critical values are already known for a particular patient.
