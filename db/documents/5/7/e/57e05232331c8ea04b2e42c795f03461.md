Bone marrow edema syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion that is characterized by pain and increased interstitial fluid within bone marrow without an obvious cause.Â It is frequently misdiagnosed as its clinical presentation is highly variable and nonspecific. As such, it may be referred to by a plethora of terms, including "transient osteoporosis," "regional migratory osteoporosis," and "algodystrophy."
