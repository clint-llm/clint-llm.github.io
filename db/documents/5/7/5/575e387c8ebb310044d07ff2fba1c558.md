**Cervical Preparation**

Unlike a D&E, where cervical preparation is recommended, cervical preparation for a D&C need only be considered. The 2 most commonly used cervical preparations are osmotic dilators or chemical ripening agents.

Osmotic dilators, such as laminaria and Dilapan-S, are established, safe, and effective ways to dilate a cervix; both require overnight placement.

Chemical ripening agents are prostaglandin analogs or progesterone antagonists, which soften or prime the cervix.

**Prevention of Infection**

Vaginal preparation with an antiseptic solution is generally performed to reduce the risk of post-abortion infection. There is limited evidence that preparation with chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine is superior to saline alone, but studies are inadequate. There is data to support that vaginal bacterial load is reduced when using the chlorohexidine solution, but this study was not powered to examine clinical outcomes.

Preoperative antibiotics lower the risk of post-abortion infection in pregnant patients but have not been proven in nonpregnant patients. Routine procedures such as endometrial biopsies and hysteroscopy do not recommend antibiotic prophylaxis; therefore is not recommended for the nonpregnant patient undergoing a D&C. Preoperative doxycycline is a safe and effective prophylactic for surgically induced abortions, whether used as a single dose or short perioperative course.
