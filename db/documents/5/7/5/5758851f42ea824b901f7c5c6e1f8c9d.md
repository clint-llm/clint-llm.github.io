Waddellâ€™s triad represents a pediatric emergency. The triad comprises of three distinct features seen in pediatric pedestrian patients subject to blunt force trauma, usually secondary to a direct impact by a motor vehicle. They include ipsilateral femoral shaft fracture, ipsilateral intra-thoracic or intra-abdominal injury, and contralateral head injury. The combination of these 3 injuries can lead to significant blood loss via internal hemorrhage. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of patients presenting with Waddell's triad and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing the patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of Waddell's triad .
- Outline the necessary workup for evaluation of a patient presenting with Waddell's triad.
- Explain the importance of pediatric trauma score for the assessment of severity of injury in patients presenting with the Waddell's triad. 
- Address the importance of coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients presenting with Waddell's triad.
