Often patients will see the snake which leaves very few differential diagnoses to consider except for the identification of the snake species.Â  Patients occasionally will not see the actual snake when bitten so there may be questions about whether the wound is from a snake or due to another process. Two puncture wounds next to one another are suggestive of a pit viper envenomation. However, not all patients will have two puncture wounds. Punctures from other sharp objects or thorns could be considerations. Punctures from non-snake sources could result in cellulitis that may potentially mimic a pit viper envenomation; however, the temporal course and appearance will be different. As such the differential diagnosis can include:

- Arthropod envenomation

- Cellulitis

- Vascular trauma

- Wasp sting

- Deep vein thrombosis
