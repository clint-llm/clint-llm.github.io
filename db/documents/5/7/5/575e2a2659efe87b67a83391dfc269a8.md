Perinatal asphyxia can result in systemic effects, including neurologic insult, respiratory distress and pulmonary hypertension, and liver, myocardial, and renal dysfunction. Depending on the severity and timing of the hypoxic insult, a neonate with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy due to perinatal asphyxia can demonstrate a variety of neurologic findings. Using the Sarnat staging for encephalopathy can be useful. In Sarnat Stage I, the least severe stage, there is generalized sympathetic tone and the neonate may be hyper-alert with prolonged periods of wakefulness, mydriasis and increased deep tendon reflexes. In Sarnat Stage II, the neonate may be lethargic or obtunded, with decreased tone, strong distal flexion, and generalized parasympathetic tone with miosis, bradycardia and increased secretions. Seizures are common in Sarnat Stage II. Sarnat Stage III, the most severe, is characterized by a profoundly decreased level of consciousness, flaccid tone, decreased deep tendon reflexes and very abnormal EEG. Clinical seizures are less common in Sarnat Stage III due to the profound injury in the brain preventing the propagation of clinical seizures.
