For evaluation of the patients, it is important to take a relevant clinical history, perform a physical examination, and do appropriate diagnostic tests including:

Risk factors evaluation: Search for risk factors of stroke, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, atrial fibrillation, atrial septal defect, migraine, and Takayasu arteritis.

Neurological examination: A complete neurological examination should be done as medial medullary syndrome is mostly a clinical diagnosis.

Imaging: For the diagnosis of medial medullary syndrome, both computerized tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be done. MRI can visualize the lesion more effectively than a CT scan. It is difficult to visualize posterior cranial fossa structures by CT scan, which may be obscured by the bony structures on CT scan. In diffusion-weighted (DWI) and T2-weighted film, there will be a hyperintense lesion in the medial medulla.

For identifying the site of vascular occlusion, a magnetic resonance (MR) angiogram or CT angiogram can be done.

An ECG can be performed for excluding underlying atrial fibrillation.

Other baseline investigations, including serum glucose, serum electrolytes, fasting lipid panel, etc., should be performed as well.
