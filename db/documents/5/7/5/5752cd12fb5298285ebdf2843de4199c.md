The etiology of hypomelanosis of Ito remains mysterious. The familial occurrence was described as suggesting an underlying chromosomal abnormality. Several models of inheritance have been proposed: X-linked, autosomal-dominant, and recessive gene transmission. However, to date, there is no evidence for genetic transmission. Most cases are sporadic. Chromosomal mosaicism and chromosomal translocations were reported.
