The dentist should consider if taking an image and exposing the patient to radiation will change the management of the fracture. A variety of X-ray projections and angulations are available, and dentists must use their clinical judgment to correctly select the most appropriate ones.

Parallel periapical radiographs are usually the first image that clinicians take. An occlusal projection may become handy in some cases. Cone-beam CT scans accurately identify the fracture's extension, location, and direction, which will improve the treatment outcomes in more complex cases.
