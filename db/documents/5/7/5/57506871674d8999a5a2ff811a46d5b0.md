To develop a curriculum and subsequent assessment, a literature search should be performed to find previously developed measures for outcomes. If the assessment tool is to be modified for a particular setting or learners, describe the modifications and include support for how these changes improve suitability for the novel situation. Discussion of the adaptation is warranted if 1) previously characterized assessment tools are modified, 2) the assessment is used for a different setting, purpose, or set of learners or 3) there is a different interpretation for the outcomes. Potential limitations for the new approach should also be disclosed and discussed. If a previously characterized assessment tool is used in the same setting, with the same types of learners, and for the same purpose, then citing the referenced literature is appropriate. Included in this discussion should be whether these modifications are likely to affect the validity or reliability of the assessment tools. Additionally, the developers of novel assessment tools should state the development process and present any data that would substantiate validity and reliability.

Developers should reflect on the purpose of the simulation to determine if the focus will be on teaching or learning.
