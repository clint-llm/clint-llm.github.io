Braxton-Hicks contractions, also known as prodromal or false labor pains, are contractions of the uterus that typically are not felt until the second or third trimester of the pregnancy. Braxton-Hicks contractions are the body's way of preparing for true labor, but they do not indicate that labor has begun. Because many pregnant patients have not been educated about Braxton-Hicks contractions, they often seek care and undergo unnecessary evaluation for these contractions. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with Braxton-Hicks contractions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in educating the patient about the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of Braxton-Hicks contractions.
- Review the presentation of a patient with Braxton-Hicks contractions.
- Explain how to evaluate a patient with Braxton-Hicks contractions.
- Employ strategies to improve interprofessional communication, which will improve outcomes in patients with Braxton-Hicks contractions.
