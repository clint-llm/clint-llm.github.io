The use of inamrinone is associated with significant side effects. However, inamrinone is valuable for short-term treatment when digoxin, diuretics, and vasodilators fail to improve cardiac output. Therefore, it becomes imperative for the healthcare team to monitor the adverse effects of inamrinone and communicate any abnormalities in blood pressure, heart rate, electrocardiogram, electrolytes, renal function, and hepatic function. Clinicians must be even more vigilant if platelet count drops to less than 150,000 cells/mm3. Nursing staff should ensure short-term use of inamrinone with a careful watch on side effects to improve patient outcomes. Pharmacists should perform medication reconciliation and notify the prescriber if drug interactions are present. Critical care and cardiology consultation are required for refractory heart failure or cardiogenic shock. A systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that critical care pharmacists, as part of the interprofessional ICU team care, are associated with a decreased likelihood of mortality and decreased ICU length of stay.

In addition, due to the intricacy of heart failure management and coordination of other health and social services required, advanced heart failure care is optimal if delivered by interprofessional teams that include cardiologists, nurses, and pharmacists specializing in heart failure, social workers, primary care clinicians, and additional specialists.
