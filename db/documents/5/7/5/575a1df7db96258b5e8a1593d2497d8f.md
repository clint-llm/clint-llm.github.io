Heart failure is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and it is associated with poor life expectancy, poor quality of life, and a higher economic burden on the healthcare system.

With an increase in the age of the population and advances in the treatment of ischemic heart diseases, the number of patients with heart failure continues to grow, which has introduced significant challenges to managing cardiac arrhythmia and advanced heart failure.

In the early 1990s, it was identified that electromechanical dyssynchrony plays a prominent role in heart failure, and pacing devices that stimulate several places in the heart at once could be utilized to offset this dyssynchrony and conduction delay.

Since then, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) has been an important treatment modality for heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction.
