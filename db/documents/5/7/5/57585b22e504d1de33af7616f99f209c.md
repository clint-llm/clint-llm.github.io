Peripheral vascular bypass (PVB) is the surgical revision of blood flow to restore perfusion distal to an occluded or otherwise disrupted arterial segment. Peripheral vascular bypass procedures can involve any arteries, excluding those in the heart or the brain. Most patients with PAD are asymptomatic, and their risk for limb loss is negligible. Therefore intervention is not indicated in asymptomatic patients. However, symptomatic patients might present with claudication and rest pain. A significant subset of patients with symptomatic PAD present with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). This activity describes the different types of peripheral vascular bypass surgery and highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for peripheral vascular bypass.
- Review the contraindications to peripheral vascular bypass.
- Review the surgical technique for one of the bypass surgical procedures discussing the aortoiliac disease.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the management of patients with peripheral vascular disease and improve outcomes.
