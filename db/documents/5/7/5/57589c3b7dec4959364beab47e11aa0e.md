Coronary angiography historically has been a well established diagnostic modality for identifying restenosis and for the guidance of PCI. In a study of 288 BMS-ISR lesions in 245 patients, Mehran and colleagues classified ISR into four angiographic patterns (Table 2 and 3). Pattern I: focal (length of 10 mm or less) lesions; pattern II: ISR involving more than 10 mm within the stent; pattern III: ISR more than 10 mm and extending outside the stent; and pattern IV is a completely occlusive ISR. The incidence was 42%, 21%, 30%, and 7% for pattern I, pattern II, pattern III, and pattern IV, respectively.

Intravascular imaging techniques, including intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and optical coherence tomography (OCT), provide additional advantages over angiography, providing more distinct lesion characterization and identification of the etiology of ISR potentially optimizing the short and long term outcomes of PCI for ISR.

Intravascular imaging with IVUS or OCT determination of the potential mechanisms of ISR can guide appropriate treatment. Both imaging modalities can identify stent under-expansion, presence of neointimal hyperplasia, and borders of the external elastic lamina for appropriate balloon sizing during post-dilation. OCT has a superior axial resolution, and can further highlight the morphologic differences between BMS-ISR and DES-ISR. Findings of homogenous, continuous tissue bands on OCT are consistent with neointimal hyperplasia that is typical of BMS-ISR, while a focal, heterogeneous, and layering appearance represents proteoglycan and fibrin deposition which occurs in the setting of neoatherosclerosis. Other specific findings that are suggestive of neoatherosclerosis include neointimal rupture, TCFA formation, microvessels, presence of lipid pools, macrophage accumulation, and evidence of non-occlusive thrombosis.

In a meta-analysis of thirteen studies with 1384 stents on double source computed tomography angiography (DSCTA) and five studies including 622 stents on 320-row computed tomography angiography (320-row CTA), the sensitivity, the specificity, and the area under the curve of DSCTA in diagnosing ISR were 0.92 (0.87 to 0.96), 0.91 (0.87 to 0.94), and 0.97 (0.95 to 0.98), respectively, and they were 0.91 (0.82 to 0.96), 0.95 (0.88 to 0.98), and 0.96 (0.94 to 0.97) for 320-row CTA. This data suggested that both DSCTA and 320-row CTA had high diagnostic accuracy in detecting ISR, especially for stent diameters of more than 3 mm, and may be appropriate tools for further evaluation of ISR in the future.

Newer data fusion methodologies and hybrid, dual-probe catheters are being developed to allow complete and detailed evaluation of plaque morphology and pathophysiology, and for reliable identification of high-risk and vulnerable lesions. Examples of these dual-probe catheters are combined IVUS-OCT,near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-IVUS, OCT-NIRS, OCT-near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) molecular imaging (IVUS-NIRF), IVUS intravascular photoacoustic imaging, and combined fluorescence lifetime-IVUS imaging. These multimodal approaches can provide a comprehensive visualization of plaque composition and plaque morphology and are useful for guiding optimal intervention decisions.

Several studies have indicated that asymptomatic patients with moderate disease severity ISR are unlikely to benefit from routine reintervention. Assessment of fractional flow reserve (FFR) during cardiac catheterization can assist in determining those that will benefit from revascularization. Prospective studies have shown that deferring revascularization in patients with ISR and FFR of over 0.75 is safe and appropriate.
