ALK(-) ALCL tends to grow cohesively and invade lymph node sinuses. The WHO classification describes several histologic patterns including common, small cell, lymphohistiocytic, and Hodgkin-like. In the common pattern, the tumor cells have abundant cytoplasm with wreath-like nuclei (see image). The small cell pattern is typically associated with ALK-positive and not ALK(-) ALCL. This pattern consists of small to medium-sized neoplastic cells with pale cytoplasm and centrally located nuclei referred to as “fried egg cells.” In the lymphohistiocytic pattern, the tumor cells are mixed with reactive histiocytes which sometimes show erythrophagocytosis. The Hodgkin-like pattern is characterized by morphological features similar to nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin lymphoma. All patterns demonstrate some examples of a characteristic cell type known as the “hallmark” cell which is a large cell with abundant cytoplasm, containing a nucleus that is horseshoe or kidney-shaped around a prominent central Golgi zone. Sometimes, the nucleus may appear “doughnut” shaped when it envelops the Golgi

The architecture of involved organs or lymph nodes is usually effaced by a solid, sheet-like infiltrate of tumor cells. Frequently within lymph nodes, the neoplastic cells appear as cohesive groups within sinuses, mimicking carcinoma. When bone marrow is involved, the pattern is typically nodular but may also be interstitial
