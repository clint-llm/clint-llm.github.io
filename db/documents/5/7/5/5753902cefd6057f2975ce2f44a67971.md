For patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, administer the first zolmitriptan dose in a medically-supervised setting and perform an electrocardiogram (EKG) following zolmitriptan administration. For high-risk patients using zolmitriptan for the long term, perform a periodic cardiovascular evaluation. Clinicians should monitor blood pressure in all patients taking zolmitriptan because of its vasoconstrictive properties—especially those with hepatic impairment. Some signs that can indicate elevated blood pressure are headaches and palpitations.
