Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death for both genetic sexes. It occurs in all populations regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic status.

When misused or administered incorrectly, FOBT has resulted in unnecessary testing, increased healthcare costs, and prolonged hospital stays. Therefore, it should only be performed when indicated. Many organizations focus on educating healthcare providers about these indications.

The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years has a substantial net benefit, and screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years has a moderate net benefit.

Colorectal cancer screening is now recommended for average-risk individuals starting at age 45, according to the American College of Gastroenterology guidelines.
