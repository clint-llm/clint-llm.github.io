- Laboratory monitoring is recommended in patients on niacin therapy due to its diverse side effects.

- In pre-diabetes or diabetic patients, frequent monitoring of blood glucose is necessary as niacin can increase fasting blood glucose. Patients on diabetic medications, such as acarbose, albiglutide, alogliptin, glipizide, or insulin, should also have blood glucose monitored frequently.

- Niacin can cause an increase in uric acid, thus exerting an antagonist effect on medications for gouts, such as pegloticase and allopurinol.

- Niacin exerts an additive reaction with blood pressure medications (amlodipine clozapine, bisoprolol, diltiazem), opioids (morphine, oxycodone, tramadol, methadone), antipsychotics (quetiapine, risperidone) phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (tadalafil), thus leading to hypotension. Frequent blood pressure checking is recommended. Also, niacin, in combination with some beta-blockers, may decrease its antihyperlipidemic efficacy.

- Niacin can increase the risk of bleeding by exerting an additive effect. Niacin has shown to not only cause a reduction in platelet counts (mean of -11% with 2000 mg) but to increase prothrombin time (mean of approximately +4%), leading to bleeding, especially when combined with anticoagulants such as apixaban, caplacizumab, or warfarin. Thus, a blood coagulation panel should be a routine test.

- Niacin also exerts an additive effect when combined with ceritinib, diazoxide leading to hyperglycemia.

- Phosphorus levels also require monitoring in patients at risk for hypophosphatemia as niacin can cause a decrease in phosphorus levels (mean of -13% with 2000 mg).
