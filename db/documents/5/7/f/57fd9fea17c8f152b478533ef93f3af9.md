The management and prognosis of a patient with uric acid nephrolithiasis improve with efficient communication amongst the interprofessional team of healthcare providers, which includes an emergency department physician, primary care physician, urologist, and nephrologist. The management of a case of uric acid nephrolithiasis starts mostly in the emergency department with the treatment of colicky pain. However, an urgent referral to the urologist may be needed if a need for immediate intervention is present. The primary care physician and the nurse practitioner provide an indispensable role in remodeling the lifestyle of the patient. Uric acid stones are associated with cardiometabolic diseases; thus, they could be seen as warning signs of these diseases.

It is imperative to motivate the patient between the occasional episodes of pain to get the metabolic testing done. The physician should use the ROKS nomogram to evaluate the recurrence of stone and order 24-hour urine testing as required. Only about 7.4% of patients undergo successful 24-hour urinary testing due to inconvenience related to the test and its interference with daily activity.

The American Urological Association has provided guidelines for the management of uric acid nephrolithiasis, which is based on a systematic review and has been extensively peer-reviewed. Interprofessional communication between different practitioners is very crucial to adhere to these guidelines and improve disease outcomes.
