It is estimated that somewhere between 10% to 20% of adults have gallstones, of which 1% to 3% of patients are symptomatic. In the United States, approximately 500,000 people require cholecystectomy due to all types of biliary disease.Â Biliary colic has a female predominance due to the influence of estrogen on the formation of gallstones. Obesity and elevated cholesterol are also strongly correlated to biliary colic and gallbladder disease because in the United States most gallstones are cholesterol-based.
