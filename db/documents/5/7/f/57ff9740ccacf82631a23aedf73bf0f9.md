Pain in short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache is generally in the V1 distribution and can be described as sharp, stabbing, burning, or electrical shocks. Patients must report at least 20 attacks that fulfill the criteria for short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache. Attacks must be of moderate to severe pain intensity lasting 1-600 seconds with the orbital, supraorbital, or temporal distribution. These attacks must also be associated with at least one of the following autonomic symptoms: conjunctival injection, stuffy nose, tearing, rhinorrhea, eyelid swelling, increased sweating in the head and neck regions, or redness, ear discomfort, or miosis/ptosis.

Similar to trigeminal neuralgia, SUNCT and SUNA can also be triggered by external stimuli. Common triggers include any irritation of the trigeminal nerve such as chewing, touching the face, brushing teeth, temperature, or even loud noise. They are differentiated from trigeminal neuralgia by the presence of cranial autonomic symptoms. Although migraine and other types of facial pain can stimulate the parasympathetic ganglion and produce some autonomic symptoms, they will not be as pronounced as the ones with SUNCT and SUNA.
