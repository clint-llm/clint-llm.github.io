Fusiform or saccular dilation of the popliteal artery is due to loss of the mechanical integrity of the vessel wall, leading to dilation of the vessel and ultimately aneurysm degeneration.  The direct mechanism is believed to be multifactorial and related to an imbalance of production and degradation of vascular wall constituents including elastin, collagen, glycosaminoglycans and vascular smooth muscle.  However, the specific mechanism for the development of popliteal artery aneurysm formation is currently unknown.
