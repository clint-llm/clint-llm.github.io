Although Becker muscular dystrophy is a rare condition, the clinical presentation gives high suspicion of the disease. But, a wide range of symptoms necessitates the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team. Especially the patients having more severe conditions should care under the intervention of physiotherapists, vocational trainers, nurses, clinicians, nutritionists, radiologists, pharmacists, speech therapists, recreational therapists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, neurologists, and genetic experts. Genetic analysis needs precise evaluation to get accurate results for diagnosis. Pharmacists should make sure that the patient is receiving glucocorticoids, working with other health professionals on dosing, administration, and side effects. The interaction between health professionals is essential to improving patient outcomes.
