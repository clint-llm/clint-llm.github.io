The superficial branch of the radial nerve is the third most common peripheral nerve injury and will cause an area of paresthesia over the dorsum of the first web space on the hand. Surgeons should be aware of their variable location within the anatomical snuffbox to avoid injury.

The anatomical snuffbox can be used as a point of access for percutaneous arterial access for coronary intervention.

Finally, if the arterial access is not accessible in the anatomical snuffbox, or if, following successful cannulation, there is a procedural complication such as vasospasm or bleeding, the commonly used radial arterial access option remains available as a backup. Disadvantages of this approach include the fact that the caliber of the radial artery is relatively small in the anatomical snuffbox, but a cohort study demonstrated successful cannulation here with a 6 Fr catheter in 132 out of 150 patients, and the authors concluded that this approach is feasible and safe for both coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention.
