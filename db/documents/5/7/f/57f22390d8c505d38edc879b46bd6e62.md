The management of yellow nail syndrome (YNS) focuses on treating symptoms. If thought to be a paraneoplastic syndrome, the treatment of underlying cancer may lead to resolution.

**Pulmonary Symptoms**

Pleural effusions are usually treated with thoracentesis. Octreotide has been shown to be effective in some cases of chylous effusions associated with YNS.

**Dystrophic and Discolored Nails**

Nail disease in YNS can resolve spontaneously. Evidence for using oral vitamin E to treat nail discoloration has mixed success.

**Lymphedema**

Lymphedema observed in YNS is treated with the same interventions used in primary lymphedema. Generally, non-surgical interventions are used, including compression garments and bandaging used in combination with skincare, manual lymph drainage, and exercises.
