A history of trauma is common in the presence of traumatic muscular hematomas but may not become clinically relevant for several days, especially when the patient has distracting injuries.

Presentation of spontaneous muscular hematomas are more variable and most commonly present with localized or diffuse pain in the flank or abdomen.  It is essential to inquire about a history of anticoagulant use when there is suspicion of a muscular hematoma, particularly in the geriatric population.

Practitioners should carefully monitor for symptoms of blood loss such as tachycardia, hypotension, and pallor, which can result in anemia and, in more severe cases, organ failure. Note that, generally, the INR will remain within the therapeutic target. Nonetheless, practitioners must be cautious to avoid overprescribing anticoagulants, which can occur in up to 33% of such cases.
