Management is dictated by the presence or absence of neurologic symptoms. The goal of treatment is the return of vascular tone and the resolution of postural hypotension to resolve symptoms. If the patient is normothermic, place the patient in Trendelenburg position or supine with the legs elevated 12 to 24 inches above the heart. Often, this alone significantly improves mental status and physical symptoms.

When resting at baseline, the patient is eligible for oral fluid resuscitation and ambulation with assistance. This should be under the auspices of personnel trained to look for signs of other forms of exertional injury like EAH or heat injuries due to the high incidence of presentation overlap. Ambulation allows for the return of skeletal muscle 'second heart' effect, and oral rehydration allows for increased intravascular volume status, both aimed at improving postural orthostatic hypotension.

If the patient's mental status is not improving after 5 minutes of Trendelenburg positioning, other etiologies should be considered. IV access should be obtained, and fluid rehydration should be considered. However, point of care electrolyte and glucose evaluation should be considered to evaluate for hypoglycemia and hyponatremia before fluid administration. Any persistent mental changes, rectal temperature > 102, systolic blood pressure < 110, or heart rate > 100 should be considered for transfer to a higher level of care.
