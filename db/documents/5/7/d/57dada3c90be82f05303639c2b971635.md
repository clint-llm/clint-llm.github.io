If an STI was diagnosed, it is important to educate the patient on safe sexual practices. This includes discussing with the patient for them to inform their partner(s) and encourage them to have themselves evaluated by a health care professional and pursue appropriate treatment. It is important to stress the likelihood of how a recurrence can occur even if their partner(s) are asymptomatic as they may have asymptomatic infections. Patients should be educated on refraining from intercourse until both the patient and partner(s) have been successfully treated and are without symptoms.
