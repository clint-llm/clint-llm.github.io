Pruritus is a common complaint among patients with progressive kidney disease. In various studies, the reported prevalence of uremic pruritus varies between 18% and 97.8%, and an overall prevalence of 55%.

Despite the high prevalence of CKD-associated pruritus, nephrologists often underestimate its prevalence. For example, when data from 6256 patients and 268 medical directors in 17 countries from 2012 to 2015 were analyzed, medical directors underestimated the prevalence of pruritus in 69 facilities.

The most comprehensive epidemiologic data on uremic pruritis comes from DOPPS, based on outcomes in 12 different countries, such as France, Belgium, Canada, Australia, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, Spain, Sweden, New Zealand, and the United States, in which 41.7% of the patients between 2002 and 2003 reported moderate to extreme pruritus.

Combining these data with DOPPS-I and DOPPS-II yields a mean weighted prevalence of 40.6%. The latest sizeable study of the prevalence of uremic pruritus, DOPPS-III data, particularly from Japan, observed an incidence of moderate to extreme uremic pruritus of 44% between 1996 and 2008.
