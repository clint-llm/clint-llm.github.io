Hepatic adenomas, also called hepatocellular adenomas, are rare but benign epithelial tumors of the liver frequently associated with women of reproductive age who are taking exogenous estrogens in the form of oral contraceptive pills. They are also seen in patients treated with anabolic steroids for athletic enhancement, Fanconi anemia, or aplastic anemia. Although benign, they are associated with risks of hemorrhage and malignant transformation. Elective resection is recommended in all men with adenomas and in women with adenomas greater than 5 cm. Advances in the radiologic diagnosis and subtype classifications based on molecular behavior have emerged, which provide a more systematic approach to treating patients with hepatic adenomas. Although typically singular, multiple adenomas can occur. Hepatic adenomatosis refers to the presence of ten or more tumors.
