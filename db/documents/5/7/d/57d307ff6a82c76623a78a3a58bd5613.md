The principal goal of management of late decelerations is to:

- Replenish uteroplacental blood flow by correcting the underlying cause

- Increase fetal PO2

- Prevention or correction of fetal acidemia

After completing a detailed assessment of the etiology of late declaration, immediate intrauterine resuscitative measures are initiated to prevent fetal acidemia and to decrease fetal morbidity and mortality. The resuscitative measures include

- Maternal repositioning to left lateral position, right lateral or knee-chest position, which will relieve the vena cava compression by the gravid uterus - this allows for an increased venous return and cardiac output, which subsequently increases uteroplacental blood flow

- Intravenous hydration: hypotension secondary to epidural anesthesia can also be corrected by giving the mother an intravenous fluid bolus or by alpha-adrenergic agonists by the anesthesiologist - correcting maternal hypotension will increase intravascular volume, increase maternal PO2, and eventually will increase uteroplacental blood flow and PO2

- Administering supplemental oxygen: there is conflicting data about maternal O2 administration for Category II and Category III fetal heart tracings - some observational studies report that O2 administration can improve fetal oxygenation and decrease decelerations, but overall data is conflicting; the standard of practice when fetal heart tracing abnormality observed remains to administer supplemental oxygen

- Discontinuing uterotonics: by discontinuing uterotonics, there is a relaxation of the uterine muscles which has been proven to increase uteroplacental blood flow - the frequency of uterine contractions can also be decreased by using tocolytics; tocolysis has proven to improve uterine relaxation by decreasing the frequency of uterine contractions and increased uteroplacental blood flow

- Expeditious operative vaginal delivery or cesarean delivery: if the above mentioned intrauterine resuscitative measures are not improving the fetal heart tracings and there are persistent late decelerations with loss of variability, then expeditious steps must be taken towards delivering the fetus.
