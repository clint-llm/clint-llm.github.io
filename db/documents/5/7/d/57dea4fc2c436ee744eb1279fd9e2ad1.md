The entire interprofessional team is involved in managing the outcome of liposuction patients. In one instance of the literature over a span of 10 years, consisting of 1,645 liposuction patients, 1.6% of patients filed a complaint in regards to their care.

As stated previously, the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and nurses all have a role to play in the successful execution of a liposuction procedure and maintaining a satisfied patient. Many of the areas in which the healthcare team can work together to improve outcomes come in the postoperative period to assuage the common complaints of the poor aesthetic outcome, complications, and the quality of care which the patient receives.
