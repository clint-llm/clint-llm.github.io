Preparation for percutaneous transcatheter VSD closure begins with an evaluation of the patient to assess if he qualifies for catheter closure. This evaluation is most commonly done via transthoracic echocardiogram, including the sizing and location of the VSD, followed by cardiac catheterization to evaluate for the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additional pre-operative tests may include chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, and blood tests to assess the patient's general health and kidney function. Before the procedure, all patients undergoing VSD closure should be pre-treated with antiplatelet therapy, commonly with both aspirin and clopidogrel daily. Warfarin therapy alone may be an option in patients who need chronic antithrombotic therapy followed by bridging with low-molecular-weight heparin before and after VSD closure. An intravenous antibiotic dose should be given one hour before percutaneous access, typically cefazolin or vancomycin, if they are allergic to penicillin. To avoid left atrial hypovolemia, patients should also receive IV normal saline before and during the procedure. All patients should be evaluated by anesthesia before the procedure. Typically, patients under ten years of age undergo general anesthesia, and conscious sedation is used for patients older than ten years of age.
