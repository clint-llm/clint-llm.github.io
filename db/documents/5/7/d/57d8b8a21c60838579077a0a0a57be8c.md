Typically, lymphatic drainage in the large and small intestines flows to intraabdominal sentinel lymph nodes. The lymph is then transported to the thoracic duct, and ultimately to the intrathoracic lymph nodes. A study on rats found that following removal of the visceral lymphatic system, the intrathoracic lymph nodes were the first to drain the bowel, most likely through the lymphatic system of the anterior chest wall and diaphragm. This study shows there is a chance that lymph can travel through channels of the diaphragm and parietal surfaces, avoiding any association with the superior mesenteric lymph nodes. This has yet to be studied in human visceral and peritoneal lymph drainage. These findings create a new outlook on the metastatic spread of malignant cells. If this is explored in humans undergoing bowel resection, new treatments can be implemented to aid in enhancing the lymph flow from the peritoneal space to the diaphragm and anterior chest wall via alternate routes.
