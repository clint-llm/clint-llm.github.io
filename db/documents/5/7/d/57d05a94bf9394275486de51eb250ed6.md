Pulmonic stenosis is a typically benign condition in most patients. While generally non-life-threatening after the neonatal period, complications and new-onset symptoms may arise in adults requiring intervention. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of pulmonic stenosis and highlights the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of pulmonic stenosis.
- Review the common presentation of a patient with pulmonic stenosis.
- Identify treatment considerations and common complications of interventions for patients with pulmonic stenosis.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by pulmonic stenosis.
