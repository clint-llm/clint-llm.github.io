Humerus fractures are relatively common in the elderly and in those who participate in intense physical sporting activities. The majority of patients with humerus fracture first present to the emergency department and hence the triage nurse and emergency room physician must be aware of the importance of prompt referral to an orthopedic surgeon. The outcomes for most patients with humerus fracture are good. Complete union can often take 6-10 weeks and even after recovery, some patients may exhibit a slight decrease in the shoulder range of motion. It is very important to follow up patients with humerus fracture to ensure that they are not developing the frozen shoulder; hence some type of exercise rehab program must be recommended.
