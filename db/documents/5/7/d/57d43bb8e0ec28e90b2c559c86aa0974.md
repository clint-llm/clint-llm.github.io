The concurrent administration of levofloxacin with drugs that prolong the QT interval is contraindicated.

It is also contraindicated in patients with documented hypersensitivity to the drug or excipients, as cases of anaphylaxis have been reported.

Fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, are contraindicated in pregnancy. Research has suggested that risk is highest during the first trimester; levofloxacin administration should typically be discouraged during pregnancy and lactation unless a safer alternative is not available. More research is needed to establish the role of fluoroquinolone during pregnancy.

It is recommended to avoid levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolone antibiotics in patients with myasthenia gravis due to an increased risk of exacerbation of existing muscle weakness.

**Boxed Warning:**FDA has alerted a boxed warning for using levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones due to increased risk of disabling and irreversible side effects, including tendinitis and tendon rupture, peripheral neuropathy, and CNS effects (e.g., seizures, increased intracranial pressure) in all ages. Older patients > 60 years, those taking corticosteroids and with kidney, heart, or lung transplants, are at increased risk of severe tendon disorders.
