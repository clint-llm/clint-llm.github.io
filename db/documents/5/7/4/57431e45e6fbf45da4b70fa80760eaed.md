The neuronal death occurs in two stages following a reversible hypoxic-ischemic injury.

- The first stage is the primary neuronal death.Â If the insult is severe, there may be immediate primary neuronal death due to cellular hypoxia with the cell's high-energy stores' exhaustion.

- After a latent period, the second stage of delayed neuronal death begins due to free radical injury, cytotoxic actions of microglia, mitochondrial failure, and nitric oxide synthesis. The delayed phase accounts for a significant proportion of the final cell loss even after severe insults. The delayed phase usually causes encephalopathy and seizures.

The latent period between primary and delayed neuronal death is approximately 6 hours, as per the experimental study.**.**Therapeutic hypothermia in neonates has a neuroprotective effect by modifying the cells programmed for apoptosis and reducing cerebral metabolic rate.
