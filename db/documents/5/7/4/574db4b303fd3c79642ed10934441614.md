Brainstem infarcts are a collection of difficult to diagnose syndromes affecting the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. They can cause a varied range of symptoms ranging from impairment of cranial nerves III to XII, to respiratory and cardiac dysfunction, locked-in syndrome, sleep-wake cycle alteration, and decreased consciousness and death. Early diagnosis is a must as brainstem infarction is associated with high mortality and morbidity. An adequate understanding of anatomy, physical exam, and pathophysiology is required for evaluating and managing the disease. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of brainstem infarction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in assessing and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of brainstem infarction.
- Outline the evaluation of brainstem infarction.
- Review the management options available for brainstem infarction.
