Infants and toddlers are at risk for amblyopia if neurodevelopment of the visual system is disrupted.

- Intervention is imperative during the critical period (up to age 3). Strongly recommended during the sensitive period (ages 3 to 9).

- To reduce the risk of complications, patients prescribed bandage soft contact lens (BSCL) therapy must be proficient in the handling and care of the BSCL.

- Patients prescribed BSCL are at risk for infection, pain and vision loss if secondary corneal infection were to occur.

- Those with iridocorneal adhesions should be monitored for glaucoma.

- Those with elevated intraocular pressure, visual field defects or glaucomatous optic nerve appearance should be treated for glaucoma.

- Penetrating keratoplasty should be considered if corneal opacities limit visual potential.

- If iridocorneal adhesions are present corneal grafting procedures are at risk for failure.

- Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy can recur in corneal grafts.
