The overall prognosis for patients with endometriosis is favorable. This is a benign disease. However, it is a chronic condition and can be progressive. Patients with endometriomas signify those with more severe disease and thus can have more long-term complications from the disease. Even if treatment is effective for patients for a time, it is, unfortunately, a condition with a high level of reoccurrence. Therefore, the main issue of this disease is the lack of truly definitive treatment, which canÂ cause long-term issues such as pain and infertility. Thankfully, most women have an improvement in their symptoms once they become menopausal due to the lack of cyclical hormonal signaling.
