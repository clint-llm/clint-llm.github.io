Murmurs are the most common reason for pediatric cardiologist referral and evaluation. There are reports that up to 72% of children will have a murmur at some pointÂ during childhood and adolescence, and of these, some may stay present until adulthood, while others will resolve with time.

The incidence of congenital heart disease in the general population is less than 1%, and of all the new murmurs referred to a pediatric cardiologist, less than 1% are a result of CHD.
