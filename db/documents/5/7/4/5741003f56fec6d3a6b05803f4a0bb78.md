Since most patients with an acute abdomen are seniors, they are best managed in an ICU setting. Intravenous hydration, Nasogastric decompression and pain control are often required. The role of antibiotics depends on the cause. Close monitoring is required as patients may develop complications like atelectasis, ileus, wound infections, DVT and pneumonia.
