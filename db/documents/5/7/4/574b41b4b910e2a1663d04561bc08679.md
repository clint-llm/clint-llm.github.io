Panic disorder has a relatively high lifetime prevalence, ranking behind only social anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder. Notably, patients suffering from panic disorder have much higher lifetime rates of cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and other medical problems compared to the general population. European Americans are more likely to suffer from panic disorder than African Americans, Asian Americans, or Latinos. Females are more affected than men. Panic disorder peaks in adolescence and early adulthood, with low prevalence in children below the age of 14.

Patients with panic disorders also share many other comorbidities including OCD, social phobia, asthma, COPD, irritable bowel syndrome, hypertension, and mitral valve prolapse. Pregnant females with panic disorder are also more likely to have small birth weight infants.
