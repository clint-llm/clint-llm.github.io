The essential characteristic of cyclothymia is a chronic, pervasive, fluctuating mood disturbance. These fluctuations are described as periods of distinguishable depressive and elevated episodes. Unlike conventional bipolar spectrum disorders, cyclothymia can induce spontaneous fleeting oscillations between euphoric and depressive dispositions. Depressive symptomatology may include depressed mood, irritability, hopelessness, helplessness, insomnia, fatigue, anhedonia, avolition, negativity of affect, headaches, neurasthenia, and suicidal ideation. Hypomanic symptoms consist of impulsivity, grandiosity, racing thoughts, increased sociability, excessive physical activity, and increased speech production.

A developmental history will most likely reveal a chronic and pervasive pattern of emotional lability, hypersensitivity, recurrent interpersonal altercations, incidents of self-harming, episodes of excessive gambling, reckless sexual activity, multiple divorces, legal or financial problems, and recurrent job loss.

Less frequently, some will experience displacement of their distress and anxiety in the form of somatic pain. Such complaints include chest pain, asthenia, weight loss, hair loss, and headaches.
