The pathogenesis of livedoid vasculopathy can be explained by increased thrombotic and decreased fibrinolytic activity along with endothelial cell damage.

Biochemical mechanisms involving defects in the proteins and enzymes involved in the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways can lead to increased platelet and fibrin rich thrombi in the capillaries leading to its typical cutaneous manifestations.

An example of this is when homocysteinemia leads to DNA hypomethylation and prevents the action of histone deacetylase that leads to transcriptional repression along with increased oxidant stress on cells due to increased expression of p66shc in endothelial cells.
