Given the characteristic triad and the pathognomonic finding of the abdominal wall in prune belly syndrome, a differential diagnosis is often not required. It is crucial, however, to identify the severity and potential causes of the urinary tract dysmorphisms and also to consider all other comorbid conditions associated with prune belly syndrome outside of the usual characteristic triad. Some patients have the typical urinary tract abnormalities described in prune belly syndrome but may have either normally placed testes (or unilateral cryptorchidism) or a normal abdominal wall (or partial/unilateral laxity), referred to as pseudo-prune belly syndrome.
