Labyrinthitis is often secondary to another infection, such as otitis media or meningitis. Therefore early diagnosis and effective management of these is important to prevent (or minimize the risk of) the development of labyrinthitis or at least minimize the risk of long-term complications. It is also key that populations are up to date with their vaccinations to reduce the risk of contracting measles, mumps, or rubella.
