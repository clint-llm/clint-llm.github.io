The primary care providers and the pediatric endocrinologists should have a detailed conversation explaining the early pubertal changes even if it's a benign variant. If treatment is required, duration and the adverse effects require discussion and consideration. Apart from this, the parents should receive education on how to explain the condition to their children and families.

Educational materials for the parents are available in the Section on Endocrinology Patient Education Committee by the Pediatric Endocrine Society/American Academy of Pediatrics.
