Treatment of acute sickle cell hepatic crisis is mainly supportive, including intravenous fluids and oxygenation.

In acute hepatic sequestration, a simple transfusion can help increase hemoglobin levels; however, if there is hepatic dysfunction as evidenced by elevated INR, then an exchange transfusion is needed.

Acute intrahepatic cholestasis must be treated with aggressive supportive therapy, exchange transfusion, and fresh frozen plasma to correct the coagulopathy resulting from hepatic dysfunction. Some cases have required dialysis due to renal failure from the resulting hepatic failure.

Overt liver failure has a very poor prognosis without hepatic transplant. Zinc deficiency has also been noted in patients with high ammonia levels. It is suggested that patients with acute hepatic failure could have underlying zinc deficiency, as it is a cofactor required for the ornithine transcarbamylase enzyme in the urea cycle. Patients should be tested for zinc levels and supplemented as necessary.

Chronic hepatitis C infection can be treated with novel antiviral therapies with above 95% eradication rates. Chronic hepatitis B infection can be treated with nucleotide/nucleoside analogs.

Both deferoxamine which can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, and deferasirox, given orally, can be used to manage transfusion iron overload. Note that deferasirox can cause some hepatic dysfunction, so liver function tests should be closely monitored before starting treatment and every two weeks during the initial month and then every month. Transaminitis of unexplained etiology is likely due to the iron chelator, which must be held and re-started at a much lower dose once transaminases are within normal limits.

In acute cholecystitis, management should include broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for anaerobic organisms and Salmonella species.

Patients with sickle cell cholangiopathy are at a high risk of choledocholithiasis; they should be treated endoscopically with dilatation or stenting.

The role of liver transplantation comes into question with more severe SCH; while data is still limited, transplantation has some possible benefits depending on the patient. Patients with end-stage liver disease without neurologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal complications are good candidates for orthoptic liver transplant. Patients with liver disease such as chronic autoimmune liver disease along with SCD also benefit from transplantation. However, patients with acute hepatic crisis secondary to SCH have very high mortality after transplantation.[4]

It is challenging to predict which patient with SCH will ultimately need a liver transplant, yet, it remains an option, especially in patients with progressive sickle cell cholangiopathy. Other treatment options, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant, can potentially stop the progression of liver disease. This has been successful in matched sibling donors, however, matched unrelated donor trials have been limited because of graft-vs-host-disease. Further studies with half-matched donors in haploidentical stem cell transplants are also underway. This option, along with gene therapy and gene editing, can be greatly beneficial for this population in the future.
