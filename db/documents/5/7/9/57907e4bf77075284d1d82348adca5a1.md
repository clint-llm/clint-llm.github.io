Proper pain control should be administered for the circumcision. It should be noted that a sugar-based oral solution alone is not an adequate pain control for infants. Effective analgesia is highly dependent on the person performing the procedure. Many infants are treated with a combination of oral sucrose solutions, topical analgesics like lidocaine cream 4% (LMX-4), lidocaine/prilocaine cream, and injected analgesics such as lidocaine without epinephrine or bupivacaine.
