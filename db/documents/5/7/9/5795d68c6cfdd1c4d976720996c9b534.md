Acute otitis media can often be managed in the outpatient/clinical setting. However, it can best be served via interprofessional management through an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, family, audiologists, nurses, pharmacists, and/or speech pathologists. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment decrease the risk of complications resulting in better patient outcomes. Nurses instruct the family about medication administration, supportive care, and analgesics. They review follow-up instructions. Pharmacists instruct patients about the potential adverse effects of medication and review for drug interactions.
