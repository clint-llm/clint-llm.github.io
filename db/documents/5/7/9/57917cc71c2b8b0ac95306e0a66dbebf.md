Currently, CDT is a class 2C recommendation by the American College of Chest Physicians for the management ofÂ acute PE associated with hypotension and who have contraindications to thrombolysis, failed thrombolysis, or shock that is likely to cause death before systemic thrombolysis can take effect (e.g., within hours), and if appropriate expertise and resources are available.

**Clinical Trials**

Several large studies have investigated the use of CDT for PE. For example, the 2014 PEITHO trial showed an increase in major bleeding, including stroke, during their investigation of tenecteplase versus unfractionated heparin (UFH) in the intermediate-risk population.

Given this level of evidence, many centers pursue CDT therapy for patients with massive and intermediate-high risk submassive PE. Those patients determined to be in the intermediate low risk are not considered for thrombolytic therapy.
