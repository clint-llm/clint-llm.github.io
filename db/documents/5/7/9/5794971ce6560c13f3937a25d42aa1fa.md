Incidence rates range from 0.01% to 3.2% of patients taking neuroleptic medications. The incidence is decreasing due to newer agents, which are less likely to cause NMS, and increased awareness of the condition. Most cases occur in young adults, but this is most likely because it is the age of first exposure to neuroleptic medications rather than an age-related risk. Men outnumber women 2:1, also related to the likelihood of exposure to the causative agent. Incidence due to the withdrawal of dopaminergic drugs is more likely in the geriatric population based on the likelihood of exposure to the inciting cause.
