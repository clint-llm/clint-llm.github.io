Managing drug side effects requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists. Without proper instruction on use, capsaicin can cause burning or stinging pain to the skin and, if ingested in large amounts by adults or small amounts by children, can produce nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and burning diarrhea. Eye exposure produces intense tearing, pain, conjunctivitis, and blepharospasm. Proper use of capsaicin under interprofessional guidance can be beneficial to patient outcomes. [Level 5]
