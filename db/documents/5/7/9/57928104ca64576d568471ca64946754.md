Rituximab has an excellent safety profile, and overdosage has not been experienced in clinical trials. Patients should be regularly monitored for the development of adverse effects.

Before initiating treatment with rituximab, CBC, routine chemistries, serum immunoglobulin levels, chest X-ray, and serologic testing for hepatitis B, C, and HIV should be obtained. If HBsAg or anti-HBc is positive, HBV DNA PCR should be obtained. If HBV DNA is positive, entecavir should be given for prophylaxis. Lamivudine prophylaxis is indicated if HBV DNA is negative.

The following should be regularly monitored during the course of treatment:

- Development of infusion reactions. Acetaminophen and an antihistamine should be administered before starting the infusion to reduce the incidence of infusion reactions

- CBC to look for the development of any cytopenias

- Electrolytes and renal function in patients at high risk of tumor lysis syndrome

- Cardiac monitoring for patients with a history of cardiac disease

- Serum immunoglobulin levels

- Liver function tests and HBV DNA in patients with risk of reactivation of hepatitis B

- Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of opportunistic infections. The neurological function should be assessed to look for the onset of any new deficits.
