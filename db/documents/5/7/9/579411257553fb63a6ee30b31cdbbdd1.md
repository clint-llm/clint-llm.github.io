While considered a milder form of pemphigus, patients should still be aware of the possible complications related to IgA pemphigus. Patients placed on corticosteroid therapy shouldÂ be counseled on the adverse effects of long-term steroid therapy, including osteoporosis and adrenal insufficiency. Care should be administered to open wounds that result from the blistering process of IgA pemphigus to avoid infection and scarring. As mentioned previously, patients diagnosed with IgA pemphigus are advised to undergo screening for hematologic diseases, especially patients who are elderly and those presenting with systemic symptoms.
