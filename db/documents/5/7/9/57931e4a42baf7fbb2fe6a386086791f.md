Griseofulvin is a microtubule assembly inhibitor. It interacts with microtubules to affect the formation of the mitotic spindle. This interference ultimately inhibits mitosis in dermatophytes. With this mechanism, griseofulvin serves as a fungistatic agent against Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton species.Malassezia, Candida), or chromomycosis. Griseofulvin is quickly eliminated from the body and thus must be taken over an extended period to have efficacy.
