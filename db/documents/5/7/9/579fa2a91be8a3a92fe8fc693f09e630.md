The diagnosis and management of second-degree heart block is made by an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist, ICU nurse, and an internist. When patients are diagnosed with a heart block, an appropriate referral to a cardiologist is highly recommended.

In the emergency room type 1 Mobitz block without symptoms requires no treatment. However, symptomatic patients may be managed with atropine or transvenous pacing and a cardiology consult should be obtained. The patient must be admitted to a monitored unit.

All patients with type ll Mobitz block need admission and treatment. Nurses should be aware of this type of block and its treatment. Hypotension and bradycardia are often resistant to atropine and transvenous pacing can be life-saving. The pharmacist should ensure that the patient is on no medication that can aggravate or trigger the heart block. In addition, the patient must be educated on both types 1 and 2 heart block and their management. Close communication between the team members is vital to prevent mortality.

The prognosis for Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) is excellent. This is usually asymptomatic and requires no intervention in asymptomatic patients.

The prognosis for Mobitz type II varies based on the cause of the rhythm. Patients require placement of implanted pacemaker devices to avoid complications of Mobitz type II AV blocks such as decreased cardiac output, symptomatic bradycardia, and sudden cardiac arrest.
