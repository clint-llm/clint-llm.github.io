Leukemia is the production of abnormal white blood cells from bone marrow and lymphatic tissues. Excess production of such white blood cells affects the production of normal blood cells, which are essential to fight infections, carry oxygen, and help clot blood. Such abnormal cell production can be fast, making it acute leukemia or a relatively slower process leading to chronic leukemia. Common symptoms include recurrent infections, weight loss, fatigue, fevers, abdominal pain, and bleeding. Multiple types of leukemias are present, and they require evaluation by a hematologist for further guidance on treatment.
