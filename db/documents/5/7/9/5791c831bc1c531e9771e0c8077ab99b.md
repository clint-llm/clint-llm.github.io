Patisiran is indicated for treating polyneuropathy associated with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR) in adults. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the United States of America approved this therapeutic usage in August 2018. It is in the RNA interference therapeutics class of drugs. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with polyneuropathy associated with hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR), wild-type of transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR), and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common indications for patisiran therapy.
- Describe the dosage and administration of patisiran therapy. 
- Review the most frequently encountered adverse events associated with patisiran treatment.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional coordination and communication for patients on patisiran therapy.
