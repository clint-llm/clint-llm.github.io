In reflux esophagitis, toxic substances (gastric acid, pepsin, and bile salts) are brought in contact with esophageal mucosa causing damage to the distal esophageal mucosa and mucosal breaks that can be detected by endoscopy in 30% to 40% of these patients. The histology of reflux esophagitis is not specific, as the histologic changes may also be present in other pathologicÂ states, such as in adjacent mucosa in esophageal cancer.

- Epithelial injury and neutrophilic infiltration of the epithelium

- Changes confined to the mucosa, lamina propria, and muscularis mucosa

- Longstanding and untreated patients develop peptic strictures, chronic inflammation, and Barrett metaplasia

- Papillae proliferation of basal cells in the distal esophagus

- Dilated intercellular spaces within the squamous epithelium

In patients with NERD, dilatation of the intercellular spaces (the most consistent microscopic finding), basal hyperplasia, and papillary elongation may be present.

Eosinophilic infiltration can be present. However, eosinophilic infiltration, particularly of the proximal esophagus, is present in eosinophilic esophagitis, and these two conditions should be differentiated.

Confocal laser endomicroscopy in patients with NERD is characterized by more intrapapillary capillary loops per image than in control individuals.
