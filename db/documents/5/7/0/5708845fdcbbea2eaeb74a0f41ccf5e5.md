A nail biopsy can provide additional concrete information when it comes to diagnoses of disease. But it is far more complicated compared to skin biopsies. A punch biopsy should be performed to get a full biopsy of the nail bed, the matrix, and the folds. However, longitudinal nail biopsies provide the most accurate information. A straight incision is possible through the proximal nail fold to the hyponychium and a second incision parallel to that providing a long rectangular shaped piece of tissue contain all nail components.
