There is a lack of large evidence on the management and outcomes of tricuspid stenosis. Treatment is centered on treating underlying mechanical obstruction. Medical therapy has a limited role.

**Medical**

Loop diuretics may be useful to relieve systemic and hepatic congestion in patients with severe, symptomatic tricuspid stenosis.

Not every tricuspid stenosis case requires invasive intervention. Treatment of SLE and APLA syndrome may reduce the “coating” over the valves and chordae and reduce stenosis and regurgitation.

**Intervention**

For patients with unacceptable surgical risk and absence of tumor, thrombus, vegetation, and insignificant or mild tricuspid regurgitation, percutaneous valvotomy can be performed.

Valvotomy: Valvotomy is performed using 1, 2, or 3 balloons. While some stenosis may persist, the change in valve area causes a significant reduction in the transvalvular pressure gradient and a decrease in right atrial pressure.

Valve surgery: Tricuspid valve surgery includes repair or replacement. Repair should be attempted when reasonable. When repair is not an option, valve replacement can be done by open surgery. No differences in outcomes have been established between bioprosthetic vs. mechanical valves.

The operative mortality for isolated tricuspid stenosis is significant and increases if performed with other valvular surgery (10% and 16%, respectively).
