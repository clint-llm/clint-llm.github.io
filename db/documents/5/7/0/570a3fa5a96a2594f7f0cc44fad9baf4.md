The medical management of X-linked ichthyosis is directed at reducing scales, decreasing skin dryness, and improving skin appearance. This can be accomplished with regular bathing and the use of emollients and keratolytic agents. Petrolatum or humectant-based moisturizers should be applied to damp skin. Topical keratolytics are probably best avoided in the first 6 months of life and should be used with caution if over large body surfaces In children, given the risk of systemic absorption and its associated toxicities. In severe forms of X-linked ichthyosis, patients may benefit from the intermittent use of topical or even systemic retinoids. Substantial evidence on the efficacy of keratolytic, topical, and systemic retinoids for the treatment of mild to severe X-linked ichthyosis is limited. Patients clinically respond well to 10% to 20%  urea cream, lactic acid, and/or salicylic acid-containing moisturizers. Tazarotene, 0.05% gel, has been shown to cause marked clinical improvement in X-linked ichthyosis, while oral acitretin induced dramatic improvement in scaling and erythema. Ophthalmology examination is generally unnecessary for affected males since the punctuate corneal opacities are asymptomatic. If cryptorchidism is present, a urology consult is warranted, followed by routine monitoring for testicular carcinoma, which has only been reported in a single patient and was unrelated to cryptorchidism.
