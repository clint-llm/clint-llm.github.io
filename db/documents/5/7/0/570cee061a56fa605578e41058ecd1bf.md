The TREX1 gene consists of a single exon, and its location on chromosome 3.TREX1 encodes a protein with 314 amino acids in length, and the only known post-translational modification of TREX1 is monoubiquitination by ubiqulin1 which regulates its endoplasmic reticulum localization.

The TREX1 enzyme exists as a homodimer like many other 3' exonucleases and anchors to the endoplasmic reticulum through the carboxyl-terminus domain. It has a unique dimeric structure with a flexible region located adjacent to the active site. The symmetric and flexible dimer is responsible for the positioning of the active sites on opposite edges and facilitates DNA interactions by providing open access for DNA. The amino-terminus region of TREX1 contains the exonuclease domain, and the carboxyl-terminus region contains a hydrophobic leucine-rich sequence which is necessary for the endoplasmic reticulum localization. Although TREX1 catalytic effects are similar to Escherichia coli exonuclease X, TREX1 is only present in mammals.
