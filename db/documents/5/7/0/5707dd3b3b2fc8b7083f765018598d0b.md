The clinical presentation and symptoms will depend on the location of the tumor. CPA epidermoids may cause symptoms due to the presence of adhesions and compression of adjacent nerves, brainstem, and vascular structures. Their growth mechanism from the accumulation of keratin along the cisterns of the CPA can produce a chronic inflammatory reaction that increases their adherence to vascular and neural structures.

Patients may develop tinnitus, headaches, involuntary twitching of the face, hypesthesia of the face, diplopia, facial weakness, facial pain, seizures, visual problems, hearing deficits, or imbalance. When the tumor in the CPA compresses the trigeminal nerve or the facial nerve, symptoms similar to trigeminal neuralgia or hemifacial spasm may occur. Hydrocephalus may develop due to compression of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outlets.

Rarely, an epidermoid tumor may leak keratin into the surrounding cisterns and cause aseptic or chemical meningitis. This meningitis can also occur in the postoperative period caused by the spillage of keratin and cholesterol breakdown products into the subarachnoid space. Meningitis secondary to meningeal irritation from the keratin can also contribute to the development of hydrocephalus. The incidence of aseptic meningitis ranged from 0% to 40% but can be reduced with the use of corticosteroids during the postoperative period.
