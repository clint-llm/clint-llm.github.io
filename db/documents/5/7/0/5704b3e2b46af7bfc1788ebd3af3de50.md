The prognosis of NVG is guarded. The prognosis depends upon prompt prophylaxis or treatment of retinal ischemia. Another important factor for the visual prognosis is the control of IOP. IOP elevation is often recalcitrant to medical treatment.Â  The success rate of trabeculectomy in NVG is limited due to inflammation and hyphema. However, in the eyes which have received prior intravitreal bevacizumab injections, prior pan-retinal photocoagulation of retina, and concurrent application of mitomycin-C or 5-fluorouracil, the success rate has been reported to be higher. Though the success in the control of IOP in trabeculectomy with MMC is described to be between 62% to 82% at the end of 1 year, the success rate decreases drastically over the following years. Eyes operated on with GDD have been reported to have more successful IOP control.

Both the valved and non-valved GDDs have been reported to control the IOP effectively in eyes with NVG.
