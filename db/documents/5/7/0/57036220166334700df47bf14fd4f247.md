Local pain at the injection site is the most typical adverse reaction from medication administration. Statistically, a few (1Â to 10%) patients have developed headaches, fatigue, and chills. Other less common reactions include skin rash and nausea. Very rarely, patients also develop DVT, serum sickness, hypersensitivity reaction, and thrombosis.
