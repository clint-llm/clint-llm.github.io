Pancreatic cancer is the fourth common cause of cancer death, and its 5-year survival rate is only about 12% despite the advancement in medical care, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and molecular biology. The pancreatoduodenectomy, also known as the Whipple procedure,  is the surgical procedure of choice for the resectable and the borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.

Historically, the first pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed by Dr. Alessandro Codivilla, an Italian surgeon, in 1898 and was later modified by Dr. Walter Kausch in 1912. The surgery was then performed as a two-stage procedure, and Dr. Allen Whipple further improved it into a one-stage Whipple procedure in 1940.

Broadly, there are two types of pancreatoduodenectomies; the more extensive "classical Whipple (CW)" and the "pylorus sparing pancreatoduodenectomy (PSD)."

Moreover, the pancreaticoduodenectomy can be performed using the laparoscopic, as well as the open approach.

This article describes in detail the surgical anatomy, indications, contraindications, technical steps in the pancreaticoduodenectomy, and its clinical significance.
