Although the pathogenesis of EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcer is not fully established, it is thought to correlate with reduced levels of T cells in immunosuppressed patients leading to a reduced ability to target all EBV associated antigens. This suppression results in a proliferation of only restricted clones of EBV specific T cells when encountering the virus. In the immunocompetent individual, the cytotoxic T-cells are able to manage the EBV induced B cell proliferation and keep the virus in the dormant state. In immunosuppressed patients with EBVMCU, the immune system is only able to keep the virus in a dormant state systemically. Thus, exposure to additional immune-modulating factors at a particular site can lead to a localized EBV driven lymphoproliferation.
