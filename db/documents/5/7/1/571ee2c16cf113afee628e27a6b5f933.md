In mild and moderate cases of dental fluorosis, the prognosis is very good, with concerns and treatment being patient-led with a focus on improving aesthetics and patients being otherwise asymptomatic.

In the rarer severe cases of dental fluorosis, the structure of the dentine and enamel becomes compromised.

To produce satisfactory results in more destructive techniques such as full coverage, conventional crowns may need to be considered. If this course is taken, patients must be informed of the lifelong maintenance such restorative work requires, including the need for repair, replacement, and even the eventual loss of teeth.
