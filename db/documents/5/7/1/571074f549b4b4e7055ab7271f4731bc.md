**Drug Delivery Routes**

With age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy becoming highly prevalent, there is increasing interest in improving drug delivery methods to the retina. The current standard is the use of intravitreal injections, which offers efficient bioavailability but is highly invasive and often leads to ocular complications with repeated use. Nanomedicine is a relatively new method of drug delivery to the retina, which involves the use of bioengineered nanoparticles such as hydrogels, liposomes, and synthetic polymers to carry and deliver drugs to target tissues.
