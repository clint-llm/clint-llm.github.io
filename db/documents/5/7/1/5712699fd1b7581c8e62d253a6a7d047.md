Either for improving the nasal appearance or in order to correct functional issues, rhinoplasty can provide excellent results in experienced hands.

A good understanding of nasal function, form, and anatomy, and the use of a surgical technique that respects critical structures are vital features that the rhinoplasty surgeon must possess.

As previously mentioned, an important step is a careful selection of surgical candidates to achieve high patient satisfaction rates. It is also necessary that the patient complies with postoperative indications responsibly and communicate with the surgical team in an early manner if alarm signs or symptoms appear.

Satisfaction with rhinoplasty results can improve the patient's quality of life, measured by an improvement in the ROE scale and other scales after surgical procedure, as demonstrated by many authors over the years.
