The recommended dose of imdevimab is 600 mg along with casirivimab 600 mg. In studies, doses up to 8 g (4000 mg of each drug) have been administered without dose-limiting toxicity. In overdose situations, general supportive measures, including vitals signs and clinical status monitoring, are recommended. There is no specific antidote for toxicity due to overdose.

Pregnancy and lactation:

- Imdevimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1). Placental transfer of IgG depends on different factors such as maternal serum level of IgG and IgG subclass.

- Maternal IgG is present in breast milk. Imdevimab is a large protein molecule with a molecular weight of about 144,000 Da, so the amount in milk is probably low. It is also likely partially destroyed in the infant's gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, absorption by the infant is likely low. No information is available regarding the use of imdevimab during breastfeeding. According to the emergency use authorization, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should depend on the benefit of treatment of the mother and the benefit and risk of exposure to the infant.

- No dose adjustment is recommended for pregnant or lactating patients per emergency use authorization by the FDA (FDA 2021).
