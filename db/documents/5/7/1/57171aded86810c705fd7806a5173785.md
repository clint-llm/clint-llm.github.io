Metformin is an antidiabetic drug that is widely used and generally well tolerated. Metformin toxicity is rare with therapeutic dosing but can be severe in overdose and may include metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). Patients and clinicians need to be aware of its toxicity and factors that increase the probability of developing MALA. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of MALA and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology leading to toxicity with metformin-associated lactic acidosis.
- Review risk factors for developing metformin-associated lactic acidosis.
- Explain the evaluation process for metformin-associated lactic acidosis.
- Outline the importance of a multispecialty approach to managing and preventing metformin-associated lactic acidosis
