Treatment options include excision, laser ablation, and cryotherapy. Excision is the preferred treatment and is usually curative. Local recurrence has been documented. Large lesions should be imaged before planning treatment to determine vascularity and involvement of surrounding tissues, including underlying osseous structures. Pre-treatment embolization is vital in patients with large and multiple cylindromas to minimize intra-operative blood loss as they can be quite vascular lesions. Topical aspirin has been utilized to prevent recurrence after excision. Excision and histopathologic examination along with clinical correlation should lead to the correct diagnosis.
