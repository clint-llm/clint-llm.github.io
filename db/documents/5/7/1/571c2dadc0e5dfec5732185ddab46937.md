As previously mentioned, the first stage of labor contains a latent phase and an active phase. During the latent phase, the cervix will dilate to 6 centimeters. The latent phase tends to last longer and shows less predictability of cervical change than is observed in the active phase of labor. The cervix changes at a more rapid and predictable pace in the active phase until it reaches complete dilation (10 cm). The cervix dilates at approximately 1.2 to 1.5 centimeters per hour during the active phase, with multiparous women demonstrating more rapid cervical dilation than nulliparous.

A positive feedback loop requiring oxytocin plays a pivotal role in the progression of the first stage of labor. Oxytocin is made in the hypothalamus and released into the bloodstream by the posterior pituitary gland, where it is transported to the uterus and stimulates uterine contractions. These contractions result in the descent of the fetus, with the descending fetal head activating stretch receptors on the cervix. These cervical stretch receptors send signals to the hypothalamus via afferent nerves, stimulating the additional release of oxytocin, thereby closing the loop. This loop results in progressively intensifying contractions and dilation over time.
