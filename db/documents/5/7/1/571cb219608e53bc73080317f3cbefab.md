Inferior vena cava filters (IVC filters) are indicated as a treatment to prevent pulmonary embolism in a select group of patients that have venous thromboembolism (VTE) and absolute contraindication to anticoagulation, failure of anticoagulation, complications resulting from anticoagulation or progression of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) despite adequate anticoagulation. This activity focuses on the basic knowledge about IVC filters, with emphasis on their indications, contraindications, complications, and clinical significance. It also highlights the role of the healthcare team in managing these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of inferior vena cava filter placement.
- Outline the technique for inferior vena cava filter placement.
- Describe the potential complications and clinical significance of inferior vena cava filters.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance inferior vena cava filters and improve outcomes with their use.
