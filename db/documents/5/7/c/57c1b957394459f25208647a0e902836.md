Damage to the cervical sympathetic ganglion can cause Horner's syndrome, which is ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and facial anhidrosis. Damage to these structures can also lead to First Bite Syndrome, where the first bite of food is painful owing to autonomic dysfunction due to trauma in the deep parotid space and/or superior cervical ganglion.[4]

Any time there is neck trauma, one needs to be concerned about the viability of the phrenic nerve. If the C3, C4, or C5 ventral rami are damaged, this could interfere with the diaphragm working correctly.

Torticollis occurs when the sternocleidomastoid muscle shortens or contracts irregularly, causing a twisting of the neck opposite to the side of the abnormal muscle. This condition can occur during birth if the SCM is damaged, leading to fibrosis and shortening of the muscle fibers. It can also occur due to increased muscle tone, or dystonia, resulting from emotional stress or sudden movements.

During trauma evaluation, it is imperative to rule out any carotid dissection in the neck. Sometimes patients present with miosis, neck pain, and neurological deficits based on the involvement of the dissection. Early diagnosis permits the treatment of a major stroke and avoids eventual disability.
