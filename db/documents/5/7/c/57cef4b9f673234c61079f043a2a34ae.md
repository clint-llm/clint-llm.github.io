The definition of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy. GDM can classify as A1GDM and A2GDM. Gestational diabetes managed without medication and responsive to nutritional therapy is diet-controlled gestational diabetes (GDM) or A1GDM. On the other side, gestational diabetes managed with medication to achieve adequate glycemic control is A2GDM.

Historically, the screening for gestational diabetes consisted of assessing patients history, past medical obstetric outcomes, and family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Even though it was useful, it was not appropriate. This screening method failed to identify approximately one-half of pregnant women with GDM. In 1973 a significant study suggested the use of the 50 g 1-hour oral glucose tolerance test as a screening for gestational diabetes; this is a very reliable method for screening, and it is used for approximately 95% of obstetricians in the united states of America as a method for screening GDM during pregnancy. In 2014, the U.S preventive service task force recommended screening all pregnant women for GDM at 24 weeks of gestation.
