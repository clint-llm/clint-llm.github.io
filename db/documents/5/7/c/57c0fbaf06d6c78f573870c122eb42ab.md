The characteristic history of dysuria, urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and suprapubic pain will be common in symptomatic UTI patients. In those patients with pyelonephritis, back or flank pain, nausea, and fever or chills may also be present.

Physical examination may reveal suprapubic tenderness, in 10% to 20% of cases, and should include urine specimen for analysis. However, in most cases of uncomplicated UTI, a physical examination is unremarkable. In complicated cases or pyelonephritis, patients may present with fever, tachycardia, and/or costovertebral angle tenderness.
