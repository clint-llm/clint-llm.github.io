As conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a manifestation of a broad spectrum of diseases, rather than a disease itself, the overall management strategy must vary accordingly. Management may be curative or palliative. Nonetheless, few common strategies are likely to alleviate the finding. All hepatotoxic medications must be held while determining the potential etiology of the conjugated bilirubinemia as an ongoing toxin or drug exposure can lead to progressive liver damage and death.

Following are some management pearls for a few of the common potential etiologies:

- **Cholelithiasis**: For patients who are not a surgical candidate or refuse surgery, oral bile salts (e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid 10 mg/kg/day) or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) may be considered. Ursodeoxycholic acid reduces the biliary secretion of cholesterol, leading to the dissolution of cholesterol stones; however, once the medication is discontinued, 50% of patients experience gallstone recurrence within five years. ESWL is contraindicated in cholecystitis, biliary pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis, pregnancy, coagulopathy, and concurrent anticoagulants. The recurrence rate for gallstones after lithotripsy is 70%.

- **Pancreatic Cancer**: Chemoradiation and surgery, including the Whipple procedure, are the preferred treatment options.

- **Malignant Obstruction of the Biliary Tract**: Endoscopic stenting or endoscopic biliary drainage may relieve symptoms of hyperbilirubinemia.
