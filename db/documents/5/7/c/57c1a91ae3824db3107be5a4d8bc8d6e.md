The main advantage of amantadine is that it has a low side effect profile. The primary adverse effects of amantadine may include orthostatic hypotension, syncope, peripheral edema, dizziness, delusions, hallucinations, falls, xerostomia, and constipation. Although livedo reticularis is a less common side effect, amantadine is one of the best-known drugs to cause it. This side effect is reversible with the withdrawal of medication. Serious adverse effects include neuroleptic malignant syndrome, psychosis, suicidal ideation, and CNS depression. Central nervous system (CNS) depression requires monitoring, especially in the elderly. Providers should caution patients against activities that require physical and mental alertness, such as driving and avoid combination with other CNS depressing agents, such as alcohol. Caution with usage and dosage adjustments may be necessary for those with heart disease, seizure disorder, hepatic impairment, and renal impairment.
