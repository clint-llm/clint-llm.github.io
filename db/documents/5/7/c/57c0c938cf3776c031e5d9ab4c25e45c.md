The most common history findings for aÂ patient with gastroenteritis are as follows:

- Nausea

- Diarrhea (watery or bloody in dysentery)

- Vomiting

- Abdominal pain

- Fever (suggests an invasive organism as the cause)

On physical examination, the abdomen would be soft, but there may be voluntary guarding. Palpation may elicit mild to moderate tenderness. Fever suggests the cause is invasive pathogens. Signs of dehydration are the most important thing to look for while performing the physical examination; some cases may be alarming and help to identify that which patient needs hospitalization. The following are red flags:

- Dry mucous membranes (dry mouth)

- Decreased skin turgor

- Altered mental status

- Tachycardia

- Hypotension, orthostasis

- Bloody stools

- Recent hospitalization or antibiotics

- Age greater than 65 years

- Comorbidities such as HIV and diabetes
