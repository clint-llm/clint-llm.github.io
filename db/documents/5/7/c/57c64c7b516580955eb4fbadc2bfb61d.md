Obesity is defined as an increase in body weight when compared to height.Â To classify obesity, the standard practice is to use a Body Mass Index scale which puts weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. An individual is considered obese at BMI level of 30 except in Asian where a BMI of 27 or higher is considered obese.

Obesity is more prevalent now more than ever, and many factors come into play such as foods with high sugar and fat content, increased fast-food restaurants, modes of transportation, increased sedentary work lifestyles, and urbanization. Due to the changing environment, it is important now more than ever to implement weight prevention strategies. These strategies can vary from policy changes, increased health services, and efforts from the local community. Ultimately, these changes should target the causes of obesity which are unhealthy eating habits and lack of physical activity.
