The history and physical examination of patients with tumor lysis syndrome should be focused on the primary causes of the tumor lysis.

Time of onset of malignancy should be elicited with attention to the presence of constitutional symptoms like weight loss or anorexia.

The presence of respiratory symptoms dyspnea, orthopnea, and tachypnea can be a sign of airway compression from a primary tumor.

Urinary symptoms such as dysuria, flank pain, and hematuria

Signs and symptoms that can be associated with hypocalcemia include nausea, vomiting, seizure, tetanic spasm, and change in mental status.

Other clinical manifestations of tumor lysis syndrome include but are not limited to, syncopal attack, palpitation lethargy, pitting edema, facial edema, abdominal distention, and other sign of fluid overload.

**Physical Examination**

The physical examination should focus on the electrolyte abnormalities that are associated with tumor lysis syndrome. The physical findings associated with these abnormalities are listed below.

Hypocalcemia

- Carpal spasm

- Pedal spasm

- Tetany

- Chvostek sign

- Trousseau’s sign

- Wheezing associated with bronchospasm

- Seizure

Uremia for hyperuricemia and obstructive uropathy

- Weakness

- Lethargy

- Malaise

- Nausea

- Vomiting

- Metallic taste in the mouth

- Irritability

- Generalized pruritis

- Rales and Ronchi from volume overload

- Muffled heart sound from pericarditis secondary to uremia

- Joint pain

- Renal colicky pain

- Calcium phosphate crystal deposits in the skin

- Pruritis

- Gangrene
