- Evaluation of foot radiographs in patients with lateral foot and/or ankle pain should include an assessment ofÂ the presence and morphology of an os peroneum, particularly on oblique views.

- Correlation with past imaging and with radiographs of the contralateral side can be useful in assessing for ossicle migration, asymmetry in the setting of chronic stress injury, or whether a fragmented appearance represents a bipartite/multipartite os peroneum versus an acutely fractured ossicle.

- Abnormalities in the os peroneum are suggestive of associated peroneal tendon injury.

- There are numerous causes of lateral foot pain, with delays in diagnosis not uncommon.
