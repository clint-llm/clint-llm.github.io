The target serum concentrations for felbamate are between 30 to 60 mg/L.

Due to the increased risk of idiosyncratic reactions in the first 6 to 12 months after initiating therapy, clinical and laboratory monitoring is essential; this includes a comprehensive metabolic panel, blood counts, and hepatic function panel. Serum studies should be completed before, during, and after the completion of felbamate therapy. Blood work can be performed biweekly or less for the first 3 months of therapy and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter.
