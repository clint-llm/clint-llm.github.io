Some hospitals have Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) programs in place where a specially trained nurse completes the forensic examination. While another provider may perform the screening exam for life-threatening conditions and other injuries, the forensic evidence collection is of the sexual assault nurse examiner. Initial evidence for SANE programs has suggested improved outcomes in patient psychological recovery, treatment, evidence collection, and prosecution of cases.
