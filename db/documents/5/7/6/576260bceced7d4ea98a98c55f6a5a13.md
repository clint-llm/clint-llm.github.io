Atypical hyperplasia cannot be identified on imaging but can be found on histopathologic examination of breast biopsy or excisions performed for other mammographic findings such as calcifications or other worrisome lesionsÂ seen on imaging. Atypical hyperplasia is less likely to be the primary finding on histopathologic examination if a biopsy is performed for a large symptomatic or palpable breast mass or lesion. Women should be encouraged to undergo mammogram screening evaluation and breast exams at the currently recommended intervals according to their risk stratification.
