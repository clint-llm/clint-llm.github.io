Forearm splinting is done by many healthcare professionals that includes the emergency department physician, orthopedic surgeon, therapist, primary care provider, orthopedic nurse and the urgent care physician.Â Forearm splinting is an excellent way to immobilize the forearm to help alleviate pain, stabilize injuries, prevent further damage to bones, muscles, nerves and/or arteries, and prevents a closed fracture from becoming an open one. Furthermore, due to the non-circumferential nature of the splint, as opposed to a cast, it can allow for soft tissue swelling and can be easily removed by the clinician to evaluate any wounds beneath.
