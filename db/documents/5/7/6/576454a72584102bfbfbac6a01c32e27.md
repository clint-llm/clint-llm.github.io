The general indications for upper extremity peripheral nerve blocks are surgical anesthesia and postoperative pain management for surgeries involving the upper arm or forearm. In addition, each upper extremity block has its indications based on the location of the surgery.

The interscalene nerve block is typically indicated for shoulder surgery but is insufficient for surgeries distal to the elbow. The supraclavicular nerve block is particularly useful as it encompasses the entire arm. The infraclavicular and axillary nerve blocks are indicated for surgeries involving the elbow and distal to the elbow, respectively.

When properly performed, none of the brachial plexus blocks will cover the upper medial portion of the upper extremity proximal to the elbow. To block this region, an intercostobrachial nerve block must be performed as an adjunct to a brachial plexus block.
