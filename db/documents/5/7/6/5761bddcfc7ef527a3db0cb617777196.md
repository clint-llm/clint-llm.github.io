The two most common causes of splenic infarct are thromboembolic disease and infiltrative hematologic diseases. In patients under 40 years of age, the most common cause is a hematologic disease.

- blood borne malignancy (leukemia, lymphoma), myelofibrosis

- hypercoagulable states (sickle cell disease, protein C, and S, polycythemia vera, lupus anticoagulant, exogenous estrogen use, malignancy)

- thromboembolic disorders (atrial fibrillation, endocarditis, patent foramen ovale, prosthetic heart valves)

- blunt abdominal trauma

- pancreatic disorders (pancreatitis, compressive pancreatic masses)

Additionally, broad categories of autoimmune and collagen vascular diseases, as well as the "wandering spleen," have been noted inÂ case reports of the splenic infarct.
