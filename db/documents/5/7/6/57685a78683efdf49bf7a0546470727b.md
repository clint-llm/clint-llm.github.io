Preparation and patient positioning depend largely on the target location and the implicated nerve. Access to all necessary personnel and equipment should be verified. Room temperature gas should be purged from the system. Sedation is rarely required, and heavy sedation should be avoided to facilitate patient localization of stimuli. Appropriate informed consent should be obtained. The patient should be positioned comfortably. A pre-procedural pause and time-out is then performed, identifying correct patient, side, site, and allergies. Aseptic technique should be observed.
