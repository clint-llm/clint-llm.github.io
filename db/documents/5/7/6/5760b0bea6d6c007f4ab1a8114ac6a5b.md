Evaluation of a patient with suspected valproate intoxication, collecting the information about the exact time of the ingestion, the formulation of the valproate, the amount ingested, and any other possible coingestants such as OTC medications or alcohol, and any prior psychiatric or medical problems they may have.

Patients with acute ingestion of 200mg/kg or having serum concentrations greater than 180 mg/L often result in central nervous system dysfunction. Neurological manifestations include tremors and agitation. Miosis may be present on pupillary examination. Cerebral edema can be present along with other focal neurological deficits. Valproate-related hyperammonemic encephalopathy may present with confusion, seizures, and lethargy, which may progress to stupor, coma, and death. Vital signs abnormalities such as respiratory depression, hypotension, and tachycardia may occur. Gastrointestinal manifestation includes vomiting, diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, and pancreatitis.

Dermatohistopathology of valproate toxicity has shown correlations with cases of hypersensitivity vasculitis and psoriasiform eruption. Patients on chronic valproate therapy can present with alopecia due to telogen effluvium evident by diffuse hair loss, thinning, and greying of hair.
