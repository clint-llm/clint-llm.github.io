The pharynx extends from the posterior nasal and oral cavity to the cricoid cartilage before blending into the esophagus. The outer circular layer consists of the superior, middle, and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscles. These constrictor muscles originate from bones and cartilage anteriorly and insert posteriorly to a tendinous seam called the pharyngeal raphe. The superior pharyngeal constrictor contract to narrow its lumen to assist with bolus transport as well as seal the nasopharynx to prevent food from going up â€” the middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictors contract to narrow its lumen to assist with bolus transport. The palatopharyngeus, salpingopharyngeus, and stylopharyngeus muscles are the inner longitudinal muscles that contract to raise the pharynx and larynx. These muscles work together to help move food bolus from the oral cavity into the esophagus.
