Cystic teratomas are usually asymptomatic or can have minimal symptoms. Various studies have reported asymptomatic tumor rates to be 6-65% at the time of diagnosis. They are often discovered as an incidental finding on radiographic studies, during a physical exam or pelvic/abdominal surgery for any other pathology. The next most common symptom reported at the time of presentation is lower abdominal pain with a reported rate of 44 to 47%, followed by palpable abdominal or pelvic mass.

Some patients present with increasing abdominal girth. Gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms can develop with increasing tumor size causing compression or invasion of the adjacent structures. Symptoms like fever, cachexia, severe abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding can also occur in advanced disease.

In the case of ovarian torsion, one of the most common complications of cystic teratoma, the patient presents with an acute abdomen (sudden abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting), requiring urgent management. On physical examination, bimanual palpation of the ovaries to determine the presence or absence of adnexal masses, uterus size, and abdominal tenderness should be assessed. Therefore, a detailed history with more emphasis on gynecological history and a thorough physical exam, abdominal and pelvic exam, in particular, plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and management of a patient presenting with the above symptoms.
