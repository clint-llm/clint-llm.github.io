We will discuss right ventricular hypertrophy further with regards to the development of pulmonary hypertension or significant TR.

The most common etiology of right ventricular hypertrophy is severe lung disease. The disorders that induce pulmonary hypertension and secondary right ventricular hypertrophy include the following (Table 1):

- Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)

- Pulmonary hypertension owing to left heart disease

- Pulmonary hypertension from lung disease and/or hypoxia

- Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)

- Pulmonary hypertension with unclear multifactorial mechanisms

Causes of primary TR include:

Direct valve injury secondary to cardiac instrumentation, chest trauma, Ebstein anomaly, rheumatic fever, infective and marantic endocarditis, right ventricular ischemia/infarction, tricuspid valve prolapse, connective tissue disorder, carcinoid syndrome and drug-induced TR.

Other less common causes of right ventricular hypertrophy are high altitude, left to right shunt, an atrial septal defect, a ventricular septal defect, anomalous pulmonary venous return, Eisenmenger syndrome, stenosis of the pulmonic valve or pulmonary artery, hyperthyroidism, cardiac fibrosis and cardiomyopathy affecting RV, and athlete heart syndrome.
