- Subfalcine herniation is noted in many conditions that cause an increase in one of the three integral compartments within the skull:

- Increased brain volume due to tumor, hemorrhage, or edema
- Increased cerebral spinal fluid volume due to hydrocephalus
- Increased blood volume due to increased cerebral blood flow

- Subfalcine herniation may present with very subtle clinical signs and symptoms.

- Subtle clinical changes in patients with subfalcine herniation must be taken seriously to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.

- Subfalcine herniation can progress to uncal or central herniation syndromes.

- Subfalcine herniation can be identified by stringent clinical monitoring and neuroimaging.
