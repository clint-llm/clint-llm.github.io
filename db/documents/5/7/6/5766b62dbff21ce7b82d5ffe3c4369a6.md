Herpetic whitlow is most commonly mistaken for paronychia (a localized bacterial abscess in the nail fold) or bacterial felon (digital pulp abscess).

Other diagnoses on the differential include herpes zoster infections, which will involve the whole dermatome of the hand, and rarely, primary cutaneous Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection and Mycobacterium marinum infection.
