If fontanelles are not fused, neurosonogram (NSG) through the anterior fontanelle will demonstrate an echogenic lesion within the ventricles. This lesion continues to demonstrate bidirectional flow throughout the diastole, indicating blood flow through vessels arranged chaotically. Sometimes, the lesions are diagnosed antenatally by using ultrasound scans.

Computerized tomography (CT) shows an isodense or slightly hyperdense lesion within the ventricles along with consequent ventriculomegaly.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals the well–defined, frond-like intraventricular lobulated masses, which are hypointense on T1WI  and hyperintense on T2WI.
