Patients with pelvic ring injuries should be counseled on the long-term sequelae associated with pelvic ring injuries, especially in the presence of concomitant injuries. Many patients suffer permanent disability, which can take a financial, mental, and physical toll on the patient. The support of a full interdisciplinary team is necessary to help patients rehab and address their disabilities appropriately.
