There are many muscles involved in the movement of the hip joint, these include (in alphabetical order) the:

- Adductor longus, brevis, and magnus

- Gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus

- Gracilis

- Hamstring muscles: semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and the biceps femoris

- Iliacus

- Obturator

- Pectineus

- Piriformis

- Psoas major

- Quadriceps muscles: rectus femoris, vastus intermedius, vastus lateralis, and vastus medialis

- Quadratus femoris

- Sartorius

- Tensor fascia latae

The blood supply to these muscles derives from the same major vessels that supply the hip joint. The MFCA supplies the adductor group, gracilis, and pectineus. The LFCA supplies the vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and rectus femoris. The vastus medialis gets its blood supply from the superficial femoral artery as well as the deep femoral artery. The perforating arteries of the profunda femoris give vascular supply to the hamstring muscles.
