The anterior mediastinum is the most common location of extragonadal germ cell tumors constituting approximately 50 to 70% of all cases.

Most mediastinal germ cell tumors are found incidentally in imaging studies. At the time of diagnosis, approximately 20% to 40% of patients are asymptomatic. Generally, initial symptoms are associated with the enlargement of the mediastinal cavity and protrusion into surrounding structures. Common clinical symptoms include chest pain, cough, dyspnea, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Manifestations are dependent on the size of the tumor and its histological subtype. Treatment involves either surgical resection or cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by surgical resection depending on the histological subtype.
