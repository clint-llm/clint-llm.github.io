Cisplatin acts via non-cell cycle-specific cytotoxicity, which is achieved through the covalent binding of platinum to the purine bases guanine and adenine. This covalent binding leads to intra-strand and inter-strand crosslinks causing subsequent strand breaks. While DNA repair mechanisms are at play, cells often undergo apoptotic or non-apoptotic cell death due to remnant damaged DNA, RNA, and proteins.

The drug is primarily excreted in the urine, with 10% in the bile. Its initial half-life is approximately 20 to 30 minutes, with a terminal half-life of 24 hours. ALbumin-bound platinum undergoes slow administration of minimally five days.
