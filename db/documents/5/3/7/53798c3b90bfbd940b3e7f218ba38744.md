Tetracycline antimicrobials are administrable either orally or intravenously.

While erythromycin administration is possible via the IV route, the most common formulation of macrolide antimicrobials is in oral dosage forms.

Clindamycin is nearly completely absorbed orally. However, it has a relatively short half-life, requiring dosing every 6 hours.

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole has available formulations on the market in both oral and intravenous forms; however, due to its indications, it is nearly universally encountered in its oral formulation.

Linezolid has nearly 100% absorption orally and may be given orally or intravenously, depending on the clinical setting.
