Proper equipment is necessary for the femoral nerve block procedure. Sterile protocol with antiseptic solution (such as chlorhexidine scrub), sterile gloves, face mask, and hospital cap, should be maintained. A 20- or 22-gauge, 50- to 100-mm, short-bevel, insulated needle (that may be stimulating and/or echogenic), lidocaine 1% with a 25 gauge needle to anesthetize at the insertion site, and 20 mL syringe for local anesthetic would be part of a standard nerve block kit. For an ultrasound-guided technique, an ultrasound machine with a linear transducer, sterile ultrasound probe cover, insulated needle, and ultrasound gel are all requirements. Local anesthetic options may include long-acting amide agents, such as bupivacaine 0.5%, levobupivacaine 0.5%, or ropivacaine 0.5%, or intermediate-acting amide agents, such as mepivacaine 0.5% or lidocaine 0.5%.
