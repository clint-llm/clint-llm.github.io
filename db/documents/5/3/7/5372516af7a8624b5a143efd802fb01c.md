The incidence of pyocytis rose following the introduction of supravesical urinary diversion procedures in the 1960s. Reported cases prior to this were rare. The incidence of pyocytis in patients with end-stage renal disease is unclear in the published literature, but it is a known complication secondary to anuria in this patient cohort.

Pyocystis resulting from iatrogenic bladder defunctioning is more common than from end-stage renal failure.

Culturing of proteus mirabilis in the urine prior to supravesical diversion has been implicated with higher risks of developing pyocystis.

Pyocystis is also described as empyema cystis and vesical empyema, though these terms are infrequently used and often used in older descriptions of the condition.
