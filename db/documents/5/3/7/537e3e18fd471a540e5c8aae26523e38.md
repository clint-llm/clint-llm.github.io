A literature review performed by Miller et al.; determined the most commonly reported adverse events occurring in >5% of subjects during clinical trials with romosozumab were arthralgia and headache.

Several trials found increased cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events associated with using romosozumab.

While these two trials indicated differences in cardiovascular events, two other trials, the FRAME, and STRUCTURE, found no difference between the romosozumab and placebo groups regarding the rate of cardiovascular events. However, due to the increase in reported cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in the ARCH and BRIDGE trials, it is recommended not to use romosozumab in patients who have had a myocardial infarction or stroke in the past year. Further, evaluating the benefits versus risks in patients with CV risk factors is recommended on a per-patient basis.

Other reported adverse events associated with using romosozumab were osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femur fracture.

Furthermore, there were two reported cases of atypical fracture of the femur in the ARCH trial and one reported case in the FRAME trial in the romosozumab treatment groups.
