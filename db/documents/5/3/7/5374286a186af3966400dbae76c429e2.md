Bursae are fluid-filled sacs that produce small amounts of synovial fluid to reduce friction between mobile structures of the musculoskeletal system. Inflammation of the bursa due to prolonged pressure, overuse, trauma or arthritis, causes excess fluid production and leads to swelling and irritation, known as bursitis. Septic (or infectious) bursitis occurs when infection from either direct inoculation, hematogenous or direct spread from other sites causes inflammatory bursitis. Bursa aspiration and fluid analysis must be completed to make an accurate diagnosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of septic bursitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team to improve care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of septic bursitis.
- Describe the work up of a patient with septic bursitis.
- Summarize the treatment options for septic bursitis.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to detect the condition using bursa aspiration and fluid analysis to enhance the delivery of care in patients with septic bursitis.
