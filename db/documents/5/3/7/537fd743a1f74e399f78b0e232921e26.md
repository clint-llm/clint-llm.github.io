Many viruses could be responsible for causing viral arthritis, the most common being Parvovirus, alphavirus, rubella, Hepatitis B, C, and flavivirus. Some other viruses can also cause arthritis/arthralgia rarely. These are EBV, HIV, mumps, herpes, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Recently, there has been an increase in the occurrence of mosquito-borne virus-related arthropathies, such as the ones associated with Zika and CHIKV.Â  Occasionally, the virus causing arthritis could be related to the patient's comorbidities. For example, EBV causing viral arthritis in patients on immunosuppressive agents.

HIV-induced arthritis is more common than once believed. It may be the first presentation in at least 30% of HIV patients; however, it can occur at any stage of the viral illness. These patients are not at risk for developing septic arthritis, but they may be at risk for pyomyositis. In addition, some patients may develop reactive arthritis and even psoriatic arthritis.
