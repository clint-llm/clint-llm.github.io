Routine blood tests are not usually indicated in simple pinna perichondritis. However, if there is an extended area of swelling, an abscess, or necrosis, blood tests should be obtained, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, c-reactive protein, blood cultures, and coagulation screen. This should also form part of a sepsis screen in an unstable patient.

Microbiology swabs should be taken of the affected area and any discharge present.

Imaging is not indicated unless there is a suspicion of intracranial pathologies, such as an abscess.
