Clinicians usually perform the thyroid uptake and scan in the outpatient setting. The patient should be prepared well for this as certain foods and medications interfere with radiotracer uptake in the thyroid gland. The patient can be allergic to the radiotracer, so careful evaluation is necessary. If a patient is taking antithyroid medications such as methimazole or propylthiouracil, they should receive instructions to hold these medications for at least five days. Prior studies of the thyroid gland and baseline TSH and free T4 levels are necessary before the test. In thyroid cancer patients, thyroglobulin and thyroglobulin antibodies may also need to be checked.

Radiotracer is given to the patient intravenously or orally. The timing of radiotracer administration before the scan varies according to the route. The patients are asked to take oral radiotracer 24 hours before the scan, or they are injected with radiotracer 30 minutes before the scan. Sodium iodide symporters located on the cells of the thyroid gland are responsible for uptaking radioactive iodine. The patient will then lie down on the movable examination table, and the gamma camera takes serial images of the thyroid gland from three different angles. The patient should lie still at the time of capturing images. The clinical history, thyroid examination, and the thyroid function tests, all merit consideration while interpreting the results of this test.
