Porcelain gallbladder refers to the condition in which the inner gallbladder wall is encrusted with calcium. The wall becomes brittle, hard, and often takes on a bluish hue. It is usually found incidentally on plain abdominal x-rays or other imaging because most patients are asymptomatic. The extent of gallbladder wall involvement varies from the presence of a single calcified plaque adhered to the mucosal layer to total full-thickness replacement of the tissue of the entire gallbladder wall with calcium. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of porcelain gallbladder and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of porcelain gallbladder.
- Describe the pathophysiology of porcelain gallbladder.
- Summarize the treatment options for porcelain gallbladder.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by porcelain gallbladder.
