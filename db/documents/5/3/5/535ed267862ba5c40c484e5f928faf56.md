Hemolytic uremic syndrome is most often associated with a gastrointestinal illness; thus, patients presenting early in the course of the disease will complain of fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Diarrhea is often bloody and is within 3 days of diarrhea onset. Bloody diarrhea that ensues can be secondary to colitis from the invasion of the gastrointestinal cells or ischemia related to a vascular lesion. After a week of such gastrointestinal symptoms, patients may start toÂ develop symptoms more closely related to the triad that defines HUS: specifically, symptoms related to anemia (syncope, shortness of breath, and jaundice) and kidney impairment (oliguria/anuria, hematuria). The skin exam may show small ecchymosis and mucosal bleeding. Late in the course of the infection, patients may develop seizures and encephalopathy related to ongoing uremia and other electrolyte derangements. In rare cases, the colitis can be severe enough to cause intestinal necrosis and perforation.

In atypical HUS, a gastrointestinal illness is not usually the initial insult, and a thorough history and physical is required to find the offending agent. If S. pneumoniae is the source, the patient may site a recent respiratory illness. A review of any new medications or chronic autoimmune diseases is necessary. These patients typically have decreased urine output, pallor, and scattered ecchymosis.
