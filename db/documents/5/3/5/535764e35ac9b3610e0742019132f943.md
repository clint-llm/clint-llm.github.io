Interprofessional communication and care coordination amongst physicians (surgeons, anesthesiologists, hospitalists, endocrinologists, primary care providers), nurses, pharmacists, nutritionists & diabetes educators play a vital role in the optimal management of diabetes in the perioperative period. Adequate communication helps minimizes adverse events, improves clinical outcomes, and patient satisfaction. It is essential to formulate a structured plan tailored to individual patient needs. Implementation of standardized protocols and computerized algorithms by hospitals is instrumental in reducing errors and providing quality care.

A safe transition from inpatient to outpatient setting is a crucial component of diabetes management. The discharge plan should include medication reconciliation, patient education with a doctor, pharmacist, or nurse with specialty training in diabetes education, evaluation of socioeconomic issues, and communication with an outpatient provider. Should the pharmacist have concerns after the medication reconciliation, it should be addressed with the team. The diabetic nurse educator should make sure both the patient and family understand the outpatient management plan. Again, if there are concerns over the potential lack of understanding or follow-up, it should be reported to the interprofessional team and addressed. A follow-up visit with the primary care provider or endocrinologist within one month of discharge is advisable for all patients. An earlier appointment within 1 to 2 weeks is preferred if there has been a change in medications, or glycemic control is not optimal at the time of discharge. Patients should receive prescriptions, drugs, and necessary medical equipment to help bridge care with their outpatient follow-up visits, and a coordinated interprofessional strategy is the best means to achieve this.
