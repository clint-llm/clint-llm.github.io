As with most procedures, the preparation is crucial for obtaining US-guided IV access. This may vary depending on whether a peripheral or central vein is being attempted. Universal precautions always should be observed to decrease the risk of infection transmission.

Prior to starting the procedure, discuss with the patient what will occur to help relieve anxiety. Consent can be obtained if time permits.

The following materials should be available at the bedside: IV starting kit (tourniquet band, appropriate length IV catheter, antiseptic solution), IV flushes/saline lock, ultrasound with the high-frequency linear probe, sterile gel, and sterile probe cover. For peripheral IV access, a thin adhesive dressing such as Tegaderm may be used to cover the ultrasound probe.

Common sites when performing US-guided IV access include the superficial veins of the hand and forearm, antecubital fossa, external jugular vein, or the deeper basilic, brachial, or cephalic veins of the upper arm. When identifying the deep upper arm veins, the easiest approach is usually from the medial side of the arm. For central IV access, sites include femoral, subclavian, or internal jugular.
