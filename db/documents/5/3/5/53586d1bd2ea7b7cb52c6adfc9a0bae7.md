The female breast is located on the anterior chest wall inferior to the clavicle with the sternum medially and the edge of the latissimus dorsi muscle laterally.  The inferior border is the inframammary fold (IMF)  also referred to as the inframammary ligament. This fold is a dermal structure formed by the fusion of the superficial and mammary fascia. The pectoralis major and minor muscles form the posterior or bottom boundary of the breast with the breast parenchyma superior. The blood supply is from the subdermal plexus of vessels with major contributions from the internal mammary artery, the external mammary artery, and the intercostal perforators. The major nerve supply is via the intercostal plexus with most contributions from the third through fifth intercostal nerves.
