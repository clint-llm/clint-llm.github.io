The diagnosis of PS is mainly clinical. A provisional diagnosisÂ is made based on the presence of craniosynostosis and brachysyndactyly, along with the features already described. Suspected children require genetic testing and mutation analysis of FGFR1 (exon 7), FGFR2 (exons 8 and 10), and FGFR 3 (exon7).

Sonographic signs of PS include craniofacial anomalies such as brachycephaly, acrocephaly, craniosynostosis, hypertelorism, small nose, and low nasal bridge, and hand and feet anomalies such as syndactyly, broad thumb, and big toe.
