The specific frequency of agranulocytosis is unknown; It is estimated to be 1.0 to 3.4 cases per million people annually. Neutropenia was particularly associated with HIV infection, acute leukemias, and myelodysplastic syndromes. Drug-induced neutropenia has an incidence of one case per million persons per year. About 50% of patients with febrile neutropenia will develop an infection, of which 20% with profound neutropenia will observe bacteremia.

Gram-positive bacteria have now become the most common pathogens causing febrile neutropenia.Staphylococcus aureus (particularly methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (particularly vancomycin-resistant strains), and some viridans streptococci can cause serious infections.
