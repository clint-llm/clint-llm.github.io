With the widespread use of imaging modalities, health care providers are now more likely to encounter patients with cardiac calcifications. The use of cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is usually pursued by the cardiologist and is helpful both in the diagnosis, management, and prognosis of patients who are at intermediate risk or ASCVD.

Moreover, the CAC score can be combined with the other traditional risk score for a better prediction of ASCVD events in patients. This can help us in controlling the risk factors aggressively and also guide in prescribing the statin medication.

Valvular calcification is an age-related mechanism that is potentiated by the disturbance in calcium homeostasis. It ultimately results in valvular stenosis. For severe or symptomatic valvular stenosis, valve replacement is offered. It can either be percutaneous or surgical and is based on a patientâ€™s age, comorbidities, frailty, and presence of other surgical risk factors.

Pericardial calcifications on chest imaging suggest a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis when supported by signs and symptoms and other definitive tests. Myocardial calcifications diffusely involve the myocardium and have an unclear treatment or prognostic value.
