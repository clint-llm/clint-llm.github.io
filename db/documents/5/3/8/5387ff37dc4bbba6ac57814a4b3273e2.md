Ensuring that individual patients and the entire population understand bone health and the benefits of proper calcium intake and nutrition requires interprofessional collaboration. At the clinical level, providers must collaborate to accurately identify patients with varying risks of poor bone health and emphasize high-risk patients. Clinicians must also collaborate to ensure healthy and young patients receive education on the importance and long-term health benefits of adequate calcium intake. Interprofessional collaboration also allows clinicians and other providers to educate one another, ensuring adherence to the best evidence-based practice guidelines.

A recent randomized prospective trial (level I evidence) assessed the efficacy of an interprofessional educational intervention to improve osteoporosis management.

At theÂ public health level, interprofessional collaboration is essential for promoting population health and nutrition. One such example is the continuing effort to fortify various fruit juices and grains with calcium and vitamin D, thereby targeting young patients who have not reached peak bone mass.
