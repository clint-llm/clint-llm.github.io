Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a systemic disorder that can affect many organ systems and hence an interprofessional team approach is recommended to avoid the morbidity.

- Rheumatologist to evaluate and manage the acute symptoms and address any coexisting spondyloarthropathies.

- Gastroenterologist to assess for inflammatory bowel disease

- Ophthalmologist to assess for anterior uveitis

- Cardiologist to assess for heart block or valvular involvement

- Physical therapy to help with function

- Neurologist to assess for nerve compression syndromes

- Pharmacist to monitor for drug interactions and dependence on analgesics

- Nurse to educate the patient on the management of daily living activities

There are many reports indicating that an interprofessional approach to ankylosing spondylitis can improve function, lower pain and increase the quality of life.

**Evidence-based Medicine**

Meta-analysis of many studies has revealed that those who participate in an exercise program have a much better outcome than those who lead a sedentary lifestyle. (Level II) Unfortunately, those patients with large symptom burden at the time of diagnosis usually have poor response rates and are often lost to follow up. One way to retain these patients is by starting an education program early in the disease.
