Typical angina affects over 10 million people in the United States. The presentation can vary from chest pressure to fatigue to shortness of breath to nausea. If this ultimately leads to myocardial infarction or unstable angina, the cardiology team is imperative in treatment; however, there are often many providers that will see this individual before that evolution. It is important to utilize an interprofessional team to best suit each patient. The primary care provider will play a large role in primary and secondary prevention, likely for many years prior to the development of symptoms. This provider may also recruit the help of a nutritionist, diabetic educator, addiction counselor, and physical and occupational therapy to help with modifying risk factors. The use of an interdisciplinary team is recommended to optimize patient outcomes.
