The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) has defined the staging of oropharyngeal cancer. This follows a TNM staging system where T relates to the extent of the primary tumor, N indicates the involvement of regional lymph nodes, and M specifies the distant metastasis. In their 8th edition of the staging manual, AJCC has modified the staging system being used for staging of oropharyngeal cancer with the addition of depth of invasion (DOI) of the primary tumor as a modification to the T category and extranodal extension (ENE) to upstage node-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma

**Staging of Human Papillomavirus-Associated (p16-Positive) Oropharyngeal Cancer**

**Primary Tumor (T)**

- T0-Primary tumor cannot be assessed

- T1-Tumor smaller than 2cm in greatest dimension

- T2-Tumor larger than 2cm but smaller than 4cm in greatest dimension

- T3-Tumor larger than 4cm or extension to the lingual surface of epiglottis

- T4-Moderately advanced local disease; tumor invades the larynx, extrinsic muscle of tongue, medial pterygoid, hard palate, or mandible or beyond

- T4a-Moderately advanced local disease; tumor invades the larynx, extrinsic muscle of tongue, medial pterygoid, hard palate, or mandible

- T4b-Very advanced local disease; tumor invades lateral pterygoid muscle, pterygoid plates, lateral nasopharynx, or skull base or encases carotid artery

**Regional Lymph Nodes (N)**

- NX-Regional lymph nodes cannot be assessed

- pN0-No regional lymph node metastasis

- pN1-Metastasis in 4 or fewer lymph nodes

- pN2-Metastasis in more than four lymph nodes

**Metastasis (M)**

- M0-No distant metastasis

- M1-Distant metastasis

- Tis-Carcinoma in situ

- T1-Tumor 2 cm or smaller in greatest dimension

- T2-Tumor larger than 2 cm but not larger than 4 cm in greatest dimension

- T3-Tumor larger than 4 cm in greatest dimension or extension to the lingual surface of epiglottis

- T4-Moderately advanced or very advanced local disease

- T4a-Moderately advanced local disease; tumor invades the larynx, extrinsic muscle of tongue, medial pterygoid, hard palate, or mandible

- T4b-Very advanced local disease; tumor invades lateral pterygoid muscle, pterygoid plates, lateral nasopharynx, or skull base or encases carotid artery

**Regional lymph nodes (N)**

- N0-No regional lymph node metastasis

- N1-Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node, 3 cm or smaller in greatest dimension and ENE-negative

- N2-Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node larger than 3 cm but not larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE-negative; or metastases in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE-negative; or metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE-negative

- N2a-Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node larger than 3 cm but not larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE-negative

- N2b-Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE-negative

- N2c-Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none larger than 6 cm in greatest dimension and ENE-negative
