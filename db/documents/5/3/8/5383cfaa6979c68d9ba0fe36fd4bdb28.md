Cardiac output is dependent on the heart as well as the circulatory system- veins and arteries. CO is the product of heart rate (HR) by stroke volume (SV), the volume of blood ejected by the heart with each beat. Thus, the heart can directly alter CO. However, the arterial compliance, vasoconstriction, and arterial pressure (afterload) directly affect the volume of blood able to leave the heart (SV), and thus also affect CO.  Last, since the circulatory system is a closed-loop, CO is dependent on the volume of blood entering the heart from the veins, or venous return VR. The venous return also depends on the central venous pressure, which in turn is altered by venoconstriction. One has to recall that about 60% of the blood is stored in the capacitance vessels, and can alter the volume of blood returning to the heart.
