Due to the progression risk of disseminated gonococcal infection, neonates with GC should be approached as emergent cases that warrant admission and observation. The most effective treatment of GC is prevention, and it is recommended that females be screened for gonorrhea and other STIs if considered high-risk (prior history of STI, commercial sex workers) and should be appropriately treated. Nevertheless, cases of neonatal GC can occur even with appropriate prophylactic measures. Below is a summary of the recommended therapies.

**Neonatal Prophylaxis**

- Erythromycin (0.5%) ophthalmic ointment, or

- Tetracycline (1%) ophthalmic ointment

**Symptomatic or High-Risk**(mother with untreated gonorrhea) neonate

- Ceftriaxone (25 mg/k to 50 mg/kg, max 125 mg intravenously (IV) or  intramuscularly (IM), single dose, or

- Cefotaxime (100 mg/kg IV/IM), single dose, which may be preferred if available due to the risk of increasing bilirubin levels associated with ceftriaxone

- Hourly saline lavage

**Non-Neonate with Symptoms**(generally, can be managed on an outpatient basis)

- Ceftriaxone (1 gm IM), single dose, and

- Azithromycin (1 gm oral), single dose, which is added on due to the frequent co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis

- Saline lavage can be considered but is not a necessity
