Poliovirus is primarily spread via fecal-oral contamination, but oral-oral spread is also possible. Primary infection can lead to viral replication in oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal lymphatic tissues. Maximum viral excretion begins 2 to 3 days before symptoms start and continue for an additional one week.

The spread of the virus to the CNS is poorly understood. If this does occur, the virus may cause anterior horn neuronal death resulting in a physical exam consistent with intact sensation and pure motor deficits.
