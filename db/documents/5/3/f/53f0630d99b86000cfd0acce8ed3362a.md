Pain can usually be managed according to the WHO pain ladder with paracetamol (acetaminophen), initially alongside non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), provided there are no contra-indications. If this fails to control the pain, then weak opioids such as codeine can be introduced before progressing to stronger opioids such as morphine. These may be indicated in the initial post-operative period.
