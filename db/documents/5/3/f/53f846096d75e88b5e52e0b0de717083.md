The word "drug" has a very loose interpretation underneath the FDCA, which involves any article designed to treat illness or alter the structure or function of the human body. Various legal clashes may derive from such interpretations.

- Depending on its desired use, a cosmetic may be classified as a drug, and courts would most possibly use the naive, unthinking market criterion to make this decision.

- A few items are both cosmetics and medications.

- Foods are not classified in Part C of the substance specification, which raises the question of what constitutes food for the objectives of Part C.

- If they are sold to fulfill specific health requirements and can be prescription only, foods that come in the category of "limited nutritional foods" or "medical foods" are not considered medications.

- If food makes disease or health claims, this could be a drug whether the claim is authorized by FDA regulation or by "significant scientific agreement."

- Dietary supplements were described and developed by the DSHEA as a distinct product category.

- Without violating Part C of the medication definition, a substance that fits the legal description of a dietary supplement can make four kinds of nutritional support claims.

- Since the claim meets the substantial scientific consensus requirement, a substance that fits the legal meaning of a dietary supplement could create an "unqualified" health or disease claim without classifying a drug if the FDA accepts the claim via regulation.

- Even if the argument does not satisfy the substantial scientific consensus test, a substance that fits the legal meaning of a dietary supplement could make a "qualified" health or disease claim if it is not deceptive.

- If the dietary supplement was authorized before the prescription, dietary supplement products containing medications are almost certainly drugs.

- As the ephedra product case shows, the FDA will only take a dietary supplement off the market if it can claim it is diluted, which means it poses a severe or unfair risk of disease or accident under the DHSEA.

- The 2006 Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act mandates dietary supplement and nonprescription medication distributors to warn of severe side effects.

- DSHEA is now under criticism for preventing the FDA from testing dangerous goods before market introduction and making it extremely difficult for the regulator to withdraw hazardous items from the market.

- Since 2007, the FDA has mandated that dietary supplements follow the Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) to avoid misbranding and spoilage and determine the identification, authenticity, consistency, weight, and composition of their drugs. The FDA, on the other hand, has no power to test medications until they are marketed.

- The line between product and medication can overlap. For example, a device may be classified as a drug depending on its intended use; however, the MDA usually grants the FDA some power to control devices without going too far.

- The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and the Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS) are official compendia under the FDCA.

- The USP establishes drug regulations, and the HPUS regulates homeopathic products.Â 
- Homeopathic drug products will be subject to risk-based preference compliance by the FDA.
