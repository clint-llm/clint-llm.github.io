Meningitis occurs when bacteria enter the bloodstream and then cross the blood-brain barrier or through direct contact of meninges with the skin or nasal cavity. The most frequent focus of the infection is the nasopharynx colonized by S. pneumoniae that evades the host immune system. During IPD, the bloodstream becomes invaded, and complement and coagulation systems are activated. Inflammatory mediators are released massively, which makes it easier for the bacteria to cross the blood-brain barrier. Inflammation is responsible for all the typical findings of bacterial meningitis, i.e., CSF pleocytosis.
