When administering methohexital, it is crucial to know that respiratory and hemodynamic effects may occur. It is important to monitor the patient throughout the procedure and the recovery phase. Guidelines suggested by organizations state that anesthesia standards of monitoring be in place, the most important factor being that during procedural sedation, one person should be present whose job is only to monitor and sedate the patient. Monitors, including hemodynamic (blood pressure cuff), O2 saturation (continuous pulse oximetry), ECG monitoring, End-tidal CO2 monitor, and respiratory rate monitoring, should be in place.

When possible, the person responsible for delivering sedation should have an unobstructed view of the patient's face, mouth, and chest wall during the procedure. To assess the depth of the anesthetic when using methohexital,Â it is reasonable to use a bispectral index (BIS) monitor, which analyzes a continuous EEG and quantifies the hypnotic/sedative effects of the drug being administered. Before administering methohexital, there should be appropriate airway equipment, including resuscitation equipment/medications, bag-valve-mask device, and Yankauer suction.
