The major differentiating clinical variable separating the two forms of ECS from ACS is the absence of a specific traumatic event in the former.  The literature consistently reports the clinical underappreciation of ECS types, particularly the acute subtype, given that there is most commonly an atraumatic presentation.

Multiple etiologies underlie CECS.  During exercise, specific muscle compartments swell up to 20%, secondary to increased blood flow and fluid volume.

The pathophysiologic cascade following this abnormal increase in intracompartmental pressure results in reduced myocyte oxygenation and ultimately resulting in myonecrosis and neurologic damage

Other etiologies of CECS include various overuse injuries or repetitive mechanisms where tissue degeneration or scar formation occurs as a result of microtrauma. Another predisposing risk factor may occur in individuals with inherently decreased elasticity of the fascia, which predisposes to nerve entrapment and quicker rises in pathologic pressures overriding the capillary perfusion pressure of the corresponding compartment.[10]. Amendola et al., in their study, felt that CECS was secondary to increased fluid content, which impaired muscle or nerve function in a tight compartment.
