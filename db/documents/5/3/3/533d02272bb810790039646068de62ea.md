Scleral fixation of intraocular lens (SFIOL) is performed when in-the-bag IOL implantation is not feasible. Sutured and sutureless SFIOL are the two main approaches utilized. Main indications include subluxation or dislocation of the lens and aphakia with inadequate capsular support due to any cause. This activity reviews techniques of SFIOL and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for scleral fixation of intraocular lens (SFIOL).
- Describe the importance of preoperative evaluation when planning scleral fixation of intraocular lens (SFIOL).
- Summarize the complications of scleral fixation of intraocular lens (SFIOL).
- Describe how using an interprofessional team approach can improve patient outcomes with scleral fixation of intraocular lens (SFIOL).
