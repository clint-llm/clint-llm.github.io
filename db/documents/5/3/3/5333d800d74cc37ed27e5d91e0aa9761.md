Medical simulation fellowship trainees have common characteristics.Â  The majority of fellows are physicians who have completed residency training, most commonly in emergency medicine, anesthesiology, or general surgery.

Surveys of medical simulation fellowship program directors have illuminated core curricular objectives and common themes for fellow education. The majority of program directors agreed that fellowship objectives should include medical simulation curriculum development, research and scholarly activity, simulation operations including organization, execution, assessment of simulation activities, principles of debriefing, simulation methodology, educational theory, and administration, including leadership and advocacy.

A consensus project by Frallicciardi et al. utilized emergency medicine simulation experts and sought to define core content for emergency medicine simulation fellowships, which may apply to non-emergency medicine fellowships as well.
