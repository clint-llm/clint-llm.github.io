Several quality improvement studies have shown issues of concern when implementing the Six Sigma methodology in healthcare. These issues of concern include the various challenges with Six Sigma implementation, the lack of studies about the actual success rates and costs of Six Sigma, and the unique aspects of healthcare as an industry. Execution of a Six Sigma project requires comprehensive planning, training, funds, and time. Studies have shown that a dedicated employee is needed to oversee a Six Sigma project.

Six Sigma methodology has several “belts” or tiers of project leader training. Depending on the training program, the designated levels or belts are as follows: white, yellow, green, black, and master black belt. White belts have the basic grounding and overview of Six Sigma. Yellow belts have 1 to 2 days of training and may assist those at higher belt levels or be assigned as contributing team members to a project. A green belt works part-time on Six Sigma projects and has 1 to 2 weeks of training. A black belt has at least two weeks of training and is a full-time manager of Six Sigma projects. While a Master Black Belt has supervised several projects and mentors those with green or black belts.

For successful implementation, often, the project will need to include specific outcomes desired, a timeline, and any problems that may arise with implementation. Lastly, Six Sigma project implementation and the completion of the 5 phases may take 18 to 24 months or longer, making it difficult to implement solutions quickly.

Studies have also shown that more research is needed due to limited evidence of Six Sigma being implemented correctly in healthcare systems.

Lastly, an issue of concern is healthcare being a complex industry sector. Several aspects that make healthcare a more complex industry include the high level of service and the wide product range necessary in healthcare. Variability among the products and services clinicians choose for patients based on the patient’s personalized needs exists.

Furthermore, the hospital staff is not trained the same as manufacturing workers. Instead, healthcare workers must often provide exceptional and personalized medical care depending on the patient’s illness and needs. Personalized care coupled with a diverse range of services required to deliver the end product or the necessary patient care in the hospital may affect the use of Six Sigma execution.

For example, two patients with the same diagnosis may have different treatment plans, including different surgeries or medications administered. Also, a patient may have preexisting conditions, such as the need for insulin therapy, making care for another health condition more complicated. With hospital healthcare, there is complexity regarding various critical and life-threatening aspects of patient care and the products needed, which does not allow for precise planning in hospital logistics.

Therefore, this may require different management and planning than other industries when discussing supply chain aspects. The outputs of the services in hospitals are typically not tangible products but are patients. Thus, metrics are not always as easy to apply to the processes as they would be in manufacturing. These healthcare features lead to concerns regarding the execution of Six Sigma projects in healthcare. Some studies have proposed using an index in Six Sigma healthcare projects that may bridge the gap between the critical items that may present in healthcare while still being able to implement Six Sigma methodology in problem management.
