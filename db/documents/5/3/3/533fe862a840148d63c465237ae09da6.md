The prevalence of NAFLD varies dramatically depending on the population being studied. It is estimated that the prevalence of NAFLD is in the range of 20% in the United States population and between 11.5% and 46% in the general population. By contrast, the prevalence of NASH is in the range of 2% and 3%. The prevalence is higher in white men than white women but therare are no differences between hispanic and African-American people

Obesity is a well-known risk factor for NAFLD. In patients with severe obesity undergoing bariatric surgery, up to 90% are found to have NAFLD and some even have cirrhosis. The same study also concluded that insulin resistance was the main predictor for NASH.
