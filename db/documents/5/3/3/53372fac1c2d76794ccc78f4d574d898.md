CL is the most common manifestation of leishmaniasis, and often laboratory testing is not available due to the setting in which disease occurs. CL can be suspected by the epidemiologic setting of an endemic tropical rural area. Signs and symptoms include crusted ulcerative lesions with or without satellite lesions, lymphangitic spread, or mucosal involvement.

Visceral involvement is usually manifested as fever, pallor, and weakness, or anorexia. Objective findings include splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and less commonly, leukopenia.
