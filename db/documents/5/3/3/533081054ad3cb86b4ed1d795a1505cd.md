All patients suspected to have acute pericarditis should initially undergo an ECG, echocardiogram, and chest X-ray. Myocardial inflammatory and injury markers such as ESR, CRP and troponins should also be obtained (Class I, LOE C).

First level tests such as a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, liver function tests, and thyroid stimulation hormone level are recommended if further work up is pursued and may be suggestive of a particular etiology such as uremia or infection. In select patients, blood cultures, viral seromarkers and tuberculosis testing (such as PPD or quantiferon TB essays) may be performed as well. HIV testing with antibody/antigen testing or nucleic acid testing (NAT) should be obtained if patients are found to have an opportunistic infection, since a strong correlation exists between an immunocompromised state, and fungal or tuberculosis infection.

The ESC 2015 guidelines support obtaining a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a Class I recommendations when second-line testing is pursued.

Emergent pericardiocentesis is recommended in patient presenting with cardiac tamponade.

An exudative pericardial effusion warrants empiric anti-tuberculosis treatment in parts of the world where tuberculosis is endemic, even while cultures are still pending. If a positive diagnosis  of tuberculosis is confirmed, then medical therapy with at least 6 months is recommended (Class I, LOE C), and pericardiectomy should be consider if there is failure of improvement on therapy within 4-8 weeks (Class I, LOE C).

Pericardial fluid analysis with cytology is recommended for the confirmation of malignant pericardial disease (Class I, LOE B). Further testing may include pericardial biopsy and tumor marker testing such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA-19 (Class IIa, LOE B), although evidence for their accuracy in distinguishing malignant effusions is limited.

The incidence of uremic pericarditis has seen significant decline with the introduction of dialysis.

Cardiac catheterization may be considered to assess for diastolic pressure equalization, and respiratory interventricular dependence if constrictive pericarditis is suspected, but is not recommended diagnostically for patients with acute pericarditis only.

Acute pericarditis treatment begins by addressing the underlying cause. Patients with uremic pericarditis should undergo more frequent dialysis, while patients with malignancy and tuberculosis should receive therapy directed at the primary disease process. For tuberculosis, standard therapy is with quadruple antibiotics (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) for at least 2 months followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for a total of 6 months, with or without adjunctive high-dose prednisolone as discussed above.

Most patients will have idiopathic acute pericarditis, and can be managed safely on an outpatient basis with medical therapy alone. Activity restriction beyond that of sedentary life is also advised until symptoms are resolved or CPR levels normalize.

In the majority of patients, empiric treatment with high dose anti-inflammatory agents in addition to colchicine is recommended, and NSAID therapy should continue until symptom relief. This period is typically between 3 days to 2 weeks. Possible regimens include Ibuprofen 600mg every 8 hours, indomethacin 25-50mg every 8 hours, or naproxen 500-1000mg every 12 hours.

The COPE trial randomized 120 patients to conventional therapy with ASA, versus conventional therapy with adjunctive colchicine and followed them over a period of 18 months. The latter group demonstrated less symptom persistence at 72 hours (11.7% versus 36.7%; P=0.003) and significantly less recurrent episodes (10.7% versus 32.3%; P=0.004) as compared to the control group.

Low to moderate doses (i.e. prednisone 0.2–0.5 mg/kg/day or equivalent) with slow taper may also be used if a regimen of NSAIDS/ASA and colchicine is contraindicated. While the latter often offers rapid clinical improvement, there is ample evidence that steroid use increases the risk for recurrent pericarditis after discontinuation of therapy.

Response to therapy is assessed clinically based on symptom relief, but serial CRP measurements can be helpful as well. If there is an incomplete response to anti-inflammatory agents (ASA or NSAIDs) with adjunctive colchicine (such as recurrent pericarditis), then the addition of steroids as triple therapy should be considered after an infectious etiology is ruled out.

For corticosteroid-dependent recurrent pericarditis, steroid-sparing immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine, IVIG or anakinra (an IL-1 receptor antagonist) may be used as third line therapy.

Certain forms of acute pericarditis, such as iatrogenic pericarditis and uremic pericarditis have been associated with increased risk of hemorrhagic pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade in small studies. Consequently, and despite the lack of strong evidence, it may be prudent to stop anticoagulation when feasible in those patients.
