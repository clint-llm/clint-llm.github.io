The diagnosis of mucocele and oral ranula is mainly based on the clinical picture. Although imaging studies are not generally indicated for the evaluation of mucoceles and oral ranulas, they can undoubtedly help in excluding other differential diagnoses, determining the cause (e.g., calculi) as well as the extent of the swellings, thus aiding in surgery.

- **Ultrasonography:**In expert hands, high-resolution ultrasonography can detect calculi, abscesses, and cysts, and can even correctly assess up to 90% of benign versus malignant tumors. Vascular lesions, however, require color doppler imaging for their evaluation.

- **CT and MRI:**They are seldomly required, except if there is a large plunging or cervical ranula that has breached through a defect in the mylohyoid muscle. Also, they aid in determining the extent of the swelling, which is crucial to know before proceeding to the surgery.

- **Biopsy:**It is required to differentiate between the benign and the malignant disease.
