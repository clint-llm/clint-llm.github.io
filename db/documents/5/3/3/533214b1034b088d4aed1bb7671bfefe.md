TMJ has several proprioceptive receptors, in particular in the parenchyma of the articular disk: Golgi-Mazzoni and Ruffini; myelinated and nonmyelinated nerve fibers.

The articular capsule in the anterolateral portion receives innervation by the masseteric nerve, a branch of the second branch of the trigeminal nerve. The lateral area of the capsule, on the other hand, is innervated by the auriculotemporal nerve of the third branch of cranial nerve V.
