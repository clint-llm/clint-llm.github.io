In April 2016, the FDA withdrew approval for the triple therapy of extended-release niacin plus fenofibrate plus a statin, citing the lack of evidence for the reduction in cardiovascular risk in statin-treated patients.

Knowledge Pearls:

- The general population's ideal triglyceride level is less than 150 mg/dL.

- Non-HDL cholesterol levels should be calculated if triglycerides are more than 200 mg/dL, as hypertriglyceridemia is associated with atherogenic triglyceride-rich particles.

- Initiate therapy if the triglyceride level is greater than 200 mg/dL.

- Pancreatitis risk increases if triglyceride levels are more than 500 mg/dL, then dramatically rises if more than 1500-2000 mg/dL. The first target of therapy is triglycerides less than 500 mg/dL.
