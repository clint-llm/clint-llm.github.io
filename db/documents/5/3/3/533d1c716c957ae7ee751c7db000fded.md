The prognosis of mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome is variable. The TNMB staging is the strongest prognostic factor. The following factors may be associated with a poor prognosis:

- Presence of extracutaneous disease (stage IV),

- Older age (greater than 60),

- Presence of large cell transformation (LCT), and

- Increased LDH

- Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides

- Tumor distribution at diagnosis
