The most common test to assess disturbances of the aldosterone pathway is the aldosterone: renin ratio. This determines whether there is an isolated aldosterone problem or there is a disturbance within renin-angiotensin system. If an aldosterone problem is suspected, and the results show no elevation in either aldosterone or renin, then congenital adrenal hyperplasia is suspected. If both aldosterone and renin are increased, and their ratio is less than 10, then the differential includes renovascular hypertension. If the renin value is normal, the aldosterone level is elevated, and the ratio is greater than 30, the differential includes Conn syndrome. This can be confirmed with a salt suppression test, an MRI of the adrenal glands, and adrenal vein sampling.
