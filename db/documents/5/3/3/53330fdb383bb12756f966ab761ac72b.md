Classified as a SERM, bazedoxifene is part of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines. Depending on the tissue or estrogen receptor being targeted, it functions as a competitive antagonist that yields anti-proliferative effects in cases of breast cancer or uterine carcinoma/endometrial hyperplasia and as an agonist that stimulates lipid metabolism and proper regulation of bone turnover.

The biomolecular antagonistic effects result from a pro-apoptotic signal that allows bazedoxifene to inhibit STAT3 and MAPK signaling pathways and effectively destroy cancer cells.
