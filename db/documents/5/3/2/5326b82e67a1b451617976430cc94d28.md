Wrist arthroscopy is quickly being used to treat a variety of intraarticular pathologies. Wrist arthroscopy has been used successfully for arthroscopic irrigation and debridement in septic arthritis, resection of ganglion cysts, removal of loose bodies, stabilization of interosseous ligaments, synovectomy, distal ulnar shortening, debridement of degenerative arthritis, and repair of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomical structures and landmarks involved in performing wrist arthroscopy. 
- Describe the risks to adjacent structures when establishing the standard wrist arthroscopic portals. 
- Summarize the origins of the potential complications of wrist arthroscopy.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance wrist arthroscopy and improve outcomes.
