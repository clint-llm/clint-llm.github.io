GV is a rare surgical emergency that is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a general surgeon, radiologist, emergency department physician, specialty nurses, and an internist. As soon as the diagnosis is made, the general surgeon must be notified as this pathology requires immediate surgery. The majority of patients are elderly with comorbidities and should be monitored by ICU nurses.

The outcome for this condition is excellent when emergency surgery is done, Any delay in surgical intervention can result in infarction and necrosis of the gallbladder which can then lead to bilious peritonitis and increase morbidity and mortality rate.
