The cause of vulvodynia remains unknown and hence its treatment remains unsatisfactory. Treatment requires an interprofessional treatment approach. It is important to believe that the woman has pain.  In many cases, the woman has been struggling for a long time in silence, or she has seen many practitioners and no one has helped her. Different practitioners may be involved in the care of this patient. When a patient finds the correct practitioners they may include a gynecologist with a special interest in vulvovaginal disease health usually involved in the societies International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health (ISSWSH) and ISSVD, a dermatologist, nurse practitioner, a neurologist, a pain management specialist, a urologist, and/or a physical therapist who specializes in women's health.
