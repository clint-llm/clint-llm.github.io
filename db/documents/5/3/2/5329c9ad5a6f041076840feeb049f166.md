Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of cardiac arrhythmia. It is the leading cardiac cause of stroke. Risk factors for atrial fibrillation include advanced age, high blood pressure, underlying heart and lung disease, congenital heart disease, and increased alcohol consumption. Although atrial fibrillation may be a permanent disease, various treatments, and risk modifying strategies have been developed to help reduce the risk of stroke in patients that remain in atrial fibrillation. Treatments include anticoagulation, rate control medication, rhythm control medication, cardioversion, ablation, and other interventional cardiac procedures. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of atrial fibrillation and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of atrial fibrillation.
- Outline the pathophysiology of atrial fibrillation.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for atrial fibrillation.
- Explain the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication regarding the management of patients with atrial fibrillation.
