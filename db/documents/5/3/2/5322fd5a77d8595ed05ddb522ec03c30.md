The initial effect of optic nerve colobomas on visual acuity is variable, and some patients even have normal visual acuity. However, during the evolution of the disease, they may develop a decrease in visual acuity due to complications such as serous retinal detachment in optic disc pit, atrophy or subretinal neovascularization.

In patients with an optic nerve head coloboma, the extent of abnormal tissue is much greater than it is in optic pits. This papillary defect along with a poorly differentiated retina and retinal pigment epithelium, an abnormal lamina cribrosa, and an enlarged scleral canal potentially allow the vitreous cavity, subretinal space, subarachnoid space, and the orbital space to communicate in these patients. A retinal detachment can develop through a defect.
