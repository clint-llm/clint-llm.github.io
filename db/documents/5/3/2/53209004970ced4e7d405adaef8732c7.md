Transplant-related malignancies arise from an interplay of immunologic and nonimmunologic risk factors. The following is a brief description of the various pathways for the oncogenesis:

- Immunosuppressive agents and oncogenesis: calcineurin inhibitors stimulate carcinogenesis by inhibiting DNA repair mechanisms, apoptosis, and enhancing the production of interleukin 2 (IL-2), transforming growth factor (TGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Transforming growth factor promotes tumor growth by regulating tumor cell invasion, metastatic potential, and VEGF stimulates neo-angiogenesis. Azathioprine increases cancer risk by causing post-replicative DNA mismatch repair. Sirolimus, everolimus and mycophenolate mofetil are not associated with an increased risk of cancer; they actually have antiproliferative properties.

- Viral Infection and oncogenesis: Transplant patients are vulnerable to viral infection or reactivation of latent infection. EBV promotes the oncogenesis by reduced lymphocyte regulation, a lack of control of the oncogenic virus by EBV-specific CD81 cytotoxic T-cells, and proliferation of EBV-infected B cells. The mechanism by which HHV-8 induces oncogenesis has not been completely elucidated. HHV-8’s proinflammatory proteins might directly inhibit apoptosis and promote cell transformation.
