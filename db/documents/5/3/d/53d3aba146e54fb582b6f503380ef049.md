**Patient Selection**

Most ESRD patients have multiple co-morbidities and complications resulting from their kidney disease. As such, they are carefully screened for their ability to tolerate surgery and the subsequent immunosuppression which accompanies transplant surgery. Below is a summary of the evaluation of comorbid conditions:

Cardiovascular Disease: Most ESRD patients require careful cardiovascular evaluation with noninvasive testing for those at high risk or who have symptoms. For example, a dobutamine stress echocardiogram has been shown to have superior accuracy for predicting perioperative cardiac events.

Cerebrovascular Disease: Any patient with a history of a cerebrovascular accident, including a transient ischemic attack, should be evaluated for carotid artery disease, if not already done.

Frailty: Several frailty tests exist to determine candidates’ fitness for transplant. The frailty test is a short physical performance battery from which an objective score is calculated. The Fried frailty criteria can also be used, and its domains include unintentional weight loss, self-reported exhaustion, weakness (grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity. These scales are particularly useful in the elderly demographic, particularly those potential recipients above years of 60.

Gastrointestinal Disease: Anyone with a family or personal history of colon cancer or above the age of 50 should have a screening colonoscopy per USPSTF recommendations. Anyone with active viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease should consult with a hepatologist for possible consideration for a combined liver-kidney transplant.

Hematologic Disorder: Patients with a history of thrombosis should be evaluated for possible hypercoagulable disorders which may require treatment with anticoagulation. For those with bleeding diathesis, a full coagulation panel should be done.

Infections: As stated above, active infection is an absolute contraindication to a kidney transplant. Most centers will send a comprehensive serology panel to test for many viral infections and tuberculosis, etc. Vaccinations should also be up to date.

Malignancy: Most transplant centers will require a cancer-free period of 2 to 5 years, depending on the type of cancer, to minimize the risk of post-transplant recurrence/metastasis potentiated by immunosuppressive therapy.

Pulmonary Disease: For higher-risk patients such as those who have been on dialysis for an extended period, those with heart dysfunction, known diagnosis of COPD or history of extensive tobacco use, obstructive sleep apnea, or history of pulmonary embolism should undergo pulmonary function testing and possibly an echocardiogram to rule out pulmonary hypertension.

**Donor Selection/Allocation**

There are two types of kidney donors: living or deceased.

Deceased donors are broken down into those that are brain dead (DBD) and those that donate after cardiac death (DCD).  As the term would indicate, brain dead donors are those that have satisfied formal criteria for brain death testing.  DCD donors are patients who, while they do not meet the criteria for formal brain death, are deemed by neurologists as being unlikely to experience a meaningful neurologic recovery.

SCD and ECD classification were ultimately replaced in 2014 by the kidney donor profile index (KDPI), a more objective graft quality measure.  KDPI is derived from the kidney donor risk index (KDRI), the percentage of donors in a reference population (as defined annually by the OPTN) that have a KDRI score less than or equal to the donor’s KDRI score.  Factors used in determining the KDPI are donor age, ethnicity, creatinine, history of HTN or DM, cause of death, height and weight, HCV status, and DCD status.  Multiple studies have shown that kidney transplant using high-KDPI kidneys is still associated with a substantial reduction in morbidity and improvement in life expectancy and remains a cost-saving treatment strategy compared with patients who remained on maintenance dialysis.

Living kidney donation offers the best graft and recipient survival, even when considering paired kidney exchange, which involves organ transport before implantation.more than 1 medication, pelvic or horseshoe kidneys, and psychiatric disorders.

Regarding long-term consequences to living kidney donors, much research has been done; initially, it was felt that eventual development of ESRD or long-term survival was not affected by living donation.
