The gold-standard for diagnosing vulvar cancer remains histologic diagnosis, although clinical correlation does have significant value. Any suspicious lesion should be biopsied and carefully examined for its precise anatomical position with respect to the midline and distance from vaginal introitus; this is crucial for planned surgical management. Imaging studies may be indicated to evaluate the extent of the disease. If there is suspicion of bladder or rectal involvement, cystoscopy and proctoscopy should be performed.
