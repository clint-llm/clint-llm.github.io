It is difficult to determine how many students miss school due to anxiety because many parents cover for their kids. Parents call the school to say that their child is sick, especially parents whose child's symptom of anxiety manifests physically in the form of a headache or stomach pain. Stressful events may lead to school refusal. Some children head to school in the morning and become anxious as they get closer to school; then they cannot proceed. Other children refuse to go to school at all. Their presenting symptoms include fearfulness, panic symptoms, crying episodes, temper tantrums, threats of self-harm, and somatic symptoms that present in the morning and improve when the child stays home.

**Symptoms**

Autonomic: Muscular, dizziness, abdominal pain, back pain, diaphoresis, joint pain, headaches, shakiness/trembling, palpitations, chest pains

Gastrointestinal (GI): Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

Stressful life events like moving or starting a new school, among others may trigger School Refusal. Other reasons include the child’s fear a parent being harmed once they are in school or fear that they may not do well in school, or they may be afraid of another student.
