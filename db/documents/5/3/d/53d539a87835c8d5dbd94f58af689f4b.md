Prolonged severe reduction of coronary blood flow leads to myocardial necrosis, eventually seizing myocardial contractility irreversibly. However, when reperfusion of the ischemic myocytes occurs, most viable tissues gain their contractile function right away, while some suffer from transient postischemic dysfunction known as stunning of the myocardium. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of stunned myocardium and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of stunned myocardium.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with stunned myocardium.
- Review the management options for patients with stunned myocardium.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with stunned myocardium.
