The diagnosis and management of tinnitus are made with an interprofessional team that consists of a primary care provider, nurse practitioner, ENT surgeon, audiologist, and internist. The treatment of tinnitus should follow guidelines established by the American Academy of Otolaryngology.  At the same time, the patient should be educated on the benefits of sleep hygiene. At present, there is no medication that can cure tinnitus. Various supplements have been tested but their efficacy remains in dispute. In the last decade, deep brain stimulation has been recommended but the treatment is not only invasive and costly it also has the potential to cause complications that may be worse than tinnitus.

Patients should be encouraged to lower stress and some may benefit from a hearing aid, that may mask other sounds. Tricyclic antidepressants are sometimes used but these drugs also have many adverse effects, which may not be well tolerated. Overall, patients with tinnitus have a poor quality of life.
