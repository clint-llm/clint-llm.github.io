The blood supply for the pronator teres is from branches of the brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries. Branches from the ulnar artery include the common interosseus artery and the anterior ulnar recurrent artery. The radial recurrent artery is a branch off of the radial artery. The inferior ulnar collateral arteries are branches off of the ulnar artery. Each of these branches provides vascularization to the pronator teres.
