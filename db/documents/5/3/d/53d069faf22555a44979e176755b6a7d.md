Arsenic is a naturally found metalloid that is a significant toxin worldwide found in the earth's crust and can act as a contaminate in drinking water. It is an occupationalÂ exposure for those working in mining, farming, and the production of semiconductors.

Arsenic is toxic as a solute, as well as in a gaseous form.

Arsenic as a solute is nearly tasteless and can present in contaminated drinking water; it is also documented as a method of intentional homicide and suicide. The first signs of arsenic toxicity are large amounts of "rice water" diarrhea that may be bloody, along with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain.

Arsine gas is a non-irritating, colorless and nearly tasteless gas that may be a byproduct in the mining process, and is used in the production of semiconductors. It is lethal at low doses, and affected individuals may not notice the toxicity until hours after exposure. Classic symptoms of arsine gas toxicity include headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, "port wine" hued urine and jaundice.

IN cases of suspected arsenic exposure it is imperative to call 911 for immediate transfer to the nearest hospital.

If there is a concern for recurrent occupational exposure Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) should be contacted at 1-800-321-6742 to investigate.
