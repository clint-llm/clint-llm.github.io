Patients should be advised to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine at least 10 hours before the exam as they can cause alterations in cerebral hemodynamics, which may cause confounding results. Injections should be performed in a dimly lit room, and the patient should be given time to relax before the radiopharmaceutical injection.

Intravenous access should be established at least 10 minutes before radiotracer injection. In addition, the patient should be instructed not to talk or interact with the technologist within 5-10 minutes of radiotracer injection.
