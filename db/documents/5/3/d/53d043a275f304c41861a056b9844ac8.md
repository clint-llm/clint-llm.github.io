History and physical examination may be all that is necessary to make the diagnosis, and it is not uncommon that testing, including lab work, is normal. If a patient's presentation is concerning for heat stress, heat injury, or heatstroke, a core temperature should be obtained with rectal thermometry if clinically possible.

- CBC and clotting factors as a significant systemic inflammatory response may be present that can progress to disseminated intravascular coagulation in severe cases

- Electrolytes and magnesium levels due to volume status abnormalities. These may have developed if there was an unbalanced replacement of fluid losses, i.e., drinking large quantities of water with no electrolytes

- Kidney and liver functioning testing due to the increased risk of organ injury found with significant heat illness

- Creatinine kinase levels to evaluate for skeletal muscle injury and rhabdomyolysis

- Urinalysis to further evaluate the health of the kidneys and presence of myoglobin

- EKG, as heat illness, can provoke cardiac arrhythmias or unmask arrhythmias that may warrant expert consultation.

- Glucose levels as patients with heat illness frequently have hypoglycemia and may require carbohydrate replacement

Patients may also have elevated levels of lactic acid secondary to decreased organ perfusion. Other tests, including a lumbar puncture or CT scan of the head, might be indicated if concern exists for other causes of a patient's presentation.
