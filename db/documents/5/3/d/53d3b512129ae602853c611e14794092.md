Tetanus is a disease caused by Clostridium tetani, a toxin-producing obligate anaerobe, which is found in the soil and gut of mammals. The spores cannot be eliminated from the environment. They may enter the body through compromises in the skin barrier or mucous membranes. OnceÂ inoculated, C. tetani transforms into a vegetative bacterium which then travels to the spinal cord and brainstem via the motor neurons. It then produces neurotoxin tetanospasmin, which interferes with the nervous system inhibitory neurotransmitters.C. tetani also produce tetanolysin, which has hemolytic properties and causes membrane damage, but its role is unknown.
