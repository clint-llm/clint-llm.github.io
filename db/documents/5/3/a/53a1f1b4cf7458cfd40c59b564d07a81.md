Fractures of the pelvis most often result following direct trauma, for example, in pedestrian vs. car accidents or a fall from significant heights, and may involve multiple bones of the pelvis or the hip joint. Pelvic fractures are potentially life-threatening, as more than 2 liters of blood can exsanguinate into the pelvic cavity without any evidence of external bleeding; for this reason, the management of pelvic fractures involves rapid fluid resuscitation and temporary external fixation to try and tamponade any internal bleeding while definitive treatment is planned.

The contemporary classification of pelvic fractures used is that outlined by Young and Burgess. It has a description of injuries resulting in force directed through the midline (anterior-posterior compression) from lateral to medial (lateral compression) or upwards off the midline (vertical shear).

Anterior-posterior compression (APC) injuries result from a force through the midline pubic symphysis. APC I injuries are defined as having less than 2.5 cm of widening at the symphysial joint and are considered clinically stable. APC II injuries demonstrate more than 2.5 cm diastasis at the symphysial joint, and there is disruption of the anterior part of the sacroiliac joint, but not the posterior part. They are considered rotationally unstable but vertically stable. APC III injuries include all the features of the APC II injuries, but with disruption of the posterior part of the sacroiliac joint, and therefore equate to a complete hemipelvis separation. They are unstable rotationally and vertically.

Lateral compression (LC) injuries are more common than APC injuries and result from a force from lateral to medial. LC I injuries are stable and comprise an oblique fracture of the pubic rami with an ipsilateral fracture of the sacral ala. LC II injuries also have an ipsilateral iliac wing fracture and are rotationally unstable but vertically stable. LC III injuries result from a greater force and cause contralateral anterior and posterior sacroiliac joint disruption.

Vertical shear (VS) injury results from an axial force delivered lateral to the midline and is the rarest, most severe, and unstable injury. This results in complete ligamentous disruption in the hemipelvis and pubic fractures.

Timely operative fixation is key to managing unstable and severe pelvic fractures and should be undertaken as soon as possible following appropriate trauma resuscitation and stabilization.
