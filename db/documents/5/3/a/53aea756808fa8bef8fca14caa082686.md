**Medication Interactions Associated with Pentoxifylline**

Pentoxifylline may potentiate the effect of antihypertensive agents. Therefore, a dose reduction of antihypertensives should merit consideration with careful blood pressure monitoring.

Pentoxifylline is shown to enhance the anti glycemic action of antidiabetic agents such as glibenclamide or metformin in animal studies. Pentoxifylline has been demonstrated to inhibit  ATP-sensitive K channels similar to glyburide in diabetic rats.

Pentoxifylline can increase the risk of bleeding in patients taking warfarin or antiplatelet agents. Monitor prothrombin time frequently when pentoxifylline is concomitantly used with warfarin.

Pentoxifylline increases the plasma levels of theophylline. Therefore, it may cause excess central nervous stimulation when administered with other xanthine derivatives.
