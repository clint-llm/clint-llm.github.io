In asymptomatic, mild thrombocytopenia patients, repeat CBC and routine monitoring is the recommended process.

Thrombocytopenic emergencies that require immediate action includes conditions of suspected HIT, TTP, HUS, drug-induced ITP, pregnancy with severe thrombocytopenia, bleeding with severe thrombocytopenia, urgently needed an invasive procedure in the presence of severe thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and aplastic anemia.

In patients with bleeding and severe thrombocytopenia, treatment includes platelet transfusion.

Management includes identifying the underlying cause and treating it.

**Primary immune thrombocytopenia:**

This condition is a diagnosis of exclusion. First line treatment includes glucocorticoids and intravenous immune globulins; these agents inhibit autoantibody production and platelet degradation. Second line treatment includes rituximab, immunosuppressive drugs, and splenectomy. Third line agents are thrombopoietin receptor agonists, which stimulate platelet production.

**Drug-induced thrombocytopenia:**

- Withholding the causative drug usually results in improvement of platelet counts in cases of drug-induced thrombocytopenia.

- The mainstay of treatment in HIT is to withdraw all heparin products and to initiate anti-thrombin and anti-Xa activity anticoagulant agents. Dicoumarol agents added once platelet count reaches normal.

TTP gets treated with plasma exchange.

In patients with secondary ITP managing the underlying condition is recommended, like, in SLE, SLE treatment is with immunosuppressive agents, and in patients with H. pylori-associated thrombocytopenia, eradication of H.pylori increases platelet count.
