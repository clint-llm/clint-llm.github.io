One tool that clinicians can use to calculate the prognosis of a patient with dyslipidemia is 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. This calculator factors in risk for patients based on lipid levels as well as age, race, tobacco use, diabetes, sex, and hypertension history. This calculation will give a percentage of risk that a cardiovascular event will happen in 10 years. Also, a percentage of risk if risk factors were optimal.
