In the past, the French-American-British system classified AML into eight subtypes, FAB M0 to M7, which are as follows:

- M0: Undifferentiated AML

- M1: AML with minimal maturation

- M2: AML with maturation

- M3: Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)

- M4: Acute myelomonocytic leukemia

- M5: Acute monocytic leukemia

- M6: Acute erythroid leukemia

- M7: Acute megakaryocytic leukemia

In 2016, World Health Organization (WHO) revised the classification and categorized it into AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities, AML with myelodysplasia-related changes, therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, NOS, myeloid sarcoma, myeloid proliferations related to Down syndrome.

AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities includes-

- AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22.1); RUNX1-RUNX1T1

- AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11

- APL with t(15;17)(q22;q12); PML-RARA

- AML with t(9;11)(p21.3;q23.3); MLLT3-KMT2A

- AML with t(6;9)(p23;q24); DEK-NUP214

- AML with inv(3)(q21.3q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21.3;q26.2); GATA2, MECOM

- AML (megakaryoblastic) with t(1;22)(p13.3;q13.3); RBM15-MKL1

- AML with mutated NPM1

- AML with biallelic mutations CEBPA

AML not otherwise specified (NOS) includes:

- AML with minimal differentiation

- AML without maturation

- AML with maturation

- Acute myelomonocytic leukemia

- Acute monoblastic/monocytic leukemia

- Pure erythroid leukemia

- Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia

- Acute basophilic leukemia

- Acute panmyelosis with myelofibrosis

Based on the etiology of the AML, it can be categorized into de novo AML, Secondary AML (s-AML), which evolves from prior MPD or MDS, and Therapy related AML (t-AML) following exposure to chemotherapeutic agents or radiation therapy or toxins.
