Androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern hair loss) typically progresses over time, leading to diminished coverage of the affected areas. Progression to complete baldness may occur in males but rarely in females. Early recognition and treatment can aid in halting progression and preserving as much hair as possible.

Alopecia areata has an unpredictable prognosis, often including relapses and remissions, as part of a chronic course. The following factors may indicate a worse prognosis: onset in childhood, long duration, extensive involvement, nail involvement, comorbid autoimmune disease, and positive family history.

Telogen effluvium prognosis depends on the ability to remove or treat the triggering factor. The course is self-limited if the underlying etiology resolves spontaneously or can be eliminated.

FFA prognosis is difficult to predict. Factors associated with a poor prognosis include facial papules, eyelashes and body hair loss, and diffuse involvement of the frontotemporal recess. Factors associated with a less severe course include younger age at onset, mild involvement of eyebrows, and a clinical pattern of pseudo fringe.

LPP has an unpredictable clinical course; it may stabilize or continue to progress slowly.
