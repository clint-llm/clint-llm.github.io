Enterobius vermicularis is an organism that primarily lives in the ileum and cecum. Once E. vermicularis eggs are ingested, they take about 1 to 2 months to develop into adult worms which happens in the small intestine. These do not usually cause any symptoms when confined to the ileocecal area. The female adult worms and ova migrate to the anal area mostly at night time and deposit thousands of eggs in the perianal area. This migration causes pruritus. Eggs hatch near the anal area causing perianal pruritus. This leads to contamination of the fingers and results in ingestion of the eggs (autoinfection) and restarting of the life cycle of the worm. Occasionally, the larvae migrate back into the rectum and to the small intestine and begin the life cycle (retro infection).
