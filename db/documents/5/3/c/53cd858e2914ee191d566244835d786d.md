Adult-onset akinesia creates many challenges for both the patient and the family. Since the supportive treatment like physiotherapy and exercise therapy is primarily motivation driven, it is essential to counsel and encourage patients to seek and diligently follow through with it, over a prolonged period. Of importance, is the underlying depressive episode in these patients. Adequate counseling and medication in clinically depressed patients, a condition not uncommon in Parkinson disease and Parkinson plus syndromes, cannot be stressed upon enough.

In parents with a live/stillbirth suggestive of fetal akinesia syndrome, fetal surveillance in subsequent pregnancies is essential. An in utero detection will allow for early termination as an option for the parents. The phenotypic condition is derived from various causes, making the recurrence risk calculation less precise. The stipulated recurrence risk lies anywhere between 0% to 25%.
