Biventricular pacing device (CRT) is indicated in the following patients.

1. It is a class I recommendation for patients with;

- Left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 36%

- Sinus rhythm with LBBB morphology

- QRS duration of >149ms

- New York Heart Association (NYHA) II, III, or ambulatory IV symptoms on optimal medical therapy.

- Acceptable non-cardiac health.

2. It is a class IIa recommendation in patients with;

- Left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 36%

- Sinus rhythm with LBBB morphology

- QRS duration of 120 to 149ms

- New York Heart Association (NYHA) II, III, or ambulatory IV symptoms on optimal medical therapy.

- Acceptable non-cardiac health

3. It is a class IIa recommendation in patients with;

- Left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 36%

- Sinus rhythm with non-LBBB pattern

- QRS duration of >149ms

- New York Heart Association (NYHA) III, or ambulatory IV symptoms on optimal medical therapy.

- Acceptable non-cardiac health.

4. It is a class IIa recommendation in patients with;

- Left ventricular ejection fraction of less than or equal to 35%, on optimal medical therapy

- Atrial fibrillation and requires ventricular pacing.
