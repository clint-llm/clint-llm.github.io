Osmosis occurs when two solutions containing different concentrations of solute are divided by a selectively permeable membrane. In the human body, this selectively permeable membrane may be the cellular membrane (in the case of intracellular fluid) or maybe a membrane lining your body cavity composed of cells (in the case of extravascular fluid). The solute concentration difference across the membrane gives rise to a gradient that facilitates the movement of a solvent (usually water in our body) until attaining equilibrium. The tendency of a solution to draw water in through the semipermeable membrane is the osmotic pressure.

The unit of osmoles is used to express the number of particles. One osmole refers to one mole of osmotically active solute particles. Though similar to molarity, osmolarity refers to the total number of active particles. For instance, one mole of glucose dissolved in one liter of solution would have molarity and osmolarity of 1 osm/L (or 1 mol/L). However, if a molecule dissociates into two ions (yielding two particles)â€”for instance, sodium chloride, then the 1 mol/L solution will yield an osmolarity of 2 osm/L.

It is also noteworthy that there is a distinction between the terms osmolarity and osmolality. While osmolarity is the number of osmoles per liter, osmolality is the number of osmoles per kilogram. In terms of volume status, we are concerned more so with the plasma osmolality, since it is independent of temperature and pressure. However, clinically, it is much easier to express body fluid quantities in liters rather than kilograms. At low concentrations (as in the human body), these two terms are almost synonymous with each other.

The total osmolarity for each of the three fluid compartments (intracellular, interstitial, intravascular) is around 280 mOsm/L, with intravascular being slightly greater due to the osmotic effects of plasma proteins. The composition of the interstitial and intravascular fluid is similar, with sodium and chloride being the primary contributors to the osmolarity. For intracellular fluid, almost half the osmolarity is due to potassium ions, with the other half composed of various other substances (e.g., phosphate, phosphocreatine, magnesium ions).
