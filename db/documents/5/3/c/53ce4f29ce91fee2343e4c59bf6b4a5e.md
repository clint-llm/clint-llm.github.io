The diagnosis and management of brachial plexitis is best done with an interprofessional team that includes a pain specialist, neurologist, physiatrist, physical therapist and a sports physician. For most patients the treatment of brachial plexitis is conservative, based on analgesia and physiotherapeutic rehabilitation. Physiotherapeutic rehabilitation, which may include kinesiotherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, deep dermal therapy, cryotherapy and/or functional electric stimulation, has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and weakness, as well as in regaining muscle trophism and functional status. The outcomes in most patient with brachial plexitis are fair. Recovery is often prolonged and exacerbations are common. The quality of life in chronic cases is poor.
