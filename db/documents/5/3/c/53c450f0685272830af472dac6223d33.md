The extremities of the body initially form as limb buds containing an outer layer of ectoderm with an inner layer of mesoderm. The lower limbs begin developmentÂ after the upper limbs, at about week 4 of gestation, with all limbs being well differentiated by about 8 to 10 weeks gestational age.

The muscles and fascia of the femoral triangle derive from mesoderm contained within developing limb buds at the time of extremity formation.

The blood vessels and the lymphatics of the femoral triangle are also derived from mesoderm.

The epidermis above the femoral triangle and the femoral nerve are formed from the ectoderm contained in limb buds at the time of extremity formation.
