AVPD is considered to be a chronic disorder, as implied by its designation within the family of personality disorders. However, some studies have suggested that, with time and treatment, a subset of those diagnosed with AVPD will eventually no longer meet diagnostic criteria. Specifically, one study revealed stability of diagnosis, ten years after the initial diagnosis, estimated to be 0.51.

Although this possibility of expiation from the disorder engenders hope, evaluations of those still meeting the diagnostic threshold of AVPD reveal minimal to nonexistent symptom diminishment.
