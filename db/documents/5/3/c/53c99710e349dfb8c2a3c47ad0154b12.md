Surgical resection of an optic nerve glioma will invariably lead to blindness of the affected side. Resection of a chiasmal or post-chiasmal OPG will likely lead to bilateral visual deficits. Resection often entails enucleation of the affected eye. Radiation therapy can lead to significant facial disfigurement, particularly in younger children.
