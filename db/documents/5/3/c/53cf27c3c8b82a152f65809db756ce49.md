Dysdiadochokinesia (diadochokinesia) is the inability to perform rapid alternating muscle movements. These can be quick, synchronous, and can include pronation/supination, fast finger tapping, opening and closing of the fists, and foot tapping. It is an essential component to evaluate in patients suspected of having a cerebellar disease. These activities correlate well with numerous lifelong measures of disability. It is a form of ataxia that leads to the loss of coordination of speech and limbs. It is measurable by using the alternate motion rate (AMR). For example, speech AMR is measurable through verbal commands such as counting the number of syllable repetitions within a specific time (less than 1 minute).
