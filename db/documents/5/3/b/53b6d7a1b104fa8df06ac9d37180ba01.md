This activity reviews the evaluation and management of diffuse esophageal spasm and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring with patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of diffuse esophageal spasm. 
- Identify the typical presentation of a patient with diffuse esophageal spasm. 
- Explain the techniques used to diagnose diffuse esophageal spasm.
- Explain the need for improved care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care and improve outcomes for patients with diffuse esophageal spasm.
