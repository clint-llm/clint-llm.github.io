Staging of Kienböck disease is essential for treatment planning and divides into morphological and functional staging.

Morphologic Staging follows the **Lichtman Classification**, which is based on radiographic and MR imaging findings and has low interobserver variability.

Stage 1: Normal radiograph, lunate signal intensity changes on MRI.

Stage 2: Lunate sclerosis on radiography with or without fracture lines. The lunate shape is normal.

Stage 3: Collapse of the lunate articular surface.

- 3A: with preserved carpal alignment and height.

- 3B: with scaphoid flexion and loss of carpal height.

- 3C: with an associated coronal fracture

Stage 4: Stage 3B + radio-carpal or mid-carpal arthrosis.

Functional Staging relies on contrast-enhanced MRI to assess osseous perfusion and the extent of necrosis. It is helpful to guide revascularization techniques during surgery for morphologic stages 2 and 3A. The pre- and post-contrast images are acquired using a T2 fat-suppressed sequence.

Stage 1: Intense homogeneous contrast enhancement reflects bone marrow ischemia and edema and a viable lunate (corresponds to morphologic stage 1).

Stage 2: Patchy, inhomogeneous enhancement reflects partial necrosis. The remaining viable portion is usually distal.

Stage 3: Absent contrast enhancement reflects complete necrosis.
