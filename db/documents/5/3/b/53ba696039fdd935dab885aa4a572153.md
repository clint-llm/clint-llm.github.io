The rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, and levator scapulae muscles are created from a paraxial mesoderm origin and are innervated by the anterior primary rami of C5. The source of the anterior motor roots of the cervical region is the basal plate region of the spinal cord. These anterior roots join with the sensory (posterior) roots which are derived from neural crest cells to form each cervical spinal nerve. After emerging from the intervertebral foramen, the spinal nerve quickly branches into an anterior primary ramus and a posterior primary ramus. The dorsal scapular nerve is formed from the anterior rami of the C5 spinal nerve.
