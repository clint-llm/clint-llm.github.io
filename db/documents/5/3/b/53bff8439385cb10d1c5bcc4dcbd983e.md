# Definition/Introduction

Childhood obesity is a rising health concern in the United States, as its prevalence continues to increase among children of all ages.

Obesity is a condition characterized by the accumulation of excessive fat in the body. Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure used to classify overweight and obesity using height and weight (kg/m^2). BMI values may significantly differ in children and adolescents, depending on their age and gender. Thus, once a BMI of a child is calculated, it is often compared with reference values for a particular gender and age group to determine his or her BMI percentile.

# Issues of Concern

The importance of addressing the issue of pediatric obesity is substantial, for it is often associated with various health complications, including type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia.

Thirty-two percent of US children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 are overweight, and 17 percent of them are obese.

**Causes of Pediatric Obesity**

Genetics play a role in the development of childhood obesity but only accounts for less than 5 percent of its cases. It often has to be combined with environmental or behavior factors to influence weight. Thus it is not considered the major cause that is responsible for the dramatic increase in pediatric obesity.

Multiple environmental factors significantly contribute to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Decreased activity level among children and adolescents is significantly associated with obesity. In 2007, only 36 percent of US children and adolescents met the recommended levels of physical activity.

**Pediatric Nutritional Guidelines**

An article by Gidding et al.

- Balanced dietary calories with physical activity (60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day)

- Daily consumption of vegetables and fruits and limited consumption of juice

- Reduced consumption of sugary drinks and foods

- Increased consumption of whole-grain bread and cereals instead of refined-grain foods

- Increased consumption of oily fish

- Reduced salt intake

Other dietary recommendations for children include carbohydrate reduced or restricted diet and low calorie and fat foods.

# Clinical Significance

In a study performed by Palhares et al., the clinical markers of overweight and obese subjects (n=161) aged between 5 to 19 years were analyzed.

**Diabetes Mellitus**

Twenty years ago, the dominant type of pediatric diabetes cases was immune-mediated type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Due to a rising rate of childhood obesity, the number of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) cases has dramatically increased among children and adolescents. T2DM is responsible for almost 50 percent of all new diabetes cases among children.

Clinical signs and symptoms of children with T2DM may be difficult to distinguish from those of children with other types of DM, such as T1DM. T1DM is predominantly present in the White population, whereas T2DM predominates more in the Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American populations. B-cell autoantibodies are more commonly observed in T1DM than in T2DM pediatric populations. Ketoacidosis is more frequent in T1DM patients. Some of the associated disorders of T1DM are autoimmune diseases related to thyroid and adrenal glands. T1DM patients have low levels of insulin and C-peptide, whereas T2DM patients have high levels of insulin and C-peptide.

Hypertension and dyslipidemia are associated with insulin resistance and obesity, and thus commonly observed in pediatric patients with T2DM. Children who are obese often present with increased LDL cholesterol and triglycerides levels and decreased HDL cholesterol levels. Elevated LDL cholesterol may lead to atherosclerosis and trigger chronic inflammation. Abnormal lipid levels are present in 12 to 17% of children and adolescents who are overweight.

**Acanthosis Nigricans**

Patients with Acanthosis nigricans present with velvety hyperpigmented patches that are poorly demarcated on the skin. These dark patches, which may be itchy and odorous, can be commonly found in body folds of the neck, groin, and armpits. This condition occurs in up to 90 percent of children with T2DM.

**Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS)**

PCOS is an endocrine disorder that presents with chronic anovulation and hyperandrogenism and may lead to infertility in women at their reproductive age. It is prevalent in 5 to 13% of women at reproductive age, and 70 to 80 % of women with PCOS are infertile.

Children and adolescents with T2DM are more likely to develop progressive complications at earlier ages than those diagnosed with the disease later in their adulthood. Some of these complications include stroke, myocardial infarction, renal insufficiency and chronic renal failure, neuropathy, and retinopathy that leads to blindness.

**Diabetic Retinopathy**

With the rising number of pediatric T1DM and T2DM cases, more children and adolescents have been at risk of developing diabetic retinopathy (DR) and experiencing visual impairment. Because DR may progress without any symptoms, conducting an annual retinal examination on diabetic children and adolescents and initiating appropriate ophthalmic therapy are crucial to prevent irreversible visual loss. Children and adolescents should get their first DR screening test when they are 10 to 12 years old or when it has been 2 to 5 years since being diagnosed with diabetes. Patients with prolonged DR may present with “hard exudates,” which are lipid deposits that look like dots on the fundus of the eye, in their retina. These deposits in the macula may lead to the development of diabetic maculopathy.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Managing pediatric obesity requires multidisciplinary efforts from health professionals at different levels, including physicians, school nurses, and diabetes educators.

**Primary Care**

Family medicine physicians and pediatricians should educate pediatric patients and their parents regarding the importance of maintaining a healthy balance between diet and physical activity. They should help the patients and their family members to gradually reduce the amount of fast food and sweetened beverages they consume and increase nutritious snacks, fruits, and vegetables. Providers should perform appropriate screenings to manage obesity effectively and efficiently.

Some of the recommendations for pediatric obesity screening appear below:

- Obtain a fasting lipid profile for overweight children and adolescents with BMI 85-95 percentile

- Obtain a hemoglobin A1c or fasting blood glucose panel and AST and ALT blood tests if overweight children are over ten years old and have one or more risk factors (elevated blood pressure or lipid levels, smoker, or have a family member with obesity-related diseases)

- Obtain a fasting lipid panel when children have no risk factors but are with BMI ≥95th percentile, regardless of their age.

- Obtain a fasting blood glucose or HbA1C test and liver function tests when children aged over ten years have no risk factors but present with BMI ≥95th percentile.

- If lipids levels are normal, screening should be repeated every two years. If the levels are borderline, repeat in 1 year. If the levels are abnormal, repeat in 2 weeks to 3 months.

**School Nurses**

School nurses may play a crucial role in pediatric obesity management since they work closely with children at school. School nurses who are experts in motivational interviewing and weight management can counsel students about their diet and exercise and encourage them to maintain a healthy lifestyle. They can continue to monitor children as they move from grade to grade, and thus can ensure the children in obesity management programs follow the program regimen for longer durations. School nurses may also have regular telephone consultations or in-person counseling sessions with parents and discuss nutrition and physical activity that are necessary at home.

**Diabetes Educators**

Diabetes educators can serve as an essential link between school nurses and pediatric endocrinologists. School nurses often reach out to diabetes educators to discuss suspected pediatric diabetes cases who triage patients before referring them to endocrinologists. They help primary care providers and school nurses select children who need a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist for T2DM treatment or children who require assistance with lifestyle management.
