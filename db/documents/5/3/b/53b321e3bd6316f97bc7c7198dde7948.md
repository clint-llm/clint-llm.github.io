Bleeding during the second half of pregnancy is usually due to either placental abruption or placenta previa.  Differentiating these 2 conditions is important to the care of the patient. The information below compares the presentation of placental abruption and placenta previa on common parameters included in an obstetrical examination.

- The onset of symptoms is sudden and intense for placental abruption but quiet and insidious for placenta previa

- Bleeding may be visible or concealed with placental abruption and is external and visible with placenta previa

- The degree of anemia or shock is greater than the visible blood loss in placental abruption and is equal to the blood loss in placenta previa.

- Pain is intense and acute in placental abruption and is unrelated to placenta previa.

- The uterine tone is firm and board-like in placental abruption and soft and relaxed in placenta previa.
