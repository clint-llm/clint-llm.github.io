One of the significant concerns regarding prostate cancer screening is overdiagnosis. Overtreatment of low-grade prostate cancer can decrease the quality of life by adding treatment-associated side effects and psychological harm. Such outcomes are particularly problematic when the malignancy would possibly not have caused clinical harm to the patient. This outcome can be overcome by greater utilization of active surveillance (monitoring) for low-grade prostate cancers.

Active surveillance is one of the management strategies in which a select group of low-grade cancer patients is under close observation and monitoring. They are followed throughout their disease course, expecting intervention only if their cancer progresses or advances.
