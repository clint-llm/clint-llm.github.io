An ischemic-reperfusion injuryÂ triggers the systemic inflammatory process in HELLP syndrome. The spiral arteries which fail to remodel because of inadequate trophoblast invasion or defective endothelial apoptosis result in ischemia of the placenta. This causes activation of endothelium, which is accompanied by an increased release of antiangiogenic factors, which leads to multiorgan microvascular injury. In addition, abnormal oxidation of fatty acids by the fetus and release of metabolic intermediates into the mother's circulation causes liver and vascular dysfunction. This occurs when the fetus has an inherited defect in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. The inflammatory component includes increased leukocytes and pro-inflammatory cytokines with a reduction in anti-inflammatory cytokines.

The coagulation cascade is activated by the adhesion of platelets on the activated and damaged endothelium. Platelets release thromboxane A and serotonin, causing vasospasm, platelet aggregation, and further endothelial damage. This causes the usage of platelets and hence, thrombocytopenia. The red blood cells break down while passing through these platelet-fibrin-rich capillaries, causing microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Multiorgan microvascular injury and hepatic necrosis lead to the development of HELLP syndrome. The cascade terminates with the delivery of the fetus.
