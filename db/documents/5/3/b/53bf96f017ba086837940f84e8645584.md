Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a primitive pediatric malignant soft tissue sarcoma of skeletal muscle phenotype that originates from a primitive mesenchymal cell. Most cases are diagnosed in children under the age of 6. The etiology and risk factors remain largely unknown. Most cases of rhabdomyosarcoma are sporadic; however, the disease is associated with familial syndromes. Rhabdomyosarcoma types include embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (approximately 60%), alveolar (approximately 20%), pleomorphic (approximately 10%), and spindle/sclerosing (approximately 10%). The survival of rhabdomyosarcoma patients has improved, especially in the last decade, mainly due to interprofessional disease management approaches. This activity highlights the presentation, diagnosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of rhabomyosarcoma.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the histopathology of rhabdomyosarcoma.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with rhabdomyosarcoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for rhabdomyosarcoma.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by rhabdomyosarcoma.
