The treatment of Holt-Oram syndrome is individualized and based on specific symptoms. In some cases, many providers are involved, including pediatricians, cardiologists, nurse practitioners, surgeons, and orthopedists.

Medications to consider depend on the specific cardiac defects. For example, if congestive heart failure is present, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-adrenergic antagonists, andÂ cardiac glycosides may be warranted.

Surveillance is critical and should include an annual electrocardiogram. If a patient has a conduction abnormality, an annual Holter monitor should be considered. Finally, those patients with septal defects should have an echocardiogram every one to 5 years. The outlook of these patients depend on the severity of the defects and number of defects. If the cardiac defect is left untreated, it can lead to eisenmenger syndrome.
