Severe insulin reactions may be proven fatal, so it is essential to contact EMS immediately when an individual is disoriented or unconscious. The patients with diabetes should also reach out to their clinicians if they begin to experience frequent hypoglycemic episodes, as they may need to have adjustments made to their medication regimen, meal plans, or even their exercise/activity regimen. Non-diabetic individuals who show signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia should contact their clinician to further evaluate their situation. Severe or prolonged hypoglycemia can be life-threatening, and in patients with diabetes, there is a correlation with increased mortality. In non-diabetic individuals experiencing reactive hypoglycemia, the prognosis is good.
