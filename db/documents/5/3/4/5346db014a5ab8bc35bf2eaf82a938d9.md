The GP receives its blood supply from the anterior choroidal artery (AChA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), and anterior cerebral artery (ACA). The MCA provides the majority of the blood supply. The perforating branches of the ACA supply the anterior and inferior portions of the GP. The perforating arteries from the MCA perfuse the majority of the superior and posterior portions of the lateral section of the GP. Heubnerâ€™s artery (which arises from the A1 or A2 segment of the ACA or at the junction of the ACA with the anterior communicating artery) and the ACA also supply a small portion of the lateral segment of the GP.

The venous drainage of the GP derives from veins that drain the adjacent basal ganglia, particularly caudate and putamen. The system forms from a deep and ventricular group of veins. The deep group subdivides into a group of inferior striate veins that drain the putamen and caudate nuclei. The deep group of veins joins the deep middle cerebral and basal veins. The ventricular group of veins drains the caudate nucleus. The ventricular group joins the internal cerebral and basal veins.

The GP, as a part of the basal ganglia, has a similar lymphatic drainage system as the cerebral cortex. The lymphatic system of the cerebral cortex forms from perivascular, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and olfactory drainage pathways, as well as meningeal lymphatic vessels.
