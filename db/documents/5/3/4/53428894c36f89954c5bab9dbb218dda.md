The various stages of urine collection, whether collection itself, storage, and preservation, have a tremendous impact on the results of a urine culture. Without adequate care, specimens can become contaminated with perineal, vaginal, or periurethral flora. The presence of the true pathogenic agent can be obscured due to the contamination, whether due to an overgrowth or an inhibition of the true pathogens. Even more than that, the medium in which the specimen is stored also plays a significant role in the true urinary pathogen. Inhibition of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae have been observed with the use of boric acid as the storage and preservation medium.
