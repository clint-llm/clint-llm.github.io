The primary factor influencing the occurrence of dizygotic twins is the usage of infertility ovulation induction drugs. Almost one-third of all twin infants born in the United States can be attributed to iatrogenic interventions, including medication use, in vitro fertilization (IVF), ovulation induction, and superovulation with intrauterine insemination. IVF also interestingly increases the risk of embryo cleavage that can generate complications of monozygotic twinning. Maternal age is associated with an increased risk for dizygotic twins.

There are racial and ethnic population variations in the prevalence of dizygotic twins, with the risk of 1.3 per 1000 births in Japan to 8 per 1000 births in the United States and Europe. The risk uniquely increases in Nigeria, where dizygotic twins comprise up to 50 per 1000 births. With parity, there seems to be an increased risk for dizygotic twins even when adjusted for maternal age. Maternal family history for twinning adds to the risk, but the paternal history is non-contributory. Some studies have suggested those patients with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 30 kg/m2 have a high risk for dizygotic twins.
