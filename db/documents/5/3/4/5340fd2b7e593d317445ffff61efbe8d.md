Methamphetamine was initially synthesized in the early 1900s and used unregulated as a nasal decongestant, to enhance alertness, and for weight loss. It was used extensively by myriad armed forces in World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam War. Initially, Japan experienced a high prevalence of abuse in the 1950s, followed by the United States in the 1960s. The street name “crank” refers to biker gangs’ transport of methamphetamine hidden in their motorcycle crankcase. The southwestern and west coast states (including Hawaii) reported the highest prevalence of abuse from the 1970s to the 1990s. Over the past decade, all regions of the United States have experienced a significant increase in the number of persons using the drug and emergency department visits. In the USA, methamphetamine abusers are predominantly white males in their 30s and 40s. More recently, epidemic abuse has been described in adolescents. Methamphetamine abusers tend to be mendacious and mistrustful of health care professionals when describing their drug history.
