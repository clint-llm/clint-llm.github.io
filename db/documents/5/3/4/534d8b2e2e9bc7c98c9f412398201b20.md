Encephalocele attributes to the developmental abnormalities delineated by the herniation of neural tissue through a skull defect. In children with tissue masses in the nasal cavity, presenting with breathing difficulties, menigocephaloceles or meningoceles should be suspected. Clinicians often misdiagnose them as polyps or tumors. Inappropriate treatment of undiagnosed hernias may lead to secondary meningitis or fluid leak due to their incision or puncture.

MRI is a non-invasive, safe imaging method that allows a definite diagnosis of menigocephaloceles and meningoceles. Noonan syndrome shares some similar characteristic facial features as lateral meningocele syndrome. Facial features of lateral meningocele syndrome comprise of arched eyebrows, ptosis, flat midface, thin upper lip, low-set, and posteriorly angulated ears, and low posterior hairline, hands with wide and short distal second and third fingers(pseudo-clubbing).
