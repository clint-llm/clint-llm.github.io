The anterior compartment of the leg is vital in the dorsiflexion of the foot, the extension of the toes, and inversion/eversion of the foot. For this reason, it is tested during the physical exam to assess the range of motion and motor strength of the ankles and toes. Weakened or absent motor strength can indicate muscle or nerve damage to the anterior compartment of the leg.

As discussed above, the anterior compartment of the leg is the most common site for compartment syndrome. Compartment syndrome may occur acutely following blunt force injury or trauma, or as a chronic, an exertional syndrome commonly seen in athletes.

The anterior compartment of the leg can also be involved in deep vein thrombosis. DVT is one of the most frequent complications after major orthopedic surgery.
