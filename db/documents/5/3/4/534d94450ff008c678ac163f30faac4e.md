The pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes is complex and not completely understood. It is believed to be multifactorial with both a functional and structural component.

Functional abnormalities seen in CFRD stem from a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene. CFTR gets expressed in pancreatic beta-cells where its exact role remains unknown. Animal models suggest that CFTR has an intrinsic role in insulin secretion, and mutations in the CFTR gene result in abnormal beta-cell function with decreased insulin secretion in response to a glucose load.

In addition to functional impairment of the beta cell, structural damage to pancreatic islet cells also occurs due to the defective CFTR protein. CFTR protein is present in the ductal epithelial cells of the pancreas. A mutation in this protein interferes with normal chloride channel function, resulting in lower water content and high viscosity of the pancreatic secretions; subsequently, the retained pancreatic enzymes lead to autodigestion, cyst formation, and progressive fibrosis of the pancreas. This progressive fibrosis ultimately causes decreased islet cell mass by destroying endocrine beta, alpha, and pancreatic polypeptide secreting cells. Both insulin and glucagon insufficiencies occur as a result of total islet destruction. Premature loss of exocrine function is an increased risk factor for the development of CFRD.
