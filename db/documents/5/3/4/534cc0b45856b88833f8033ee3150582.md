Patients typically present with postprandial pain that "comes and goes," hence the term colic. The pain is usually in the RUQ of the abdomen and may have radiation into the back. With uncomplicated biliary colic, patients will likely present only with pain. However, some may also report nausea and/or vomiting. These symptoms are accentuated after meals.

Biliary colic patients are afebrile and will commonly have no abnormal vitals in contrast to acute cholecystitis or cholangitis, which may present with fevers, tachycardia, or even hypotension if they progress to septic shock.

Patients with biliary colic will generally only have right upper quadrant (RUQ) or epigastric tenderness on physical exam. Abdominal distension and rebound tenderness are less common. Jaundice is not seen with blockage of the cystic duct; however, it is common with blockage of the common bile duct due to an elevation of direct bilirubin. This finding would suggest a more serious obstruction of the biliary tree and should raise suspicion for potential cholangitis rather than biliary colic.
