Obtaining accreditation involves understanding the leadership structure of the program (if affiliated with an institution). It is paramount to set up a form of governance specifically for the simulation program and to include all stakeholders involved. This can include the director of the program, faculty, Director of Research, Director of Finance, student representatives, hospital representatives (should the program be affiliated with any), and other persons who would benefit from the long term direction of the center.

It is well understood that the very essence of medical simulation-based education is to improve learner communication skills, develop leadership expertise, promote highly functional and efficient teamwork, and enhance medical knowledge and skills through skillfully debriefed sessions and deliberate practice.  None of these goals are easily obtainable, and all of these goals require high-level facilitator and simulation team experience and expertise.   The accreditation process is highly beneficial in creating the necessity for a simulation center to self-evaluate and critique its programs and policies and address avenues that may lead to further simulation center excellence.  Obtaining SSH accreditation often only occurs after a program has internally evaluated and optimized its learning environment and has codified its policies and principles as an educational site.
