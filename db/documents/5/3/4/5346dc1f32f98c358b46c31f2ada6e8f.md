Gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) is a result of any disease process that causes a mechanical impediment to gastric emptying. It can be caused by mechanical causes as well as motility disorders and typically is associated with abdominal pain, postprandial vomiting, early satiety, and weight loss. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of gastric outlet obstruction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of gastric outlet obstruction.
- Review how to evaluate a patient with gastric outlet obstruction.

- Outline the approach to treating gastric outlet obstruction depending on the etiology of the disease.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with gastric outlet obstruction.
