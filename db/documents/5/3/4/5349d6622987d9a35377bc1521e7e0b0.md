Tetanus is characterized by severe, diffuse muscle contractions. The muscular rigidity and spasms of tetanus are caused by tetanus toxin (tetanospasmin). The transmission of C. tetani is through the exposure of a deep tissue wound to the spores which are present in soil or fecal matter from animals or humans. Given that C. tetani is an obligate anaerobe, the anaerobic tissue wound provides an ideal environment for the replication and growth of C. tetani. Following extensive bacterial replication at the wound site, an expression of the genes encoding the 2 toxins, tetanospasmin, and tetanolysin, occur. Tetanospasmin is taken up at the nerve terminals of the peripheral nervous system and can interfere with the vesicular release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Thus, an initial presenting symptom of tetanus is flaccid paralysis which can resemble the effects of C. botulinum. However, the toxin is transported in a retrograde fashion toward the central nervous system and eventually reaching the spinal cord or brainstem. It is here that the tetanus toxin produces its characteristic satellite of symptoms. The toxin causes inhibition of the release of GABA and glycine inside inhibitory nerve terminals that control the activity of the lower motor neurons. Thus, this action causes a hyperactivity effect leading to involuntary contraction of the skeletal muscles.
