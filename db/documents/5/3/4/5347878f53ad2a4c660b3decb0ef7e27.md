Cardiac defects for which the Fontan completion procedure may be considered include:

- Tricuspid atresia

- Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (most common)

- Hypoplastic right heart syndrome

- Pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum

- Double-inlet left ventricle

- Double outlet right ventricle

- Unbalanced atrioventricular canal defects

- Ebstein anomalies that areÂ adequate for Fontan correction

- Congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries

This procedure typically occurs in childhood. Optimal physiologic and anatomical considerations include good ventricular function, normal pulmonary vascular resistance, and adequately-sized pulmonary arteries.
