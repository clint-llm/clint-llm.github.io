Anterior uveitis (iritis) is the inflammation of the anterior chamber and the iris. Uveitis is often idiopathic, but it may be triggered by genetic, immune, traumatic, or infectious mechanisms. The symptoms include redness, sensitivity to light, and pain. Slit-lamp examination reveals cells in the anterior chamber. Proper evaluation is necessary for recurrent anterior uveitis. The management options include topical steroids and cycloplegics. With appropriate treatment and follow-up, it has a good prognosis. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of iritis.
- Review the steps for evaluating iritis.
- Summarize the treatment options of iritis.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by iritis.
