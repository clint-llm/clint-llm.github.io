Despite these disadvantages, the need for mini implants will continue to grow, especially among edentulous patients because of the following:

- An increase in the need for complete dentures

- The increased cost of standard implants

- Access-to-care issues, especially among economically disadvantaged patients and patients indicated for maxillofacial prostheses

- Medically compromised patients who may not be candidates for traditional surgical procedures or ridge augmentation procedures

- Use of mini implants as transitional implants to support prosthesis during the healing phase of implant denture restoration.

- As an alternative to the standard implants, when inadequate space and limited bone is available, a mini implant-supported permanent single crown can be placed

- Increased interest in implant dentistry among general dentists

Therefore, the current evidence must be reviewed and synthesized with the available clinical data on the survival of mini implants for definitive prosthodontic treatment.

Following factors influence the clinical success of mini implants:

1. Mini implant design: Improvement of implant shape, thread patterns and surface treatments lead to enhanced primary stability and faster osseointegration

2. Size of mini-implant effects the area of possible retention in bones

3. Favorable occlusion and masticatory forces significantly influence mini-implant success

4. Number and position of mini-implant within the prosthesis affect the forces acting on the bone surrounding the implants

5. The stress distribution is influenced by implant diameter and shape along with the load direction
