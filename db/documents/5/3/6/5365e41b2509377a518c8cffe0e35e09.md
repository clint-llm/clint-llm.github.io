In adolescents with rectal prolapse, symptoms include tenesmus, anorectal pain, and passage of blood and mucus. In children, rectal prolapse is typically brought to medical attention after being detected by the patientâ€™s parents. A dark red mass with or without mucus and blood that protrudes from the rectum during straining is described, yet this is commonly spontaneously resolved by the time the patient presents. Prolapse is usually painless or associated with only mild discomfort. At the time of prolapse, decreased or absent rectal tone may be present on a digital rectal exam, but the tone is usually normal after a few hours.
