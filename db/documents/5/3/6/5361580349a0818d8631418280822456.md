Initial assessment begins with following the standard principles of trauma assessment and resuscitation protocols.  The mechanism of injury should be determined and can help guide treatment.  Physical exam should include whole body evaluation for other signs of trauma/associated injuries.  A complete review of the musculoskeletal system is required, especially of the peripheral nerves and skin.  Soft tissue should undergo evaluation for the possibility of a Morel-Lavalle lesion.
