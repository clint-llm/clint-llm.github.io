Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a debilitating illness that often goes under-reported. It is important to screen patients for symptoms of the disorder. It is crucial to educate the medical professionals to be more aware, as well as those in the school systems, who typically work with adolescents. By localizing areas in the brain and honing in on the neurotransmitters specifically involved, we are making headway at further defining what OCD is. As OCD affects a significant portion of the population, having therapists equipped to handle the disorder is crucial. It is our responsibility as health care professionals to raise awareness and make treatment options known. An interprofessional team of primary care providers, psychiatrists, psychologists, psychiatric nurses, social workers, and pharmacists improves outcomes. Pharmacists review prescriptions, provide patient and family education, and assist the team by checking for drug interactions. Clinicians can also consult with board-certified psychiatric pharmacists to most effectively prescribe the correct agents. Psychiatric nurses monitor patients, provide education, and communicate status updates to the team. With this interprofessional approach to care, OCD patients can experience improved outcomes.
