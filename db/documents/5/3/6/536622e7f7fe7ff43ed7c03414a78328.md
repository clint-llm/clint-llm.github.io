Occupational exposure to beryllium and other metals is a health risk to workers worldwide. Increased regulations such as limiting the permissible exposure limit (PEL) of beryllium in US workers, enforced by governing bodies such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), have made acute beryllium pneumonitis rare. But, despite this increase in safety, the mortality from tracheal, bronchial, and lung cancer resulting from general, occupational carcinogen exposure has increased globally from 1990 to 2019.

One study found that the standardized mortality ratio for berylliosis in workers involved in nuclear weapons research was significantly elevated.

While beryllium toxicity is more commonly due to occupational exposure, the general public also has exposure risk. Beryllium can be present in small amounts in contaminated soil, air, food, or water. Individuals who live near waste disposal sites, in particular, may be at increased risk for beryllium exposure through the soil.
