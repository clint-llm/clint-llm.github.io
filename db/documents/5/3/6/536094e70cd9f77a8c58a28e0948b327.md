The primary function of skeletal muscle contraction is to allow for the performance of specific movements. Skeletal muscle also provides structural support, maintains the body's posture, stores amino acids, and maintains core body temperature via shivering.

There are two types of cardiac muscle cells, autorhythmic and contractile. Autorhythmic cardiac cells do not contract; they set the pace of contraction for other cardiac muscle cells, which the ANS can modulate.Â Contractile cardiac cells (cardiomyocytes) constitute the majority of the heart muscle and can contract.

There are two types of smooth muscle cells, single-unit and multiunit. Single-unit smooth muscle cells are found in the gut and blood vessels. They are linked together via gap junctions, allowing for contraction as a functional syncytium. They also contract myogenically and can be modulated by the ANS.
