A cutaneous horn is usually evident upon physical examination and can be described as a white or yellow exophytic protrusion in the shape of an animal horn. Unlike animal horns that usually contain an osseous cast, cutaneous horns consist solely of cornified proliferative keratinocytes without a bony component. The color, size, shape, and dimensions can vary significantly, so clinical suspicion should be confirmed by histopathological analysis. This activity describes the evaluation and management of a patient with a cutaneous horn and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of a cutaneous horn.
- Review the appropriate points in the evaluation of a cutaneous horn.
- Outline the management options available for a cutaneous horn.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of cutaneous horns and improve outcomes.
