Mitral regurgitation (MR) is caused by the retrograde flow of blood from the left ventricle (LV) into the left atrium (LA) through the mitral valve (MV), causing a systolic murmur heard best at the apex of the heart with radiation to the left axilla. MR is the most common valvular abnormality worldwide, affecting over 2% of the total population and has a prevalence that increases with age. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of mitral regurgitation and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of mitral regurgitation medical conditions and emergencies.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of mitral regurgitation.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for mitral regurgitation.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance mitral regurgitation and improve outcomes.
