**NRTIs**

Compete with natural deoxynucleotides for incorporation into a growing viral DNA chain. However, NRTIs lack a 3'-hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose moiety. This difference results in incorporating an NRTI, and the next incoming deoxynucleotide cannot form the following 5', 3' phosphodiester bond needed to extend the DNA chain. The result is a chain termination in DNA synthesis.

**NNRTIs**

Block reverse transcriptase (RT) by directly binding to the enzyme. Though NNRTIs do not get incorporated into the viral DNA, they inhibit the movement of protein domains of RT that are essential to carrying out the DNA synthesis.

**Protease Inhibitors**

Bind HIV-1 protease and block proteolytic cleavage of protein precursors necessary for producing viral particles.

**Fusion Inhibitors**

Disrupt binding, fusion, and entry of HIV virions into a human cell. Enfuvirtide binds to gp41 and disrupts membrane attachment.

**CCR5 Antagonist**

Maraviroc blocks the CCCR receptor on the T-Cell to prevent viral attachment.

**Integrase Inhibitors**

Block the action of integrase, preventing the viral genome from inserting itself into the DNA of a host cell.

**Post-Attachment Inhibitors**

This class is a monoclonal antibody that binds CD4 inhibiting viral entry into the cell.

**Pharmacokinetic Enhancers**

Inhibition of human CYP3A protein, increasing plasma concentration of other anti-HIV drugs.
