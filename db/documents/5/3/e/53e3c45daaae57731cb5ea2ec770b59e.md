Intoxications regularly go hand-in-hand with addictions as they can either be the subject of the addiction or the propelling factor towards behavioral disruptions and suicidal tendencies. For that reason, refer to the following list of intoxications/overdoses and their respective antidotes.

Further management involves monitoring and maintaining patient vital signs. Once again, this is dependent on the stage of presentation of the patient and the subject of the addiction.

While multiple pharmacological treatments are available to the two most common substance addictions – smoking tobacco and alcohol – group meetings and psychological and social support are by far the most effective.

Pharmacologically, alcohol dependence is treatable with disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate.

For tobacco dependence pharmacologically, there is currently bupropion and varenicline.

Ultimately, however, these pharmacological interventions must be combined with non-pharmacological methods for optimal efficacy and to limit and prevent the progression of substance use from developing to misuse to dependence. For example, in terms of nicotine dependence, it has been shown that pharmacological treatments employed with physician advice and empathy results in approximately double the rate of long-term abstinence.

Of interest, more addicts have overcome their addiction in their way vs the amount enrolled in a program (12-step, CBT, etc).
