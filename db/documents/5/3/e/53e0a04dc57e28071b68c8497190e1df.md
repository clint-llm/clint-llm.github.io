The surgical considerations for the arteries of the hand are to ensure that the structures will have proper blood flow before and after surgical intervention. The anatomy of the arteries in the hand itself is usually sufficient to maintain blood flow from the collateral anastomoses from the radial and ulnar arteries, but sometimes with variations in development, there may be an absence in collateral blood flow formation.

The scaphoid bone is one of the structures that suffer from inadequate blood supply after injury, so if surgery is performed to repair the scaphoid bone and the blood supply is not properly restored, the bone itself will not heal.

In patients with myocardial infarction, the placement of a stent in the coronary artery is an option if open-heart surgery is not indicated or if the patient prefers stent placement. In some patients that receive coronary artery stent, the cannulation site may be the radial artery. If a patient is a candidate for stent placement with the use of the radial artery, the length of the hospital stay decreases compared to other methods.
