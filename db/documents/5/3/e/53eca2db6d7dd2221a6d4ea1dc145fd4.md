Managing a bariatric patient with severe obesity is both challenging and complex. While a skilled surgeon is required for surgical success, the care surrounding this patient requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary team. To derive favorable outcomes, meet the goals and objectives of healthy weight loss and maintenance long-term, a patient must be counseled appropriately with the aid of the bariatric team. This team includes a registered dietitian, bariatric medical specialist, bariatric nurses, and bariatric surgeon. It is essential to incorporate assistance from each team member of the interprofessional healthcare to optimize the patient for success. [Level 5]

A retrospective observational study that analyzed multidisciplinary team treatment decisions to proceed with bariatric surgery found that an interprofessional format changed surgical decision-making for a significant number of patients. Specifically, there was an interprofessional team agreement for 55% of patients to proceed to surgery versus 45% team disagreement. The most common reason for the failure of team agreement was the patient’s nonadherence to attending appointments. Overall, using a single-day multidisciplinary team clinic format improved the quality of care for patients and likely avoided preventable bad outcomes. The interprofessional team approach for bariatric surgery is valuable and should be the standard of care.
