Cyst: Cysts have variable wall thickness but are usually thin-walled (< 2 mm) and occur without associated pulmonary emphysema on CT scans. Pathologically, a cyst is any round circumscribed space surrounded by an epithelial or fibrous wall of variable thickness.

Bullae: A bulla is an airspace measuring more than 1 cm that is sharply demarcated by a thin wall not more than 1 mm thickness. Radiologically, it appears as a rounded focal lucency or decreased attenuation. Bullae are usually located in the subpleural lung rather than within the lung parenchyma. Multiple bullae are usually accompanied by adjacent paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema. Bullae can be distinguished from cysts by their almost imperceptible thin-wall, subpleural location, and accompanying adjacent emphysema.

Cavitary lesion: A cavity is a gas-filled space that is observed as a lucency or low-attenuated area within pulmonary consolidation, a mass, or a nodule. Cavity wall thickness may vary, but the wall is usually relatively thick. Some cavitary lesions may appear as thin-walled cavities or cysts at their end-stage presentation. Many different diseases present as cavitary lesions e.g., acute to chronic infections, chronic systemic diseases, primary or metastatic malignancies. A cavity is differentiated from a cyst by the presence of a thicker wall and a more irregular shape.

A history of trauma helps distinguish post-traumatic pneumatocele from these conditions. However, if the lesion does not decrease in size over time, etiologies other than TPP should be sought out. This is particularly true in countries where other causes of cavitary pulmonary lesions are endemic. A previous chest x-ray may help perform the comparison and narrowing differentials.

Ventilator-induced pneumatoceles are a manifestation of intrathoracic air leaks of prematurity. They are markers for ventilator-induced lung injury and are associated with significant mortality. Conservative management with a reduction in mean airway pressure is effective in the resolution of this condition, and surgical intervention is generally not necessary.
