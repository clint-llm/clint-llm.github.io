Prognosis in the case of choroidal folds depends upon the associated underlying conditions:

- Idiopathic choroidal folds, acquired hyperopia with choroidal folds usually have good visual acuity and good prognosis.

- Choroidal folds in association with diode endolaser photocoagulation remain stable over the long term.

- Prognosis in cases of hypotony is good if detected early and treated. The choroidal folds may disappear completely if intra-ocular pressure returns to normal.

- Prognosis in cases of uveal effusion is variable with permanent loss of vision in severe cases.

- In cases of posterior scleritis, visual prognosis is good if treatment is initiated early.

- Prompt and aggressive treatment with steroids leads to a good visual prognosis in Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease.

- Prognosis is usually good in cases of space flight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome.
