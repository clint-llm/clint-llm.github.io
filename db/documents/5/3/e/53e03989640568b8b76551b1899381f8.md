Many causes of organ toxicity due to beta-lactamase inhibitor therapy are directly related to the toxic effects of the beta-lactam antimicrobial with which they are co-administered. Allergic reactions can lead to bronchoconstriction, urticaria, intravascular hemolysis, and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. Neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, genotoxicity, and urogenital organ toxicity have also been noted.****Though beta-lactamase inhibitor therapy is generally considered to be safe, the wide array of toxic effects associated with the use of these drugs underscores the importance of routine monitoring of patients taking beta-lactam antimicrobial/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations. The treatment for toxicity associated with beta-lactamase inhibitor therapy is the cessation of drug use.
