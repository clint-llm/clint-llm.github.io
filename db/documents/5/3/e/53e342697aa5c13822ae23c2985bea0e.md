**Serous Cystadenoma**

Macroscopic findings:

Serous cystadenoma ranges in size from 1 to more than 30 cm in greatest dimension (mean = 10 cm). They have a smooth outer surface and contain one or more thin-walled cysts filled with clear, watery fluid.

Histopathology:

Serous cystadenomas are composed of cysts and papillae lined by non-stratified or stratified cuboidal to columnar cells resembling fallopian tube epithelium.

Immunohistochemistry:

The immunohistochemical profile of serous cystadenoma is similar to that of normal ovarian surface epithelium and tubal epithelium. In addition to positivity with most commonly used epithelial markers, p63 is positive in most cases.

**Mucinous Cystadenoma**

Macroscopic findings:

Mucinous cystadenomas have a smooth surface and are usually multilocular and sometimes unilocular. They range in size from a few centimeters to greater than 30 cm; with a mean of 10 cm.

Histopathology:

Mucinous cystadenoma is composed of multiple cysts and glands lined by simple non-stratified mucinous epithelium resembling gastric foveolar-type or intestinal epithelium containing goblet cells and sometimes neuroendocrine cells or Paneth cells.  The ovarian stroma may be cellular with areas of stromal luteinization. There are no cytologic atypia and no mitotic figures.

**Endometrioid Cystadenoma**

Macroscopic findings: the cysts range in size up to 15 cm. The cyst lining is irregular with areas of hemorrhage. The cyst contents are typically dark brown due to old hemorrhage (chocolate cyst).

Histopathology: the rare endometrioid cystadenomas are similar to endometriotic cysts but lack endometrial stroma, hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and a myofibroblastic wall. There are no cytologic atypia and no mitotic figures.

**Clear Cell Cystadenoma**

Macroscopic findings:

Clear cell cystadenoma ranges in size from 3 to 16 cm. It has a smooth, lobulated external surface.

Histopathology:

Clear cell cystadenoma is composed of glands or cysts lined by cuboidal to flattened cells with clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm embedded in a fibromatous stroma. There are no cytologic atypia and no mitotic figures.

**Seromucinous Cystadenoma**

Macroscopic findings:

Grossly, seromucinous cystadenomas present as a unilocular cyst with a smooth surface and inner lining. They may contain serous or mucinous fluid.

Histopathology:

Histologically, the cysts are lined by a variable admixture of serous and mucinous cells (endocervical-type) but endometrial and less often transitional or squamous cells may be in evidence. If present, the stroma is bland and fibromatous.
