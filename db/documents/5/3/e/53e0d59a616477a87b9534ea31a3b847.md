The embryologic period occurs during the first eight weeks following fertilization. During this time, neural crest cells migrate caudally to form the five pharyngeal arches. The first and second pharyngeal arches give rise to the anterior and posterior bellies of the digastrics as well as their respective nerve supplies. The anterior belly of the digastric and the mylohyoid nerve form from the first pharyngeal arch, also known as the mandibular arch. TheÂ posterior belly of the digastric and the facial nerve derives from the second pharyngeal arch or the hyoid arch.

Other muscular structures derived from the first pharyngeal arch include the mylohyoid, tensor veli palatini, tensor tympani, and mastication muscles, including the temporalis, masseter, and medial and lateral pterygoids. In addition to the posterior belly of the digastric, the second pharyngeal arch gives rise to the stapedius, buccinator, auricular, occipitofrontalis, facial muscles, platysma, and stylohyoid muscles.
