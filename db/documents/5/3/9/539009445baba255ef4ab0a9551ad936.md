The liver is the main organ affected by the toxic effects of aflatoxin. Histopathologic changes in acute hepatotoxicity due to aflatoxin toxicity are fatty changes in hepatocytes, acute hemorrhagic necrosis, and bile duct proliferation.

Also, chronic aflatoxin exposure may present with histopathologic features of cirrhosis, such as nodular degeneration and fibrosis leading to distortion of the hepaticÂ architecture and HCC, which are well-vascularized tumors with wide trabeculae, small cell changes, vascular invasion, prominent acinar pattern, atypia, mitotic activity, and absence of Kupffer cells.
