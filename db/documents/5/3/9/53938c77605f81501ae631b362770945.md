Ventral hernias of the abdomen are non-inguinal, non-hiatal defects in the fascia of the abdominal wall. They are commonly seen in clinical practice. The repair of these abdominal wall defects is a common surgery performed by general surgeons. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of ventral hernias and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of ventral hernias.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a ventral hernia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for ventral hernias.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of ventral hernias and improve outcomes.
