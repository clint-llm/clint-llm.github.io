There are two muscles of the iris and they both consist of smooth muscle. The sphincter muscle contracts the pupil in a circular motion while the dilator muscles enlarge the pupil by pulling the iris radially. An area called the iris collarette is the thickest portion of the iris where the sphincter muscle and dilator muscle overlap. While the collarette is typically flat, there are cases in which this structure can be rather prominent.
