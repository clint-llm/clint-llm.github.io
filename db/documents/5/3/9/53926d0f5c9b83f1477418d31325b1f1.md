Patients with newly-diagnosed scleritis should undergo clinical and laboratory evaluation for vasculitis, including CBC, CMP, urinalysis, P-ANCA, C-ANCA, ESR, C-reactive protein, and chest x-ray. Systemic infections such as Lyme disease or syphilis must also be ruled out.

Patients with a high-risk history should be further evaluated for infectious scleritis. Infectious scleritis should be cultured by swab, spatula, or biopsy of the sclera. Specimens should be cultured on blood and chocolate agar, thioglycolate, Sabourad dextrose agar, non-nutrient agar with E.Coli, and brain- heart infusion broth.
