Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique used in the diagnosis and therapeutic response monitoring of various cancers, neurological diseases, cardiovascular disorders, and also infectious diseases. Computerized tomography (CT)  and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) only provide the anatomic details but cannot detect morphologically normal but functionally abnormal tissues.

On the other hand, PET provides functional information at the molecular level, which is vital in staging and assessing treatment responses in various malignancies. Hybrid imaging combining PET with CT has a high level of sensitivity with simultaneously providing functional and anatomic details and therefore has become crucial in the care of cancer patients.

Multiple positron-emitting radiotracers are in various stages of development, and many of these are now commercially available for use in clinical practice. F18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is the most widely available and increasingly utilized radiopharmaceutical in managing various cancers.

In this article, we will focus on the role of fluorine18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG PET/CT)  in managing lymphoma.
