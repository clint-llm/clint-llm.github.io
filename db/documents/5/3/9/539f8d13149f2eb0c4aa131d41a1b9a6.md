ONSUS remains a relatively new modality for the assessment of ICP. Initial studies have shown that it is an extremely easy skill to acquire and can be performed bilaterally in less than 5 minutes by experienced operators.

Additional research has suggested that novice ultrasound users can obtain proficiency with this scan in as little as 25 exams, while an experienced sonographer might become proficient with as few as ten scans.

Systematic review and meta-analysis have shown that ONSD of more than 5.00 to 5.70 mm has a concurrent ICP value above 20 mm Hg.

ONSD/eyeball transverse diameter (mean value of 0.18) is more reliable than ONSD measurement alone.

- Significant correlation between ONSD and ETD

- Standard deviation between the normal and pathological values for ONSD is often overlapping

- The ratio is independent of demographic variables such as sex, height, weight, and BMI.

ONSD reacts to ICP in real-time. Within the effective range, the chances of plastic deformation and over-distention of the ONS are minimal.

Consensus on the ONSD monitoring as a noninvasive surrogate marker of intracranial pressure monitoring has advocated a checklist for quality assurance pertaining to probe selection, patient safety, positioning, image acquisition, and methods of measurement.
