Enzymes serve as catalysts to chemical reactions in all living organisms. Enzymes and their inhibitors play significant roles throughout all of the human physiology. Metabolism is a carefully correlated collection of reactions to meet the metabolic demands of the body. Demand differs from tissue to tissue, even cell to cell, and may change over time or due to changing conditions. Enzymes and their regulators give cells the precise control over these processes to ensure the meeting of metabolic demands. One example of the importance of non-competitive inhibition is its role in the regulation of metabolism via feedback inhibition.
