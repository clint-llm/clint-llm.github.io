Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a rare mitochondrial disorder that typically presents in young males with progressive visual loss due to optic neuropathy. LHON was the first disease to be associated with mitochondrial DNA point mutations and is, therefore, maternally inherited. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the cause of Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.
- Review the presentation of a patient with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.
- Summarize the treatment options for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.
- Explain the importance of enhancing coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.
