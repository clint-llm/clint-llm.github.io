Erythrokeratodermia is a group of inherited disorders characterized by well-demarcated erythematous lesions and hyperkeratotic plaques. Connexin mutations have been demonstrated to be responsible for most cases of erythrokeratodermia variabilis (EKV). In this condition, we usually observe migratory red patches along with fixed localized or generalized keratotic plaques. Erythrokeratodermia variabilis was also known as Mendes da Costa syndrome.
