Intubation, or placement of an endotracheal tube, is an important life-saving skill.  All clinicians who work in emergency rooms, operating rooms, peri-operative areas, and intensive care units (all places with intubated patients) must understand the basics and mechanics of an endotracheal tube.  This knowledge is necessary for appropriate ventilator settings and the management of intensive care-level patients.
