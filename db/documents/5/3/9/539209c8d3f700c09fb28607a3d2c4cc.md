EEG patterns interpreted in isolation cannot inform prognosis, and this principle extends to patterns that define IIC. A comprehensive approach to the prognosis that includes a detailed history, neurological exam, and clinical trajectory are essential components to prognostication, with EEG findings playing a supportive role. The etiology of cerebral dysfunction is most important for the prediction of clinical outcomes.

Given the heterogeneity of causes for these patterns, the prognosis is highly variable. In a cohort of patients with traumatic brain injury, patients with moderate and severe IIC activity as a group did not demonstrate an association with poor outcome, whereas multivariate regression analysis of a group of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage showed periodic discharges to be associated with an 18.8-fold risk of a poor functional outcome on the modified Rankin Scale.

Rhythmic and periodic electrographic patterns in the setting of cardiac arrest are generally associated with poor neurological outcomes, but this is not universally observed, and caution must be exercised when interpreting these findings, particularly if there is concern that the pattern reflects ongoing seizures that are not actively being treated.
