It is important to know how to do a complete and thorough neonatal examination and identify common findings. A systematic approach, ideally completing the same order of physical examinations for each infant, will ensure appropriate milestones in the physical examination. Moreover, it would be pragmatic to rule out anomalies and consider appropriate interventions. Similarly, with a greater number of evaluations and experience of evaluating physicians, having a good vision of normal physical findings will aid in determining deviations from normal.
