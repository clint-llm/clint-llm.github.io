Electron microscopy has been shown to be an effective method in visualizing the process of cornification in the human skin, in which KHG play a large role.  Keratohyalin granules are apparent as electron-dense granules that appear in the cytoplasm of cells where they can be seen forming a sheath around the tonofibrils and ultimately associating with keratin filaments in the more superficial layers of the epidermis.
