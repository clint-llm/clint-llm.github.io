Observation can provide a tremendous amount of feedback concerning the etiology of someone’s gait disturbance. Observing a patient’s tendencies during gait cycles, as well as identifying where they are compensating, is essential. Testing of joint motion, joint pain, extremity force, and coordination are all necessary. Knee, ankle, and foot coordination must be precise.

Laboratory tests are particularly relevant to rule out any metabolic disturbances or vitamin deficiency.
