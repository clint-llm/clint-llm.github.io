Liver injuries make up approximately 5% of all trauma admissions. The liver is the most common solid organ injured in blunt trauma, and patients with hepatic injury usually have other concomitant injuries. Mortality from hepatic trauma depends on the degree of injury. Minor liver injuries make up most hepatic trauma, with 80% to 90% being grades 1 or II. Mortality increases with the grade of injury, and grade VI liver injuries are often fatal. Liver injury is the primary cause of death in severe abdominal trauma and has a 10% to 15% mortality rate.
