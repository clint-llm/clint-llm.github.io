The intercostal nerves are in constant jeopardy of being damaged during thoracotomy procedures. The intercostal nerves are also in danger of damage or transection during the placement of a chest tube. There have been case reports describing chest tube placement techniques that include careful dissection of the intercostal spaces and identification of the intercostal nerve as opposed to a stab insertion of a chest tube. There have also been reports that anesthetic blocks of the intercostal nerves before the closure of a thoracotomy have resulted in hypotension both with and without a spinal block.
