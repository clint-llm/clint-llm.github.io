Sudden cardiac death due to post-infarction arrhythmias is one of the most calamitous sequelae of myocardial infarction. These arrhythmias can also occur with heart failure. Electrical remodeling of the heart in response to structural insult is the underlying mechanism by which these arrhythmias develop. This type of remodeling is secondary electrical remodeling. Changes in different ion channels and intercellular gap junctions pave the way for secondary electrical remodeling. Abnormalities in the repolarization, specifically the lengthening of the duration of the action potential is most often present with this type of electrical remodeling. Intricate changes in the ionic channels of outward K+ currents, late part of inward Na+ currents, and inward Ca2+ currents have implications in the underlying pathophysiology of this kind of electrical remodeling. Current densities and the spatial distribution of ionic channels change with the progression of remodeling, especially in heart failure.
