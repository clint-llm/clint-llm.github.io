Facet joints are formed by the articulations of the superior and inferior articular processes of adjacent vertebrae. Except for the atlantooccipital and atlantoaxial joints, facet joints are lined with synovium and covered by a true joint capsule. The capsule is richly innervated. Each facet joint receives innervation from two spinal levels, one of which is from the dorsal ramus at the same vertebral level and the other of which is from one level above. This explains why facet-related pain is not easy to locate. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of facet arthritis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of facet joint arthritis.
- Outline the components of a proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with a facet joint arthritis, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Summarize the treatment options available for facet joint arthritis.
- Describe how an optimally functioning interprofessional team would coordinate care to enhance outcomes for patients with arthritis of the facet joints.
