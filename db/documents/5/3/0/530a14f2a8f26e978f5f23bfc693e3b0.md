Three primary methods for calculation of medication dosages exist; Dimensional Analysis, Ratio Proportion, and Formula or Desired Over Have Method. We are going to explore the Ratio-Proportion Method, one of these three methods, in more detail.

Ratio-Proportion Method allows us the ability to compare numbers, units of measurement, or values.

Clinicians must define a ratio and proportion. Ratios, often expressed in fraction format, are mathematical works of art designed in relationship patterns that explore comparisons between units, words, numbers. As in any relationship, key players forge a bond to make the association stronger or manageable. Proportions are those key players formed by the equality of ratios. A complicated relationship simplified by utilization and strategic placement of key players of like units or volumes. Ratios and proportions expressed as fractions, canceled out by cross multiplication or division, provide for ease in problem-solving using this method of drug calculation.

Numerators (top) numbers or denominators (bottom) numbers multiplied and divided after the same units are canceled out. Some equations or formulas get expressed with a colon (:) or backslash (/) to indicate division and its subsequent deployment in this problem-solving technique.

For ease of calculation, a person should place the numerator of the fraction to the left of the colon or slash. In completion of this relationship, the denominator gets put on the right of the slash or colon. Unknown amounts, unknown quantities, or unknown desired amounts are depicted as an (x) in the equation and solved. The symbol (x) placement is to the left of the equation, making cross multiplication and division for (x) a simple undertaking. Keeping in mind the fundamental principle regarding the same units of measurement, numbers or units on the top and bottom of a fraction possess the ability to cancel each other out.
