**Clinical Features**

- Ptosis: Due to paralysis of LPS (levator palpebrae superioris) muscle

- Ocular deviation: In case of third-nerve palsy, the lateral rectus and superior oblique are spared, and their unopposed action brings the eye in a “down and out” position.

- Pupil: In compressive third-nerve palsy, the pupil becomes fixed and dilated due to paralysis of sphincter pupillae. Ciliary muscle paralysis also leads to loss of accommodation. However, in ischemic lesions, the pupil is spared, and there is no loss of accommodation.

- Diplopia: This occurs due deviation of the affected eye resulting in the image falling on an extrafoveal point. However, due to ptosis the patient usually doesn’t complain of double vision as ptosis acts as a barrier to diplopia.

**Four Distinct Syndromes**

- Benedikt syndrome: Ipsilateral third-nerve palsy and contralateral tremors

- Weber syndrome: Ipsilateral third-nerve palsy and contralateral hemiplegia

- Nothnagel syndrome: Ipsilateral third-nerve palsy and cerebellar ataxia

- Claude syndrome: Combined features of both Benedikt and Nothnagel syndromes
