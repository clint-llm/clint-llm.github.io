There have been multiple studies concerning glyburide use in pregnant patients with gestational diabetes mellitus. Although glyburide is considered a Category C drug by the FDA, expert bodies have begun introducing glyburide as a possible alternative to insulin for antidiabetic therapy. Glyburide does cross the placenta in utero and gets metabolized by placental microsomes, so the fetus has exposure to the medication. Concerning lactation, glyburide, along with its second-generation counterpart glipizide, is compatible with breastfeeding and does not cross into breastmilk to affect breastfed children.

Glyburide therapy should not be re-initiated if the patient has a history of allergic reactions to the medication. However, patients who have had previous allergic reactions to drugs of the same class may not necessarily react to glyburide.

Also, it is essential to use caution with glyburide in hospitalized patients, who are malnourished, misuse alcohol, have renal and cardiac dysfunctions, or with gastrointestinal disease.
