Trazodone therapy requires careful consideration for patients treated with any class of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), including linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. MAO inhibitors impair the metabolism of serotonin, and concurrent administration increases serum levels of serotonin. Therefore, one must have 14 days of the MAOI-free period to reduce the risk of serotonin syndrome before initiating treatment with trazodone. In addition, concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs, such as triptans, TCA, or fentanyl, will also increase serotonin levels. Trazodone use requires caution in patients with compromised liver function and renal function.
