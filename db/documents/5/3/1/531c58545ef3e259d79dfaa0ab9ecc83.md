Patients require evaluation regarding their pregnancy status before starting therapy and if 14 weeks have passed since the last injection. Also, weight and bone mineral density should be determined regularly. In female patients with a strong history of breast cancer and the possibility of developing endometrial cancer, consider bone mineral density, especially with long-term usage. Endometrial sampling is recommended every 3 to 5 months to monitor continually for endometrial hyperplasia.

For menopausal patients currently using combination hormonal therapy, the risk for breast cancer and cardiovascular disease requires assessment. Following the administration of medroxyprogesterone, it is essential to assess blood pressure and for any unscheduled bleeding greater than six months to evaluate for endometrial pathology. Additionally, patients should be administered breast exams and pelvic exams, depending on their age. These parameters should be followed even more closely for patients with diabetes, obesity, or a family history of endometrial cancer. Serum triglycerides should be monitored closely and checked two weeks after starting therapy in patients with elevated triglycerides (>200 mg/dL). For patients who are currently receiving thyroid replacements, TSH levels must also be monitored 6 to 12 weeks after starting on oral medroxyprogesterone tablets.

Patients currently using medroxyprogesterone for paraphilia/hypersexuality, LFTs, CBC, serum testosterone, LH, FSH, and glucose require regular monitoring. Also, if serum testosterone shows a marked decrease, consider an annual bone scan.
