Luteinizing hormone acts by binding to a G-protein coupled receptor, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase. Adenylyl cyclase, an enzyme, then produces cyclic-AMP, thus increasing its intracellular concentration, which then activates a kinase molecule called protein kinase A (PKA). PKA then phosphorylates specific intracellular proteins that subsequently achieve the end physiological actions of LH like steroid production and ovulation
