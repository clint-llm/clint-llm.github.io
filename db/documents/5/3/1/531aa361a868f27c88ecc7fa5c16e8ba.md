Most of the eyelash conditions are managed locally as discussed above.

In the presence of mucous membrane pemphigoid disease, the patient needs to be assessed for the involvement of other mucosal areas such as the nasopharynxÂ (can cause airway obstruction), oral, genital, anal, and esophagus.

If a malignancy is diagnosed as causing trichiasis/lash loss, appropriate biopsy and local and systemic management are instituted.

With active trachoma, oral azithromycin and topical tetracycline are instituted. The trichiasis and/or entropion are treated appropriately with surgery (lash destruction, eyelid margin tarsal rotation surgery).
