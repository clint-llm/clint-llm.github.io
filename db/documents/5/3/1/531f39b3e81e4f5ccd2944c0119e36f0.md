In clinical studies, tafamidis has been administered at a dose of 80 mg and for up to 111 months without any significant adverse events. A single dose of tafamidis of 480 mg in healthy volunteers did not show any adverse event except mild hordeolum in one patient. Two patients, during clinical trials, accidentally took 160 mg of tafamidis without any adverse event. Moreover, administering a very high dose of tafamidis in dogs (476 fold the clinical dose of 80 mg tafamidis meglumine) had no apparent adverse events. Thus, the risk of overdose in humans is extremely low. However, clinicians should give standard supportive measures in case of overdose.
