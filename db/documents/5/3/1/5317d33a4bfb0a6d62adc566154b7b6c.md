Contraindications to intravitreal aflibercept include ocular or periocular infections, active ocular inflammation, and known hypersensitivity to aflibercept or any excipients found in the formulation. Patients should be counseled on the common symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, urticaria, pruritus, severe ocular intraocular inflammation, or severe anaphylactic reactions. Patients who have an ocular infection, have recently undergone ocular surgery, or have increased intraocular pressure should avoid intravitreal aflibercept use.

There is no data on the effects of intravitreal aflibercept on human fertility. Data in primate studies showed reversibly impaired fertility and function in female reproductive systems at intravenous administration doses 1500 times higher than the human systemic level. As such, the FDA has recommended effective contraception in reproductive-aged females before, during treatment, and at least three months following the last intravitreal injection of aflibercept.

Aflibercept is not recommended while breastfeeding due to the potential for drug excretion in breast milk and the threat to infant growth and development. Studies have not yet established the safety and effectiveness of aflibercept in pediatric patients.
