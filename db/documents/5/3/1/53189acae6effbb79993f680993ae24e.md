Distinguishing on clinical grounds between acute mitral regurgitation and rupture of the ventricular septum in patients with STEMI in whom a loud systolic murmur suddenly develops may be difficult. Such differentiation can be made most readily by color flow Doppler echocardiography. Also, right heart catheterization with a balloon-tipped catheter can readily distinguish between these 2 complications. Patients with VSR demonstrate a step-up in oxygen saturation in blood samples from the right ventricle and pulmonary artery as compared with those from the right atrium. Patients with acute mitral regurgitation lack this step-up and may demonstrate tall C-V waves in both the pulmonary capillary and pulmonary arterial pressure tracings.
