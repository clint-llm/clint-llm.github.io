- Young patients with femoral neck fractures should be treated emergently for stabilization via open reduction internal fixation after completion of imaging and ATLS protocol as needed. With more vertically oriented fractures such a Pauwel III, a sliding hip screw is biomechanically stable.

- Elderly patients should be seen and evaluated by medical services and optimized as needed.

- Displacement and baseline activity dictate the treatment plan.

- A non-displaced fracture may have surgical treatment with screws in situ.

- A displaced fracture may undergo a total hip arthroplasty in active individuals or a hemiarthroplasty in less active individuals.
