Around the world, theophylline (1,3-dimethylxanthine) is primarily used as a bronchodilator for patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, in the United States, asthma and COPD are mainly treated with other agents, and theophylline is predominantly used to treat bradycardia and apnea in premature newborns. Theophylline causes the endogenous release of catecholamines via indirect stimulation of beta-1 and beta-2 receptors, which, at therapeutic levels lead to bronchodilation, the goal of treatment. Unfortunately, theophylline has a narrow therapeutic window, and levels even slightly above the therapeutic range can have adverse effects both acutely and chronically. This activity will review the most common causes of theophylline toxicity and outline the treatment approach according to current evidence. This activity will highlight the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and treating theophylline toxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Explain strategies for preventing theophylline toxicity. 
- Describe which organs are commonly affected by theophylline toxicity.
- Explain the treatment strategy for a patient with theophylline toxicity.
- Explain how the facilitation of interprofessional team education and discussion can optimize the effective detection of theophylline toxicity and inform the need for subsequent evaluations.
