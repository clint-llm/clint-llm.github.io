ICDs have proven survival benefits. Since their inception in the late 1980s, they continue to improve in functionality and design and have provided a lifeline for high-risk patients who, can seek help in case of cardiac arrest, otherwise would not have made it to the hospital.

Patients with structural heart disease as well as cardiomyopathies, both ischemic and non-ischemic, fare equally from the device especially when it is coupled with resynchronization therapy that provides not only mortality benefit but improves the quality of life (QOL) and has also shown potential to aid in the recovery of LVEF.

Now, there is an ever-growing list of patients who can live up to their date of transplant with ICDs/CRT-Ds watching over them while they wait for a suitable donor.
