WHO statistics cite over one million neonatal deaths around the world each year result from neonatal sepsis/pneumonia making it the leading cause of infant mortality. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the estimated incidence of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the United States is 0.77 to 1 per 1000 live births. With the establishment of guidelines for universal screening and treatment of maternal GBS colonization, the incidence of early-onset sepsis in full-term infants has decreased to 0.3 to 0.4/1000 live births. However, the incidence of late-onset sepsis remained the same (0.4/1000).
