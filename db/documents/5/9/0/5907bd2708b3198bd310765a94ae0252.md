History, physical examination, pachymetry, and microscopy are key features in evaluating a patient with FED. The first step is to take a thorough history. FED symptoms will typically begin in the sixth to seventh decades of life, and patients will have complaints of blurry vision, glare, and corneal haze. Guttata and corneal edema will be apparent on slit-lamp examination, and later stages may show pathologic changes such as epithelial bullae, scarring, and vascularization.

Specular or confocal microscopy will show endothelial cell loss, and CCT will increase as a result of corneal edema. CCT and endothelial cell count and morphology can be used to monitor disease progression.

Clinicians and patients should monitor FED progression with routine eye exams every six months, and early FED may be managed medically. It is important to note that if patients are scheduled in the morning, their vision will likely be worse compared to afternoon hours. Surgical options may be a consideration for patients with advanced disease associated with decreased function and quality of life.

Patients with FED are typically elderly and therefore may present with several comorbid conditions, including cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, and cardiovascular disease, which can complicate surgical management.
