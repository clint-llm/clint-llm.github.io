**Clinical Manifestation**

The clinical manifestation of microsporidia infection ranges from asymptomatic infection to symptomatic infection that includes diarrhea, myositis, keratitis, and bronchitis. Although rare, encephalitis may also occur.E. bieneusi causes pulmonary infections or infects the bile ducts leading to cholecystitis and cholangitis.

It remains unknown how much of the spore titer is required for infection in humans, but it appears to vary among the different subspecies. The spores that infect humans are usually 1 to 4 micrometers, and children with an asymptomatic picture appear to have 1.2 x 10 spores of E. bieneusi per gram of feces. Whereas, in HIV-infected patients, the concentration of E. bieneusi spores vary from 4.5 x 10 to 4.4 x 10 per milliliter of diarrheic feces, totaling 10 spores in 24 hours.

**Risk Factors**

Risk factors associated with microsporidia infection include male-male sexual encounters, intravenous drug use, exposure to swamp water or crop irrigation area, exposure to water with excreta, swimming pool and hot tubs use, or occupational contact with water.

**Transmission**

Microsporidia disease transmission occurs mostly through food (foodborne disease) including the global food chain industry of fish and crustaceans (shrimp, lobster, clams, among others). Transmission also occurs through water including crop irrigation, seawater, drinking water, groundwater, wastewater, excreta in the environment, and sludge.
