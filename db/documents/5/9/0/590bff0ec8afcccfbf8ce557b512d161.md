Hypertension is one of the most prevalent pathologies in America affecting approximately 75 million adults or one in three US adults. Of these patients diagnosed with hypertension, only 54% have adequate blood pressure control.

Meta-analyses have demonstrated a log-linear relationship between elevated blood pressure and increased risk of cardiovascular disease which increases substantially with age.

- In patients age 45-54 years old - 36.1% of males, 33.2% of females

- In patients age 55-64 - 57.6% of males and 55.5% of females

- In patients age 65-74 - 63.6% of males and 65.8% of females

- In patients age 75 or older 73.4% of males and 81.2% of females

Hypertension is slightly more common in women and conveys an increased risk of heart failure (3-fold) in comparison to men (2-fold). Women are more likely to have uncontrolled blood pressure and recent studies have suggested certain classes of antihypertensive medications may be less effective in women.

Certain ethnic groups have a higher predisposition for hypertension. The prevalence of hypertension among the African American population is among the highest of any ethnic group in the world at 45.0% for males and 46.3% for females. The rate is 34.5% for Caucasian males with 32.3% for females and 28.9% among Hispanic males with 30.7% for females.
