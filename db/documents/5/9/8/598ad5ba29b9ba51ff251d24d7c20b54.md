The treatment for costochondritis is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

Some consideration can be given to a course of naproxen or meloxicam because these are dosed twice daily and once daily, respectively. Other NSAIDs can also be used, including ibuprofen. The NSAID of choice is based on provider/patient preference.

NSAIDs are contraindicated in acute and chronic kidney disease.

It is also important to discuss with patients the risk of gastritis with chronic NSAID use.

If patients have severe or refractory costochondritis, refer for outpatient follow-up. Physical therapy is a treatment option for refractory costochondritis.
