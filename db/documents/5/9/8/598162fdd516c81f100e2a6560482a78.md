Rectus sheath hematomas result from bleeding of the epigastric vessels or their perforator branches in the rectus abdominis muscle sheath

Like in other types of bleeding, the cause can be due to the bleeding tendency, anticoagulation, or injury to the vessels. Vascular injury may occur due to external abdominal trauma, trauma during surgery (iatrogenic), or intense contraction of the rectus muscles during activities associated with Valsalva maneuver, as inÂ severe retching, vomiting, or straining
