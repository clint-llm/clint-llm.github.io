PTT is commonly used in clinical practice to monitor unfractionated heparin infusion to target therapeutic range of anticoagulation and as part of coagulation panels to help elucidate causes of bleeding or clotting disorders. PTT tests the function of all clotting factors except VII (tissue factor) and XIII (fibrin stabilizing factor).
