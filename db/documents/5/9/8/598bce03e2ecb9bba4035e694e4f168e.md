Piriformis is innervated by branches of the anterior rami of S1 and S2 of the sacral plexus.  In some instances, the muscle will be supplied by only S2, and in other cases, there may be contributions from L5 nerve roots. In at least a fifth of the population, the piriformis is pierced in different parts by the sciatic nerve. However, in some cases, it may be penetrated by the common fibular nerve. In a few people, the muscle may integrate with the gluteus medius and minimus muscles. The piriformis may also have one or two attachments to the sacrum or capsule of the hip joint.
