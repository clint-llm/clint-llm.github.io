Basal cell carcinoma is part of the differential for a new, pink, pearly papule of the head, neck, or trunk. Papules will often ulcerate and bleed. The clinical history can help rule out more acute lesions, such as acneiform papules, as patients often report a nonhealing or intermittently bleeding lesion noticeable for several weeks to months.  A biopsy and histopathologic review can confirm the diagnosis of a clinically suspicious lesion. On histology, the three main categories differ in their microscopic presentation. Nodular basal cell carcinoma presents as large, blue islands with peripheral palisading of cells. Clefting between the collagen and the palisaded cells is common. Basal cell carcinoma has a distinct fibromyxoid stroma on histology.  Superficial basal cell carcinoma shows a palisaded border of blue basal cells budding from the epidermis. The infiltrative types of basal cell carcinoma show small islands of blue tumor cells diving between collagen bundles. The morpheaform subtype has a sclerotic stroma, which correlates with the scar-like clinical appearance.
