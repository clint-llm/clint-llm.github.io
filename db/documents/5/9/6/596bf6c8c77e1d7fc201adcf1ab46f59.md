Once a patient has been diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis, the nurse practitioner and primary care provider should provide coordinated education of the patient and family on potential complications and the course of the illness. The patient should be told to avoid all physical activity for at least 4-6 weeks to minimize the risk of splenic rupture. The patient should be told about the signs and symptoms of splenic rupture and when to return to the hospital. All patients should be told about the need to follow up until the symptoms subside and permission to return to physical activity.  The pharmacist should educate the patient on supportive care and the need to remain hydrated. Finally, all clinicians looking after patients with mononucleosis should be aware of the potential complications, and make the appropriate referral to the specialist when symptoms arise.
