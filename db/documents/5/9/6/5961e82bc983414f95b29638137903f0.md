Smallpox is the first human infectious disease to be successfully eradicated worldwide. It remains of clinical concern because of the potential for release and weaponization. Smallpox is a member of the viral family poxvirus, genus orthopoxvirus, and species variola virus. This disease presents with a non-specific febrile prodrome of high fever, chills, vomiting, abdominal pain, headache, and backache. The skin lesions occur 1-3 days later and first begin on the forearms or face and spread to the rest of the body. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of smallpox and describes the role of the interprofessional team in managing those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of small pox.
- Review the presentation of a patient with small pox.
- Summarize the treatment of small pox.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to be aware of the clinical presentation of smallpox and report it efficiently to prevent an outbreak of this disease.
