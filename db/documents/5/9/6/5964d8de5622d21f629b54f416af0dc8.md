Radiotherapy can be considered in patients who are medically unfit for surgery. Different modalities have been used, including tomotherapy, proton beam therapy, imaging-guided radiotherapy, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Some of them have been used as a combined treatment with surgery or chemotherapy. Their use is recommended when treating ameloblastic carcinoma or recurrent ameloblastoma after multiple surgical excision. However, studies show mixed responses when using them as an adjuvant treatment with or without chemotherapy.Â Risks should be discussed with the patient, including the potential of life-threatening malignant transformations.
