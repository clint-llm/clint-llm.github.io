**NontraumaticÂ Subarachnoid Hemorrhage**

Histopathologically, a nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage can be divided into two main types:

- Saccular aneurysm

- Fusiform aneurysm

- Dolicoecthatic

Aneurysms are described as saccular, fusiform, or dolicoecthatic, depending on their shape. Saccular aneurysms are pouch-or berry-like protrusions that arise from vascular bifurcations or from the side of a vessel and often have an irregular shape with secondary protrusions. Dilations or pathological increases in vessel caliber that do not lead to forming a separate saccular pouch are usually called fusiform aneurysms, whereas tortuous, dilated elongations of vessels are referred to as dolicoecthatic.
