Telogen effluvium can occur in people of any age, any gender, and any racial background. The exact prevalence of telogen effluvium is not known, but it is considered to be quite common. A large percentage of adults experience an episode of telogen effluvium at some point. Telogen effluvium can occur in either sex, though women have a greater tendency to experience this condition because of postpartum hormonal changes. Also, women are more disturbed by hair shedding than men and are therefore more likely to seek medical attention.
