The bicuspid aortic valve can lead to significant valvular dysfunction which could be aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The risk of infective endocarditis is high among populations with a bicuspid valve.

The bicuspid aortic valve is also associated with:

- Coarctation of aorta

- Ascending aortic dilatation 40% to 60%

- Aortic aneurysm
