Vaccination providers, including PSs, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists, commonly encounter patients who do not have adequate immunization documentation. Providers should only accept dated and written records as evidence of vaccination. If records are unavailable, these patients should have serologic testing to determine immunity and start on their age-appropriate vaccination schedule.

On administering a vaccine, the provider should chart it in detail and add it to the patient's health record so that future providers can see the full vaccine picture. This practice applies to clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists.

Providers should administer vaccines as close to the recommended intervals as possible. It is essential to know the indications, doses, mode of administration, and contraindications of the meningococcal vaccine.

Misperceptions by healthcare providers result in missed opportunities to administer recommended vaccinations and should be avoided. Unusually, administration errors could occur due to healthcare providers' unfamiliarity with the new vaccines and their requirements for appropriate use. These errors rarely cause a serious safety problem. Additional vaccine doses may be necessary as the patient may remain unprotected in some situations,Â potentially leading to a local adverse reaction, additional cost, and loss of trust of the health care provider.
