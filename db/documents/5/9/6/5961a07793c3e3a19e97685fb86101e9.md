Initial evaluation includes blood cultures, wound cultures, urinalysis, chest radiograph, complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, C-reactive protein, and HIV testing. Procalcitonin and lactate levels are important in those with EG in the setting of sepsis. Evaluation of the lesions with a Wood's lamp may expedite the diagnosis, as P. aeruginosa will appear with green fluorescence.
