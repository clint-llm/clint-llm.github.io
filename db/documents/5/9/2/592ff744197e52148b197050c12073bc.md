Relative to other anxiolytics, buspirone has low toxicity and potential for abuse. There have been no deaths reported from a buspirone overdose alone. In pharmacological trials, healthy male patients were given up to 375 mg daily and developed nausea, vomiting, dizziness, drowsiness, miosis, and gastric distress. While buspirone overdose typically resolves with complete recovery, high suspicion of other medication overdoses should be maintained and investigated.

In a literature review, multiple reports of movement disorders, including dyskinesia, akathisia, myoclonus, parkinsonism, and dystonia, have been reported. In case of movement disorder induced by buspirone, the drug should be discontinued, and in some instances, it may require therapy with trihexyphenidyl/benztropine(centrally acting anticholinergic medication) and additional supportive treatment.

Clinicians should use symptomatic and supportive measures and immediate gastric lavage in acute overdose. Healthcare providers must monitor respiration, pulse, and blood pressure, as in all drug overdose cases. Seizures can occur in rare instances which require treatment with benzodiazepines. It is important to note that no specific antidote is known for buspirone.
