Abdominal pain, diarrhea, dyspepsia, gastritis, nausea, vomiting, erythema multiforme, genital pruritus, vaginitis, vaginal discharge, candidiasis, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, eosinophilia, arthralgia, arthropathy, and arthritis have been reported by manufacturers.

In clinical trials, increased serum alanine aminotransferase, increased serum aspartate aminotransferase, cholestatic jaundice, and interstitial nephritis is reported in patients using cephalexin.

Another aspect of the cephalexin administration to keep in mind is the potential for allergic reactions to the drug. A patient can develop an allergy to cephalexin if they have taken penicillin in the past. This situation occurs when a patient takes penicillin, and the immune system generates IgG and/or IgM antibodies that have the potential to bind to cephalexin once ingested orally. The thinking is that approximately 10% of patients with a penicillin allergy also have cross-reactions to cephalosporin antibiotics, but this claim does not have support from the literature. Retrospective studies have suggested that there is only a 1 to 3% incidence of allergic or immunologic reactions to cephalosporins after administration of penicillin.

Clostridioides difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) and colitis have been reported in patients taking cephalexin. It can occur at the beginning of cephalexin administration up to three months post-treatment. Older and immunocompromised patients are at higher risk of developing CDAD following long-term antibiotic treatments.

Immunogenic Hemolytic anemia has been reported as a rare occurrence, especially in patients with hypersensitivity reactions to other cephalosporins. Other hypersensitivity reactions reported are skin rash, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms.

**Drug Interactions**

- Metformin: Coadministration of cephalexin with metformin may result in increased plasma concentration and decreased renal clearance of metformin. It is recommended to monitor patients carefully and adjust the dose of metformin when taking cephalexin and metformin concomitantly.

- Probenecid: Coadministration of cephalexin with probenecid is not recommended as these may lead to inhibition of the renal excretion of cephalexin.
