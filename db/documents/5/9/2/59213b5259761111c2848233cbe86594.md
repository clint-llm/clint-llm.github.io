Managing phalanx fractures requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that include nurses, occupational therapy, physical therapy, radiology, orthopedic surgery, and primary care physicians.

Since the majority of phalanx fractures initially present in the emergency department, the ED physician should be aware of the management and when to seek a consult from the orthopedic surgeon.

Care is taken to diagnose phalanx fractures correctly with physical exam and radiography, allowing guiding treatment to operative versus non-operative management. Regardless of the procedure, the patient has a period of immobilization, followed by an early range of motion. All patients with phalanx fractures need to be followed to ensure that healing is occurring; improper healing can affect function and quality of life. Nursing can follow up and assess the progress of treatment and subsequent therapy; reporting concerns to the clinical team. Orthopedic specialty nursing can also assist with patient and family education, as well as monitoring progress and coordinate rehab, reporting status changes to the managing clinician. Early intervention with physical therapy, whether formal or informally, will prevent stiffness and secondary complications of phalanx fractures. Ultimately, this results in better outcomes and care for the patient.
