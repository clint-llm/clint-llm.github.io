The life expectancy for patients with hemophilia was 11 to 13 years until 1970 through the introduction of the first coagulation factors. Before that, the patients used to receive whole blood or fresh frozen plasma. Until 1964 a noble prize winner, American physician Judith Graham Pool extracted cryoprecipitate from the plasma, which contained higher amounts of coagulation factors and made a significant improvement in the patients with this condition. In 1970, the first coagulation factor could be extracted from the plasma, which made a significant improvement in the quality of life and the prognosis of the patients.

By the beginning of 1980, patients receiving factors replacements started getting infected with HIV and hepatitis C, which reached 80% to 85% of the patients till 1992 with the development of new screening techniques, and this improved the safety of plasma-derived products and their transmission to these patients.

Nowadays, patients have a regular life span in developed countries after an early replacement of factor deficiency with prophylaxis started earlier by age 1 to 2 years in cases of severe hemophilia. While in developing countries, the mortality rate for patients with hemophilia remains twice that of the average healthy male population due to inadequate health systems and diminished health resources.
