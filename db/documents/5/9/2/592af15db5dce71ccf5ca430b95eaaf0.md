The main coronary vasculature develops from cells migrating from the dorsal mesocardium to the surface of the myocardium in the epicardial layer. The development of the Thebesian vessels has not been the subject of extensive research, but they seem to have a different origin from the main coronary venous system. Researchers have postulated various theories as to their origin; for example, that these veins evolve from the intertrabecular network of the embryonic circulation, which is initially separate from the main venous circulation. This network then grows out to the epicardial surface and connects with the greater cardiac venous system later on in development.
