Gastric ultrasound is a useful diagnostic exam because it can reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. However, risk reduction requires effective communication and collaboration between all clinical members of each patient's care team. Surgical schedulers must ensure that patients receive instructions regarding appropriate fasting before surgery. On the day of a procedure, preoperative nurses should assess fasting status during the preoperative interview.

For surgical inpatients, the responsible provider (nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or physician) should ensure appropriate diet orders are placed the evening before a scheduled surgery. The anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist is ultimately responsible for performing the final assessment and determining the most appropriate method for reducing the risk of aspiration. However, gastric ultrasound can be performed and interpreted by any qualified clinician.
