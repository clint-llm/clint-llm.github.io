Eczema herpeticum presents as a sudden onset eruption of monomorphic, dome-shaped, grouped, 2 to 3 mm vesicles on an erythematous base. Lesions are superimposed on areas of pre-existing atopic dermatitis, most commonly on the face, neck, and upper trunk. The lesions are pruritic, painful, and may spread to involve normal skin over seven to 10 days.

Numerous vesicles may appear in successive crops, and multiple morphologies may be present at the same time. Lesions that are secondarily impetiginized may have an overlying honey-colored crust. In patients with severe or poorly-controlled atopic dermatitis, the characteristic morphology may be difficult to recognize and can be misdiagnosed as an exacerbation of eczematous dermatitis.
