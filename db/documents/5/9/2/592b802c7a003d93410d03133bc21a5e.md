First, a transabdominal examination takes place, focusing on visualization of the entire uterus as well as adnexa bilaterally.  The patient should localize her pain, and the examiner obtains dedicated images of this area. The pelvis undergoes assessment for signs of hemoperitoneum, and, if there is an extrauterine fluid collection identified, the upper abdomen (Morrison’s pouch and paracolic gutters) gets scanned to determine the extent of bleeding.  Next, a transvaginal portion of the examination is performed, focusing on further evaluation of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries.

Mean gestational sac diameter (mGSD) gets calculated by taking an average of measurements obtained in three orthogonal planes.  In other words, it can be calculated by adding measurements of the height, width, and length and dividing the sum by 3.
