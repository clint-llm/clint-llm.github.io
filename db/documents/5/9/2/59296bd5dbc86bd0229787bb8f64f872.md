Before mentioning ways to treat pressure ulcers, it is important to discuss ways to prevent them; ironically, the ways to prevent ulcers are also ways to treat them. All hospitals use screening tools on admission to determine the risk of pressure sores.

**Braden Scale**

The Braden scale is a widely used screening too to determines the patients who are at risk. This assessment tool consists of six categories:

- Sensory perception

- Moisture

- Activity

- Mobility

- Nutrition

- Friction/shear

Number one through four on these categories indicates that there is no potential problem; however, receiving a one means the patient is at great risk. Friction and shear is the sixth category which often can disrupt skin integrity. The highest Braden score one can achieve is 23, and the lowest is 6; the lower the number, the higher the risk of developing an ulcer.

**Norton Scale**

The Norton scale is also used as an assessment tool for patients who are at great risk of developing pressure ulcers. This scale relies on these factors:

- Physical condition

- Mental condition

- Activity

- Mobility

- Continence

Each category has four grades (1-4), number 4 means the patient is healthy and number 1 means the patient is at great risk. The highest possible score is 20, and the lowest possible score is 5. The onset of risk = 16 or below; high risk = 12 or below.

Other simple prevention measures include proper nutrition, pressure relieving repositioning, hygiene and moisture control, special mattresses, and topical skin care. Adequate nutrition is needed for tissue metabolism and is necessary for the prevention and healing of pressure ulcers. The patient must be provided with sufficient calories, fluid, protein, vitamin C, and zinc. For those who are not able to eat, a feeding tube may be necessary, otherwise wound healing will not take place.
