In the emergency department, the most critical facet of the evaluation is a thorough history, including possible exposures and identifying the symptoms consistent with any of the mercury toxicity syndromes.  Initial testing would include a chest radiograph, urinalysis,  and basic bloodwork such as a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. A 24-hour urine collection for mercury levels should be obtained as well as whole-blood mercury levels in the case of organic mercury exposure as there is very little urinary excretion of these compounds. Positive levels confirm exposure, but the levels do not directly correlate with toxicity.
