**Lumbar Counterstrain**

The lumbar spine has five anterior tender points and five posterior tender points. The tender points are named for the lumbar vertebra with which they correspond.

Counterstrain is an indirect technique in which the practitioner places the patient away from the restrictive barrier. The basic procedure for all counterstrain techniques starts with the practitioner finding a tender point in a muscle, ligament, or tendon. The practitioner then presses on the tender point with one finger with just enough pressure to blanch the practitioner's diagnosis finger. The practitioner establishes a pain scale, letting the patient know that the tender point's pain is considered 100%. Without moving the monitoring finger, the practitioner moves the patient to find a position where the tender point pain is reduced by 70% or more. This may require fine-tuning the position until the patient feels at least 70% relief. Once that position is found, it is held for 90 seconds while continuing to monitor the tender point. After 90 seconds has passed, the practitioner slowly and passively brings the patient back to neutral and then reassesses the tender point.

L1 Anterior Tender Point

The patient begins by lying supine on the table. Determine if a tender point exists by pressing medial to the anterior superior iliac spines. If the area is tender, stand next to the table on the side of the tender point. Keep light pressure on the tender point with one finger and bring the patient's knees and hips into about 90 degrees of flexion. If desired, the practitioner may bring their leg up to the table and rest the patient's legs on their knee. Hold the position for 90 seconds, then bring the patient's legs back to neutral and reassess the tender point.

L2 Anterior Tender Point

The patient begins by lying supine on the table. Determine if a tender point exists by pressing medial to the anterior inferior iliac spines. If the area is tender, stand on the opposite side of the table of the tender point. Keep light pressure on the tender point with one finger, with the other hand, bring the patient's hips and knees into about 90 degrees of flexion and rotate the hips 60 degrees away from the tender point. Hold the position for 90 seconds, then bring the patient's legs back to neutral and reassess the tender point.

L3 Anterior Tender Point

The patient begins by lying supine on the table. Determine if a tender point exists by pressing laterally to the anterior inferior iliac spines. If the area is tender, stand next to the table on the side of the tender point. Keep light pressure on the tender point with one finger, with the other hand, bring the patient's knees and hips into about 90 degrees of flexion and slightly rotate the legs toward the tender point. If desired, the practitioner may bring their leg up to the table to rest the patient's legs on their knee. Side bend the patient's spine away from the tender point. Hold the position for 90 seconds, then bring the patient's legs back to neutral and reassess the tender point.

L4 Anterior Tender Point

The patient begins by lying supine on the table. Determine if a tender point exists by pressing below the anterior inferior iliac spines. If the area is tender, stand next to the table on the side of the tender point. Keep light pressure on the tender point with one finger, use the other hand to bring the patient's knees and hips into about 90 degrees of flexion and slightly rotate toward the tender point. If desired, the practitioner may bring their leg up to the table to rest the patient's legs on their knee. Side bend the patient's spine away from the tender point. Hold the position for 90 seconds, then bring the patient's legs back to neutral and reassess the tender point.

L5 Anterior Tender Point

The patient begins by lying supine on the table. Determine if a tender point exists by pressing on the respective the pubic ramus, just lateral to the symphysis. If the area is tender, stand next to the table on the side of the tender point. Keep light pressure on the tender point with one finger, use the other hand to bring the patient's knees and hips into about 90 degrees of flexion. Bring the patient's far ankle to cross over the nearer ankle and spread the knees slightly apart. Hold the position for 90 seconds, then bring the patient's legs back to neutral and reassess the tender point.

L1-5 Posterior Tender Point

The patient begins by lying prone on the table. The posterior tender points for L1-5 can be located on the spinous process, transverse process, or in between the two on the corresponding lumbar segment. Locate a tender point and stand on the side of the table opposite of the tender point. Lift the leg on the side of the tender point. If the tender point is midline extension may be enough if the tender point if further out toward the transverse process, pull the leg into adduction. Hold the position for 90 seconds, then bring the patient's leg back to neutral and reassess the tender point.

L3,4,5 Upper Pole Tender Points

The patient begins by lying prone on the table. The L3, L4, L5 upper pole tender points can be located 2/3 linear distance from the posterior inferior iliac spine (PSIS) to the tensor fascia latae, the posterior edge of the tensor facia latae, and superior and medial to the PSIS, respectively. Locate a tender point and stands on the side of the table opposite the tender point. Lift the patient's leg on the side of the tender point and pull the leg into adduction. Hold the position for 90 seconds, then bring the patient's leg back to neutral and reassess the tender point.

Lower Pole L5 Tender Point

The patient begins by lying prone on the table. The lower pole tender point for L5 can be located inferior to the PSIS. Locate a tender point and sit on a stool on the side of the table of the tender point. Drop the patient's leg off the table and bring the knee and hip into about 90 degrees of flexion. Adduct the thigh by bringing the knee in towards the table. Hold the position for 90 seconds, then bring the patient's leg back to neutral and reassess the tender point.

**Lumbar Facilitated Positional Release**

FPR is also an indirect technique where the practitioner places the patient away from the restrictive barrier. The basic procedure for all FPR techniques is to find a somatic dysfunction, monitor the dysfunction with one finger, then place the patient's body into a position of ease. This will hyper-shorten the muscle or exaggerate the dysfunctional vertebra and allow the muscle spindle to decrease its output. Lastly, a facilitating force is applied by adding compression, torsion, or a union of both for three seconds. The facilitating force is released, and the patient is returned to neutral, and the monitoring finger can let go to reassess the somatic dysfunction.

Low Back Superficial Muscle Hypertonicity

The patient begins by lying prone on the table. Straighten the lumbar lordotic curve by placing a pillow under the patient's abdomen. Locate an area of lower back superficial muscle hypertonicity and stand on the side of the hypertonic muscle. Monitor the hypertonic muscle with one finger. Move the patient's legs toward the side of the table of the hypertonicity until motion is felt under the monitoring finger. This will induce lumbar side bending toward the side of the hypertonicity. Cross the patient's farther leg over the closer leg to induce more of a side bend. Hold the patient's farther thigh and rotate it externally while extending the thigh. Keep moving until motion can be felt with the monitoring finger. Hold the position for three seconds. Bring the patient's leg back to neutral and reassess the hypertonic muscle.

Lumbar Segment Extension Dysfunction

Assess the patient's lumbar spinal segments for an extension dysfunction. Once an extension dysfunction is found, the patient begins by lying prone on the table. Straighten the lumbar lordotic curve by placing a pillow under the patient's abdomen. Place a second pillow under the thigh in which the spinal segment is rotated, and side bent towards (e.g., for an L3 Extended SLRL segment place a second pillow under the patient's left thigh). Stand on the side of the table towards which the spinal segment is rotated and side bent. Monitor the most posterior transverse process of the dysfunctional vertebra with one finger. Bring the patient's closest leg into abduction and internal rotation until motion can be felt at the monitoring finger. Internal rotation is achievable by grasping above the patient's ankle to rotate the leg. Then press the leg down toward the floor until motion can be felt at the monitoring finger. Hold the position for three seconds. Bring the patient's leg back to neutral and reassess.

Lumbar Segment Flexion Dysfunction

Assess the patient's lumbar spinal segments for a flexion dysfunction. Once a flexion dysfunction is found, the patient begins by lying prone on the table. Straighten the lumbar lordotic curve by placing a pillow under the patient's abdomen. Sit on a stool on the side of the table in which the spinal segment is rotated, and side bent towards (e.g., for an L3FSLRL dysfunction sit on the left side). Monitor the most posterior transverse process of the dysfunctional vertebra with one finger. Bring the patient's closest leg off the table. Holding the patient's knee, bring the patient's knee and hip into flexion until motion can be felt at the monitoring finger. Then press the patient's knee into adduction and internal rotation of the hip until motion can be felt at the monitoring finger. Hold the position for 3 seconds. Bring the patient's leg back to neutral and reassess.
