The patient can perform the maneuver in the sitting, supine, or recumbent position. Some reports advocate a recumbent position,

**Modified VM**

In order to increase the relaxation phase venous return and vagal stimulation, a modification to the standard VM has been described in the REVERT trial, which includes supine positioning with leg elevation immediately after the Valsalva strain. This is used for the emergency treatment of supraventricular tachycardias.

**Reverse VM**

The patient in a sitting position is asked to inhale against resistance for ten seconds while keeping the nose pinched and having the mouth closed tightly. This leads to increased vagal tone and decreased sympathetic activity, which in turn leads to bradycardia and arterial hypotension (the Bezold–Jarich reflex), causing supraventricular tachycardia to resolve in the next 15 seconds if effective.
