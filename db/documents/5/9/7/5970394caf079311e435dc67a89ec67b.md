The right GEA is the largest terminal branch of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) which is a branch of the hepatic artery.Â At times, it arises from the left hepatic artery or the celiac trunk, or rarely from the superior mesenteric artery. The right GEA reaches nearly half to two-thirds of the greater curvature of the stomach in most people and may form a communication with the left GEA.
