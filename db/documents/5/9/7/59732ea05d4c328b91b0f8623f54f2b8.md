A cardiac contusion is a misnomer used to indicate injury to the heart after blunt chest trauma. Because of the term's ambiguity in describing a spectrum of myocardial injuries secondary to blunt trauma, "cardiac contusion" is now termed "blunt cardiac injury." Blunt cardiac Injuries can range from clinically silent, transient arrhythmias to fatal cardiac rupture. This activity describes the etiology, epidemiology, and management of blunt cardiac injury. It explains the role of an interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of such patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors for blunt cardiac injury.
- Outline the diagnostic techniques for blunt cardiac injury.
- Explain the conservative and invasive treatment options and their indications in the treatment of patients with blunt cardiac injury.
- Describe the interplay among the interprofessional team in rapidly diagnosing, treating, and rehabilitation of patients with blunt cardiac injury.
