Spinal nerves originate from the sclerotome, more specifically, the central region of the anterior-half-sclerotome. This portion of the sclerotome is also responsible for the endoneurium and perineurium of the spinal nerves. This origin stands in contrast to the posterior-half-sclerotome that forms the bone and cartilage of the vertebral column. The posterior half also acts to block the outgrowth of neural crest cells and spinal nerve axons, thus leading to the segmentation of the spinal nerves.
