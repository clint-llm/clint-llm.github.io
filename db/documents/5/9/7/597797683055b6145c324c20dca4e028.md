Morvan syndrome or Morvan fibrillary chorea (MFC) is a rare constellation of neurological symptoms, consisting of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability, autonomic instability, and encephalopathy often associated with autoantibodies to voltage-gated potassium channel complexes (VGKCs). This activity reviews the pathophysiology of Morvan syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of Morvan syndrome.
- Describe the presentation of Morvan syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment of Morvan syndrome.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by Morvan syndrome.
