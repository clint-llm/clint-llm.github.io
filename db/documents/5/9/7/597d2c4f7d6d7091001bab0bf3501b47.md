Patients with posterior cortical atrophy have progressive deterioration of visuospatial and visuoperceptual abilities. The cognitive symptoms invariably and inevitably worsen with patients becoming functionally blind, leading to considerable distress, especially in those who retain insight into the deficits and are aware of the increasing dependency for self-care and day-to-day activities. It can also lead to significant depression and feelings of disempowerment.
