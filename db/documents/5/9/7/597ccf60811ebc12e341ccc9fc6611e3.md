When found early, colorectal cancer treatment is highly successful. The overall 5-year survival rate for rectal cancer is 67%, but this is affected significantly by various factors, most notably the stage of cancer.  If the cancer is diagnosed when it is in the localized stage, the survival rate jumps to89%. The 5-year survival rate is 71% if cancer has metastasized to surrounding tissues or organs and/or the regional lymph nodes. However, with metastatic spread to distant areas of the body, the 5-year survival rate drops to 15%.
