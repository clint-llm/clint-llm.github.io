Inguinal hernias are often first encountered by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, or internist. In all cases, the patient should be referred toÂ a general surgeon for definitive treatment. All hernias have a potential risk of strangulation and incarceration and thus asymptomatic patients need to follow up. Over the years many types of surgical procedures have been developed to treat an inguinal hernia. The open repair is effective but it also results in significant post-operative pain. Patients do need to be educated that if they do not change their lifestyle or reduce body weight, recurrences can occur.
