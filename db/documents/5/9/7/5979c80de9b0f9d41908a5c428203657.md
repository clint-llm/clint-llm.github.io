Gastric Lymphomas are slow-growing indolent neoplasms that respond well to treatment, especially if caught early in the course of the disease. Low-grade gastric MALT lymphomas involving the mucosa and submucosal layers carry a favorable prognosis with up to 90% survival at 10 years. In the vast majority of cases, the low-grade disease can completely resolve with H. pylori eradication therapy alone and recurrence of disease can be influenced by re-infection with H. pylori. Deeper tissue involvement and the presence of chromosomal translocation (t(11;18)(q21;21)) can indicate an increased rate of progression to high-grade disease that does not resolve with H. pylori eradication therapy alone.

High-grade gastric MALT Lymphoma may eventually require chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and/or surgery despite having slow progression over time. MALT-IPI was developed to categorize patients with gastric MALT lymphoma into three prognostic groups: low risk, intermediate-risk, and high risk. The risk factors assessed are age greater than or equal to 70, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, and Ann Arbor Stage III or IV disease.

If no risk factors are present, the patient is considered low risk with a 5-year event-free survival rate approaching 70% and overall survival of 99%. Intermediate risk patients with one risk factor present carry a 5-year event-free survival rate of 56% and an overall survival rate of 93%. Patients with over 2 risk factors are believed to have higher rates of poor outcomes with a 5-year event-free survival rate of 29% and overall survival of 64%.
