Clostridium botulinum produces botulinum toxin and causes botulism, a rare disease manifested as various clinical syndromes ranging from food poisoning, wound infection to infant botulism. The term is derived from Latin word botulus, meaning sausage, as poorly cooked sausages were formerly associated with food poisoning.

- C. botulinum is anaerobic gram-positive bacillus with subterminal spore.

- It is ubiquitous, widely distributed as a saprophyte in soil, animal manure, vegetables, and sea mud.
