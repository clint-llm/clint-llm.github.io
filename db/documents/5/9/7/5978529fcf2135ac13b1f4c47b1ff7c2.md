Factors contributing to hyperglycemia include reduced insulin secretion, decreased glucose utilization, and increased glucose production. Glucose homeostasis is a balance between hepatic glucose production and peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Insulin is the most important regulator of glucose homeostasis.

**Secondary Cause of Hyperglycemia**

The secondary causes of hyperglycemia include the following:

- Destruction of the pancreas from chronic pancreatitis, hemochromatosis, pancreatic cancer, and cystic fibrosis

- Endocrine disorders that cause peripheral insulin resistance like Cushing syndrome, acromegaly, and pheochromocytoma

- Use of medications like glucocorticoids, phenytoin, and estrogens

- Gestational diabetes is known to occur in 4% of all pregnancies and is primarily due to decreased insulin sensitivity

- Total parental nutrition and dextrose infusion

- Reactive as seen postoperatively or in critically ill patients

**Major Risk Factors for Hyperglycemia**

- Weight more than 120% of the desired body weight

- Family history of type 2 diabetes

- Native Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, or African Americans

- Presence of hyperlipidemia or hypertension

- History of gestational diabetes

- Presence of polycystic ovarian syndrome
