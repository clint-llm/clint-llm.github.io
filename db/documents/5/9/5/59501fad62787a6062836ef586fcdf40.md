Following an attack of acute cholecystitis, the resulting inflammation and adhesion of the gallbladder to GI, together with mechanical pressure applied by gallstones on the gallbladder itself and bowel wall, may result in an ischemic tear of the apposed gallbladder and enteric wall; this mechanism potentiates a fistula between the gallbladder and bowel where the gallstone could pass.

Bilioenteric fistulas usually present as cholecystoduodenal fistulas and contribute to 68% of the cases. Less common variants, cholecystocolic or cholecystogastric fistulas, account for 17% and 5% of the cases respectively.
