Children with MELAS often have normal early psychomotor development until the onset of symptoms between 2 and 10 years old. Though less common, infantile onset may occur and may present as failure to thrive, growth retardation and progressive deafness. Onset in older children typically presents as recurrent attacks of a migraine-like headache, anorexia, vomiting, and seizures. Children with MELAS are also frequently found to have short stature.

Myopathy in MELAS initially presents as exercise intolerance or proximal muscle weakness. Due to the severity of the other neurological features, the myopathy is often under-recognized. The myopathy in MELAS often does not cause a significant functional disturbance.

Seizures in MELAS may be focal or generalized and have no recognized syndrome-specific semiology or EEG findings. Children with younger age of onset tend to have higher rates of drug-resistance epilepsy and therefore more severe clinical dysfunction.

Seizures are often accompanied by sudden focal neurological deficits which are termed "stroke-like episodes." These episodes differ from a typical stroke in that they do not conform to any vascular territory, the MRI findings may fluctuate or resolve more quickly than typical stroke, and the apparent diffusion coefficient on MRI is not always decreased like typical infarct, and may instead be increased or mixed. Typical focal neurologic deficits include hemiparesis, hemianopia, or aphasia. Residual deficits from stroke-like episodes gradually impair neurologic function. By adolescence or young adulthood, patients often have impaired motor function, vision, mentation, and sensorineural hearing loss.

Encephalopathy is another key feature. Altered level of consciousness is often associated with the stroke-like episodes. Mental deterioration begins during childhood and is slowly progressive.

Other organ systems may also be involved in MELAS. Patients are reported to have cardiac conduction disorders, diabetes, and chronic fatigue.
