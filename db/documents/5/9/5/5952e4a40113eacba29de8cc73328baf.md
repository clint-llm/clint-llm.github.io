Although MII-pH testing is a great tool to assess and diagnose GERD-related symptoms, there are some limitations and drawbacks to the test.

- There is a day-to-day variability of the test.

- Assessment of the reflux-symptom correlation uses the SI and SAP indices; however, the validity of these indices is still uncertain.

- When performing the test off PPI therapy, MII-pH findings are not always able to predict the response to PPIs in patients with typical reflux-related symptoms.

- The inability to assess the volume of refluxate

- Difficulty in measuring changes in impedance in patients that have a low baseline impedance (i.e., Barrett esophagus, severe esophagitis, poor esophageal motility)
