The most common adverse effects accompanying mebendazole use are loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhea, flatulence, nausea, vomiting, headache, tinnitus, and elevated liver enzymes.

Mebendazole toxicity is usually limited to gastrointestinal irritation, but there are reports of other serious side effects, including neutropenia (including agranulocytosis) and/or thrombocytopenia, particularly in patients who have received higher dosages orÂ had a more prolonged treatment course than usually recommended.
