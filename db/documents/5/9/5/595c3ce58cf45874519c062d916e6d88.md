The human body has certain types of general sensations, e.g., touch, pressure, etc., and certain special sensations such as smell and sight. One of these special sensations is taste. Technically known as gustation, this sense serves to provide the ability to discern the characteristics of substances that one ingests. At a basic evolutionary level, taste allows one to assess whether these substances are nutritious or potentially hazardous. This sensation is primarily relayed via receptors located on the tongue, but at the higher cortical level, taste is considered a multisensory experience since the smell of a particular food item, its texture, and whether or not it activates pain receptors (e.g., spicy food) all play a role in determining how it “tastes.”
