There are a few rare complications that must be noted. Anaphylaxis is very rare but must be considered and treated promptly.

Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites (HMB), has been mostly described in East Asian journals; this occurs in patients with chronic EBV infections and presents as an exaggerated reaction to mosquito bites. These symptoms include bulla formation, skin necrosis, high fever, and malaise. The patient will usually recover from these episodes, but may later develop a malignant histiocytosis that may prove fatal.
