GHB users often experience an initial disinhibition and euphoria as quickly as 15 minutes following ingestion. The classic presentation of GHB toxicity is a sudden onset of coma followed by an abrupt awakening within several hours. Symptoms are dose-related with higher doses causing more severe respiratory and CNS depression. It is not unusual for users to become agitated or combative before, during, or after a prolonged period of somnolence or coma. Additional CNS findings include amnesia, myoclonic activity, and seizure-like effects. Bradycardia, hypotension, apnea, vomiting, and hypothermia may also occur.

It is often difficult to obtain a reliable history due to patientsâ€™ altered mental status. Clues to GHB toxicity may include empty mini shampoo bottles in their possession, attendance at a party or nightclub, or possible sexual assault.
