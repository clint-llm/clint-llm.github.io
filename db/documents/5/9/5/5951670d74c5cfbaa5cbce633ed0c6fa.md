Some scholars and scientists are skeptical that the Braak staging system can accurately correlate neuroanatomical LB density/dissemination with predictable clinical symptoms. The staging is based on retrospective clinical pathologic studies in younger-onset PD patients with about 6% to 40% of the cases not following the proposed caudo-rostral progression pattern of pathology.

The above-mentioned complexity is exemplified in patients with incidental Lewy body disease (ILBD), or LBs found in autopsy with no documented clinical parkinsonism.
