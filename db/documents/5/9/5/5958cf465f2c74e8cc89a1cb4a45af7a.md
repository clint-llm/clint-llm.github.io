Patient education is key to the successful management of patients with clear cell carcinoma of the cervix. The care providers should ensure that patients are instructed to immediately consult their providers if they develop any symptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding. Patients must also be informed about the risk of taking DES during pregnancy as it may induce clear cell adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix and vagina of the female offspring.

The interprofessional team should ensure that patients are provided with the required information about their disease and provide them with written information leaflets or refer them to educational websites, to help patients better understand their disease and the available treatment options.
