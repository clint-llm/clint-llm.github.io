Patients' preparations before conventional angiography are individualized based on the patients' characteristics, type of angiography that is planned, and the indication. All patients undergoing conventional angiography should be well hydrated to minimize the risk of contrast medium-induced nephrotoxicity. Fasting for 6 t 8 hours may be required in certain circumstances. Patients with impaired renal function, diabetic patients on metformin, patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, and those with prior history of allergy to iodinated contrast should be appropriately evaluated before angiography to ensure the safety of the procedure.
