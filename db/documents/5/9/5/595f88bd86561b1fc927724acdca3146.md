The most common side effects of amoxapine therapy include but are not limited to insomnia, palpitations, tachycardia, hypotension, and constipation.

Also, since amoxapine imparts, although minimal, effects on the histamine H1 receptor, antihistamine side effects must be taken into account, especially in the elderly population consisting of patients above the age of 65. These effects include sedation, insomnia, dry mouth, delirium, and Parkinsonism symptoms.
