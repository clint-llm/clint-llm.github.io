Malignant pleural mesothelioma is primarily linked to asbestos exposure, with some suggesting that asbestos inhalation causes repeated pleural inflammation, interference with mitosis, activation of proto-oncogenes, and free radical production. Other reports indicate associations with ionizing radiation, such as mantle radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma, or a germline mutation of BRCA 1 Associated Protein (BAP1).

Professions associated with exposure to asbestos include:

- Shipbuilding

- Mining

- Ceramics

- Cement manufacturer with asbestos

- Auto parts manufacturer, especially that of brake lining

- Paper mill worker

- Insulation work

- Railroad repair

There is no evidence that alcohol, tobacco, or dietary intake is involved in malignant pleural mesothelioma.

It is believed that particular genetic makeup or changes may make people more susceptible to this disease. Research shows that the loss of one copy of chromosome 22 is commonly seen in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Other chromosomal anomalies that have been identified include deletions in chromosomal arms 3p, 1p, 6q, and 9p.
