Initial treatment for patients with ulnar neuropathies that lack atrophy should include nonsurgical modalities such as anti-inflammatory medications, external padding of the nerve, and night splinting with the elbow in 45 degrees of flexion, or of the wrist in neutral position depending on the etiology of the compression. Additionally, occupational therapy that educates on appropriate positioning of the extremity may help to alleviate symptoms.

**Cubital Tunnel Syndrome Surgical Management**

For patients with significant atrophy and weakness, or those who have failed, conservative nonsurgical treatment should consider surgical management. Surgical release of Osborne's ligament, whichÂ spans the heads of FCU, can release pressure on the nerve at the elbow. The release can be extended proximally through the medial intermuscular septum and distally through the flexor-pronator aponeurosis to allow for free movement of the nerve. Ulnar nerve transposition may also serve to relieve the traction and compression of the ulnar nerve when placing the nerve superficial to the flexor-pronator origin, which positions the nerve anterior to the axis of the elbow motion.

Alternative treatments of cubital tunnel syndrome may include a medial epicondylectomy, which has a lower incidence of ulnar nerve injury compared to transposition but has the disadvantage of an increased risk of elbow instability and flexor-pronator weakness.

**Ulnar Tunnel Syndrome Surgical Management**

Surgical management of compression at Guyon's canal should address the specific pathology causing the nerve compression. Ganglia and other local masses should be excised when possible and results in favorable patient outcomes. Typical release of Guyon's canal should include all four compartments spanning from proximal to the wrist flexion crease and extending to the mid-palmar line. It is important, however, to note that an isolated loss of motor function indicates a zone 2 compression, and therefore should only be managed with release of the pisohamate ligament and exploration for a deep ganglion cyst.
