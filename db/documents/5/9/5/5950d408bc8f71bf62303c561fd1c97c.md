**Proximal Humerus Fractures**

Traditionally, surgeons have utilized a deltopectoral and a transdeltoid lateral surgical approach in open reduction and internal fixation of proximal humerus fractures. Injury to the anterior humeral circumflex artery and axillary nerve are common complications of such procedure; therefore, a couple of studies have aimed to establish anatomic landmarks to identify and protect the anterior humeral circumflex artery during surgical fixation.

The first study’s objective was to identify simple landmarks for quick access to protect both humeral circumflex arteries (anterior and posterior). Calculating the mean distances of the anterior humeral circumflex artery to the infraglenoid tubercule, the coracoid, the acromion, and the midclavicular line, which were 26.9 mm, 49.2 mm, 67.0 mm and 74.9 mm, respectively. The mean distances The second study was also aiming at identifying bony landmarks to prevent injury of the anterior humeral circumflex artery and the axillary nerve during surgical treatment, and researchers found that the anterior humeral circumflex artery was located 5.1 cm below the inferior border of the medial acromion and 2.5 cm below the prominence of the lesser tuberosity.
