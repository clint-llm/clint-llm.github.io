The principal goal of the treatment in OH is to reduce adverse outcomes such as falls, disability, and impaired quality of life. Treatment is only indicated for those symptomatic and therapy should be driven by symptoms and not by targets of blood pressure.

First, eliminate predisposing factors, especially medications, and exclude hypovolemic status. Then, start stepwise with non-pharmacological maneuvers, followed by pharmacologic interventions. Symptoms must be assessed in every consult to monitor progress.

- Non-pharmacological therapy, the principal basis is to decrease venous pooling to the lower body, and to increase the intravascular volume: Physical maneuvers: change of position gradually, compression waist high stocking (30 to 40 mm Hg), avoid standing motionless, tensing leg muscles, an abdominal binder and exercise (swimming or recumbent biking). Lifestyle modification: increase salt consumption 6 to 10 grams per day and water intake 2 to 3 liters per day.

- Pharmacological therapy, the aim is to raise the blood pressure when the patient will stand up or will perform any activity in the upright position, avoiding side effects and the complications of increasing the blood pressure for a prolonged time. Fludrocortisone is the first-line treatment in the non-hypertensive patient. Second-line therapy includes midodrine indicated for patients with or without hypertension.
