Several variant neural connections exist in the orbit. A significant proportion of these neural connections involve the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1) and extraocular muscles. These communications include branches of V1 merging with: inferior and superior divisions of CN III, CN IV, CN VI, carotid plexus, superior rectus muscle, medial rectus muscle, and levator palpebrae superioris muscle.

The venous system of the orbit is also highly variable, as a dense anastomotic network is typically present. There is no single venous correlate to the ophthalmic artery. Instead, there is a superior ophthalmic vein and a variable inferior ophthalmic vein. The two ophthalmic veins may drain to the cavernous sinus independently or join first before entering the cavernous sinus.
