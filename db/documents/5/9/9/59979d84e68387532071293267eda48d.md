De Quervain tenosynovitis is named after the Swiss surgeon, Fritz de Quervain, who first described it in 1895. It is a condition which involves tendon entrapment affecting the first dorsal compartment of the wrist. With this condition thickening of the tendon sheaths around the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis develops where the tendons pass in through the fibro-osseous tunnel located along the radial styloid at the distal wrist. Pain is exacerbated by thumb movement and radial and ulnar deviation of the wrist. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of De Quervain tenosynovitis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiologies and pathophysiology of De Quervain tenosynovitis.
- Review the examination procedures necessary to perform on a patient presenting with suspected De Quervain tenosynovitis.
- Summarize the treatment and management of De Quervain tenosynovitis.
- Outline possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of De Quervain tenosynovitis and improve outcomes.
