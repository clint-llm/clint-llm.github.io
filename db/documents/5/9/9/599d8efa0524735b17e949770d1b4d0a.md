Neonatal abstinence syndrome is influenced by many factors, including maternal-fetal-placental pharmacokinetics, neurotransmitter dysregulation, genetic and epigenetic factors. The pathophysiology underlying NAS has not been fully understood. However, rat models show differences between neonatal and adult withdrawal processes. Although several mechanisms have been proposed as potential pathways, there appears to be a complex interaction between the various neurotransmitters (like dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate), lack of adequate expression of some opioid receptors (kappa and delta receptors), and differential maturation of neuronal circuit.

Genetic mechanisms for differences in NAS expression have additionally been suggested. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the genes for opioid receptors (mu - OPRM1, delta - OPRD1, and kappa - OPRK1) and dopamine metabolism pathway (catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene) are associated with shorter hospital stay and duration of treatment. Studies evaluating SNPs in the genes for opioid metabolism like the ABCB1 gene and cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes like CYP2B6, CYP2D6, and CYP34A have been inconclusive. Besides the genetic mechanisms, epigenetics, like DNA methylation resulting in decreased expression of OPRM1 genes, have also correlated with increased NAS expression severity.

Several neurotransmitters play some role in NAS, but most signs and symptoms of NAS are secondary to increased noradrenergic output from locus ceruleus, which is the leading site for noradrenaline production in the brain. Chronic opioid stimulation in-utero and sudden cessation post-birth lead to increased norepinephrine levels through upregulation and super-activation of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Through the same pathway, other neurotransmitters are also altered and believed to cause NAS's clinical manifestations. For example, decreased serotonin causes sleep deprivation, decreased dopamine causes hyperirritability, and increased acetylcholine causes cholinergic symptoms such as sneezing and diarrhea in NAS babies. Increased corticotropin release from activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis has also been noted to cause stress and hyperphagia during the opioid withdrawal process in the neonates.

The mechanism for signs and symptoms of withdrawal from other drugs seems to be almost similar to opioid withdrawal, although some distinction exists. Withdrawal symptoms from in-utero exposure to SSRI/SNRI may be secondary to excessive serotonin and norepinephrine. Neonatal TCA withdrawal may be due to excess cholinergic transmitters. Withdrawal symptoms from in-utero exposure to Benzodiazepines are probably due to increased gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
