Torsion of a testicular appendage is generally a self-limiting condition and, as such, most cases receive conservative therapy. Conservative management includes bed rest, scrotal elevation, ice, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and analgesics. The inflammation and pain usually resolve within one week.

Surgery is rarely indicated for a torsed testicular appendage. A scrotal exploration should only be performed if it is difficult to differentiate from testicular torsion, if the pain is severe and uncontrollable by analgesics or if the pain is prolonged or recurrent. If there is any reasonable doubt about the diagnosis, a scrotal exploration should take place to exclude testicular torsion definitively. If surgery is ultimately the outcome for a torsed testicular appendage, there is no need to explore the opposite side as is typically done for testicular torsions.
