Primary intraocular lymphoma is a great masquerader and can mimic nonspecific uveitis. The delay between the onset of symptoms (ocular or CNS) and a positive diagnosis usually varies from 4 to 40 months.

**Ophthalmic Findings**

The most common symptom is a painless blurring of vision or a complaint of floaters. The disease is bilateral in 80% of the individuals and is asymmetric in presentation.

Creamy lesions with yellowish-orange subretinal or sub-RPE infiltrate may be seen, leading to "leopard skin pigmentation" over the lesions.

**Central Nervous System (CNS) Findings******

The new onset of seizures indicates CNS involvement in a case of PIOL.
