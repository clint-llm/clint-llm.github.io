The theory of having only four or five types of tastes has been debatable in the domain of gustation. Some of the gustation researchers have argued that there's no real rationale to test these basic tastes and thus it was never tested. As a result, those researchers suggested that there may be fine distinctions and differences in the perceptual quality in the taste classifications, making them not only four orÂ five taste types, but rather a variety of different taste forms.
