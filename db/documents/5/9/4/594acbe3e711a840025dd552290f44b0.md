Angioedema is characterized by one or more areas of well-demarcated, non-pitting edema of deep subcutaneous tissues. It is primarily known to involve the face, lips, tongue, and oropharynx, but also, can also involve the genitals, distal extremities, and gastrointestinal mucosa. Immediate identification of angioedema is of the utmost importance due to the potential for rapid development and progression of life-threatening airway compromise. This activity eviews the evaluation and treatment of angioedema and highlights the importance of a cohesive interprofessional team in providing optimal care to patients with angioedema.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with angioedema. 
- Explain when airway intervention should be considered in patients presenting with angioedema.
- Describe the treatment of angioedema.
- Develop a cohesive, interprofessional team approach to evaluate and manage patients with angioedema.
