Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome can lead to complications of the affected organs like fetal loss, stroke, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, valvular abnormality, acute coronary syndrome, mesenteric thrombosis, or hepatic veno-occlusive disease.

Perioperative complications are common in APLS due to the added prothrombotic risk posed by the surgery. The anticoagulation strategy should be clearly defined before any surgery in patients with APLS to prevent thrombosis.
