Many healthcare teams are involved in the care of patients requiring cystectomy with urinary diversion. As part of multidisciplinary care, preoperative and perioperative evaluation and management with nutritionists, anesthesia and pain management teams, geriatricians, smoking cessation counselors, physical and occupational therapists, and primary care teams are vital. Preoperative evaluation of all patients undergoing cystectomy by a dedicated enterostomal therapist is critical, even if an orthotopic neobladder is desired as the primary reconstructive option. The intraoperative evaluation may rarely require conversion to either ileal conduit or continent cutaneous urinary diversion, and preoperative evaluation of the abdomen in varying positions can allow for ideal placement of ileal conduit stoma or catheterizable channel.

Preoperative marking of the stoma site both ensures the surgeon appropriately positions the ostomy and allows for more in-depth preoperative counseling with the patient and his/her family. Preoperative marking has been associated with independent care of ostomy, decreased stoma-related complications, improved appliance application, and earlier resumption of normal activities.
