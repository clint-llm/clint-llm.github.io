The treatment of HaNDL syndrome mainly depends on the severity of the disease. It is a self-limiting condition and has a good recovery rate without treatment. But due to the high likelihood of recurrence of the disease, education, and reassurance are crucial in the management process. Symptomatic management of headaches is necessary during an acute attack. During the first two presentations, patients usually undergo extensive investigations such as neuroimaging and spinal tap, but after a secure diagnosis of HaNDL, there is less extensive repeat testing.

Antiepileptic and migraine prophylaxis can help prevent acute attacks since its close association with migraine-like headaches. Although the response of these drugs is difficult to compare to the natural process of the disease itself due to its self-limiting property.
