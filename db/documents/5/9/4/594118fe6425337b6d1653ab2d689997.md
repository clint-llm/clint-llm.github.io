Before a receiver can give good feedback, he or she must have positive listening skills and allow the sender to confirm message delivery. There are several tips to be a good listener:

- Focus on the sender.

- Listen to the message, not what you want to hear.

- Do not start judging the sender if your relationship is not solid. Watch the sender’s body language to assess information about the sender’s attitude about their message.

- Make sure to repeat back in your own words what you thought you heard them say.

- Ask clarifying the question if needed to help you understand the message.

- If the sender seems to start to go off-topic, redirect the conversation to the original issue/concern.

- While listening to the sender, do not let yourself get sidetracked or make assumptions.

- Finally, never start formulating a response before you have heard the entire message.

Active Listening requires participation. Our teammates and patients will greatly appreciate this improved communication tool.
