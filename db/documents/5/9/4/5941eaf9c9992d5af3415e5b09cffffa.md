Malaria vaccine would be an ideal tool to control, prevent, eliminate, and ultimately eradicate the disease. The complexity of P. falciparum infection has hindered several attempts at developing an effective vaccine, yet the acquisition of partial immunity and successful treatment of malaria with purified immunoglobulins from semi-immune adults showed that the development of a vaccine is attainable. Researchers have identified several potential targets in the parasite´s infectious cycle. Currently, 20 vaccine candidates are undergoing clinical trials.****The most promising and most advanced vaccine to be developed so far is a licensed RTS, S subunit vaccine (RTS, S/ASO1), targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage of infection, thus preventing hepatocyte infection and parasite development, consequently limiting RBC invasion. It consists of a recombinant protein of theP. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP) conjugated to the hepatitis B surface antigen.

There has been an emergence of a (widely used) pyrethroid insecticide-resistant malaria vector population, causing extensive research with their first results suggesting a better effect of long-lasting insecticidal nets treated with PBO (piperonyl butoxide) instead of pyrethroid laced nets.
