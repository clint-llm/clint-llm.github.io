Galactosemia is an inborn error of metabolism due to impaired degradation of galactose. The disease was first described in 1917, and defective galactose metabolism was explained as the cause in the 1950s. If not recognized and treated promptly, affected infants may develop significant morbidity within days of birth. Newborn screening tests in developed countries have helped identify affected infants early. However, providers must maintain a high index of suspicion in ill newborns as feeding intolerance, hepatomegaly, lethargy, coagulopathy, and renal dysfunction may occur within the first few days of life, even before newborn screening tests have been finalized.
