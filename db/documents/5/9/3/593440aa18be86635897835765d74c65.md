Cervical spondylosis is a slowly progressive, degenerative disease process that deteriorates with age. However, the severity of symptoms may not necessarily correlate with the degree of spondylosis seen on neuroimaging. Patients who present with axial neck pain typically improve over time but can have a recurrence of pain. One study noted that 79% of patients with neck pain improved or became asymptomatic by the 15-year follow-up after the onset of symptoms.
