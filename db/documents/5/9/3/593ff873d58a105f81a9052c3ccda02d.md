Understanding nephrotoxic pharmaceutical agents is a key component of the interprofessional healthcare team and a patient-centered approach. Starting with the clinicians who prescribe the drugs to the pharmacists who dispense the drug and the nurses who administer the drugs, there is a chain of transport where many healthcare providers are a part of patient care. Knowing the toxic effects, these agents may significantly impact the quality of care a patient receives. The nurse should be aware of which drugs are nephrotoxic, especially with patients that already have renal impairment. They can counsel the patients regarding these agents and report any issues back to the prescriber. The pharmacist can reinforce this counsel while also performing total medication reconciliation, checking doses (especially those that require renal adjustment), and contacting the clinician if there are any issues. These types of interprofessional collaborations will prevent renal toxicity from occurring when it need not. [Level 5]

Furthermore, through the understanding of preventative measures and thresholds for toxicity, healthcare providers may enhance patient safety. Lastly, with the development of numerous biomarkers targeting types of renal damage, response to treatment can be monitored when knowledge of the potential renal effects of medication is known.
