There are five different types of cartilage found in the human body: hyaline, fibroelastic, fibrocartilage, elastic, and physeal cartilage. The type of cartilage found lining the articular surfaces of native joints is predominantly hyaline cartilage. The role of hyaline cartilage is to provide a smooth surface that is friction-free and can withstand the joint's repetitive loading and off-loading. The composition of hyaline cartilage is predominantly water, type 2 collagen, and proteoglycans.

By weight, water typically comprises 70Â to 80% of the mass of hyaline cartilage. In the presence of osteoarthritis, water content increases, which leads to decreased strength. Articular cartilage consists of five different layers; superficial zone, intermediate zone, deep layer, tidemark, and subchondral bone. When there is damage to articular cartilage that goes deep to the tidemark, this leads to fibrocartilage formation. Fibrocartilage has been formed as a result of the release of pluripotent mesenchymal cells from the bone marrow.
