Tinea pedis is a very common infection worldwide and is commonly encountered by the general healthcare professional. While the acute condition is managed by the physician, the focus today is on prevention. To lower the morbidity, the infection is best managed by an interprofessional team

Both the nurse and pharmacist need to educate the patient on the potential for reinfection if lifestyle changes are not undertaken. The old shoes should be discarded, and one should avoid sharing personal care items. At the swimming pool or sauna, protective footwear should be worn. The feet should be left dry, and one should avoid wearing constrictive shoes which lack aeration. Cotton socks are preferred, and one may add a drying antifungal powder if the feet are constantly perspiring. Open communication between team members is important to avoid the morbidity of the infection.

**Outcomes**

For the majority of healthy people, once treatment is started outcomes are excellent. Most people see symptoms relief in a few days and full recovery in 7-14 days. However, in patients who are hemiplegic or immunocompromised, the tinea infection can be associated with cellulitis or even pyoderma.
