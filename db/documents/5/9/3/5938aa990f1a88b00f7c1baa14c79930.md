Lab values found in stercoral colitis are non-specific but include leukocytosis and elevated acute phase reactants. Elevated lactic acid and anion gap metabolic acidosis in the setting of stercoral colitis should raise concern for bowel ischemia or perforation.

Findings on CT that suggest the diagnosis of stercoral colitis are fecal impaction with dilation of the colon, most commonly the rectosigmoid colon, but the entire colon can be affected if the patient presents late. Occasionally, fecalomas can be visualized on CT as radiopaque masses within the colon. In cases of edema or ulceration secondary to pressure necrosis, there is a focal thickening of the colonic wall, typically adjacent to fecalomas. There can also be diffuse bowel wall edema from increased intraluminal pressure, which appears as a mucosal discontinuity on CT imaging. Mucosal discontinuity refers to decreased uptake of IV contrast from areas of the bowel wall where blood supply is compromised. This distinguishes stercoral colitis from uncomplicated fecal impaction, where the colonic wall is typically thin. Other findings that suggest stercoral colitis are pericolonic fat stranding.

If extraluminal bubbles of gas or an abscess are visualized, this suggests that perforation has already occurred.
