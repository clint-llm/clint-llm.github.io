The patient's BUN creatinine ratio, magnesium levels, and blood pressure require monitoring while on therapy. Uric acid monitoring is debatable. Therapeutic monitoring of cyclosporine in transplant patients is a valuable tool in adjusting drug dosage to prevent acute rejection, nephrotoxicity, and predictable dose-dependent adverse reactions. The ideal therapeutic range of cyclosporine in whole blood is as follows:

Kidney transplant: 200 to 400 ng/ml in the first week after transplantation; 125 to 275 ng/ml in the second week to the sixth-month post-transplantation; 100 to 150 ng/ml in the seventh to the twelfth-month post-transplantation; and 75 to 160 ng/ml one year after transplantation (residual concentration predose).

Heart transplant: 250 to 350 ng/mL in the first six months; 100 to 200 ng/mL six months to one year after transplantation (residual concentration predose).

Liver transplant: 250 to 350 ng/mL for the first six months; 100 to 200 ng/mL six months to one year after transplantation (residual concentration predose).

The range between effective cyclosporine concentrations and the concentrations associated with serious toxicity is fairly narrow. Sub-optimal doses or concentrations can lead to therapeutic failure or severe toxicity. Cyclosporine is subject to therapeutic monitoring based on pharmacokinetics measures. The medication has low-to-moderate within-subject variability.
