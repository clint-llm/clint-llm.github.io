The pituitary gland is an ectodermal origin. AtÂ approximately 36 days of gestation, an upward growth from the ectodermal roof of the primordial oral cavity called the hypophyseal diverticulum or Rathke pouch gives rise to the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland. By eight weeks of gestation, the hypophyseal diverticulum loses its connection with the oral cavity and comes into contact with the infundibulum and posterior pituitary. The proliferation of the hypophyseal diverticulum produces the cells that make up the adenohypophysis or anterior pituitary.
