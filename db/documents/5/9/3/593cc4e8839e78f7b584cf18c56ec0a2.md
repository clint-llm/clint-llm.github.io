- Caution is warranted when treating patients on hemodialysis or with severe renal impairment with creatinine clearance less than 30 mL/minute. As this antibiotic primarily gets renally excreted, individuals with renal disease will need dose adjustments and closer monitoring.

- There are no guidelines for dosing in hepatic impairment, but extreme caution is necessary when considering use in this population. This medication is contraindicated in any patient with a prior history of amoxicillin or clavulanic acid-induced hepatic dysfunction.

- Lastly, use in patients with previous hypersensitivity reactions to amoxicillin, clavulanic acid, or other beta-lactam antimicrobials is also contraindicated. As amoxicillin is a penicillin derivative, there is a high likelihood of crossover hypersensitivity in patients with a documented penicillin allergy. In this population, clinicians should consider alternative antimicrobial options.
