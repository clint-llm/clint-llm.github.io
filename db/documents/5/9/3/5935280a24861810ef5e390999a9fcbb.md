Osteochondromas are common benign osseous surface lesions generally arising from the metaphysis of long bones. The lesions are most commonly asymptomatic and found incidentally. However, there are several well-documented complications, including but not limited to fracture, bursa formation, neurovascular compression, and malignant degeneration. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and etiology of osteochondromas highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in evaluation and management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of osteochondromas.
- Describe the differences in solitary (non-hereditary) and multiple (HME) forms.
- Outline the clinical presentation of osteochondromas.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of osteochondrosis to help improve outcomes.
