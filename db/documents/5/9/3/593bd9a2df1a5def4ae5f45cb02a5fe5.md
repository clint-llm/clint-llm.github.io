The trachea has a D-shaped cross-section structure consisting of 16 to 20 incomplete, horseshoe-shaped cartilaginous rings anteriorly and laterally with a membranous wall posteriorly.

The paired arytenoids lie superiorly on the posterior surface of the cricoid, forming the cricoarytenoid joint and serve as the attachment for the intrinsic laryngeal muscles, vocal ligament, and vocal folds.

The blood supply to the trachea is segmental and approaches the tracheal wall laterally and divides longitudinally into superior and inferior branches. The branches anastomose with the segmental arteries above and below. At the same time, the arteries branch anteriorly and posteriorly within the intercartilaginous membrane and anastomose to the contralateral side.

The trachea is also divided into cervical (C6 to C7) and thoracic segments (T1-T4). The cervical trachea is supplied by the tracheoesophageal branches of inferior thyroid arteries, which branch off the thyrocervical trunk from the subclavian arteries. The thoracic segment and carina are supplied by the bronchial arteries, which branch directly from the aorta.

Stenosis is recognized as the most common long-term complication after endotracheal intubation and ranges from 10 to 22%, with 1 to 2 % being symptomatic.

Over-inflation of endotracheal cuffs beyond 20 to 25 mm Hg can cause ischemic necrosis of the tracheal mucosa, leading to stenosis. During prolonged intubations, the frequent shearing motion of the endotracheal tube from respiratory cycles, suctioning, swallowing movements, head movements, coughing, and yawning can injure the tracheal mucosa.

Patients with airway stenosis often present with dyspnea on exertion, cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, or shortness of breath, although the trachea can be narrowed up to 75% before any symptoms become apparent. In stenosis due to neoplasm, symptoms can also be insidious due to the slow-growing nature of certain tracheal tumors and be misdiagnosed as asthma.
