**Preparation**:

- Patients are required to be nil per os (NPO) for up to 4 hours before the CCK test; this is to avoid endogenous secretion of CCK, which can cause gallbladder contraction and, in turn, inhibit the absorption of the radiotracer, which may lead to false-positive test results.

- During the period of prolonged fasting, bile in the gall bladder becomes too vicious and turns into sludge, which prevents the radiotracer from entering the gallbladder.

2. The physician should make a note of the other medications taken by the patient.

3. Intravenous access: Before gaining intravenous access, the patient receives instruction regarding the procedure of the test. After this counseling session, the CCK will be injected through the vein, and the imaging done over the patient's abdomen. During that time, the patient should remain still.

- Sincalide is the synthetically prepared C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin commonly used in nuclear medicine hepatobiliary studies. Its purpose is to reduce the size of the gallbladder by emptying it for better visualization.

- At present, 40 ng/kg/hr of CCK infusion for five minutes after using a secretin test dose (intravenous bolus of 0.2 mcg/kg).

- Pain medications like morphine may also be used during the procedure.
