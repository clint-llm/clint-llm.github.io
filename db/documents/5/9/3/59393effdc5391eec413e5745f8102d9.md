In the ideal situation, there are two operators. One person will perform the intended procedure, whereas the other person will be dedicated to sedation, patient monitoring, and team coordination. Nevertheless, there are many circumstances where having two operators is not possible, particularly for unplanned procedures. This situation is most common in a rural or resource-constrained setting. If the circumstance is the lone operator, this person must be prepared to abandon the procedure and rescue the patient.

Personnel involved in PSA must have the following training:

- Perform appropriate patient selection

- Acquire advanced airway-management skills (a mandatory prerequisite for performing these techniques)

- Understand and manage medications administered

- Perform patient's' monitoring

- Manages all potential complications
