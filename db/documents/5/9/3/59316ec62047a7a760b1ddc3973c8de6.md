Teriparatide is a recombinant fragment of human parathyroid hormone consisting of its first amino(N)-terminal 34 amino acids and a potent osteoanabolic agent. It has undergone multiple clinical trials that proved its safety and efficacy for the treatment of osteoporosis. In a seminal randomized placebo-controlled trial (n = 1637) by Neer et al (2001) in postmenopausal women with at least one prior vertebral fracture (the Fracture  Prevention Trial) , 20 mcg teriparatide administered  daily (i.e. the currently approved dose for prescription) decreased the risk for new vertebral fractures by 65% (RR = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.22-0.55) and nonvertebral fragility fractures by 53% (RR = 0.47;  95% CI = 0.25-0.88) and increased bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine by 9% and at femoral neck by 3% over a median follow-up period of 21 months.

Not only do other subsequent trials corroborate these effects in head-to-head comparison trials to available therapies such as alendronate and risedronate in postmenopausal women, but also replicate them in men and patients with different etiology for osteoporosis such as glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, indicating activity independently of sex and through primary and secondary osteoporotic etiologies.

It has FDA approval for the following indications:

- Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with a high risk for fracture

- Increase of bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis at high risk for fracture

- Treatment of men and women with systemic glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis at high risk for fracture

‘’High risk for fracture’’ is defined in the FDA drug label as a history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk fracture factors, failure, or intolerance to other available osteoporosis therapy (e.g., bisphosphonates).

To preserve the increments of BMD acquired with teriparatide, therapy with an antiresorptive agent (e.g., bisphosphonates) should restart after teriparatide discontinuation.

Given the availability of safe, effective, and less expensive therapies for osteoporosis, the exigence of high risk for fracture or intolerance or nonavailability of other therapies points to the fact that PTH analogs should be used as ‘’last resort’’ treatment and reserved for severe osteoporosis ( defined by WHO as BMD of T-score 2.5 or less plus at least one fragility fracture) because patients with severe osteoporosis have significant risk for fracture.  In a meta-analysis of cohort studies of 15259 men and 44902 women with prior fractures, a personal history of previous fragility fracture increased the risk of any subsequent fracture by more than 86% compared to individuals without prior fracture (RR = 1.86; 95% CI = 1.75-1.98).

Other than the approved indications for osteoporosis, studies and reports indicate possible benefits of teriparatide in fracture healing, hypoparathyroidism, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and periodontal disease.
