Isolating Coccidioides organisms in a patient is definite evidence of a coccidioidal infection, and this diagnostic approach is used most frequently in patients with complicated pulmonary or disseminated syndromes. Sputum collection has no risk of transmission.

Professionals most frequently use serologic testing to diagnose primary coccidial infections. Often, the patients may not have sputum production, and fungal cultures are not feasible. CSF cultures are often negative in coccidioidomycosis. Minimally reactive test results should not be dismissed as insignificant. A negative serologic test result does not exclude the presence of coccidial infection. Therefore the test should be repeated over the course of two months.

Detection of tube precipitin antibodies is sometimes called the IgM test. The polysaccharide antigen of the fungal cell wall is responsible for this antibody. Tube precipitin antibodies are detected in 90% of patients in the first three weeks after exposure. The prevalence of tube precipitin antibodies decreases to 5% by seven months after exposure. Complement-fixing antibodies (CF) are immunoglobulin G (IgG), and the antigen responsible for these antibodies is chitinase. Complement-fixing antibodies can be detected in other body fluids, and their detection in cerebrospinal fluid is an especially important aid to the diagnosis of coccidial meningitis. Complement-fixing antibody concentration is expressed as a titer, such as 1:4 or 1:64.

An enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect Coccidiosis IgM and IgG antibodies are available. However, the results are not interchangeable with the immunodiffusion (ID) and CF tests because different antigens are used for EIA. Enzyme immunoassay results should be confirmed with immunodiffusion tube precipitin, immunodiffusion complement-fixing (IDCF), or complement-fixing test (CF) because these tests have established a track record. Nevertheless, positive results with the EIA commercial kit are highly sensitive (95%) for coccidiosis infection, but false-positive results occur more frequently when compared to TP and CF tests.

Antibodies detected by the original tube precipitin or complement-fixing tests can be detected by alternative procedures known as the immunodiffusion tube precipitin and immunodiffusion complement-fixing tests. Although these tests are conducted similarly, different antigens are used to measure different types of antibodies. Test results are as sensitive as the tube precipitin and complement-fixing antibody detection tests.

Overall, the serological tests are likely to be positive in a normal host who has been exposed to Coccidioides species. In a study of 41 patients with culture-confirmed coccidioidomycosis, the CF was positive in 23 (56%), the IDCF in 29 (71%), and the EIA in 34 (81%). In six (15%) patients, all serologic tests were negative.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) probes to detect coccidiosis DNA directly in the patient’s clinical specimens are not available commercially. Genomic studies in research settings show that PCR tests are 98% sensitive and 100% specific.

A specific ribosomal RNA sequence can be detected using a commercially available DNA probe (Gen-Probe, San Diego) in mycelia grown in the laboratory. At present, molecular methods to differentiate between C. immitis and C. posadasii are available only at a limited number of reference laboratories.

Latex tests are simple to use and are widely available in clinical settings but are less sensitive. There are significant numbers of false-positive reactions.

Antigenemia and antigenuria may occur with early or chronic Coccidioides infections. The PCR test, if applied to CSF, is particularly useful for the diagnosis of meningitis because frequently the CSF cultures are negative. In a study of 24 immunosuppressed patients with coccidioidomycosis, most (17/24; 71%) had a positive test for antigen in the urine. The Histoplasma antigenuria assay was positive in 14 of these patients, confirming the cross-reactivity between the two fungi.
