Antiarrhythmic medications have several areas of concern. First and foremost, most agents also have some degree of pro-arrhythmic potential. Practically speaking, while trying to suppress arrhythmias with the medications, the medications themselves can lead to other (potentially more dangerous) arrhythmias.

Other side effects of class Ia antiarrhythmics are more drug-specific. Procainamide may induce lupus erythematosus, reversible after discontinuation of the offending drug. An adverse effect caused by treatment with quinine is called cinchonism and includes nausea, dizziness, headache, tinnitus, and visual changes. Disopyramide has an anticholinergic effect and accounts for many adverse side effects, such as flushed and dry skin, thirst, hyperthermia, mydriasis, confusion, agitation, and urinary retention. Due to arrhythmogenic effects, class Ic antiarrhythmics are contraindicated in post-myocardial infarction patients.

Therapy with beta-blockers may have cardiovascular side effects such as bradycardia and AV block. Beta-blockers noncardiac side effects include exacerbation of asthma and COPD, lethargy, and dyslipidemia. All K+ channel blockers share this potential side effect. The reason for this is straightforward if one compares the action potential phases to the ECG. The T wave on the ECG represents ventricular repolarization. Phase 3 of the action potential represents repolarization. If a K+ channel blocker is given, this prolongs phase 3 of the action potential due to the slow efflux of K+ ions. If the repolarization phase of the action potential is prolonged, the T-wave on the corresponding ECG also gets prolonged, which creates a prolonged QTc interval. Drodenadrone is not for use in a patient with severe heart failure or decompensated heart failure, or cases of permanent atrial fibrillation, according to pulled safety data from eight clinical trials.

Verapamil may cause unwanted effects such as AV block, bradycardia, and constipation. The most frequently reported diltiazem side effects are headaches, dizziness, and edema. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) like verapamil and diltiazem have common adverse drug reactions, i.e., peripheral edema. A prescribing cascade happens when the edema is misinterpreted as a new medical condition, and a diuretic is t prescribed to manage the peripheral edema.

Minor adenosine adverse effects include flushing, a sense of impending doom, and sweating, which are usually transient due to the drug's short half-life. More severe side effects include hypotension, chest pain, AV block, and asystole. The adverse effect of bronchospasm makes it contraindicated in asthmatic patients. Clinicians should avoid adenosine in patients with SVT involving accessory pathways (WPW, antidromic AVRT) due to the risk of tachycardia exacerbation.

Atrial tachycardia with AV block is arrhythmia specific for digoxin toxicity. Digoxin toxicity is characterized by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, confusion, and color vision alterations.

A recent meta-analysis reported that ivabradine therapy was associated with an increased incidence of atrial fibrillation, and the effect was more observed in the patients with LVEF >40%.
