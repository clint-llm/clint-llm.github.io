The periodontium is also significant because of its effect on systemic health and environmental risk factors affecting it.

Some medications reported as affecting the periodontium include anti-convulsants (diphenylhydantoin), immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, and CCBs.

Smoking and bacterial biofilms within periodontal pockets are known to be the common causes of loss of attachment between cementum, and alveolar bone promotes tooth loss.

Epidemiological studies have shown that periodontal diseases are associated with an increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight (LBW). This can happen by direct vertical transfer of maternal bacteria that cause inflammation (Gram-negative bacteria contained in the dental plaque biofilm, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum.
