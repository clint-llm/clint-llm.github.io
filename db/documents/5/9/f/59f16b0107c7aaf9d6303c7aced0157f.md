Hypovolemia is a sign of an underlying disorder, therefore, consultations should be tailored to the disease that is causing the hypovolemia. After proper fluid resuscitation and diagnosis of the underlying etiology specialties should be involved to manage the specific disease as needed. In the case of gastrointestinal losses or bleeds, a gastrointestinal disease specialist should be involved to directly treat the source. Nephrologists are usually consulted when renal issues are determined to be the culprit. For trauma patients and burn victims, surgery should be consulted. In cases where patients are not responding to fluid resuscitation, an intensivist may be consulted as these patients may be undergoing hypovolemic shock and require more critical care.
