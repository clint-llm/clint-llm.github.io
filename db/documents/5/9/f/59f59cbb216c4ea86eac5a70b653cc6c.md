Leukemia cutis is regarded as a systemic manifestation of underlying leukemia and generally carries an unfavorable prognosis.

While some patients can experience remission of skin lesions after systemic chemotherapy, a diagnosis of leukemia cutis strongly correlates with additional sites of extramedullary involvement, with meninges being the most common site of spread (40%).

A 2-year follow-up in AML patients showed a 6% survival rate with skin involvement vs. 30% in those without skin infiltrates.
