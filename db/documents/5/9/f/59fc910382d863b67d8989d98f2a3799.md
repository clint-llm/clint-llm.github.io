Abnormal facial or appendicular movements, hypotonia, poor feeding, abnormal low Apgar scores, altered level of consciousness, and unusual imaging could require an EEG if clinical seizures are thought to be the cause. EEG is indicated for determining brain development, identify cortical hyperexcitability, epileptiform activity, seizures, or assessing prognosis.

Neonatal EEG visual analysis helps to assess brain development and functionality as the baby matures week by week. Knowledge of gestation/postconceptional age, topography (skull and scalp thickness, abnormal cranial vault), interelectrode resistance, benign variants appropriate for age, artifacts, and sleep structures is essential for the proper interpretation. Postconceptional age is defined as gestational age (in weeks) plus the number of weeks since birth. Gestational age is the number of weeks/months the child was in the womb. Legal age is the age of the child since birth. Prematurity is defined as birth at a gestational age < 38 weeks; the full term is defined as birth at a gestational age of 38Â to 42 weeks.
