The disorder can be diagnosed via a medical examination and discussion of medical and familial history, self-reported symptoms, endoscopy of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and, through the use of molecular testing of the blood for screening of genetic mutations known to be linked to the disease. Pre-natal genetic testing can also be performed, and if positive, endoscopic screenings for polyps can begin as early as 10 years of age.
