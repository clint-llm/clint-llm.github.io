Symptoms of sudden onset dizziness or nausea accompanied by loss of strength or sensation require immediate evaluation by a team of medical professionals as these can be symptoms of an acute stroke. Head imaging will be performed to confirm a stroke diagnosis and evaluate you for medical and surgical treatment. Prompt evaluation is necessary as one drug called TPA requires that you be evaluated within 4.5 hours of onset. If a blood clot is found and reachable, you may be a candidate for an intravascular procedure to remove the blood clot called a thrombectomy. The risk factors for having a stroke include high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, tobacco smoking, obesity, and a sedentary lifestyle.
