There are no serious complications of black piedra infection. In the absence of treatment, patients with comorbidities (diabetes, immunodeficiency, and malignant tumors) may develop alopecia.

Reports exist of secondary pediculosis (head lice), as well as mixed piedra (black piedra plus white piedra in the same individual) in patients with poor scalp hygiene.
