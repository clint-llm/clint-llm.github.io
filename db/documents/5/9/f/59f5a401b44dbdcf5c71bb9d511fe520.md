A seizure is usually the first neurological manifestation of Sturge-Weber syndrome. Infantile spasms are seen in approximately 90% of affectedÂ patients in the first year of life followed by atonic, tonic, or myoclonic seizures. Increasing hemiparesis commonly accompanies seizures. Seizures progressively become refractory to medication.
