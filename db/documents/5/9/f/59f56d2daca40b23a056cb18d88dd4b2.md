The eyes are a set of sensory organs that play a crucial role in the visual system. The eyes are responsible for detecting light that enters the eyes. Then, the light gets converted into an image in the brain. The sensory and motor innervation of the eyes originate from six paired cranial nerves. These nerves work in sync to manifest movements, reflexes, and vision.
