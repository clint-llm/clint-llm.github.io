The current focus is on prevention, and various studies are looking at how we could reduce post-traumatic neuroma formation during surgical repair.

The CoNNECT randomized trial still in progress is looking at end to end, end to end plus conduit, and no direct suture only conduit secured repairs to determine if tubes are beneficial and if sutureless solutions merit consideration.

A study is looking at a substance that actively decreased neuroma formation when continuously released to repair site.

A group of Chinese scientists is looking into autologous vein grafts to be used instead of nerve grafts to bridge short gaps after nerve injury.

There is also work being done to use stem cells to help nerves regenerate after an injury. Although the main aim is to improve function rather than to reduce neuroma formation.
