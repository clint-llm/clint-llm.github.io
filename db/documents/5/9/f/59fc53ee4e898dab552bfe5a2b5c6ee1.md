The evaluation of aneurysmal bone cysts primarily consists of imaging studies, which can typically provide critical clues to the diagnosis.

Radiographs illustrate cystic or osteolytic lesions with thin “eggshell” sclerotic borders. The enclosed cavity contains many dividing septa.

Computed tomography reveals similar characteristics as plain radiographs, although it may define the cystic septa to a greater degree, highlighting the “eggshell” rim.  Fluid-fluid levels may be present within the cavities due to the separation of the cellular debris from the serum.

Magnetic resonance imaging again demonstrates similar findings as CT.  T1 contrast-enhanced and T2 weighted images can emphasize the septa within the lesion, revealing rims of low T1 and T2 signal

Laboratory studies hold a minimal benefit in the workup and diagnosis of aneurysmal bone cysts, although bears mentioning that alkaline phosphatase levels may present as increased due to the elevated activity of osteoblasts.
