Effective interprofessional communication between the operative and anesthesia teams is essential. A plan for achieving lung isolation, including which devices are most appropriate for the clinical scenario, should be established before starting the procedure.Â Establishing a plan for lung isolation in a patient with a difficult airway is particularly essential. Emergency airway equipment, including that required for a surgical airway, should be immediately available. It is also vital for perioperative nurses and anesthesia technologists or technicians to ensure that all necessary equipment is ready and working. This type of interprofessional interplay among healthcare team members can significantly improve patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Because there is conflicting evidence regarding whether a DLT or BB provides more rapid achievement of lung isolation or complete lung collapse, equipment choice may hinge upon individual provider preference and experience.
