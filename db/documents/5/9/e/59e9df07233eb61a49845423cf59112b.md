All patients need near-perfect visual outcomes. This necessitates a highly accurate calculation of IOL power. IOL formula calculation was first started in 1960. Fyodorov first devised a formula to predict the IOL power that would allow the refracted ray of light to fall on the retina.

The formula was based on three parameters: axial length (AL), corneal refractive power (K), and anterior chamber depth (ACD). This formula was used for anterior chamber IOLs. This formula stressed knowing where the IOL will rest after surgery. This position is known as the effective lens position (ELP). This is the only parameter that cannot be measured preoperatively. ELP is defined as the effective distance between the anterior surface of the cornea and the lens plane, assuming that the lens is infinitely thin.

This ELP is the main limiting factor for postoperative refractive predictability, as the axial length and corneal power are accurately measured.

**Regression formulae**: They are based on a mathematical and statistical analysis of many adult postoperative results. These formulae do not take into account the optics of the eye.

**Vergence formulae**: They are based on Gaussian optics. There are six variables in this theoretic formula which are

- Net corneal power (K)

- Axial length (AL)

- IOL power (IOLP)

- Effective lens position (ELP)

- Desired refraction (D Post Rx)

- Vertex distance (V)
