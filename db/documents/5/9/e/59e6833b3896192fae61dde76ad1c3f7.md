**Adult Acquired Flatfoot Deformity (AAFD)**

When conservative treatments failed to improve AAFD, various surgical interventions merit consideration. Medial displacement osteotomy of the calcaneus with posterior tibial tendon replacement using the flexor digitorum longus tendon, spring ligament reconstruction, subtalar arthrodesis, and triple arthrodesis are alternatives forÂ surgical procedures to correct the flatfoot deformity.

**Navicular Fracture**

Navicular fracture typically requires surgical intervention if it is an acute traumatic injury or a stress fracture that happens in high functional demand such as in athletes. The common operative procedure is an open reduction with internal fixation with the primary goal to achieve anatomical reduction and also to restore the medial column length. Surgical management often results in a satisfactory prognosis; in a case study of ten patients who underwent surgical management after suffering from a comminuted navicular fracture, achieve union with none requiring an arthrodesis. Several potential complications are avascular necrosis, malunion, nonunion, and persistent stiffness. Osteonecrosis is commonly treated with a fusion of the talonavicular or naviculocuneiform joints to restore its length and alignment.
