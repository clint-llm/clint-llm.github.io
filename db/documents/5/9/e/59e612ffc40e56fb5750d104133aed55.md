A ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt is a cerebral shunt used to treat hydrocephalus. The shunt removes excess cerebrospinal fluid. In pediatric patients, untreated hydrocephalus can lead to many adverse effects including increase irritabilities, chronic headaches, learning difficulties, visual disturbances, and in more advanced cases severe mental retardation. This review describes the indications of VP shunts, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the management considerations for patients with a VP shunt.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with a VP shunt malfunction.
- Recall the complications associated with the placement of a VP shunt.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing insertion of a VP shunt.
