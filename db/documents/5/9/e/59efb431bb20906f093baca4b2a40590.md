Because the GON, LON, and TON play significant roles in the innervation of the scalp, they are often associated with occipital neuralgia. Based on the International Headache Society, patients with occipital neuralgia have a stabbing pain in the GON and LON dermatomes that originates from GON or LON compression and spans from the suboccipital area to the upper portion of the neck, the area behind the eyes, and the posterior region of the head.

Additionally, GON blocks have been used to treat other forms of headaches, such as migraines, cluster headaches, and cervicogenic headaches.

Patients with whiplash injuries may also suffer from third occipital headaches. Whiplash injuries are often associated with motor vehicle accidents, and patients with these injuries may have stiffness and pain in the neck, paresthesias, memory problems, and psychological pain.
