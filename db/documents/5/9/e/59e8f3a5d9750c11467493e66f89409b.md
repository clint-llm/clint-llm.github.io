All specimens collected from patients require the application of biosafety measures. It starts with the instructions provided by the healthcare worker to the patient. Clear statements with explanations and step-by-step procedures are necessary, especially for patients who will collect the specimen. Healthcare workers, including laboratory staff, should be well-oriented, especially when they are to collect specimens directly from patients. Personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn at all times during the specimen collection.

Several procedures exist for collecting sterile and non-sterile sample specimens. Better strategies were developed recently to minimize hazards either during and after sending the specimens into the laboratory. For example, the use of the evacuated tube system (ETS) prevented the contact of the patient’s blood from the site of extraction to the phlebotomist and the external environment during venipuncture.
