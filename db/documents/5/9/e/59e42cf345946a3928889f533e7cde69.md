The pathogenesis of most of the cases of Sezary syndrome is still unknown. However, a small percentage of cases of SS are associated with human T-lymphotropic viruses type 1 and 2 (HTLV-I/II) which are endemic in southern Japan, the Caribbean islands, and part of the Middle East. The typical immunophenotype of abnormal peripheral T cell population in SS is CD3+, CD4+, CD7-, CD26-, CD8-. Occasionally SS can occur with the malignant population demonstrating a CD8+ phenotype or even a CD4-CD8- phenotype. SS with CD8+ phenotype may be associated with HTLV-I/II or HIV. . The tumor cells originate from memory T cells or skin-homing CD4+ T cells expressing cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) and chemokine receptors CCR4 and CCR7. Patients with Sezary syndrome have suppressed immunity, as the malignant cells produce type-2, T-cell (Th2) cytokines which suppress Th1 immunity by decreasing the production of IL-12. The role of IL-12 is to stimulate the production of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), thus protecting against tumors.
