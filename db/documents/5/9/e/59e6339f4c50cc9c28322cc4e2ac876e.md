Although complete rupture of the proximal biceps femoris tendon is not common, the patients may have weakness, pain, and sciatic neuralgia if the injured tendon does not receive proper treatment.

The following complications have been reported:

- **Recurrence:**The most common complication. Higher risk with weak hamstring, hamstring-quadriceps strength imbalance, and premature return to activities.

- Peroneal nerve injury: This is usually a self-resolving neuropraxia with distalÂ injuries.

- Sciatic nerve injury: This is reported in chronic cases where there is scarring around the nerve. It indicates nerve exploration.

- Hamstring syndrome: This complicates the nonoperative management of avulsion injuries. The patient will experience a localized posterior buttock and ischial tuberosity pain. Treatment usually involves surgical release and sciatic nerve injury.

- Nonunion of the ischial tuberosity: occurs with nonoperative management of displaced (> 2 cm) bony avulsion fractures. Treatment is open reduction and internal fixation with or without bone graft.
