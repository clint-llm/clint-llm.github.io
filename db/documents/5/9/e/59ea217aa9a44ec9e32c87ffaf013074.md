Usually patient with Meckel's diverticulum and Barrett's esophagus shows increase secretion of pertechnetate.

Meckel diverticula are usually located in the right lower quadrant, but they can occur elsewhere. Lateral views at the end of the study are essential to differentiate anterior structures like Meckel diverticula from posterior structures like kidney, ureters, and bladder. Usually, the hyperactivity of the Meckel's diverticula is prominent, rounded, of small size, and appears simultaneously with stomach activity between 10Â to 20 min after the injection of the tracer. Radioactivity in the Meckel's diverticula increases along with stomach activity.

For Barrett's esophagus, continuous suction of the radioactive saliva is necessary. Cephalad activity of the stomach indicates the existence of gastric mucosa in the esophagus, but first, the clinician must rule out hiatal hernia and gastroesophageal reflux.
