The clinician should always consider SCFE in a pre-adolescent, adolescent, or young adult patient with a complaint of the atraumatic hip, thigh, or knee pain, particularly if associated with limping or inability to bear weight. Pain is most often reported in the hip (52%); however, pain associated with SCFE may also be reported in the groin (13.9%), thigh (35%), or knee (26%).

On examination, a limited internal rotation of the affected extremity can be present, and passive internal rotation may elicit pain. There would be a loss of hip flexion, abduction, and internal rotation. The patient may demonstrate theÂ Drehmann sign, which is obligatory external rotation with passive hip flexion to 90 degrees.
