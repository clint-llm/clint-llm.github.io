Because the diagnosis and management of these patients are challenging, the patient should be managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurosurgeon, neuropathologist, neuroradiologist, hematologist-oncologist, radiation oncologist, and pain specialist. The outcomes for patients with spinal cord tumors depend on many factors including age, comorbidities, the extent of resection, tumor spread, neurological deficits, and pathology. Overall, the prognosis for most patients is guarded.
