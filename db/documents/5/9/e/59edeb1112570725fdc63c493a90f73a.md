Diagnosis is usually made clinically based on the history of recent travel to endemic areas in combination with a classic serpiginous rash. The rash is very pruritic, raised, and has a slower rate of millimeters up to 2 cm per day. This distinguishes it from other migrating infections. Blood tests are not necessary for diagnosis. Not only is eosinophilia found in less than 40% of patients with CLM, but it is also not specific. Non-invasive optical coherence tomography has been used to establish the diagnosis, although this is not often used. Skin biopsy is occasionally performed and may reveal the nematode larvae within a circular canal. A biopsy is not sensitive, and while secondary changes and infiltrate assist in diagnosis, it is not necessary to confirm this clinical diagnosis.
