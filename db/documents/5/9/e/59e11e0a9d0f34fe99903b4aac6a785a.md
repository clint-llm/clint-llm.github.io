Researchers have proposed numerous mechanisms for the degeneration of the posterior tibial tendon (PTT). The most commonly the cause for PTT degeneration is credited to a repetitive loading causing microtrauma and progressive failure. A retromalleolar, hypovascular region does exist and may also contribute to the disease. In a study by Manske et al., cadaver specimens showed a region of decreased blood supply from 2.2 +/- 0.8cm proximal to the medial malleolus to a region 0.6 +/- 0.6cm proximal to the medial malleolus.

The anatomic course of the posterior tibial tendon also likely contributes as the tendon does make an acute turn around the medial malleolus. This location puts a significant amount of tension on the tendon in the region distal and posterior to the medial malleolus. The adjacent tendons, namely the flexor hallucis longus and the flexor digitorum longus, do not take this sharp turn.

Other potential culprits include constriction beneath the flexor retinaculum,
