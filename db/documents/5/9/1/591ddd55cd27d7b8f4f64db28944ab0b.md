Patients who are diagnosed with pneumoconiosis should be advised to change their profession and move to a dust-free profession. While people who are working in coal mines, stone crushing, sandblaster, or such industries in which they are exposed to inorganic dust, should get regular check-ups, lung function testing, and chest X-rays every 1-3 years. Encourage smoking cessation to all miners who smoke.
