The goal of telehealth is better access to health care while maintaining medical expenses.

One of the most successful applications of telehealth is the reduction of health disparities to areas with limited physician access. Approximately 20% of the United States population resides in rural areas, and only 9% of physicians serve these areas. Telehealth aims to eliminate transportation costs, which often burden patients of low socioeconomic status. Through similar mechanisms, it can improve health literacy by providing patient education and prevent hospitalizations with the assurance of medication adherence.

In addition to improved access, it is estimated that telehealth could save the United States health care system more than $4 billion, annually. The use of technology could reduce referrals, stream-line medical evaluations, and decrease the burden of some preventable diseases. For example, chronic disease accounts for 75% of medical expenses. It is proposed that by monitoring patients at home, ensuring medication adherence via electronic means, and providing expeditious access to a physician, the financial burden of hospital readmissions can be curbed.

Reimbursement and parity laws remain the largest barrier to implementing telehealth services.

Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare allows for telemedicine-specific services to be covered and reimbursed. However, it poses restrictions that may include:

- Type of communication, specifically, synchronous versus asynchronous

- The area the patient resides. The patient must reside in a non-metropolitan region

- The physical location of the patient. The patient cannot be at home; must be at a pre-specified location

- Licensure of the physician. The physician must be licensed and have admitting privileges at the patient’s local hospital.

Medicaid, which is governed by individual states, almost ubiquitously reimburses for synchronous care. Its restrictions, especially for rural health, are less stringent than Medicare's.

Parity laws vary significantly by state, affecting reimbursement for telehealth services for a privately insured patient. While a majority of states now have parity laws requiring private insurers to reimburse for telehealth, many states have varying stipulations. For example, some states require an initial in-person visit to establish a patient-provider relationship. Others have limits on patient locations and provider types, similar to Medicare limits. The amount of reimbursement, known as payment-parity, also varies, and reimbursements for telehealth are often not equivalent to an in-person visit.

There are very few special telemedicine licenses allowing practitioners to care for patients across state lines; currently, the majority of state licenses do not allow the practice of telemedicine for a patient in another state.
