In the majority of cases, the cause of vanishing twin remains unknown, but certain etiological factors are considered to be associated with the loss of the embryo, which includes:

- Advanced maternal age (usually more than 30 years)

- Chromosomal abnormalities in the deceased twin

- Use of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) such as; in vitro fertilization (IVF)

- Increase the incidence of multiple gestations

- Small placenta or other anatomical abnormalities of the placenta may be associated with early twin loss

- Genetic and teratogenic factors
