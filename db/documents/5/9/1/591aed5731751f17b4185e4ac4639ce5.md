The primary goal of treatment is complete surgical excision of the tumor. Wide local excision with the use of frozen sections, or Mohs micrographic surgery, are first-line treatments for sebaceous carcinoma of the head or neck.

The role of radiation therapy for primary sebaceous carcinomas is uncertain.Â Some small studies have reported good outcomes from the use of radiation as the primary treatment of ocular sebaceous carcinoma, but surgical resection remains the primary treatment modality.

Adjuvant therapies include cryotherapy, and topical mitomycin C. The use of these therapies is primarily reserved for pagetoid spread to the conjunctiva.
