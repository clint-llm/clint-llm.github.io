There are variations between individuals when evaluated in cadaveric studies with regard to the origins of the C1 spinal nerve and, thus, the suboccipital nerve. In 80 cadaveric specimens, it was found that the dorsal rootlets were present alongside ventral rootlets in 60% of cases, and these dorsal rootlets formed a dorsal root ganglion in 30% of cases. Surprisingly, therefore, in around 40% of specimens, there were no dorsal rootlets that contributed to the formation of the C1 spinal nerve.

However, these inter-individual differences in the origins of the nerve do not affect its function or subsequent branching patterns as the nervous supply of the suboccipital group of muscles. Furthermore, after splitting to form the suboccipital nerve from the ventral ramus of the C1 spinal nerve, there was a connection with the dorsal ramus of the C2 spinal nerve found in 15 cadaveric specimens.
