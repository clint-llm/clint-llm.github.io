Post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia is usually a late complication of weight loss surgeries. It has been thought of as post-prandial hypoglycemia; however, meal-independent hypoglycemia is also recognized. It can present with symptoms of hypoglycemia; however, in some cases, hypoglycemia can be asymptomatic and still affect cognition. Treatment options include nutritional therapy, pharmacotherapy, and surgery.
