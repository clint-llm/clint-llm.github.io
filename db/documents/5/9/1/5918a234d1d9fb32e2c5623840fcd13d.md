This syndrome was first defined in 1910 by Demetrius Chilaiditi, a Greek radiologist, after he reported three cases of patients who were found to have intra-abdominal free air on radiological imaging caused by the interposition of the bowel between the right hemidiaphragm and liver. Chilaiditi sign has a 0.025% to 0.28% incidence worldwide with a male to female ratio of 4:1. It most commonly occurs in the elderly population, where there is a 1% incidence. However, it has documentation in patients from 5 months of age to 81 years of age. There is also an 8.8% incidence in mentally ill patients.
