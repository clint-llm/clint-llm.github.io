A detailed history focusing on possible etiologies is essential, as the cause actively directs treatment of tenosynovitis.

Physical exam findings vary based on cause and extent; however, in general, they demonstrate swelling, pain, erythema, and difficulty moving the affected joint. For infectious flexor tenosynovitis, the “Kanavel signs” are important to recognize:

- Tenderness of the flexor sheath

- Enlargement of the affected tendon in a symmetric pattern

- Baseline contracture of the affected tendon

- Pain with passive straightening of the tendon

These signs are 91 to 97% sensitive for pyogenic flexor tenosynovitis, however, with a reduced specificity of 51 to 69%.

Stenosing tenosynovitis, a phenomenon resulting from enlargement of the flexor tendon relative to the flexor retinaculum pulley (A1 pulley), results in “catching” or “locking” of the joint.
