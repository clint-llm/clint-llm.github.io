As with most drug toxicities, it is important to ask about the type of medication ingested, any concurrent ingestions (including drugs or alcohol) and current medications, the strength of the medications, the timing of ingestion, and intent.  Any recent history of trauma, especially to the head, should be noted.

In warfarin toxicity, it is important to ask if the person is currently taking warfarin for an underlying condition, as you may need to consider the risk of reversing the INR. It is also important to ask about any signs or symptoms of abnormal bleeding, such as nosebleeds, dark urine or dark stools. This will be an important piece of information to guide the appropriate clinical treatment. As with any history, be sure to ask about any underlying medical conditions that may alter the clinical course in the setting of warfarin toxicity, specifically asking about alcohol use or potential hepatic disease.
