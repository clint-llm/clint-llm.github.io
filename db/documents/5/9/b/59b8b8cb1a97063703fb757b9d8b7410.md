Certain viruses such as hepatotropic and non-hepatotropic viruses share links with the causation of the PHL. Of note, the common hepatotropic viruses linked with the causation of PHL are hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections.

In a large case series of over 69 patients with PHL, the prevalence of seropositive HBV infections was 20%; however, the majority of the patient population was from the western world.
