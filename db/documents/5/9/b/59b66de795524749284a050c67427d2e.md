Aside from the general complications of microvascular reconstruction, which should be reserved as another topic, the most common complication of this flap is incomplete healing of the skin graft utilized for donor site closure. Less frequent complications include forearm hematoma or seroma, sensory deficits in the distribution of the superficial branch of the radial nerve and weakness, or stiffness of the hand.

The appropriate patient education and expectations by the surgeon regarding the cosmetic outcomes of the donor site are necessary since the skin graft is often discolored for 8 to 12 weeks after surgery. After healing and maturation, the color of the skin graft will improve and more closely match the color of the surrounding forearm skin.
