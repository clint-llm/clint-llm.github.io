While the neuro-ophthalmologist is almost always involved in the care of patients with homonymous superior quadrantanopia, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a neurologist, neurosurgeon, and neuroradiologist. The nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they will monitor the patient during the treatment of the causative injury and assist with the education of the patient and family. The neuroradiologist also plays a vital role in determining the cause. Without providing a proper history, the neuroradiologist may not be sure what to look for or what additional radiologic exams may be needed. Some patients are sent for visual occupational therapy and rehabilitation. An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to postoperative care can help achieve the best possible outcomes.
