Laryngeal injuries are common after endotracheal intubation, and post-intubation laryngeal edema is the major contributor of laryngeal injury and post-extubation stridor. About half of the patients who present with post-extubation stridor will require reintubation. Since every reintubation event is a risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality, it is of utmost importance to identify the at-risk patients for post-intubation laryngeal edema and/or stridor by performing a bedside CLT in all the high-risk patients as described above and initiate prompt prophylactic IV methylprednisolone administration in case of a negative CLT.
