The molecular structure of sildenafil mimics that of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This similarity protects cGMP from degradation because sildenafil can bind to the catalytic site to act as a competitive inhibitor of cGMP-specific PDE-5,Â the enzyme that normally catalyzes the breakdown of vasodilatory cGMP. When PDE5 is active, cGMP is degraded, causing the vascular smooth muscle contraction, thereby limiting blood flow.

Relaxation of vascular smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum leads to penile erection when the cavernosal sinusoids engorge with blood to compress the subtunical veins against the tunica albuginea. In patients with vasoactive pulmonary arterial hypertension, vasodilation of the pulmonary artery leads to reduced resistance to blood flow, with subsequent reductions in mean pulmonary arterial pressure.
