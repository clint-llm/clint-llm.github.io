The axillary artery has three divisions, based on relative positioning to the pectoralis minor muscle. The superior thoracic artery, also referred to as the supreme thoracic artery, is the first branch of the axillary artery. This artery courses anteriorly and medially along the superior border of the pectoralis minor muscle. The superior thoracic artery then passes between the lateral aspect of the chest and the pectoralis minor muscle. Typically, this artery proceeds to anastomose with the intercostal and the internal thoracic artery. However, there are several physiological variants in both the origin and anastomoses of this artery. In most individuals, it is the only branch of the first division of the axillary artery. The superior thoracic is a small artery that can usually be palpated two finger widths below the clavicle on the midclavicular line.
