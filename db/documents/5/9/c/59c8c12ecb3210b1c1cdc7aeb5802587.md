Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are generally uncommon in the population. In 1953 Johns Hopkins hospital performed an autopsy study with 15,000 cases with only 3 cases of PAVM detected.

PAVMs are seen twice as often in females than males with a male predominance in newborns.

PAVMs are largely associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), which itself affects approximately 1 in 5,000 to 8,000 people. HHT is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of AVMs at multiple sites, including mucocutaneous, pulmonary, hepatic, gastrointestinal, and cerebrovascular systems.
