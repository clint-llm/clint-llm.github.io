The etiology of primary EMPD has been debated but appears to be of apocrine origin. Secondary extramammary Paget disease represents an extension of an underlying adnexal adenocarcinoma or an underlying visceral malignancy, most commonly urothelial or anorectal, but it may also be cervical, prostatic, ovarian, or endometrial.
