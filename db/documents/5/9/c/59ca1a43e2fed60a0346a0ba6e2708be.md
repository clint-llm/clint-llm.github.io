The hemoglobin level should increase by 2 g/dL within 4 to 8 weeks of initiating therapy. Ferritin should be rechecked 8 to 12 weeks after completion of treatment as normalization of ferritin levels and transferrin saturation is the target goal. For patients suffering from severe deficiency, it may take up to 3 months for hemoglobin to return to theÂ normal range.
