Patients with tricuspid stenosis can present with features of systemic congestion, exertional syncope due to reduced cardiac output, or symptoms of accompanying valvular heart disease, such as mitral stenosis (MS). Symptoms of reduced cardiac output include exertional dyspnea, fatigue, or exertional syncope.

Signs of systemic congestion include leg edema, ascites, anasarca, and congestive hepatopathy. The jugular venous pressure is elevated with prominent or giant 'a' wave classically greater in height than usually perceived. A "slow y descent" due to delayed emptying of the right atrium into the right ventricle can also be seen.

The lungs are clear in patients with isolated tricuspid stenosis. On precordial examination, there is a mid-diastolic rumble at the left fourth intercostal space, preceded by an opening snap. It is shorter in duration and softer in intensity than the murmur of mitral stenosis. The intensity of the murmur and opening snap increase with maneuvers that increase blood flow across the tricuspid valve, especially with inspiration, leg raise, inhalation of amyl nitrate, squatting, or exercise.
