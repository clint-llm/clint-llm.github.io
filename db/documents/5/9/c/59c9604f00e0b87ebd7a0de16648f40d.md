Ingestion of unripe Ackee fruit may result in the metabolic syndrome known as "Jamaican vomiting sickness." Clinical manifestations may include profuse vomiting, altered mental status, and hypoglycemia. Severe cases have been reported to cause seizures, hypothermia, coma, and death. Medical treatment is primarily supportive care with intravenous fluids and dextrose. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of ackee fruit toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in providing optimal care to patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how hypoglycin A, the major toxin in ackee fruit, leads to glycogen storage depletion and hypoglycemia.
- Describe how the presentation of ackee fruit toxicity differs from that of acute gastrointestinal infections.
- Describe the evaluation and management of patients with ackee fruit toxicity.
- Identify interprofessional team strategies for improving recognition and management of patients with ackee fruit toxicity.
