- Tracheostomy tube exchange is swift to minimize changes of stoma collapse and patient discomfort, or time when the patient is left hypoxic.

- Once the patient is prepared, and the necessary equipment is available and checked for functionality, the procedure may commence. Pre-oxygenation may be required in those who may not tolerate the procedure well physiologically.

- If there is an inflated cuff on the indwelling tracheostomy tube with a subglottic suction port, first use a syringe to aspirate any secretions that may be sitting above, prior to cuff deflation. In any tube, it is also important to perform gentle suction in the lower airway. Note the amount, color, and consistency of secretions suctioned.

- Remove any sutures or ties attached to the tracheostomy tube and patient. When doing this, the assistant must stabilize the flange at all times to prevent premature removal. Next, the cuff may be deflated. It is also useful to note the amount of air aspirated from the cuff until a ‘vacuum’ resistance is felt. The tube is now ready to be removed.

- In a smooth semi-circular fashion mimicking the curvature of the tracheostomy tube, remove the tube. “out-then-down”  movement

- Inspect the stoma for signs of infection, presence of granulation tissue, bleeding, wound breakdown, and adequacy of a tract. Clean the area with moist gauze (with normal saline or hydrogen peroxide) followed by dry gauze while ensuring no foreign body enters the airway. Stay sutures, if present, may be used gently to pull up the trachea to provide exposure.

- Apply the new, lubricated tracheostomy tube with an obturator in situ. First, the tube with its obturator is rotated 90 degrees from its correct position (at a right angle to the long axis of the neck) to engage the stoma, then turned 90 degrees back to its correct position to be inserted through the tract into the tracheal lumen.

- A common error is making this caudal turn pre-maturely, thereby risking false passage creation or airway occlusion.

- As soon as the tube is in place, remove the obturator and replace it with an inner cannula as appropriate. In a mechanically ventilated patient, reconnect the ventilator tubing and watch for carbon dioxide detection or capnography.

- Confirm proper placement of the tube within the trachea with one of many possible techniques. Traditionally, the patient is ventilated and correct tube placement confirmed by observation of equal chest rise and auscultation of bilateral breath sounds

- If necessary, a flexible fibreoptic endoscope may be used or may use a suction catheter.

- Once correct tube placement is confirmed, the tube is secured with hook-and-loop fastener ties and stoma dressing applied and fill the cuff if necessary.

- Make sure the trach ties are not too tight and should be able to pass an index finger in between the trach ties and neck

- Remove the shoulder roll and reposition the patient.
