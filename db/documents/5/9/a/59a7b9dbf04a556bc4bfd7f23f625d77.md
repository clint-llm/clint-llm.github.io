- This procedure is performed in the outpatient clinic setting.

- The procedure is approximately 2 to 3 minutes in duration.

- The throat microphone is placed externally on the neck, overlying the thyroid cartilage, to assess vocal pitch and intensity.

- Topical 1% lidocaine and a decongestant, usually with 0.05% oxymetazoline hydrochloride, is sprayed or nebulized into the nasal cavity (for transasal laryngoscopy) or the tongue and oropharynx (for a transoral approach).

- The patient is instructed to lean forward with the lower neck flexed forward and the upper neck flexed in a "sniffing" position.

- The laryngoscope is warmed or defogged.

- The scope is then advanced into the nasal cavity past the nasopharynx, in order to provide a view of the laryngeal structures.

- The patient is then instructed to sustain an "ee" (/i/) sound at different pitches and volumes.
