Complications of a percutaneous transcatheter left ventricular pseudoaneurysm closure include but are not limited to the following: bleeding, hematoma, infection, embolism of the closure device, arrhythmia, pacemaker dependence, stroke, and/or death. Since this procedure is rather new and the rate of intervention is low due to the low incidence of LVP, researchers need to perform more studies on the possible long-term effects/complications of this procedure.
