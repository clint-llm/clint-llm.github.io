Calcinosis cutis commonly occurs in patients with systemic sclerosis, especially the limited form (CREST). Twenty-five percent to 40% of patients with limited systemic sclerosis will develop calcinosis cutis ten years after the onset of disease. Calcinosis cutis is seen in 30% of adults and up to 70% of children and adolescents with dermatomyositis. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus can present with periarticular calcification in 33% of cases and soft tissue calcification in 17%.
