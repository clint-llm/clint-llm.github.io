Cystitis cystica is a common benign condition of the urinary bladder where there is a reactive inflammatory change of the bladder mucosa associated with subepithelial vesicles or cysts formation and glandular metaplasia (cystitis glandularis). There are often invaginations of hyperplastic urothelial extensions into the superficial lamina propria, called von Brunn's nests. These inflammatory projections are considered reactive but benign and non-malignant.

Cystitis glandularis is a further, proliferative progression of cystitis cystica characterized by glandular metaplasia of the urothelium.

Cystitis cystica and cystitis glandularis occur mainly in response to chronic irritation or inflammation. They are usually asymptomatic but may present with non-specific signs and symptoms that require thoughtful attention to exclude other morphologically similar malignant lesions such as bladder adenocarcinoma.

A nephrogenic adenoma is a rare, benign bladder tumor that is similar to cystoscopic appearance to cystitis glandularis and represents a type of superficial bladder proliferative disorder.
