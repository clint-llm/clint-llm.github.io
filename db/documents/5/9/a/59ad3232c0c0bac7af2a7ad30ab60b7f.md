When afferent loop syndrome presents acutely, the major cause of mortality is sepsis, which leads to multiorgan failure. Even when intervention occurs before the development of peritonitis and systemic infection, these patients are at increased risk for other periprocedural complications, especially if the initial surgery was for the treatment of malignancy. Patients who have an acute-on-chronic presentation may also experience an increased rate of complications due to malnutrition and anemia. Examples of complications for which these patients experience increased risk include anastomotic leak, recurrent adhesions or strictures, fistula formation, wound infection and dehiscence, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and aspiration on the induction of anesthesia.
