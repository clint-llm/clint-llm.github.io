Early identification of at-risk patients is an effective strategy in preventing aberrant opioid behavior. In the postsurgical setting, opioid abuse increases the risks of poor surgical outcomes, motor vehicle accidents, myocardial infarction, bone fractures, and death, among various other medical issues. Opioid-related adverse events have a direct positive correlation with the opioid dosages. Although the CDC has indicated there is insufficient evidence to determine the utility of opioid risk screening tools, some prescription guidelines suggestÂ using these instruments. In this context, the ORT has been adopted in clinical practice to evaluate the risk of future aberrant opioid behavior.
