The follicle is the primary functional unit in the ovary – responsible for germ cell development and steroid production. The peak of follicular maturation occurs at the midpoint of the ovulatory cycle. At this time, increased estrogen levels, followed by a surge in LH and FSH from the pituitary, results in ovulation. The follicular cells subsequently reorganize to become the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum supplies the hormone progesterone, which serves to stabilize the endometrium until implantation occurs. In the absence of ovulation, no corpus luteum forms; this results in lower levels of progestin, which leads to the persistence of proliferative endometrium. This unstable endometrial tissue is prone to irregular and heavy shedding. Additionally, the presence of high levels of estrogen unopposed by progesterone, are believed to contribute to increased vascular fragility and decreased vascular tone in the endometrium resulting in an increased volume of blood loss. Abnormal prostaglandin synthesis and prostaglandin receptor upregulation, increased fibrinolytic activity locally, and an increase in the activity of tissue plasminogen activator have all been implicated as mechanisms of abnormal uterine bleeding secondary to ovulatory dysfunction.
