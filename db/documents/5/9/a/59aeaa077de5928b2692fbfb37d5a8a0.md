Recent trends in morbidity and mortality indicate that patients with acute on chronic liver failure comprise 5% of all hospitalizations for cirrhosis. When compared to the most common causes of hospitalization in the United States, the healthcare burden per patient is much higher in patients with ACLF. The mean cost of hospitalization for patients with ACLF is three times more than the cost of patients hospitalized with cirrhosis, and five times more than the cost of patients hospitalized with congestive heart failure. The estimated mortality rate in patients with ACLF has decreased from 65% in 2001 to 50% in 2011. The current worldwide mortality rate as per the European Association for the Study of Liver-Chronic-Liver Failure (EASL-CLIF consortium) is 30% to 50%. The mortality rates in the United States, as per the North-American Consortium for the Study of End-Stage Liver Disease (NACSELD) in infected decompensated patients were 27%, 49%, 64%, and 77% with 1, 2, 3, or 4 organ failures, respectively.

Patients discharged following admission for ACLF have a 30-day readmission rate of approximately 30%.
