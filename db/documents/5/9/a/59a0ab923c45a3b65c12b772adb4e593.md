Effective interprofessional teamwork and coordination by clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals are required to provide the best care for the patient. One of the principles that enhance healthcare team outcomes is having a shared goal for everyone, including the patient. Having clear roles between the different interprofessional team members and trusting each other can increase the teamâ€™s efficiency. Crucial for team success is having effective communication skills. A clinician needs to be able to accurately diagnose a disease and prescribe the proper medication and inform possible adverse effects to the patients. Nurses also need to know possible adverse effects so that they can inform the physician if they notice any adverse effects developing. A pharmacist can educate the patient on how to properly administer the drug and the other potential adverse effects, as well as verify agent selection and coverage and report any potential interactions to the ordering clinician. The patient also must tell the clinician and nurse what they are experiencing, anything unusual, so that everyone is informed about the patient's well-being. Through effective interprofessional healthcare teamwork, appropriate management of cephalosporin adverse drug reactions can occur, resulting in better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
