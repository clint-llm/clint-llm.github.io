**New Proposed clinical staging of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in asthmatic patients**

Stage 0: Asymptomatic

- No previous diagnosis of ABPA

- Controlled asthma (according to GINA/EPR-3 guidelines)

- Fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of ABPA (ISHAM working group criteria)

Stage 1:  Acute

- No previous diagnosis of ABPA

- Uncontrolled asthma/symptoms consistent with ABPA

- Meeting the diagnostic criteria of ABPA

- 1a: With mucoid impaction - Mucoid impaction observed on chest imaging or bronchoscopy
- 1b: Without mucoid impaction - Absence of mucoid impaction on chest imaging or bronchoscopy

Stage 2:  Response

- Clinical and/or radiological improvement and

- Decline in IgE by greater than or equal to 25% of baseline at 8 weeks

Stage 3:  Exacerbation

- Clinical and/or radiological worsening and

- Increase in IgE by ≥ 50% from the baseline established during response/remission

Stage 4:  Remission

Sustained clinical-radiological improvement and

- IgE levels persisting at or below baseline (or increase by less than 50%) for greater than or equal to 6 months off treatment

Stage 5a:  Treatment-dependent ABPA

- Greater than or equal to two exacerbations within six months of stopping therapy or

- Worsening of clinical and/or radiological condition, along with immunological worsening (rise in IgE levels) on tapering oral steroids/azoles

Stage 5b:  Glucocorticoid-dependent asthma

- Systemic glucocorticoids required for control of asthma while the ABPA activity is controlled (as indicated by IgE levels and thoracic imaging)

Stage 6:  Advanced ABPA

- Extensive bronchiectasis due to ABPA on chest imaging and

- Complications (cor pulmonale and/or chronic type II respiratory failure)
