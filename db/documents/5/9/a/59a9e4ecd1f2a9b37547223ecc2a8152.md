The interactions between the lungs and heart during exercise are the main physiological phenomena relevant to the test. In general terms, deoxygenated blood returning to the right heart via the venous circulation is pumped by the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. As it advances through the pulmonary capillaries, gas exchange occurs when the capillaries meet the alveoli, with oxygen entering the circulation while carbon dioxide is released into the alveoli.

Oxygenated blood then circulates to the left heart, where the left ventricle pumps it to the systemic circulation, through which it is eventually delivered to the organs to sustain aerobic metabolism. The neurological and musculoskeletal systems are also involved in this process, particularly with concern to the process of matching minute ventilation to cardiac output in response to varying exercise intensity levels. This occurs via reflex responses that adjust the cardiac and pulmonary activity to the oxygen consumption levels required by the degree of exertion. Impairment of any of these components, the cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, or musculoskeletal systems, will decrease exercise tolerance.
