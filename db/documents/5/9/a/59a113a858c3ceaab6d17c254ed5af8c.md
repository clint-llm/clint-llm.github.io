Ganglion cysts are mucin filled synovial cysts containing paucicellular connective tissue. They may be filled with fluid from a tendon sheath or joint. Ganglion cysts are most commonly found (70%) on the dorsal aspect of the wrist arising from the scapholunate ligament or scapholunate articulation. Approximately 20% of ganglion cysts are located on the volar aspect of the wrist arising from the radiocarpal joint or scaphotrapezial joint. The remaining 10% of ganglion cysts can arise from multiple areas of the body including the volar retinaculum of the wrist, distal interphalangeal joint, ankle joint, and foot. Wrist volar retinacular cysts arise from herniated tendon sheath fluid that protrudes out. Ganglion cysts arising from the dorsal DIP joint are called mucous cysts and are associated with Herbeden's nodules. They are commonly found in women between the ages of 40 and 70 with osteoarthritis.
