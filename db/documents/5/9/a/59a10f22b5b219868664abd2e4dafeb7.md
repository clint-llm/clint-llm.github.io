The diagnosis and management of boutonniere deformity is complex and requires an interprofessional team that includes a primary care provider, nurse practitioner, physical therapist, hand surgeon, and orthopedic surgeon. The goal of treatment is to regain full range of motion of the affected finger. Treatment options include both surgical and nonsurgical modalities.  If nonsurgical measures are unsuccessful, surgical joint replacement may be necessary. Joint fusion is another surgical procedure that involves fusing the two joint surfaces of the affected digit together. The benefits of joint fusion are pain improvement, increased the stability of the joint, and prevention of worsening joint deformity. After surgery, patients are instructed to wear a splint or brace for several weeks to keep the proximal interphalangeal joint straight.
