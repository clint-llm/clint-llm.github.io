Scarring is a common complication after laser ablation or electrosurgical cauterization of intranasal telangiectasias due to loss of mucociliary clearance and subsequent crusting. Postoperative nasal hygiene with topical saline sprays and irrigations and deliberate postoperative debridement of crusts can prevent scarring and synechiae formation.

There are no definitive guidelines for optimal postoperative management after endovascular intervention or surgery for AVMs. Postoperative care, including activity restrictions, areÂ based on the location of the AVM, size, the number of lesions, type of procedure (endovascular versus open), and extent of surgery.
