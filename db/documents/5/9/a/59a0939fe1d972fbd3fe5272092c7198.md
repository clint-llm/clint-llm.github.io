The prognosis forÂ lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) will depend on:

- Disease phenotype.

- Early diagnosis.

- Specific treatments.

- Facilities for the latest diagnoses and treatment.

In instances with a very severe phenotype, the prognosis is grim. The disease in certain LSDs is complicated by hydrops fetalis or cardiorespiratory failure in the first year of life. Prenatal counseling is of immense help in such cases.

In LSDs, where treatments are available and begun before organ damage sets in, the prognosis improves lifespan and quality of life. Even in such cases, some organ damage is irreversible. Examples are unrelenting neurological dysfunction after HSCT in Hurler disease (MPS I).

As newborn screening becomes universal, and further improvements in diagnostics and treatments occur, the prognosis is likely to get better.
