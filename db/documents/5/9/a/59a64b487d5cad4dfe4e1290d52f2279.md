IBD and its EIMs have a multifactorial etiology, including genetic predisposition, immune dysregulation, and intestinal microbiota dysbiosis. The resultant chronic systemic inflammation is responsible for the signs and symptoms of the disease. The pathogenesis of EIMs is believed to occur due to an abnormal immune response towards shared epitopes in the gastrointestinal mucosa and the extraintestinal sites of disease.

EIMs have a genetic predisposition as individuals with siblings and first-degree relatives with IBD are more likely to manifest these symptoms.

Some studies have proposed the pathogenesis of EIMs as an autoimmune reaction towards a tropomyosin isoform expressed in the non-pigmented ciliary epithelium (eye), keratinocytes (skin), chondrocytes (joint), the biliary epithelium (hepatobiliary tract), and the gastrointestinal epithelium (GIT).
