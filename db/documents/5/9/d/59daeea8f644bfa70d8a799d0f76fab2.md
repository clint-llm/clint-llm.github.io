The pancreas is an abdominal organ possessing both endocrine and exocrine functions. It produces a variety of hormones that mostly pertain to regulating blood sugar levels. As an exocrine gland, it secretes pancreatic fluid that contains bicarbonate and digestive enzymes. Commonly, a few broad categories of diseases affect the pancreas that can be characterized on imaging: pancreatitis, pancreatic insufficiency, cystic lesions of the pancreas, and pancreatic tumors.

Pancreatitis is a generalized inflammation of the pancreas due to the activation of digestive enzymes produced by the pancreas while still inside the organ. Acutely, this can result from gallstones, alcohol misuse, or hypertriglyceridemia.

Pancreatic insufficiency results when the pancreas is unable to produce enough digestive enzymes to break down food in the digestive tract.

Pancreatic exocrine cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United States.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are malignancies that form in the endocrine tissue of the pancreas. Also known as islet cell tumors, these are rare tumors occurring in approximately 1 in every 100,000 people, and only 1% of all pancreatic tumors are NETs.

Cystic lesions of the pancreas are a relatively common incidental finding on body imaging, with prevalence in the general population rangingÂ up to 14%.
