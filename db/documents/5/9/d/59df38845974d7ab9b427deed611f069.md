Infantile spasms (IS) is a seizure disorder that was first described by William West in 1841 and has been referred to as West syndrome. It is a disorder that affects mostly those in the first year of life and is described as spasms with characteristic EEG changes known as hypsarrhythmia and a strong association with developmental delay or regression.
