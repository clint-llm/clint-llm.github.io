Partial or complete flap failure can result from vascular compromise during the initial few weeks of healing.

If vascular compromise is recognized early enough and corrected, flaps can often be salvaged by returning to the operating room and removing the clot from the blood vessels or correcting a kink, or by applying leeches to the skin paddle to reduce venous congestion. However, prolonged periods of venous congestion or a lack of arterial inflow can cause complete flap loss. Flaps can also be compromised due to vessel compression from a hematoma or wound infection. Intra-operative hemostasis should be meticulous, and patient activities should be limited in the first two weeks after surgery to prevent hematoma formation.

Similarly, blood pressure should be controlled with medication in the post-operative period. Antibiotics should be given before surgery and continued for several days after to prevent infection. Further, patients should be counseled about how to clean their incisions properly after discharge from the hospital.
