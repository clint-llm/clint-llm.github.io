Typical findings include:

- Alpha-fetoprotein levels in men and non-pregnant women vary for age and race but mostly range from 0 ng/ml to 40 ng/ml.

- Maternal AFP levels in pregnancy start to rise from about the 14th week of gestation up until about 32 weeks of gestation.

- Between 15 and 20 weeks, AFP levels usually range between 10 ng/ml to 150 ng/ml.

- Adult blood levels greater than 200 ng/ml in patients with liver cirrhosis strongly indicate hepatocellular carcinoma.
