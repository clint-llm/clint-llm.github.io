The innervation of the larynx is intricate, detailed, and represents some of the more complex relationships in the anatomy of the head and neck. The vagus nerve is the large nerve that supplies the many branches of nerves that innervate the larynx. The superior laryngeal nerve, its external and internal branches, and the recurrent laryngeal nerve all have very distinct roles in motor and sensory innervation of the larynx. Superiorly, sensory and motor innervation are separated by internal and external branches of the superior laryngeal nerves. Inferiorly, the sensory and motor innervation is provided by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
