Natalizumab is an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease. The drug was originally approved to treat multiple sclerosis in 2004, but after reported cases of death due to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy during treatment with natalizumab, the FDA removed the drug from the market. However, in 2006, the FDA reintroduced the drug when multiple protests by those with multiple sclerosis advocated for the use of natalizumab in conjunction with the establishment of an advisory committee that would monitor those on natalizumab. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of natalizumab so that providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes for MS patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the approved indications for natalizumab.
- Summarize the therapeutic mechanism of action of natalizumab.
- Review the recommended monitoring for potential adverse effects of natalizumab.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients who might benefit from therapy with natalizumab.
