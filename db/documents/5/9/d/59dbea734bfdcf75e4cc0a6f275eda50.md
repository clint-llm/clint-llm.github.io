Caffeine consumption is relatively safe in limited amounts. The problem is that many people today are consuming high-energy drinks that contain massive amounts of caffeine, which can lead to complications. Today the issue of caffeine toxicity has been worsened with high-energy drinks. These concentrated caffeinated beverages are not only toxic themselves, but the problem becomes exacerbated when the individual combines caffeine use with other illicit agents, such as tobacco and alcohol. Over the past few years, there have been reports of many deaths following the consumption of such combinations.

Dealing with caffeine toxicity or side effects, or using caffeine therapeutically, requires an interprofessional healthcare team for optimal results. For therapeutic use, query the patient about other potential caffeine sources so that toxicity is not an issue with therapy.Â  Team members are in a prime position to educate the public on the dangers of high-energy drinks and related foods. Clinicians, nursing staff, and pharmacists must be prepared to offer counsel to patients who may be overindulging in caffeine. While there are no absolute contraindications to caffeine, the public should be advised to avoid caffeine if they have cardiac disorders, panic disorder, anxiety, or elevated stress levels. An interprofessional team is the best means by which to convey this message. [Level 5]
