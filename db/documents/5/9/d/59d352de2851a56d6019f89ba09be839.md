The sleep cycle is regulated by the circadian rhythm, a process controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus.

The SCN receives input from nerve cells in the retina that detect light to regulate the circadian rhythm and sleep via multiple pathways that cause the nocturnal release of ACTH, prolactin, melatonin, and norepinephrine. One of the most commonly recognized pathways by which this occurs is via the stimulation of norepinephrine release by the SCN, which in turn stimulates the pineal gland to release melatonin.

Wakefulness is maintained by subcortical structures and pathways activating the cortical system.

- Norepinephrine (locus ceruleus)

- Serotonin (midline raphe nuclei)

- Histamine (tuberomammillary nucleus)

- Dopamine (ventral periaqueductal gray matter)

- Acetylcholine (pedunculopontine tegmentum and laterodorsal tegmentum of the pons)

- Orexin (perifornical area)

Sleep initiation and maintenance require the successful suppression of the arousal systems via the inhibitory activity of the ventrolateral preoptic (VLPO) area.

The extraocular movements after which REM sleep is named is largely due to the cholinergic activity of the pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPT) center and glutamatergic activity of the medial pontine reticular formation (mPRF).
