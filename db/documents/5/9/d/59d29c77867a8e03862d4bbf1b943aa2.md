Sheehan syndrome which is also called post-partum pituitary necrosis refers to the necrosis of cells of the anterior pituitary gland following significant post-partum bleeding, hypovolemia, and shock. Advances in obstetrical care in developed countries have reduced the incidence of this condition. However, it is still a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in less developed countries. British pathologist Harold Leeming Sheehan first described this disorder in 1937.
