Among the differential diagnoses to be considered in patients for whom HCM is the presumed underlying diagnosis are all the entities previously discussed as possible causes of the pseudo-Cushing syndrome (physiologic HCM) including but not restricted to: Pregnancy, morbid obesity, melancholic depression, chronic alcoholism, poorly controlled diabetes, various eating disorders including Bulimia nervosa and the night eating disorder, chronic lymphedema, lipoedema, partial lipodystrophy syndromes (both congenital and acquired), Dercum disease and syndromes of hypothalamic obesity including Prada Willi syndrome, Frolich's syndrome and the Bardet Biedl syndrome. Other rare considerations, especially in children, would include POMC and leptin-deficient associated obesity syndromes as well as cerebral gigantism - Soto syndrome.

Other diagnostic considerations would be entities associated with Anasarca, including generalized protein-energy malnutrition (including Kwashiokor in children), congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver with ascites, and nephrotic syndrome.

Biochemical evidence suggestive of possible HCM without concordant physical findings may occur in settings of exogenous HCM, factitious CS (including abuse of various glucocorticoids, anabolic steroids and peptides like ACTHAR, DDAVP, and corticorelin among patients with severe Munchausen syndrome presentations), severe physical stress, severe malnutrition, anorexia nervosa, hyper-exercise syndrome including the female athlete triad of eating disorders, amenorrhea and osteoporosis, hypothalamic amenorrhea and glucocorticoid resistance states.

There are also reports of rare disorders that can present similarlyÂ to HCM, including ectopic non-adrenal cortisol secretion, normal Cushing syndrome, and biochemical HCM in the absence of cushingoid features.
