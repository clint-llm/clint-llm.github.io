**Denaturation**

Mercaptoethanol is a chemical that can break up disulfide bonds. It "cuts" proteins to the right of the penultimate amino acid's carboxyl group. This cutting can only occur at disulfide bonds because these bonds can receive electrons from the alcohol groups on beta-mercaptoethanol, which is also why this substance is known as a reducing agent. The issue of concern manifests through hormonal denaturation. Hormones are well-known for being proteins with a lot of disulfide bonds. Therefore if placed in an aqueous environment rich in alcohol groups, hormones will denature and lose biological functionality. This condition appears to be why mothers who have alcohol use disorder and breastfeed can stop lactating (due to denatured prolactin), why alcoholics develop diabetes after a while (due to denatured insulin), and why teenagers who excessively consume alcohol stop growing (due to denatured growth hormone).
