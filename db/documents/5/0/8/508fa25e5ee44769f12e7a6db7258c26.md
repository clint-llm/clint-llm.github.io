The treatment for biotinidase deficiency is lifelong but relatively straightforward. The recommended treatment is biotin replacement with a starting dose of 5 to 20 mg daily. However, it takes a few hours to days for seizures and movement disorders to improve and some weeks for skin manifestations to improve. Sometimes, this dose will not be adequate, and the clinical signs may persist. Increasing the dose to 40 mg/day is recommended in such scenarios.

Children with developmental delays may regain lost milestones or reach new milestones depending on the timing of treatment initiation and the extent of damage already experienced due to a delayed diagnosis.

In addition to oral biotin therapy, children with residual neurologic deficits may need medical interventions for spasticity, developmental delay, and bulbar dysfunction. Dystonia and spasticity may be treated with intrathecal baclofen and neurotoxins.
