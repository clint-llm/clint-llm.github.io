Gastroenterology must be consulted for cases of severe pancreatitis, especially if there are complications or endoscopic ultrasound is required to evaluate the pancreatic mass. Radiology plays an important role when appropriate imaging is done to investigate pancreatic etiologies.

Dermatology and pathology must be consulted, as a skin biopsy must be performed and interpreted. If neoplasm is discovered, oncology and surgery must be involved. Interventional radiology may be needed to biopsy metastatic lesions or masses in locations more appropriate for image-guided biopsy techniques.
