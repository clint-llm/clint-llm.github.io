- BAL is an excellent method of obtaining specimens to rule out opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals. It is important to combine culture results with cytology which may show viral intranuclear or intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies on examination of pulmonary epithelial cells. this may help identify viruses like herpes simplex and CMV. BAL is also very useful for detection of fungi and mycobacteria which may not always be identified in blood. The one big disadvantage of BAL is that many potentially pathogenic microorganism may have colonized the airways in the absence of any clinical disease and hence their recovery may not be meaningful.

The use of BAL has been extensively studies in patients with interstitial lung disorders like hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Unfortunately, the findings of BAL are frequently not specific for these lung disorders and thus, the physician must also incorporate the clinical and imaging findings before making the diagnosis. In some disorders like acute eosinophilic pneumonia, BAL has saved the patient an unnecessary lung biopsy

BAL is also proving to be useful in evaluating individuals with occupational exposures to asbestos and other silicates. These macrophage-ingested occupational dust particles is usually visible in the fluid under polarized light.  BAL cytology is also useful for evaluating patients with malignancies of the airways.

For the most part, BAL is performed for diagnostic purposes. However, BAL is uniquely used for the treatment of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. This involves instilling 30 to 50 liters of sterile saline through a double lumen endotracheal tube while the patient is under general anesthesia.
