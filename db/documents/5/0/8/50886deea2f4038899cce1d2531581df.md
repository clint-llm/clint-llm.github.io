The differential diagnosis of a fever and a rash are broad. In the clinical scenario of a sandpaper rash in the presence of a sore throat and fever, GAS infection should be seriously considered. Use of the CENTOR criteria and testing can be utilized. Pustules are more indicative of a local infection such as impetigo or erysipelas. Some viral illnesses which should be considered in the affected population are measles (rubeola), chickenpox (herpes zoster), and hand-foot-and-mouth disease (Coxsackie), which all have specific presentations that distinguish them from scarlet fever. Good immunization, travel, and medical history should be considered when a patient presents with fever and a rash.
