Evidence of anastomosis between the LGEA and the RGEA ranges from about 50 to 94%. One anatomical study, consisting of 17 cadavers, has shown that 94% of vessels anastomose with 70% of those being continuous (without a branching system connecting the two). Various other studies using angiograms have shown a 43 to 65% anastomosis rate, with 23 to 37% being continuous.

The RGEA has been shown to have many different origins. The RGEA most commonly branches from the gastroduodenal artery but may branch off of the superior mesenteric artery when no gastroduodenal artery develops

The LGEA often arises as a common branch with the inferior splenic artery and then branches into two separate arteries distally in its course. The omental branches of the LGEA have been shown to create anastomoses with branches of the middle colic artery.
