Virus depends on the host cell metabolic machinery to survive. Its intracellular existence protects from antibodies action. Expression of antigen on virally infected cells forms the important source of cytotoxic cell activation, which induces apoptosis of host cells leading to the death of a virus.

Cytotoxic T cells appear to be involved in the killing of some bacteria, parasite, and fungi. Granulysin is the protein involved in the killing of these pathogens, which may be present inside or outside the cell. The killing of extracellular microbes involves the release of granulysin when CTL recognize these microbes when they directly get in contact with them. When a microbe is present inside the cell CTL release granulysin intracellularly, this recognition is usually not dependent on MHC. Grnulysin disrupts the integrity of cell membrane inducing lysis of the cell.
