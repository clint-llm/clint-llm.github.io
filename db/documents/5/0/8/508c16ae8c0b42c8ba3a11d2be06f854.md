The most important contraindication to note is the patient who is unfit for general anesthesia which will likely be due to a combination of factors including co-morbidities, sepsis, hemodynamic instability, and widespread metastatic malignant disease. The patientâ€™s wishes are also very important as it is their right to say no to a laparotomy (no matter the indication) if they have the capacity to make that decision.

A thorough clinical evaluation and relevant radiological investigations are paramount as one should always high index of suspicion for medical conditions that may mimic acute abdomen thereby causing a false indication for laparotomy such as acute pancreatitis, hyperglycaemic crisis, gout, gastritis or urinary tract infection

A prognostic predictor tool such as the P-POSSUM score may be helpful at times to assess the morbidity and mortality risks.
