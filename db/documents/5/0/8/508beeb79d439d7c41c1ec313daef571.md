A high level of suspicion should be made in diagnosing aspiration pneumonia, especially in critically ill hospitalized patients and antibiotic treatment should be initiated immediately, and imaging studies should not delay the treatment. The commonly utilized imaging studies are chest x-ray, computed tomography of the chest, which will help in localizing the site of aspiration. However, most cases are unwitnessed aspiration, making it very hard to distinguish between aspiration pneumonitis and aspiration pneumonia. Clinical features may helpÂ to distinguish. In aspiration pneumonitis, a large volume of gastric content has to be aspirated to produce chemical pneumonitis and can quickly progress to acute lung injury with subsequent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Whereas, in aspiration pneumonia, aspiration can be of smaller volumes and can be unwitnessed, which with inoculation of bacteria progress to features of pneumonia and subsequent development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
