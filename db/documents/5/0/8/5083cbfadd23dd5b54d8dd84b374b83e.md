Pelvic inflammatory disease confers a risk of ectopic pregnancy in women of childbearing age. Inflammation and scarring of the upper genital tract may also affect fertility or lead to chronic pelvic pain. Chlamydial infection in pregnancy can also increase the risk of prelabour rupture of membranes (PROM), premature prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM), and preterm delivery.
