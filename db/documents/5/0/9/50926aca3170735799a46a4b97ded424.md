The most effective management of diabetes mellitus demands an interprofessional approach involving both lifestyle modifications with diet and exercise and pharmacologic therapies as necessary to meet individualized glycemic goals. Lifestyle modifications must be combined with oral pharmacologic agents for optimal glycemic control, particularly as type 2 diabetes mellitus progresses with continued loss of pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin production. This activity outlines the indications, mechanisms of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of oral hypoglycemic medications, so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes where glycemic control and diabetes play a role in outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various mechanisms of action of oral hypoglycemic drugs.
- Review the adverse events associated with each class of oral hypoglycemic medications.
- Summarize the contraindications to each class of oral hypoglycemic drugs.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with oral hypoglycemic medications.
