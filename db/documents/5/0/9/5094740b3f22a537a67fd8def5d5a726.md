**Physeal Fractures**

Salter-Harris fractures are fractures of the epiphyseal plate.

- Type I: separation through the physis

- Type II: fracture enters in the plane of the physics and exits through the metaphysis

- Type III: fracture enters in the plane of the physics and exits through the epiphysis

- Type IV: fracture crosses the physics and extends from metaphysics to epiphysis

- Type V: fracture is a crush injury

**Forensic Significance**

Age estimation of the fetus is one of the primary objectives of the fetal autopsy.

Forensic fetal osteology:

- The embryological method is one of the procedures employed in estimating the gestational age of the fetus which is crucial in determining fetal viability postpartum in forensic practice

The forensic examination of fetal remains

- It is not uncommon for a forensic pathologist to be called on to develop the forensic profile of fetal remains in a variety of medicolegal contexts, including cases of criminal abortion/feticide and infanticide.

- In such medicolegal contexts, the presence or absence of ossification centers aids in the gestational age estimation of fetal remains.

- Dimensions of various ossification centers are also useful in estimating the age of the fetus (for example, linear measurements of the neural arch of the atlas, the diameter of the distal epiphysis of the femur).

- Postmortem computed tomography (PM-CT) and plain radiography are useful imaging techniques employed to assess physical maturation of fetal bones.
