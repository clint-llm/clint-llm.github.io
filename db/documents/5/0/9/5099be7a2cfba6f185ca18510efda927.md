An azygos lobe is formed during embryological development when the right posterior cardinal vein aberrantly migrates through the upper lobe of the right lung rather than over the apex. As a result, two pleural layers are carried through the right upper lobe creating a fissure known as the azygos fissure (See Figure 1)**.**While most of the posterior cardinal veins regress during embryological development, the right-sided supracardinal veins form a portion of the inferior vena cava, the intercostal veins, the hemiazygos vein, and the azygos vein. Interestingly, the failure of regression of left-sided supracardinal veins has been reported. This failure leads to such anomalies as the persistence of left superior and inferior vena cava
