Trichinellosis, also called trichinosis, results from roundworms (nematodes) from the genus Trichinella. It is a parasitic infection. It is caused by consuming undercooked or raw meat (usually pork). Trichinella spiralis species is the common cause of human disease by eating raw or undercooked pork. Other mammals like wild carnivores and horses can be reservoirs of infection. It can cause symptoms varying from generalized fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, myalgia to more severe like myocarditis and encephalitis.
