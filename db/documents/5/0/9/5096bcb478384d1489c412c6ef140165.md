Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disorder of connective tissues caused by an abnormality in the synthesis or processing of type I collagen. It is also called brittle bone disease. It is characterized by an increased susceptibility to bone fractures and decreased bone density. Other manifestations include blue sclerae, dentinogenesis imperfecta, short stature, as well as deafness in adulthood. There are also reports of valvular insufficiencies and aortic root dilation. Milder manifestations include generalized laxity, easy bruising, hernias, and excess sweating. Clinical manifestations range from mild with a nearly asymptomatic form to most severe forms (involving infants presenting with crumpled ribs, fragile cranium, and long bone fractures incompatible with life), resulting in increased perinatal mortality.[ This activity reviews the pathophysiology of osteogenesis imperfecta and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of osteogenesis imperfecta.
- Review the presentation of a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta.
- Outline the management options available for osteogenesis imperfecta.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta.
