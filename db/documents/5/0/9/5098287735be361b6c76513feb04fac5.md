As with other class III antiarrhythmic drugs, dofetilide blocks potassium channels in phase 3 of the action potential and slows the efflux of potassium cation back out of the myocyte, slowing the repolarization rate of the cell and widening the action potential's plateau phase. The refractory periods of atrial, ventricular, and Purkinje cells are increased, leading to lengthening of the QT interval on the ECG. The increased widening of the QT interval is possibly due to the inhibition of phosphoinositide 3–kinase, which increases the late sodium current.

Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic agent. By inhibiting a component of the time-dependent potassium current, dofetilide increases the effective refractory period and action potential without affecting the conduction velocity.
