While no vaccine exists,Â control and elimination is a worldwide effort as demonstrated by initial measures implemented in the 1900s and current efforts by the WHO. Cooperation of local governments of endemic areas is paramount to implement screening and treatment as well as a report on the incidence of new cases.

Well-constructed studies on this disease are often sparse as reporting is sporadic and diagnosis and treatment often occur in impoverished areas far removed from controlled environments. Efficacy of treatment, however, has been and continues to be actively studied. An example of this is an open-label, 3-arm, parallel clinical trial showing combinations of nifurtimox with traditional eflornithine and melarsoprol or combination therapy of the latter 2 showed higher cure rates with the addition of nifurtimox.

Control of Chagas disease is also a worldwide collective effort. The Southern Cone Initiative is an example of international corroboration to reduce transmission through vector control. This has resulted in nearly transmission free countries including Chile, Uruguay, and parts of Brazil.
