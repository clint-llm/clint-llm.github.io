Early detection of Gardner syndrome is crucial due to the high probability that it will transmute to malignancy over time. The disease is genetically based and follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. It typically presents as gastrointestinal polyps, skin, and soft tissue tumors, as well as, multiple osteomas. The cutaneous based presentations often include but are not limited to epidermoid cysts, desmoid, and other benign tumors. The progression from an adenoma to carcinoma includes a cellular cascade of events at the tyrosine kinase level of the cell cycle. The disorder is considered a variant of familialÂ adenomatous polyposis, although it manifests in areas other than the colon.
