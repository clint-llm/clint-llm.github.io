Each year thousands of people develop adverse drug reactions (ADR), with a minority resulting in fatalities. Skin reactions are the most common type of ADR and can be diagnostically challenging. Healthcare workers, including nurses and pharmacists, must be vigilant about ADR as they can present at any time in any patient and have a wide range of presentations. The skin reactions can confound even the most experienced specialist. Polypharmacy, or the use of multiple medications, can make the determination of the offending agent even more difficult. Furthermore, there are genetic variations linked to skin reactions, usually related to anti-epileptic medications. It is important for healthcare workers to understand that FDA approval does not ensure safety in each and every patient. During the FDA approval process, the drug is usually studied in a small number of people for a short time, and hence, many side effects can be missed. These trials do not always determine the rare side effects of drugs, and often the ADRs are picked up during post-marketing surveillance. Drugs can be FDA approved and enter the market after phase 3 of clinical trials, which is typically before long-term effects are well-documented. Thus, it is essential for the team of healthcare workers to be vigilant about ADR and monitor patients closely.
