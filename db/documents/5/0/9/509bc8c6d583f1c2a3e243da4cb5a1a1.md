AppropriateÂ antimicrobial administration involves the entire healthcare team: dentists, oral surgeons, orthopedic surgeons, infectious diseases specialists, cardiologists, primary care physicians, and pharmacists. Dentists play a crucial role in the prescribing of antimicrobial prophylaxis. A panel of experts formed the American Dental Association's guidelines on antibiotic prophylaxis before dental procedures to prevent prosthetic joint infection in 2014.

However, impediments to guideline-adherent prescribing include a lack of information regarding the complete cardiac histories of patients presenting for dental procedures, pressure from other physicians and the patients themselves to prescribe antimicrobial prophylaxis, and lack of education regarding the most up-to-date guidelines. The current infective endocarditis prophylaxis guidelines from the American Heart Society were developed after an exhaustive review of all available data.

Cardiologists are crucial in advising patients and dentists about when patients do and do not require antimicrobial prophylaxis before dental procedures and oral surgery. Orthopedic surgeons also play a role when advising patients with implanted prosthetic joints. Primary care providers also contribute, as patients commonly ask whether antimicrobial prophylaxis is necessary before patients present to their dentists for dental work.

Infectious disease physicians have a critical role in advising their patients and other physicians and have also played a significant role in education and outreach. Pharmacists also have a considerable role to play in helping with antimicrobial selection in more challenging situations, such as antibiotic allergy, and especially antimicrobial stewardship pharmacists significantly contribute via outreach and education. Many physicians, surgeons, and pharmacists contribute to the breadth of knowledge regarding this subject with significant research contributions.

As multiple physicians are often involved in these situations, in addition to the dentist or oral surgeon, all members of the patient's healthcare team must provide consistent messaging and education to the patient to avoid antibiotic overprescribing that leads to increased antimicrobial resistance and unnecessary adverse events in situations where antimicrobial prophylaxis does not have benefit.
