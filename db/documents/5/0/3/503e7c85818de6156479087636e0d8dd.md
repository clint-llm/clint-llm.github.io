The function of the pulmonary system is to extract oxygen from the environment and provide it for aerobic respiration at the cellular level. Oxygen is ultimately used to produce ATP, and carbon dioxide is breathed out with other metabolic byproducts.

Respiratory tract organs facilitate the process of gas exchange, including the nose, oral cavity, throat, trachea, bronchi, and lungs. The lungs divide into five major lobes: three lobes on the right and two lobes on the left. Each lobe is made up of many small alveoli, which are the primary site of gas exchange. At the alveoli, diffusion of gases into the arterioles occurs.
