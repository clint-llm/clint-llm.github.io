Microdontia results from the disruption of normal dental developmental processes, where steps are halted prior to completion. These changes may be environmental and/or genetic in nature.

Macrodontia results from over-expression of dental developmental structures, resulting in hyperactivity of the tissues produced during tooth development. This change results in larger than normal teeth, which are often attributed to systemic, syndromic, or environmental factors.

Taurodontism results from one of the three suggested pathologic processes: an unusual developmental pattern that results in the subsequent delay in the calcification of the pulp chamber, a deficiency of odontoblasts with a resultant alteration in Hertwigâ€™s epithelial root sheath, or the result of disrupted developmental homeostasis.

Fusion occurs when two developing tooth buds are in close enough proximity to one another to begin to develop simultaneously as one single unit. This joining can be simply because the teeth are so close together or due to the presence of supernumerary teeth. It has also been suggested that signaling mediated through the Jagged2 gene plays a role in tooth development and the subsequent fusing of teeth.
