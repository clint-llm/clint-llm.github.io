BPF is one of the most severe complications after thoracic surgery, and no effective prophylactic procedure is available. Evidence for buttressing the bronchial stump leading to a reduction in the incidence of a bronchopleural fistula is conflicting. Level 1b evidence exists that an intercostal flap reduces the risk of BPF in people with diabetes. Thoracic surgeons should consider coverage of the bronchial stump by an intercostal muscle pedicle flap in patients at high risk of BPF.

In a prospective randomized controlled trial of pneumonectomy patients with diabetes mellitus, Sfyridis et al. reported that intercostal muscle flap coverage was effective.

Deschamps et al. analyzed 713 pneumonectomy patients.

An interprofessional team of the thoracic surgeon, intensivist, and critical care nurse will improve outcomes. Providers must be vigilant for signs and symptoms described above. Rapid recognition and treatment will decrease mortality and morbidity. Specialty trained nurses monitor patients and report status changes back to the team. [Level 5]
