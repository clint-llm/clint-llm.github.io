Several risk factors can lead to the development of postpartum blues. These include a history of menstrual cycle-related mood changes or mood changes associated with pregnancy, a history of major depression or dysthymia, a larger number of lifetime pregnancies, or a family history of post-partum depression.

Pathogenesis is largely unknown. However, hormonal changes have long been suggested as one of the primary causative factorsÂ in developing postpartum mood changes. Typically, there is a drastic decrease in estradiol, progesterone, and prolactin in the time following delivery. The decrease in these hormones is also noted in the mood changes that occur during the various phases of the menstrual cycle, such as those noted in premenstrual dysphoric disorder.

According to one particular study, the three predisposing factors most often found in women who developed postpartum blues were higher levels of depressive symptoms during pregnancy, at least one previous episode of diagnosed depression, and a history of premenstrual depression or other menstrual-related mood changes.

Other studies have also proposed that elevated monoamine oxidase levels or decreased serotoninergic activity in the immediate postpartum period are also significant risk factors or etiological characteristics that could predispose a woman to the development of postpartum blues.
