Prognostic indicators from randomized control trials lack cases of PACNS. However, data obtained from retrospective observational studies show favorable outcomes when patients are treated with either glucocorticoids or a combination of glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide. Some degree of reduction in life expectancy is observed in PACNS cases when compared to general population. Poor outcomes are found to be associated with larger vessel involvement.
