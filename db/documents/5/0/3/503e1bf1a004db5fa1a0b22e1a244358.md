Many patients that present to the clinic with pathognomonic features associated with Paget disease are usually asymptomatic. The majority of patients with the condition are often diagnosed by an incidental finding on an x-ray study. The disease will present with one bone affected in 1/3 of cases. The spine and pelvis are commonly affected and among the long bones, the femur is often involved. Symptomatic patients can present with the following:

- Pain involving the bones and joints

- Diffuse joint stiffness

- Abnormally enlarged skull

- Musculoskeletal deformities

- Loss of hearing (due to the involvement of the petrous temporal bone)

- Migraines

- Fractures

- Heart failure

- Cranial nerve neuropathies

- Headaches

- Enlarged skull

- Skull and jaw deformity

The lumbar spine, sacrum, and skull are involved in most cases. Pain is a common feature and is worse with weight-bearing.

The physical exam may show bone deformity or angulation, localized pain to palpation and increased warmth. The gait may be altered and there may be balance problems.

Incomplete fractures are common in Paget disease and seen in the tibia and femur. Even mild injuries can result in fractures. Femur fractures often involve the subtrochanteric region.

Osteosarcoma is a rare complication but should be suspected in a patient with sudden increase in swelling or bone pain. The disorder is fatal. Giant cell tumors may also arise in pagetic bone and involve the facial bones. With vertebral fractures, acute spinal cord compression can occur.

An increase in cardiac output is noted in 20% of patients when the axial skeleton is involved. In addition, calcified aortic stenosis is also common in this population.
