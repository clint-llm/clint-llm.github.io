Multi-system trauma involvement is clinically significant in that it should carry a high index of suspicion with "t-bone" collisions. Rollover crashes may cause all ofÂ these impacts as mentioned above and violent insults to the body. As the roof intrudes into the passenger compartment, head injuries are probable. If ejected, an impact with the windshield, window, and roadway or object on the road further complicate an already complicated patient. High-speed motor vehicle collisions, like those seen on the interstates, have a high probability of multi-system trauma involvement.
