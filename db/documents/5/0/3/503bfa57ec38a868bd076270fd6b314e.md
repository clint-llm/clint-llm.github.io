Surgery is not the first-line of treatment for VOR malfunction. The ability to restore the VOR function varies. Due to neuroplasticity, it usually improves spontaneously with time, and no intervention is needed. There are a few suggested interventions for those who do not recover with time. One is an adaptation, and another is exercise-based treatment programs (vestibular rehabilitation therapy). However, it is challenging to restore the VOR function at high velocities in severe cases of vestibular loss.
