Determining the progress of labor is a key component of intrapartum care. Maternal uterine activity is assessed by either manual palpation, external tocodynamometry, or internal monitoring with a pressure catheter. With external tocodynamometry, target uterine activity is 3 to 5 contractions in a 10-minute window. The contractions should last 30 to 40 seconds to be effective. Internal intrauterine pressure assessment using a catheter may also be utilized when the amniotic sac is not intact, in which case the actual strength of contractions can be measured. The most common approach to quantitating uterine contractions is by measuring Montevideo units. Montevideo units are calculated by adding the sum of the net contraction pressures in 10 minutes.  Adequate uterine activity is targeted at 200 - 250 Montevideo units.
