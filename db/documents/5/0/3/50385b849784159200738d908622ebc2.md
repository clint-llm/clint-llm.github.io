Clinical findings of ASH (jaundice, leukocytosis, fever) may demonstrate classical histological finding of steatosis; however few or no MDB.  The opposite may be true, as well.

Inclusions do occur in the liver, muscle, and neural tissues which suggest a common intracellular network of protein synthesis and degradation along with responsiveness to stressors. MBD can be considered a protective mechanism of cell injury or rather a step in the pathogenesis of liver damage.
