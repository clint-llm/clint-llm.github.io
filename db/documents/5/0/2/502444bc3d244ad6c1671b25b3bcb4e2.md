The continuation of the paralysis and muscle relaxation effect is based on the temporary restraint of neurotransmitter release. The half-life differs among the serotypes and relies on when the SNARE protein regains function and releases neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Studies suggest that botulinum neurotoxin serotype A has the most prolonged half-life.
