IPL uses a flashlamp to emit polychromatic light across a broad wavelength spectrum of approximately 400–1400 nm, which makes it fundamentally different from a laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation), whose light is necessarily monochromatic (of a single wavelength), collimated (with waves running in parallel), and coherent (with waves in phase).

Lasers and light devices produce a clinical effect when their light is absorbed by the skin, resulting in the emission of photons that carry thermal energy.
