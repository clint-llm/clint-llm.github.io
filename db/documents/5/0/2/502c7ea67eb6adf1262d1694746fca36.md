The management of patients with FED is challenging and complex, and it requires collaboration between ophthalmologists and optometrists on the patient’s care team. FED is a progressive disease, and a patient’s quality of vision and quality of life should be a major consideration when selecting management approaches. Routine eye exams are crucial. Although surgical options are available for advanced disease, there is a possibility of graft failure. In early stages during medical management, the pharmacist can assist with instructing the patients on the use of hyperosmotic eye drops or ointments. If there is a concern with patient compliance, the pharmacist should contact the prescribing as well as provide further patient education. Nursing can also help in this regard, as well as ascertaining and encouraging medication compliance. When the condition progresses to a surgical solution, the ophthalmic surgeon should coordinate with nursing for follow-up care after surgery, so that post-operative care expectations are set and met. Since the FED patient population is typically elderly, patients may benefit from social workers and low vision therapists.

Given the challenge of FED management, it is crucial to employ an interprofessional healthcare team approach, so that collaborative care and information sharing lead to optimal patient outcomes through each stage of the condition. [Level 5]
