Nuclear imaging plays an adjunctive role in seizure imaging. There are circumstances where nuclear imaging studies add complementary information to that of traditional cross-sectional imaging such as MRI.

Positron emission tomography with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) allows for metabolic imaging within the brain. The fluorodeoxyglucose is actively taken up by neuronal cells, in an activation-dependent distribution. Thus, FDG uptake is increased in parts of the brain during a seizure, and conversely, uptake is decreased within the seizure focus interictally. These temporal factors contribute significant limitations to FDG-PET imaging, making it technically challenging to obtain the images either during a seizure or immediately after.

Single-photon emission CT (SPECT) produces images through the use of radioisotope production of gamma rays. These radioisotopes are linked to parent molecules, known as radiopharmaceuticals. Radiopharmaceuticals such as Tc99m-HMPAO do not cross the blood-brain barrier and act as perfusion agents within the brain. Through rapid intravenous administration of a radiopharmaceutical within 90 seconds of seizure onset, regions of increased perfusion within the brain can be identified, which correspond to the seizure focus. Similarly, postictal administration results in decreased cerebral blood flow in the epileptogenic center.
