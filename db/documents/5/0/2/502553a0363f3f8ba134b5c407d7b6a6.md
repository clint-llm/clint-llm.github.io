If the patient presents with a symptomatic renal cyst, which may include abdominal pain or urinary obstruction, then the differential is broad. Given that the kidneys are bilateral structures almost every organ can be implicated in pain caused by a renal cyst. It is worth noting, however, that most renal cysts are asymptomatic and are most commonly found incidentally. The differential diagnosis for a symptomatic cyst includes but is not limited to:

- Kidney stones

- Pyelonephritis

- Adrenal neoplasm

- Renal neoplasm

- Splenic infarction

- Hernia

- Trauma

- Gallbladder disease
