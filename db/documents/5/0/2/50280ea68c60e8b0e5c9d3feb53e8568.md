Arterial supply to the abdomen is by the branches of the abdominal aorta. The abdominal aorta is the furtherance of the thoracic aorta into the abdominal compartment by piercing the diaphragm close to the twelfth thoracic vertebra. The abdominal aorta bifurcates around the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. It provides a vast network of paired and unpaired branches that supply the abdomen and later bifurcates to supply the pelvis and lower limbs.

Venous drainage of the abdomen is by the inferior vena cava and its tributaries. The blood from the portal vein passes through the liver and finally drains into the inferior vena cava. The inferior vena cava forms at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra by the joining of left with the right common iliac veins. It ascends anterior to the vertebral column, just right to the abdominal aorta. It pierces the diaphragm at the eighth thoracic vertebrae just before opening into the right atrium in the thorax.
