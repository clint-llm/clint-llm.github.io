There are few contraindications to the Seton placement. Active infection and abscess should be drained at the initial procedure, and if the tract identified, then a Seton may also be placed. If the internal opening if found to be cancer, then this scenario would mandate an oncologic treatment for the patient and further workup and management. Both acute and chronic fistula tracts may be treated with a Seton regardless of additional pathology found. Superficial fistula tracts are most expeditiously treated with a simple fistulotomy if the tract involves the posterior area and small amount of sphincter muscle. Anterior fistula tracts, especially in females, those in patients with prior fecal incontinence and those with Crohn disease should not undergo fistulotomy as incontinence rates are high. For this group of patients, following Seton placement, follow-up with colorectal specialists for more complex surgical therapies is recommended.
