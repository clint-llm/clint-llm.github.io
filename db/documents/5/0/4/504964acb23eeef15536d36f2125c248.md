Two vital cranial nerves that are present within the midbrain are cranial nerve III, the oculomotor nerve, and cranial nerve IV, the trochlear nerve. The oculomotor nerve has a portion that lies between the cerebral peduncles located in the ventral midbrain while the trochlear nerve comes out of the midbrain dorsally.
