In general, the indication for debridement is the removal of devitalized tissue such as necrotic tissue, slough, bioburden, biofilm, and apoptotic cells.

Debridement is a major component of wound management to prepare the wound bed for re-epithelialization. Devitalized tissue, in general, and necrotic tissue, in particular, serve as the source of nutrients for bacteria. Devitalized tissue also acts as a physical barrier for re-epithelialization, preventing applied topical compounds to make direct contact with the wound bed to provide their beneficial properties. Necrotic tissue also prevents angiogenesis, granulation tissue formation, epidermal resurfacing, and normal extracellular matrix (ECM) formation. Finally, the presence of necrotic tissue may prevent the clinician from accurately assessing the wound's extent and severity, even masking possible underlying infections.

Schiffman et al. include the following as common indications for sharp surgical debridement.

- Removal of the source of sepsis, mainly necrotic tissue

- Removal of local infection to decrease bacterial burden, reduce the probability of resistance from antibiotic treatment, and obtain accurate cultures

- Collection of deep cultures taken after debridement from the tissue left behind to evaluate persistent infection and requirements for systemic antibiotic treatment

- Stimulation of the wound bed to support healing and to prepare for a skin graft or flap
