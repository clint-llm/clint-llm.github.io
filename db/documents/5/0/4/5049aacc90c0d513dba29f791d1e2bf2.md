Due to the relatively new use of flow cytometry for immunophenotyping, there are several interfering factors:

- Poor standardization regarding the choice of reagents

- How to prepare and store cells to be analyzed

- How to analyze the collected data

Recent attempts have been made to investigate each of the variables that stands as a roadblock for standardization; notably, many are assembled in “Guidelines for the use of flow cytometry and cell sorting in immunological studies,” published in the European Journal of Immunology.
