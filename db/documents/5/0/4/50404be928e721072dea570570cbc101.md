The superior and inferior epigastric arteries supply the rectus abdominis muscle and rectus sheath. The superior epigastric artery arises from the internal thoracic artery. The inferior epigastric artery has its origin as a branch of the external iliac artery. The superior and inferior epigastric arteries form anastomoses with each other to varying degrees, thus allowing for collateral flow along the midline abdominal wall. These arteries, along with the superior and inferior epigastric veins, run within the posterior rectus sheath. Additionally, small tributaries of the lower six internal intercostal arteries contribute to the blood supply of the rectus abdominis muscle and rectus sheath.

Deep lymphatics travel with the epigastric veins and drain into the lymph node basins associated with the venous drainage pattern — the lymphatics associated with the inferior epigastric vein drain to the lymph node basin associated with the external iliac vessels.
