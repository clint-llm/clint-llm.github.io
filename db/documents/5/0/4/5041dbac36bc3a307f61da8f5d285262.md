Glomangioma or glomuvenous malformation is a rare cutaneous venous malformation that shows glomus cells (undifferentiated smooth muscle cells which are thermoregulatory units) along with the venous system in histology. Glomus cells are specialized smooth muscle cells who regulates the temperature in the body. Masson described glomangioma at first and Papoff studied it extensively. This activity describes the evaluation, and treatment of glomangioma, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of glomangioma medical conditions and emergencies.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of glomangioma.
- Summarize the management options available for glomangioma.
- Outline some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance glomangioma and improve outcomes.
