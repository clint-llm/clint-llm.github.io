Oral Iron Supplementation

- Oral iron replacement therapy is the most cost-effective and readily available for the general public as ferrous sulfate (20% elemental iron), ferrous gluconate (12% elemental iron), and ferrous fumarate (33% elemental iron).

- For best absorption, the recommendation is to take iron at least 30 minutes before a meal or 2 hours before taking other medications.

- If the patient cannot tolerate the gastrointestinal side effects, they may take it with small amounts of food.

- Avoid taking it with milk, calcium, and antacids, high fiber foods, or caffeine.

- Some studies have suggested taking iron with orange juice or with vitamin C supplementation to help improve absorption.

IV Iron Supplementation

An alternative to oral iron supplementation is via IV infusion; this may be preferable in patients who:

- Cannot tolerate oral iron due to side effects

- Pregnant women who already have significant nausea and vomiting

- Those who have had a gastric bypass, where reduced gastric secretion impairs iron absorption

- Those who have malabsorption conditions that prevent adequate absorption into the body (such as Whipple's disease, SIBO, celiac disease, pernicious anemia)

- Those with chronic inflammatory states, such as SLE or rheumatoid arthritis have elevated hepcidin levels that reduce oral iron absorption

IM iron is available, but not preferred as patients will have severe site injection pain and inconsistent absorption. It may also stain the skin.
