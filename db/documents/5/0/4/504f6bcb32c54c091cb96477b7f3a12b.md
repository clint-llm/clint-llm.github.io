The patient usually presents with dyspnea in the setting of liver disease. The onset is insidious, and dyspnea worsens with exertion. In the early stages, most patients are asymptomatic. The patient may have associated signs and symptoms of chronic liver disease.

HPS may co-occur with other cardiopulmonary diseases, which can exacerbate ventilation-perfusion abnormalities.

The physical exam may show the following:

- Cyanosis

- Digital clubbing

- Diffuse telangiectasia. Spider naevi are more likely associated with HPS in several studies.

- Platypnoea – worsening of dyspnea when moving from a supine to an upright position.

- Orthodeoxia – decrease in PaO2 of more than 5% or more than 4mm Hg when moving from a supine to an upright position. It is very specific for HPS in the presence of liver disease. The sensitivity of orthodeoxia is low but increases with the severity of HPS.
