Patients commonly present with pancreatic panniculitis in their seventh decade of life, but they can be older if the etiology is pancreatic malignancy. The disease usually involves the eruption of tender nodules on the lower extremities. These lesions can also be present on the thighs, hips, buttocks, breasts, upper extremities, scalp, and around various joints.

Skin lesions may not always be painful. However, increasingly difficult-to-control pain from panniculitis can be an initial presentation for patients seeking care and further evaluation.

A migratory polyarthritis may also occur alongside panniculitis, which should raise suspicion for PPP syndrome. In addition to polyarthritis, intramedullary fat necrosis and polyserositis can occur in patients with PPP syndrome.

Clinicians should obtain a complete patient history, especially for alcohol use, prior procedures or surgery, history of malignancy in the patient or family, and trauma.
