Two embryological precursor structures – the metanephric mesenchyme and the ureteric bud – interact to form the human kidney.

The metanephric mesenchyme is also known as metanephric mesoderm, metanephrogenic blastema, and metanephric blastema. The RET (REarranged during Transfection) gene is crucial for the correct formation between the metanephric mesenchyme and renal development. The gene encodes a protein/receptor. The RET receptor tyrosine kinase is activated by a growth factor (glial cell growth factor - GDNF), initiating the development of the cell.

The metanephric mesenchyme appears in the fifth week of gestation from the mesoderm.
