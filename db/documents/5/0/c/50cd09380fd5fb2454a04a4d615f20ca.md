Quite broadly, the vascular system distributes, exchanges, and collects gas and metabolites to and from the heart in coordination with ventilation by the lungs. Of the conduits away from the heart, the elastic arteries maintain a potential energy gradient necessary to maintain flow with high pressure during the diastolic period of the heart. The muscular arteries and arterioles are where the regulation of blood flow most occurs, with arterioles having the capacity to convert pulsatile flow to steady flow creating the greatest drop in pressure.
