It is still not clear when bruxism in otherwise healthy individuals requires intervention. Generally, the treatment of bruxism is indicated when there are negative consequences in the oral structures:

- Mechanical wear of the teeth,Â which results in loss of occlusal morphology and flattening of the occlusal surfaces

- Hypersensitive teeth

- Tooth fractures

- Restorations fractures, usually class I and class II restorations, fracture of crowns, and fixed partial prosthesis

- Dental implants failure

- Hypertrophy of masticatory muscles

- Tenderness and stiffness in jaw muscles

- When bruxism leads to limited mouth opening

- Temporomandibular pain

- Pain in the preauricular region

- Clicking and tenderness of the temporomandibular joint

- When headaches occur as a result of muscle tenderness associated with the temporalis muscle

- Unpleasant loud noises during sleep that cause sleep disturbances
