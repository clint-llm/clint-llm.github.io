Prior to the placement of a percutaneous or open gastrostomy tube, it is important that the practitioner review the anatomy of the stomach and surrounding areas. The stomach is divided up into different anatomical parts. The gastroesophageal junction is the point at which the esophagus meets the stomach. The fundus of the stomach is the superior portion lying closest to the diaphragm. The pylorus is the valve that leads out of the stomach into the duodenum. Next to pylorus is the antrum, and the remainder of the body is called the body. Ideally, a feeding tube is placed in the anterior body of the stomach.

Attached to the greater curvature is the greater omentum, which forms the gastrocolic ligament and attaches to the transverse colon. The proximity to which needs to be taken into consideration, especially during the placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy tube.

Not only is normal anatomy extremely important, but it also important to consider variants of normal. A person with hepatomegaly may have a left lobe of the liver that crosses the past midline. Though preoperative imaging is not needed, if prior imaging is available, it is recommended to review it prior to performing a feeding tube procedure. In addition, it is imperative that the practitioner reviews the patientâ€™s surgical history and perform a thorough inspection of the abdomen.
