An infectious disease specialist should evaluate patients with infection-associated neutrophilia both in inpatient and outpatient settings. Hematology/Oncology consultation should be considered in patients with hematological and non-hematological malignancies associated with neutrophilia. To rule out LAD, a pediatric consultation should be considered in children presenting with poor wound healing, periodontitis, and repetitive infections.
