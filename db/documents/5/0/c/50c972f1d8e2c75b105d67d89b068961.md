Patients who have sudden cardiac arrest due to pulseless electrical activity have a poor outcome. In one study of 150 such patients, 23% were resuscitated and survived until hospital admission; only 11% survived until hospital discharge.

Unfortunately, despite optimalÂ cardiopulmonary resuscitation, pulseless electrical activity still carries a high mortality rate.
