It is hard to determine true incidence and prevalence because many patients are misdiagnosed, but the estimated prevalence is 1.9% to 2.3% with an incidence of 3.2/100,000. CVS is more common in whites and slightly more common in females. Children often develop the condition by age 3 to 7, but CVS has been reported in infants as well as elderly patients. Adults who have CVS may develop the disease without any childhood episodes.
