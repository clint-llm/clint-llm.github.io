The acute management of radial nerve entrapment is surgical; less severe cases can employ conservative management. However, once the surgeryÂ is completed, the patient needs to be followed by an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, hand surgeon, specialty trained nurses, physical and occupational therapists. After the healing is complete, most patients require extensive rehabilitation to recover motor and sensory function. In addition, the patient must wear protective splints to protect the hand. Orthopedic nurses monitor patients and provide education. Recovery often takes months, and compliance with the exercise program is key.

**Outcomes**

The outcomes after radial nerve entrapment depend on the severity of the injury. For those with neuropraxic injury, the outcome is good in most cases. For those with axonotmesis, recovery depends on the completeness of release. Unfortunately, many patients have residual deficits. Following neurotmesis, recovery is usually limited even with surgical repair. All patients need extended physical and occupational therapy, and recovery can take months or even years.
