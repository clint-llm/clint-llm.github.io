The most critical aspect of preparing for tubal ligation is ensuring adequate patient counseling and informed consent. Appropriate documentation and consent forms should be in place before the procedure. Laws and restrictions regarding timing and the consent process require careful adherence. The technique and approach most appropriate for the individual patient must also be determined, which will allow adequate counseling with regards to any surgical risks, risks of failure, risks of anesthesia, recovery, and follow-up unique to each technique or approach.

The timing of tubal ligation can be

- **Postpartum**- at the time of cesarean section or after vaginal delivery before discharge home

- **Postabortion**- immediately after an uncomplicated spontaneous abortion or induced abortion

- **Interval**- procedure separate from pregnancy

Appropriate skin preparation preoperatively should be performed. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended prior to laparoscopic tubal ligations. Antibiotics are also not routinely administered before mini-laparotomy. The patient should have an empty stomach appropriate for the surgical approach chosen.
