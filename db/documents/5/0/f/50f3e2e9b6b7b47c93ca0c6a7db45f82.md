The main indication for laminectomy is the presence of spinal canal stenosis; spinal canal narrowing has multiple etiologies, such as congenital, metabolic, traumatic, or tumoral; however, degenerative stenosis is the most common cause. According to Wiltse, spinal stenosis can also be classified into central stenosis, lateral recess, foraminal and extraforaminal stenosis.

Central stenosis is the most common, and the main symptom is neurogenic claudication, which includes pain, tingling, or cramping sensation in the lower extremity. On the other hand, lateral recess, foraminal, and extraforaminal stenosis may cause radiculopathy, patients with central stenosis may experience more symptoms in standing position and during walking, and pain is usually relieved by leaning forward or in a sitting position. In cases of central stenosis, straight leg raising and femoral nerve stretching test are usually normal.

When symptoms derived from stenosis do not respond to conservative treatment, surgical management such as decompression with or without fusion is usually a consideration.

Fusion techniques are required when stenosis is associated with spinal instability, degenerative or isthmic spondylolisthesis, kyphosis, or scoliosis, as laminectomy alone may increase the risk of spinal instability in these conditions.

Other important indications for laminectomy are primary or secondary tumors, infection (peridural abscesses), trauma (fractures that compromise the spinal canal), and stenosis associated with the deformity.

The radiological armamentarium required in the workup includes:

- CT-criteria for central stenosis include anteroposterior diameter (< 10 mm) and cross-sectional area (< 70 mm2) of spinal canal.

- MRI –Gold standard imaging modality

- Dynamic flexion /extension films- to rule out instability and spondylolisthesis

- EMG- for differentiating distal neuropathies

- Plan X-ray- hip and knee- confounding osteoarthritis

The causes of spinal stenosis can be categorized as:

- **Congenital**: Achindroplastis dwarfism

- **Acquired**:

- Degeneration

- Trauma

- Space occupying lesions: Tumors, cysts

- Osseous lesions: Paget and Ankylosing spondylitis.

**Indications for laminectomy**include:

- Central or lateral canal stenosis refractory to 12 weeks of medication, physical therapy, and injections

- Presence of intractable pain or progressive neurological deficits

- Presentation with cauda equina syndrome
