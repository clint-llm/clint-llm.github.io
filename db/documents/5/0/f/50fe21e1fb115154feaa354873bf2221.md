Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina is a rare autosomal recessive condition characterized by elevation of plasma ornithine levels due to deficiency of the mitochondrial enzyme ornithine aminotransferase. It is characterized mainly by the presence of specific ophthalmic manifestations; however, neurological and muscular features may also be present. This activity describes the evaluation and management of gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina.
- Outline the classic presentation of a patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina.
- Summarize the treatment of a patient with gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina.
