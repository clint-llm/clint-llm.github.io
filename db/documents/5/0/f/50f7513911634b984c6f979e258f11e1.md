Gonadal dysgenesis develops due to genetic alterations leading to impaired gonadal development. When the gonads do not develop properly, it leads to issues in the development of both internal and external genitalia. All patients with gonadal dysgenesis will have at least some dysfunction within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. The hypothalamus secretes GnRH, which acts on the pituitary to release LH and FSH. LH and FSH act on the gonads, which in turn produce sex hormones in the form of estrogen and testosterone.

Complete 46 XY gonadal dysgenesis in which the lack of the SRY gene activating the bodyâ€™s processes to enact male development results in the body relies on the default processes which allow the Mullerian structures to develop internally. Mullerian structures develop into the female anatomy, including the fallopian tubes, uterus, and cervix. Due to the lack of testicular development in these males, there is a lack of testosterone production, which inhibits the development of male external genitalia, so these males will tend to present with female external genitalia. Patients with incomplete or partial 46 XY gonadal dysgenesis, or patients with mosaic forms of the disease with a Y chromosome, it appears that there is a mixture of development of both male and female internal genitalia. In the 46 XY with incomplete gonadal dysgenesis, it appears there is incomplete differentiation of the internal genitalia likely due to insufficient amounts of testosterone and Mullerian inhibiting hormone during the early stages of development. These patients range from having non-functional streak gonads to partially functioning gonads due to the incomplete development. Patients with mosaic forms of the disease, as seen in Turner syndrome with cell lines containing a Y chromosome, will also have a mixture of development resulting in partial or non-functioning gonads and internal genitalia. These patients will have ambiguous external genitalia due to the reduced influence of the Y chromosome.

Patients with complete 46 XX gonadal dysgenesis will tend to have female internal and external genitalia and will typically have streaked or hypoplastic ovaries.
