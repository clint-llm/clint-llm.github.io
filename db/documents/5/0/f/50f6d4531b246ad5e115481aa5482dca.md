Postoperative care primarily depends on the type of surgical procedure. If prenatal surgical closure of myelomeningocele takes place, and fetal delivery is preterm, the baby should stay at a specialized neonatal intensive care unit in a latex-free environment.

To preserve the functional neurological level and improve the quality of life, long-term rehabilitation care should be followed postoperatively to expand the recovery of the patient. Preventive measures must be included, focusing on improving the musculoskeletal system with the aid of physical therapy and exercises. Therefore, avoiding the risk of developing pressure ulcers, wound infections, deep vein thrombosis, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, patients with hydrocephalus should have regular ophthalmology visits to screen for visual impairments and papilledema. Also, urodynamic testing is recommended for patients complaining of any urological problem to rule out the presence of neurogenic bladder. Bowel management is achievable by teaching the patient, and caregivers about a reflex-triggered bowel evacuation program as well as dietary modifications and laxative use. All the measures mentioned earlier should be continued until the patient reaches a successful transition to adult care. Adult healthcare offers specialized medical care and activities tailored to promote autonomy and provide prolonged and continued care for the patients.
