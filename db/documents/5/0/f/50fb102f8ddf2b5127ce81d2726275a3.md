Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are imaging modalities in nuclear medicine that can be used to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics. SPECT and PET cerebral perfusion examinations have an important role in evaluating multiple diagnoses, including but not limited to stroke, chronic cerebrovascular disease, epilepsy, and dementia. This activity reviews and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo SPECT and PET cerebral perfusion exams.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the common indications for PET and SPECT cerebral perfusion imaging.
- Review common abnormalities seen on PET and SPECT cerebral perfusion imaging.
- Identify common radiotracers and augmenting medications used in PET and SPECT cerebral perfusion imaging and their associated contraindications and complications.
- Summarize the basic principles of how PET and SPECT cerebral perfusion imaging is performed and the inherent benefits and drawbacks of each imaging modality.
