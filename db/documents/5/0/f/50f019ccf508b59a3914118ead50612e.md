- Anorectal malformations result from any disruption or abnormality during the process of embryological development of the gut tube. By the completion of the fifth week of development, the endoderm proliferates and occludes the lumen of the entire GI tract. The lumen becomes recanalized via apoptosis during the seventh week and completes by the ninth week.

- Hirschsprung's disease

- During the development of the GI tract, enteric neural crest cells migrate from the anterior foregut caudally throughout the entire GI tract and form the enteric nervous system. Disruption of this migration results in an aganglionic segment of the colon, which causes physiologic obstruction most commonly in the distal portion of the colon.

- Imperforate anus

- Failure in the breakdown of the anal membrane before birth. This congenital defect disrupts the opening to the anus.

- Adenocarcinoma

- Superior to the pectinate line, the lining of the anal canal is simple columnar epithelium. Therefore, the superior anal canal is more likely to develop adenocarcinoma.

- Squamous cell carcinoma

- Inferior to the pectinate line, the lining of the anal canal is stratified squamous epithelium. Therefore, the inferior anal canal is more likely to develop squamous cell carcinoma.
