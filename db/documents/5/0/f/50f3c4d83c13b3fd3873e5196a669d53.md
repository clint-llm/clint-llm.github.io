The location of the CN0 fibers is in close relationship to the olfactory tract. Its nerve components conglomerate into a rich plexus of fibers embedded along with the dura mater in proximity to CNI and other nerve fibers. Possibly this explains why CN0 fibers have consistently been mistaken as part of CNI during human dissections, imaging studies, and cranial surgical procedures. Furthermore, the CN0 fibers also travel through the minuscule foramina of the cribriform plate (ethmoid bone) towards the nasal cavity. The CN0 fibers then course on either side of the nasal septum and branch through the septal mucosa bilaterally. Herein, its fibers travel along the olfactory and nasopalatine nerve fibers.

The anatomical positioning of CN0 poses important clinical considerations, especially for otorhinolaryngology (ENT) surgical procedures. Given its potential neuro reproductive role, damage or lacerations to CN0 during routine ENT surgical procedures may compromise its structural integrity and potential functionality. In animal models, the laceration of the terminal nerve has been reported to cause GnRH deficiencies. However, there are no clinical studies to confirm these findings in humans.
