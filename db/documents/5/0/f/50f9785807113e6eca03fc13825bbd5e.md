Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus may be confused with several other blistering diseases, especially two autoimmune blistering conditions: dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA).

Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) exhibits similar antibodies against type VII collagen. It is more likely to heal with scarring and milia formation compared to BSLE. A prominent distinguishing feature includes the absence of SLE and a lack of histologic finding of large deposits of mucin in the dermis. The poor or slow response to dapsone in EBA compared to BSLE may help in separating the two entities.

Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) has a skin distribution different from BSLE. The pruritic lesions have a predilection to the extensor surfaces, elbows, knees, and buttocks. DH is histologically identical to BSLE except for the presence of IgA deposition within the dermal papilla.

Other differential diagnoses include:

- Linear IgA bullous dermatosis: immunofluorescence shows IgA deposition on the epidermal side of split skin

- Systemic lupus erythematosus with blisters

- Bullous pemphigoid: With the aid of immunofluorescence, antibody deposition is found on the epidermal side of salt-split skin
