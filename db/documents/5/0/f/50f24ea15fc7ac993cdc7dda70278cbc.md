The miniaturized pressure sensor, which is embedded into a coronary wire is able to carry out pressure measurements with high fidelity. The pressure sensor contains piezo-electric sensors and is made by St. Jude and Philip Volcano. The sensor is typically located at the proximal end of the radiopaque wire tip. The disadvantage of these wires is the potential for signal interference at connecting points. These wires typically have a signal drift of < 7 mmHg/hr. FFR is a ratio of pressure distal to stenosis (Pd) relative to proximal pressure (Pa) during maximal hyperemia or vasodilation [4]. On the other hand, iFR equipment relies on the cardiac mechanics of wave generation. A wave-free period (WFP) exists in diastole, and during this period, the intracoronary pressure and flow decrease in a linear fashion, and the microvascular resistance are minimal. Therefore iFR relies on this WFP to derive coronary pressure assessment without inducing hyperemia.
