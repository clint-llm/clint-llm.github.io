Schwann cells embryologically derive from the neural crest. They myelinate peripheral nerves and serve as the primary glial cells of the peripheral nervous system (PNS), insulating and providing nutrients to axons. Myelination increases conduction velocity along the axon, allowing for the saltatory conduction of impulses.
