The pathophysiology of gastroparesis is poorly understood and is not well defined, but important mechanisms associated are theÂ loss of interstitial cells of Cajal and inability to express neuronal nitric oxide synthase. For gastric emptying to occur there needs interaction between smooth muscles, extrinsic nerves, intrinsic or enteric nerves and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). It has been hypothesized that there might be a poor interplay between local enteric system along with decreased local secretion of nitric oxide(NO). Nitric oxide is required for smooth muscle relaxation, as a result causing accommodation of fundus and impairment in pyloric muscle relaxation. ICC generate slow wave and transmit to the smooth muscle thus enabling contraction, which is impaired with loss of ICC. Thus both contributing to delayed gastric emptying. There are several ongoing studies to determine pathophysiology, expect to improve our understanding soon.
