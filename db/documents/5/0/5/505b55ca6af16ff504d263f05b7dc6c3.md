- Hyperthermia is often delivered twice a week within an hour after daily radiation, and it enhances the effects of radiation-induced DNA damage by blocking DNA repair in cancer cells, increasing blood flow thereby increasing oxygenation and free oxygen radicals, as well as several other direct effects on tumor cell death.

- The use of radiation and hyperthermia to tumor temperatures ranging from 41 to 44 C has been shown to improve local control in locally recurrent breast cancer patients.

- The combination of radiation with chemotherapy and radiation therapy can be safely administered to tissue as superficial as the chest wall, with minimal toxicity.

- Hyperthermia may not be available at all centers. However, it is imperative to try to coordinate hyperthermia treatments with nearby hyperthermia centers to provide the best chance for local control for locally recurrent breast cancer patients.
