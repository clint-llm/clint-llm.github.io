- Intracranial hypotension – sagging midbrain may mimic tonsillar or hindbrain herniation.

- Normal variant cerebellar tonsillar ectopia – does not meet the criteria for Chiari malformation and an incidental finding in an asymptomatic patient.

- Tonsillar herniation from increased intracranial pressure (ICP) – assess for causes of ICP such as mass effect from neoplasm, hydrocephalus, trauma, or hemorrhage.
