Local invasion of the surrounding structures occurs in almost 70% of patients as observed in large series: muscles (65%), trachea (46%), esophagus (44%), laryngeal nerve (27%), and larynx (13%). Lymph node metastases are a feature in almost 40% of patients.

The progression of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is rapid, and most patients die from local airway obstruction or complications of pulmonary metastases within one year.
