Clinicians should advise the patient on how to take the drug with the correct dosage. There are no recommended routine monitoring tests with this class of medications. Serious adverse effects of bronchodilators include bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reactions, hypertension, hypotension, cardiac arrest, hypokalemia, and hyperglycemia. Anticholinergics have correlated with dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and delirium. If a patient believes they are experiencing any of these symptoms or general discomfort after taking this medicine, they should be seen by emergency personnel quickly. In particular, patient chronically on short-acting beta-2 agonists patient risks not achieving the same relief from their medicine as they once did. This phenomenon is called receptor downregulation. It happens because a portion of the receptors targeted end up being inactivated by the body due to overuse. Since fewer receptors are available to be targeted by this medication class, a less than adequate relief of symptoms occurs. Higher dosages are then required to achieve the same result.
