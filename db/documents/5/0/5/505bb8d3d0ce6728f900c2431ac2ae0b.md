Patients with endometrial hyperplasia mostly present with abnormal uterine bleeding. Women in the reproductive age group present in the form of menorrhagia and metrorrhagia, while postmenopausal bleeding is the presentation in the post-reproductive period. Occasionally patients may present with vaginal discharge. Some patients may be detected due to abnormal glandular or endometrial cells in the Pap smear.

A detailed history and physical examination are required to determine and rule out other sources and causes of the presenting complaints or bleeding. A thorough and focused examination of the lower genital tract for pathologies and lesions of the lower genital tract, e.g., vulva, vagina, cervix, along with uterus and ovaries, should be done. This should include a pelvic examination. In obese patients where the pelvic examination may be difficult to interpret radiological investigations such as pelvic ultrasonography may be used. Pelvic ultrasonography is helpful in ruling out ovarian and other pathologies like uterine fibroids etc.
