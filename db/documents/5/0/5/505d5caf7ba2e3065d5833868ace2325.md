Urticaria pigmentosa has small, monomorphic tan to brown macules or papules distributed mostly on the trunk and classically spares the central face, palms, and soles. It is similar to the lesions typically observed in adults. Lesions can be few or numerous and are usually about 1 to 2 cm in size however they can be larger. Darier’s sign is the formation of a wheal upon stroking or rubbing skin lesions and suggests the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis. The wheal forms due to the release of mast cell mediators which can contribute to the systemic symptoms that may occur after stroking the lesion. Some lesions may blister after stroking the lesion. Darier’s sign is more pronounced in children than it is in adults due to an increased density of mast cells in lesions of children.

Systemic symptoms can occur such as pruritus, flushing, abdominal pain, diarrhea, palpitations, dizziness, and syncope. Twenty-five percent of patients with UP experience gastrointestinal symptoms. Complaints of fever, night sweats, bone pain, epigastric distress, malaise, weight loss, and problems with cognitive disorganization often signal the presence of extracutaneous disease. Death can even occur from extensive mast cell mediator release.
