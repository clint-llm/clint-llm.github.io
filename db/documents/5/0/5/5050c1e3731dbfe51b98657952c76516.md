Properly done, PSA is a humane approach to helping patients tolerate brief, painful procedures. Furthermore, it is vital thatÂ the procedure takes place in a safe environment with personnel prepared to rescue the patient from adverse effects of the sedation. Special attention is necessary for respiratory suppression, which is mitigated by monitoring, especially EtCO2, and having a low threshold to support respirations, particularly with bag valve mask ventilation. It is also essential that the respiratory support of the patient not be regarded as an adverse outcome but rather a necessary patient intervention.Because hypotension can also represent a complication, it is imperative to have an IV in place and be prepared to support blood pressure with IV fluids. It is also best practice to be cautious in moving the patient from recumbent to sitting position. Again, the operators must have experience in managing other potential complications such as vomiting.
