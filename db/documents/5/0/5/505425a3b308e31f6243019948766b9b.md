It is estimated that up to 17% of the global population is at risk for inadequate zinc intake, while in South Asia, up to 30% of the population may be deficient. Other areas at risk include sub-Saharan Africa and Central America.

Endemic deficiency is common in up to one-third of the population in various parts of the world, primarily in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Clay eating or 'pica' is commonly seen in children of certain communities and regions. Clay effectively binds zinc, causing a dramatic decrease in the bioavailability of zinc. Approximately two billion people in developing regions are deficient in zinc to some extent. The at-risk population is comprised of children and elderly adults.
