The thoracic cavity subdivides into three compartments; the mediastinum and two pleural cavities, one on each side. The mediastinum is the median compartment containing the heart and great vessels; whereas, the pleural cavities contain the lungs. The thoracic cage protects the lungs and the heart as well as provide attachments for the muscles of the thorax, upper extremities, back, and the abdomen. It communicates superiorly with the neck via the thoracic outlet and inferiorly separates the abdomen by the respiratory diaphragm.

The boundaries of the thoracic wall are important landmarks used by clinician and surgeons for various procedures including sternotomy, pericardiocentesis in patients with cardiac tamponade and thoracentesis for pleural effusion. The thoracic wall is bounded anteriorly by the sternum and costal cartilages; laterally by the ribs and intercostal spaces; posteriorly by the thoracic vertebrae and intervertebral discs; superiorly by the suprapleural membrane and inferiorly by the respiratory diaphragm.
