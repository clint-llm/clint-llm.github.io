Onychoscopy is performed for close evaluation of the nail unit to aid in the diagnosis, which is limited to gross examination. Contact and non-contact dermoscopy of the nail are two ways to identify features of nail disease. At different depths, these methods can identify characteristic features to diagnose local and systemic diseases. In turn, onychoscopy can aid in diagnosing systemic diseases that are challenging to diagnose. It can also aid in decision-making for local diseases that may require further intervention. The diagnostic procedure can also assist in finding ideal locations for biopsies to optimize the diagnostic yield of a biopsy. This activity reviews the evaluation of the nail unit with onychoscopy and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo onychoscopy.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the diagnostic findings of nail psoriasis.
- Review the causes and management of longitudinal melanonychia.
- Identify the key features of onychopapilloma.
- Explain the onychoscopic findings in connective tissue disease, such as dermatomyositis.
