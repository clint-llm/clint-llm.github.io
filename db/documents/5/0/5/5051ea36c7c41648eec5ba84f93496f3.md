Barbiturates have been shown to cause fetal damage if used in pregnant women and are pregnancy category D drugs. This class of drugs can cross the placental barrier and distribute throughout the fetal tissue with the highest concentrations in the liver, brain, and placenta. It is essential to monitor maternal blood levels for fetal safety in any pregnant female taking these drugs. There is documentation of withdrawal in infants born to mothers who took barbiturates during pregnancy. Newborns should be closely monitored for seizures and hyperirritability as this may indicate a need for withdrawal treatment. Symptoms can be delayed for up to two weeks and require prompt treatment if indicated.
