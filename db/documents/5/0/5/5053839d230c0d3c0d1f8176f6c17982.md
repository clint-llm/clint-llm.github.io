Posttraumatic syringomyelia refers to the development of a cerebrospinal fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord several months or years after a known trauma. It is distinct from the type of syringomyelia that is often associated with congenital malformations such as the Chiari type 1 malformation, where obstruction of the normal cerebrospinal fluid flow can result in a syrinx occurring as a secondary phenomenon. This activity reviews the presentation and management of posttraumatic syringomyelia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of posttraumatic syringomyelia.
- Describe the epidemiology of posttraumatic syringomyelia.
- Describe the evaluation of posttraumatic syringomyelia.
- Incorporate a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care and appropriate surveillance of patients with posttraumatic syringomyelia.
