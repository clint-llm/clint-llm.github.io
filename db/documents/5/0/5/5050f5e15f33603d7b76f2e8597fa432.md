Loose anagen hair syndrome is a disease in which diagnosis is made clinically, and treatment revolves around decreasing trauma to easily detached anagen hairs. As the disease process primarily affects young children, pediatricians and pediatric nurse practitioners and physician assistants are likely to be the first to encounter these patients. Awareness of looseÂ anagen hair syndrome and differentials is crucial for diagnosis, and referral to a dermatologist may assist in providing the best patient care. Discussion with parents revolves around lifestyle modification and minimizing trauma to hair with routine combing, washing, and styling. Treatment may be considered with minoxidil applied topically. Biotin or additional nutritional supplementation has not been shown to be helpful.
