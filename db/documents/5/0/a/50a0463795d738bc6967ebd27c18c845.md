Carotid artery dissection is a condition whereby the layers of the carotid artery are spontaneously separated. This potentially compromises blood flow to certain areas of the brain and can lead to a stroke. Furthermore, it can occur extracranially or intracranially and can lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage or brain ischemia. It is the most common cause of strokes in younger patients, and the importance of making a timely diagnosis is paramount to minimize potential morbidity and mortality of the disease. This activity describes the causes, pathophysiology, presentation of carotid artery dissection and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of carotid artery dissection.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with carotid artery dissection.
- Summarize the treatment options for carotid artery dissection.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by carotid artery dissection.
