Partial liver transplants can be made, primarily by harvesting the right lobe of the liver. Care must be taken to account for possible variations in the anatomy of the liver. Common variations include absent main-right portal vein (14.5%) and multiple bile duct abnormalities. Patients with portal vein abnormalities are highly likely to have multiple bile ducts (88.9%).
