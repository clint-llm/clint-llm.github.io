The aorta is the main artery of the human body. It arises from the left ventricle of the heart and travels superiorly to form the ascending aorta. It then loops inferiorly to form the arch of the aorta and through the thorax to form the thoracic aorta. After crossing the diaphragm into the abdomen, the aptly-named abdominal aorta eventually bifurcates into the common iliac arteries in the lower abdomen. Along the way, the aorta gives rise to the arterial branches that areÂ responsible for transmitting oxygenated blood to all the tissues of the body. As such, pathology arising in the aorta frequently results in serious consequences. Thus, it is important for the clinician to be aware of the functional, anatomical, surgical, and clinical considerations about the aorta.
