Adult akinesia should be differentiated from:

- Catatonia: These patients are predominantly apathetic and present with posturing rather than difficulty initiating movement.

- Akinesia arrest reaction: This is typically intermittent in onset, associated with seizure activity on electroencephalogram.

Live births with fetal akinesia syndrome should be differentiated from:

- Osteogenesis imperfecta: This is typically associated with multiple fractures, not accompanied by contractures, unlike fetal akinesia syndrome. Other findings, like blue sclera, conductive deafness, and mild stunting, would make this diagnosis more likely.

- Potter's sequence: This is often associated with renal agenesis, but not with contractures.

- Congenital myopathies: This is not frequently associated with intrauterine death, but is associated with gradually progressing muscle weakness.

- Congenital myasthenia gravis: An infant with congenital myasthenia would present with ptosis, poor crying and sucking reflex, and facial, bulbar, and generalized weakness.

- Maternal antibodies to fetal acetylcholine receptor: A history of myasthenia present in the mother, would make this a more likely diagnosis.

- Metabolic disorders: Mucopolysaccharidosis III, glycosylation type 1A deficiency, phosphofructokinase deficiency (glycogenosis VII)

- Trisomy 18: Other midline defects like holoprosencephaly, omphalocele, cleft lip/palate would also be present in this disorder.
