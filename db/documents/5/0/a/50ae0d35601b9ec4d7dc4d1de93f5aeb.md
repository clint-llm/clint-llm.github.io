A reciprocating syringe can be used in place of a conventional syringe resulting in improvement of physician performance in arthrocentesis. The reciprocating syringe allows the physician to perform the procedure one-handed while reducing significant pain and procedure time.

The utility of ultrasound has shown success in the evaluation of joint effusions and arthrocentesis. With its ability to identify joint anatomy and fluid collections, ultrasound improves aspiration rates and results in fewer complications, especially in small joints.
