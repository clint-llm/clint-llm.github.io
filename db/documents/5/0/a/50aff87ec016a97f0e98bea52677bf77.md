# Introduction

The complement system consists of several complement proteins synthesized by the liver’s Kupffer cells and subsequently found in the body’s blood and tissues. The proteins themselves are both zymogens, meaning they are typically inactive, and are meta-stable when activated, meaning they require a cell surface to remain active. When these complement proteins (mostly named C1 to C9) initiate a cascade that engages both the innate and adaptive immune system, they serve as the first line of defense in response to pathogen attack. One goal of the complement system is the formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC), which compromises the pathogen’s cell wall, causing swelling that ultimately leads to cell death. The complement system is diffusely active within the body, and deficiencies or dysregulation results in immune system deficiencies, autoimmune disorders, or bleeding disorders.

While often considered as part of the innate immune system, this is not entirely the case. One method of complement cascade initiation, the classical activation pathway, involves antibodies and, thus, the adaptive immune system. The other two well-studied pathways are the alternative and lectin activation pathways. Neither requires adaptive immune system activation and, therefore, truly are mechanisms of the innate immune system. Although they differ in mechanisms, the commonly needed step of all pathways is the conversion of C3 to C3a and C3b; the latter is necessary for the formation of the MAC.

# Fundamentals

Alternative Activation Pathway

The alternative pathway can begin with the spontaneous conversion of C3 to C3b, microbial surface molecules, complex carbohydrates, or other substances.  It is continually activated at low levels throughout the cell body and must be tightly regulated to ensure immunological homeostasis. For example, if C3b is unable to bind to an amino or hydroxyl group on a pathogenic surface, it is rapidly made inert by the arguably more ubiquitous water molecules in the plasma.

If a pathogenic surface stabilizes C3b, then complement protein B binds to it; complement protein D then cleaves the B attached to C3b to form Bb, thus yielding C3bBb, or C3 convertase. C3 convertase mediates C3's conversion to C3b in proximity to the pathogen, resulting in a "complement cascade."

Factor H serves an essential regulatory role in the alternative pathway, blocking its effects on host cells. Factor H is also synthesized in the liver and is acquired by host cells as it travels past them in the plasma; once on a host cell, it either inactivates C3b or ensures the decay of C3bBb.

Lectin Activation Pathway

The lectin pathway utilizes complement proteins 2 and 4 to achieve the same result as the alternative pathway. However, this pathway uses mannose-binding lectin (MBL), a glycoprotein also produced in the liver, to bind mannose on the surface of similar pathogens to that of the alternate pathway. MBLs circulate with and help 'dock' mannose associated serine proteases (MASPs) so that MASPs can cleave C2 and C4, forming C2b and C4b; the union of these two products, C2b4b, serves as a C3 convertase.

The resulting cascade carries out identically to the alternative activation pathway. However, MBL exhibits a higher affinity to Candida albicans than molecules of the other pathways.

Classical Activation Pathway

The classical activation pathway requires some level of adaptive response (humoral) to initiate its complement cascade. For this reason, the body produces IgM antibodies as a first-line response to early infection. The pattern in which IgM antibodies form antibody-antigen complexes (with proximal Fc regions) allows for the proximal binding of two C1 complexes to two Fc regions. The proximity between the two C1 complexes (which are specific to the classical activation pathway) results in the release of their inhibitors (C1-inhibitors). The release of C1-inhibitors activates each complex's neighboring C1r and C1s complement proteins, creating a C3 convertase that triggers the complement cascade on the pathogen's surface.

C-reactive protein (CRP), a protein synthesized in the liver in response to acute inflammation, has been found to enhance classical pathway activation weakly.

# Issues of Concern

Complement activation pathways are tightly regulated and have multiple points of inhibition to protect normal tissue from complement dysregulation, and include MCP, decay-accelerating factor (DAF), MAC-inhibitory protein (CD59 or protectin), and the previously described Factor H. MCP deactivates C3b while DAF facilitates the destruction of C3bBb (C3 convertase).

# Function

Membrane Attack Complex

As stated in the Fundamentals section, all complement pathways result in the construction of a MAC, which compromises the pathogen cell wall, resulting in its swift malfunction.

Inflammation and Chemotaxis

All forms of C3 convertase yield C3b and C3a. The C3a fragment is an anaphylatoxin that mediates inflammation in two ways: it triggers histamine release from mast cells and increases vascular permeability.

Similarly, all forms of C5 convertase yield both C5b (for the MAC) and C5a. C5a is also an anaphylatoxin, in addition to a neutrophil chemotactic agent.

Opsonization for enhancement of phagocytosis

There are two well-studied mechanisms by which the complement system opsonizes the pathogen for enhanced phagocytosis. We will first discuss the mechanism that all pathways have in common. C3b binds C3bBb forming C5 convertase, but C3b also acts as an opsonin to attract macrophages to the site of inflammation (namely, complement activation) to enhance phagocytosis.

The alternative activation pathway performs the second mechanism of opsonization. This pathway is capable of synthesizing a ‘soluble’ C3 convertase, named iC3Bb. iC3Bb can also attach to the pathogen and, in turn, attract phagocytes, bind them, and ultimately facilitate phagocytosis.

# Testing

Complement testing is available for many of the complement proteins, including:

- C1

- C1q

- C2

- C3

- C4

- CH50

- CH100

- Total complement

Specific tests may assist in monitoring disease activity and treatment, such as in hypocomplementemia and systemic lupus erythematosus (both with low C3 and C4).

CH50

Testing for 50% hemolytic complement activity of serum (serum CH50) assesses the activity of the classical activation pathway. The normal range is 22 to 40 units/mL, indicating the presence of complement proteins 1 through 9.

# Clinical Significance

Factor H

This regulatory plasma glycoprotein can be used by pathogens and cancer cells to evade the immune system.Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Borrelia burgdorferi, Staphylococcus aureus, West Nile Virus, and HIV-1.

Inherited C3 Deficiency

Inherited C3 deficiency occurs because of a secretory malfunction (as a result of a protein substitution).

Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria

Deficiencies in molecules that inhibit complement (MCP, decay-accelerating factor (DAF), CD59, and Factor H) results in hemolysis or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Clinical signs of hemolysis include hemoglobinuria at night, anemia, and increased abdominal pain.

Hereditary Angioedema

Hereditary angioedema is an autosomal dominant disorder due to a C1 inhibitor protein deficiency.
