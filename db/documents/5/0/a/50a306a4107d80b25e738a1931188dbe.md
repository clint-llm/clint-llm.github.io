While Doppler ultrasound has its origins in evaluation for vascular patency, its use has expanded over the years to encompass nearly every organ system. From evaluation of vascular stenosis and malformations, to grading organ perfusion in native as well as transplant organs, advanced echocardiography techniques including valvular dysfunction and assessment of intracardiac pressure gradients, obstetric evaluations, and evaluation of intravascular devices and implants, the use of Doppler sonography has permeated all aspects of clinical medicine.
