The diagnosis of trigger finger is clinical, and it is presumed in aÂ patient whose finger locks during flexion, clicks painfully, and catches upon extension. It is also presumed when an inflamed nodule at the base of the affected finger is present.

Ultrasound can be obtained in assessing this condition. Ultrasound may demonstrate thickening of the pulley as well as inflammation and irregularity of the underlying flexor tendon. However, it may not reliably predict the site. Ultrasound can be used dynamically to demonstrate the catching and clicking during tendon sliding.

Plain radiographs are useful to rule out other conditions, such as an occult fracture. In general, MRI and CT scans may not be required.
