Vestibular rehabilitation has been well documented as the cornerstone for peripheral vestibular hypofunction, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) treatment, and canalith repositioning for BPPV.

Preliminary research has demonstrated positive results for vestibular rehabilitation for head injury (concussions in particular) and central disorders such as cerebellar disorders and Parkinson disease), but further high-level research is needed to confirm the benefits of these preliminary studies.
