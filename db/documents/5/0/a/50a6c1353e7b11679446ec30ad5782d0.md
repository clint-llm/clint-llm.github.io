History should reveal a trauma of the affected region in the not too distant past. Special care should be taken to establish where and how was the injury treated, was there any attempt at repairing the nerve.

If there is no history of trauma, the differential should shift towards genetic causes of the neuroma and true neoplasms.

Neuroma pain can be burning, sharp, tingling sensation, or numbness.

On examination, a well defined hard lump is usually palpable, which can be adherent to nearby structures. On pressure, patients can experience a sensation similar to electric shock.
