Dorsal Column-Medial Lemniscus Pathway

The dorsal column-medial lemniscus pathway is the primary somatosensory pathway for fine touch, vibration, two-point discrimination, and proprioception. This pathway is comprised of three neurons that connect the mechanoreceptor to its specific region within the primary somatosensory cortex. Meissner's corpuscles, Merkel's disks, and Ruffini's corpuscles are stimulated by touch, vibration, and skin tension, respectively leading to the production of an action potential in the first-order neuron.

Spinothalamic Tract

The spinothalamic tract (also known as the ventrolateral system) is the somatosensory pathway for crude touch, pressure, nociception, and temperature. The spinothalamic tract divides into two systems; the anterior spinothalamic system is responsible for crude touch and pressure, and the lateral spinothalamic system is responsible for pain and temperature sensation.

In the anterior spinothalamic system, A-beta fibers carrying crude touch and pressure stimuli travel through the dorsal root ganglion and synapse in the ipsilateral dorsal horn. A-beta fibers are myelinated and have a large diameter compared to other fiber types in the spinothalamic tract.

Unlike the anterior spinothalamic system, the lateral spinothalamic system is made up of multiple nerve fiber types. A-delta fibers are myelinated nerves with a smaller diameter than A-beta fibers.
