# Introduction

The anesthesia patient safety foundation (APSF) was founded in 1985 with the timeless mission to ensure that “no patient shall be harmed by anesthesia.”

Anesthesiology’s stake in simulation dates as far back as the 1950s when anesthesiologist Dr. Peter Safar demonstrated the ability to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation on a chemically paralyzed human volunteer.

# Function

Low-fidelity mannequins used for cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training in basic and advanced life support (BLS/ACLS) courses differ significantly from high fidelity mannequins that have the capability of recording tidal volume, chest compression depth, and rate as well as respiratory rate.

In certain cases, scenarios enacted on simulation models may not truly reflect the actual time course for the disease and the treatments utilized.

In a review of 26 studies where augmented and mixed reality technology was used for medical education beyond surgery, the most common application of simulation exercises was to anatomy and anesthesiology procedures.

# Continuing Education

Simulation has been in use to earn credits for the maintenance of certification in anesthesia (MOCA). Weinger et al. examined the use of mannequin based simulation by 263 board-certified anesthesiologists during the simulation component of their maintenance of certification, which includes two 20 minutes duration emergency situations, to identify performance gaps and to establish psychometric properties of the assessment methods.

# Clinical Significance

The anesthesiology milestones project created by the American Board of Anesthesiology (ABA), together with the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), consists of 6 general core competencies and several sub-competencies as well as serves as an anchor for post-graduate anesthesia education.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

**COGNITIVE AIDS**

The use of cognitive aids or algorithms is helpful in the retrieval of information during high-acuity situations that demand quick, yet efficient action by a healthcare provider and/or team of providers.  In industries such as aviation and nuclear energy, the use of cognitive aids is practically mandated, given the nature of regulations in these industries.  Limitations to the use of cognitive aids in healthcare include, but are not limited to, the complexity of steps listed in the aids, unclear or incomplete instructions, the stigma that utilizing a cognitive aid implies a suboptimal fund of knowledge and the extra steps involved in using the aid in a crisis.

An extensive review of the existing literature involving the use of cognitive aids in anesthetic emergencies demonstrates improvement in technical skills. Although the impact of these aids on team coordination is not clearly established and requires further study.

**DEBRIEFING**

Debriefing can be learner-guided or facilitator-guided, the latter being more commonly used and better studied.

In one study that looked at the rates of debriefing that occurred after critical events at a large academic medical center, roughly half of the events were debriefed.

**COMMUNICATION**

Teamwork is paramount to anesthesia crisis resource management, especially when it relies on multidisciplinary decision-making. In response to the institute of medicine's report, to err is human, as well as the public demand for improvement in patient safety, the agency for healthcare research and quality (AHRQ) and the department of defense (DOD) have developed a curriculum dubbed TeamSTEPPS (team strategies & tools to enhance performance and patient safety) in 2006.
