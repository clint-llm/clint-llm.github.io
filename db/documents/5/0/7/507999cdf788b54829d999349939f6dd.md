Biliary duct hamartomas, otherwise known as Von Meyenburg complexes, are dilated cystic bile ducts, which are embryologic remnants that failed to involute during the period of embryogenesis. They are typically small (<5mm) and present as multiple lesions scattered throughout the liver, often referred to as "a starry night."

Several studies have found an increased frequency in cirrhotic livers due to chronic viral hepatitis or alcohol liver disease or secondary to inflammation or ischemia, which may demonstrate that these lesions can be acquired and environmental exposure can play an important role.
