The sternum consists of 3 major parts; the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process, with the xiphoid process being the smallest and most distal part of the three. The manubrium is the broad, quadrangular, and most superior segment and is characterized by its superior dip known as the suprasternal notch. The body is the middle and longest part and connects to the manubrium at the sternal angle. The xiphoid process is triangular in shape and is the most distal part of the sternum.

The term xiphoid process comes from the word "xiphos," which is of Greek origin and means straight sword describing the morphology of this bone.

At birth, the xiphoid is purely cartilaginous and is made of 2 types of cartilage; hyaline cartilage in the proximal portion and elastic cartilage in the distal part.
