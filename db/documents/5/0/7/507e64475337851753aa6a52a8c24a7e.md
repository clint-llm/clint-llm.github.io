Evaluation of the body fracture is via radiographs using plain radiography (panoramic, lateral-oblique, posteroanterior, occlusal, and periapical views) and CT scan. The lateral-oblique view helps to diagnose posterior body fractures. Mandibular occlusal view and Caldwell posteroanterior view demonstrate the presence of medial or lateral displacement of body fractures. Among all the radiographs, the most informative is the panoramic radiograph. The entire mandible is viewable in a single plane along with various advantages such as simplicity of technique, cost-effectiveness, and low radiation exposure compared with CT or cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). However, it is challenging to take a panoramic radiograph in a severely traumatized patient as it usually requires the patient to be upright position. Also, as it is a 2-dimensional image, it becomes difficult to appreciate buccolingual bone displacement.

When conventional 2- dimensional radiographs cannot give an accurate picture of the fracture, CBCT can be useful as it is highly sensitive in identifying fractures. Also, it provides better imaging quality and decreases the chances of interpretation error.
