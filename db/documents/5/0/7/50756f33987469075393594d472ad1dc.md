Retroperitoneal fibrosis is an uncommon collagen vascular disorder. It is the result of a fibrotic reaction within the retroperitoneum, and its cause is not well understood. It has correlations with both benign and malignant conditions, certain medications, and idiopathic cases, which have also been described.  Patients will often present initially with symptoms of ureteric obstruction. Reportedly CT or MRI are of equal value in diagnosis. Imaging typically shows contrast-enhancing fibrosis encasing the structures of the retroperitoneum resulting in obstruction and displacement of the ureters or vascular structures. An underlying cause remains unfound in over 70% of cases. Treatment and outcomes vary and are dependent upon etiology and the degree of obstruction.

The retroperitoneum can occasionally be a site of significant bleeding, usually after trauma, surgical intervention, or even spontaneously in patients with vascular lesions (e.g., abdominal aortic aneurysm) or those treated with anticoagulation therapy. Presentation varies based on etiology. Symptoms can include hypotension, tachycardia, ecchymoses in the affected areas, fatigue, hematuria, and flank or back pain. Computed tomography of the abdomen is the diagnostic imaging of choice.  Management of retroperitoneal hematoma is almost always MEDICAL, with resuscitation, blood transfusions, and reversal of anticoagulation as necessary.
