Reversible ototoxicity (manifested as sensory neural hearing loss, tinnitus) can be caused by ischemia in stria vascularis and by inhibiting NKCC1 channels in stria vascularis by loop diuretics, which improves with discontinuation of the drug. Deafness and tinnitus from loop diuretics most frequently occur when administering large bolus doses in an acute setting, such as when using furosemide in acute kidney injury. The resulting ototoxicity is, therefore, due to the higher serum concentrations of the drug achieved. Ethacrynic acid is the most ototoxic drug in this group.

There are reports of hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, spironolactone, and triamterene, causing hepatotoxicity, but there is no suggestion of diuretic class effect.

Diuretic-induced kidney injury has been reported, and it is most severe in elderly patients due to their decreased sensitivity of thirst response. Diuretics are also associated with increased risk when the renal blood flow is compromised in conditions such as congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome and can cause acute renal failure. Dose dependency also plays a factor as higher diuretic doses are associated with pathological injury of the glomerular basement membrane. Diuretics can lead to vacuolar degeneration of tubular epithelial cells, and hence their use with other nephrotoxic drugs should be contraindicated.
