An interprofessional team approach with good communication and established roles is crucial for optimal patient care in a patient with an unstable arrhythmia. This interprofessional team includes clinicians, nursing staff, and pharmacists. Depending on the type of reentrant arrhythmia and the management approach chosen, various interprofessional team members will contribute from their specialty (e.g., pharmacists if medication is chosen, nurses will also participate in medical management, or if surgery or ablation is the choice, nursing will assist throughout the process, including post-procedural monitoring. Open communication channels are essential to optimal outcomes.

Healthcare professionals trained and oriented to the hospitalâ€™s specific policies are essential for any rapid response or code blue situation. One study at a Vancouver General Hospital showed that nurses felt the team performed better after training and with assigned team roles. Prior to training, many nurses noted that it was unclear who the team leader was and who had which roles. Establishing proper roles for healthcare professionals on an interprofessional team is extremely important in unstable patients with advanced conditions such as reentrant arrhythmias.
