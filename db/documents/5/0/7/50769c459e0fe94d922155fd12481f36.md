There are many protocols for pharmacological SPECT study. The following protocols are the two most common protocols that are used in the clinical practice

**1. Tl-201 Stress/Redistribution Rest**

This test is a perfusion test and a viability test. The following are the steps of this protocol:

- A patient is injected with pharmacological vasodilator (adenosine (140 mcg/kg/min continuous infusion for six minutes) or regadenoson (one dose of 0.4 mg injection)) and a Tl-201 radio-tracer

- Stress cardiac images are then taken after 15 minutes with gamma cameras

- Rest cardiac images are then taken after 2.5 to 4 hours with gamma cameras. (This step is optional based on the stress cardiac images)

- Redistribution cardiac images are then taken after 24 hours from the initial injection with gamma cameras. (This step is optional based on the stress and resting cardiac images)

**2. Tl-201 Rest/Redistribution**

This protocol used for a viability test only. The following are the steps of this protocol:

- A patient is injected with a Tl-201 radio-tracer at rest

- Rest cardiac images are then taken after 15 minutes with gamma cameras

- Redistribution cardiac images are then taken after 3 to 4 hours or 24 hours from the initial injection with gamma cameras. (This step is optional based on the stress and rest cardiac images)
