The evaluation of muscle strength and muscle contraction is a routinely included procedure in the patient physical exam. The Medical Research Council Manual Muscle Testing scale is the most commonly used muscle strength grading system, where scores from 0 to 5 are assigned based on patient ability. A score of 0 refers to no muscle activation. Scoring of 1 means that there is only slight contractility of the muscle. A score of 2 is when there is muscle activation tested in the absence of gravity. 3 refers to muscle activation against gravity but not with resistance. 4 is muscle activation against gravity, and some resistance and 5 is muscle activation against both gravity and full resistance. The primary purpose of muscle strength testing in the physical exam is to evaluate and determine a differential diagnosis for when a patient presents with complaints of weakness, often in the setting of neurologic disease.
