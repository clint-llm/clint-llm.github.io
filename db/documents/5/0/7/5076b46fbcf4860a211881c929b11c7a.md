Inadequate plain films and lack of advanced imaging can lead to a missed cervical spine injury.

Injury to the vertebral artery may occur as a result of subaxial cervical spine trauma or intraoperatively.

Secondary neurologic deterioration is a potential complication of cervical spine injuries - this manifests as a progressive motor or sensory loss at or above the level of the injury after the initial assessment. Risk factors for this deterioration include a flexion mechanism of injury and an underlying ankylosed spine.

Surgical treatment of these fractures can lead to the known complications of spine surgery, including infection, dural tears, neurologic injury, pseudarthrosis, and hardware loosening.
