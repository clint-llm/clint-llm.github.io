The exact etiology of TS is unknown.  The literature demonstrates multiple proposed etiologic theories but none of these postulated hypotheses have been conclusively substantiated.  Proposed risk factors include but are not limited to:

- preceding upper respiratory infection (URI)

- preceding bacterial infection

- post-streptococcal toxic synovitis

- preceding trauma

Many pediatric patients will present with a history of preceding URI symptoms, or in the setting of recent trauma.  According to Kastrissianakis and Beattie, patients diagnosed with TS are more likely to have experienced preceding viral symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, or common cold symptoms

Other hypothesized risk factors include postvaccine or drug-mediated hypersensitivity reactions or certain allergic predispositions.  Another potential clinical association has been proposed for Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (LCPD) and TS.  While this relationship remains controversial, some studies have reported increased incidence rates of LCDP following TS (up to 3%) compared to the relative LCPD incidence rate reporting in the general population (0.9 per 100,000 patients).
