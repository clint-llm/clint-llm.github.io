The area of the brainstem where the spinal trigeminal nucleus is situated is supplied by the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA)

Specifically related to the spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve are the first and second of these segments, which pass over the ventrolateral part of the brainstem. Any disruption of blood flow through the vertebral artery or posterior inferior cerebellar artery would interrupt the processing of sensory information from the trigeminal nerve. Such pathologies include vertebral artery dissection, thrombotic occlusion, and stenosis from extrinsic compression, such as from a tumor or fibrous band.
