APUDomas, currently known as neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), are a group of heterogeneous tumors that arise from the diffuse neuroendocrine system. They occur mainly in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. To avoid the advancement and progression of such tumors, they should be diagnosed and treated early. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of NETs and explains the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of APUDomas.
- Describe the histopathology of APUDomas.
- Outline the options for the management of APUDomas.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by APUDomas.
