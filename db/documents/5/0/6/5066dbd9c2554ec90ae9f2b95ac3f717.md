For analysis and CTX-1 and P1NP level measurement, available assays include both those run by automated analyzer systems and manual assays.

As standardized reference values have yet to be determined for BTMs, data generated from the measurements taken with this process are best applied to monitor scenarios, where serial measurements of markers from the same patient can be used to show the relative change in levels over time. This is particularly helpful in pharmacologic therapy response and adherence monitoring, as described below.

For anabolic agents like teriparatide, BTMs are expected to increase in response to treatment, with P1NP being the preferred marker; levels begin to increase immediately once treatment is initiated, with peak levels appearing after 1 to 3 months of treatment.
