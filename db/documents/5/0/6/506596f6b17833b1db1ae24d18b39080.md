Patients with esophageal leiomyoma may present to the nurse practitioner and primary care provider with symptoms or an incidental finding on an imaging study. These patients are best managed by a thoracic surgeon, gastroenterologist, and a primary care nurse, physician assistant, or primary care physician for followup. All lesions should be removed because malignancy is hard to rule out. The outlook for patients with esophageal leiomyoma is excellent and chance of recurrence is extremely small. However, complications as a result of surgery may occur and include a perforation of the esophagus or fibrosis.
