Adverse effects are common during opioid therapy. In particular, patients on opioids should be monitored for constipation, nausea, vomiting, sedation, impaired psychomotor function, and urinary retention. Among gastrointestinal side effects, opioid-induced constipation (OIC) affects between 45% and 90% of patients and is a source of significant morbidity.

Opioids also have neuroexcitatory effects that might not be easily recognized. Myoclonus is typically a herald symptom. Myoclonus, which is the uncontrollable jerking and twitching of muscles/muscle groups, most frequently occurs in the extremities, initially presenting with only an occasional random jerking movement. Myoclonus can present in patients on chronic therapy with most opioids, including hydromorphone, morphine, and fentanyl.  Higher doses more frequently result in myoclonus, but the dose relationship is variable.

Sedation occurs in 20% to 60% of patients, most commonly when initiating opioid therapy or when doses increase.

Both pruritus and urinary retention are rare side effects. A combination of topical agents and/or systemic low-dose opioid antagonists is commonly used to treat pruritus. Acute urinary retention needs urgent medical attention; if it is related to the opioid, either the opioid dose can be reduced, or the agent discontinued.
