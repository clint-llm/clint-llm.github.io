**Urinalysis**is often required to rule out urinary tract infection (UTI).

**Bladder scan,**uroflowmetry, or ultrasonography with post-void is often required for cases of suspected underlying anatomical cause. Consider voiding cystourethrography, cystoscopy, or****urodynamic studies if abnormalities found on ultrasonography.

**Sleep study**is recommended in cases of suspected sleep disorder. In cases with decreased arousal from sleep, it is important to obtain workup for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).

- **Epworth Sleepiness Scale**(EPS) should be completed prior to ordering a sleep study.
