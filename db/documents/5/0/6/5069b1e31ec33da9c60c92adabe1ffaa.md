The management of LV aneurysms includes medical and surgical.

**Medical Management:**

Small or medium, or large LV aneurysms with no symptoms can be safely monitored with an expected five-year survival of up to 90%. The management can include optimization of coronary artery disease risk factors for ischemia prevention, afterload reduction with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and anticoagulation to prevent thromboembolism. In patients with large LV aneurysms with symptoms, the management is the same as asymptomatic cases, plus specific treatment for complication/symptoms treatment and perform surgical management if there is any indication. In terms of anticoagulation, the risk of LV mural thrombus is highest within the first month after acute infarction; therefore, it is always prudent to employ anticoagulation in all patients using warfarin the first three months after LV infarction. Long-term anticoagulation should be reserved for patients with large, friable thrombi protruding into the ventricular cavity, documented systemic embolization beyond the three months, or while receiving anticoagulants, and globally impaired LV function.

**Surgical Management**

Relative indications for ventricular aneurysm operation include:

- Documented expansion

- Large size

- Angina

- Congestive heart failure

- Arrhythmia

- Rupture

- Pseudoaneurysm

- Congenital aneurysm

- Embolism

All patients considered for surgery must undergo right and left cardiac catheterization with coronary arteriography and left ventriculography. An echocardiographic assessment of the mitral valve should be done with +2 mitral regurgitation with cardiac catheterization and should be evaluated for intrinsic valve disease not amenable for annuloplasty. The left ventricular aneurysmal repair constitutes aneurysmectomy, aneurysmorrhaphy, and ventricular restoration that requires cardiopulmonary bypass and a balanced anesthetic technique. The ultimate size of the left ventricular cavity at the end of the procedure is critical to patient outcomes. Using preoperative and postoperative three-dimensional techniques to image the left ventricle, Cherniavsky and colleagues proposed that the aneurysm resection or patch should produce a postoperative left ventricular end-diastolic volume of about 150 mL.

The early surgical approaches, including nondirected aneurysmectomy or infarctectomy with or without revascularization for patients with LV aneurysm and drug-refractory ventricular tachycardia, were abandoned because of high operative mortality. With the advancement of electrophysiologic mapping techniques to demarcate the site of arrhythmogenic focus, a directed subendocardial ablation of the arrhythmia focus of LV aneurysm can be performed. This technique consists of an aneurysmectomy, along with excision of a 2-3 mm thick layer of subendocardial peri-infarcted tissue. With such an approach, tachycardia can be eliminated in 90% of patients with an operative mortality of about 10%.

Relative contraindications for left ventricular aneurysm correction surgery include greater anesthetic risk, myocardial dysfunction, cardiac index less than 2.0 liters/m2 per minute, severe mitral regurgitation, evidence of subendocardial infarction, and lack of a thin-walled aneurysm with prominent margins.

**Pseudoaneurysm**

Untreated LV pseudoaneurysm can have a mortality of up to 50%. Surgery is the preferred treatment for pseudoaneurysm and holds perioperative mortality up to 10%. Percutaneous transcatheter device closure is preferred over open surgery.
