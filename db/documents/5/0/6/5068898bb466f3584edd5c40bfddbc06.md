Alkaline phosphatases are a group of isoenzymes, locatedÂ on the outer layer of the cell membrane; they catalyze the hydrolysis of organic phosphate esters present in the extracellular space. Zinc and magnesium are important co-factors of this enzyme. Although alkaline phosphatases are present in different body tissues and have different physiochemical properties, they are true isoenzymes because they catalyze the same reaction. In the liver, alkaline phosphatase is cytosolic and present in the canalicular membrane of the hepatocyte.

Alkaline phosphatases are classified as tissue-specific and tissue-nonspecific types. Alkaline phosphatases found in the intestine, placenta, and germinal tissue are tissue-specific.
