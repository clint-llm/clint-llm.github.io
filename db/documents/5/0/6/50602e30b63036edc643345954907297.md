Among vascular disorders, the two major differential diagnoses of lateral neck pain would be carotid dissection and giant cell arteritis. Carotid artery dissection is usually associated with neurological deficits, and Horner's syndrome comprising of ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis is present in about half the cases of carotid dissection.

Table 1. Differential diagnoses for unilateral neck pain related to the carotid artery

Unilateral neck pain:

Infectious: Infections of the oropharynx, oral cavity, and glands (lymphadenitis, sialadenitis, peritonsillar abscess, and thyroiditis)

Neurological: Migraine headache, trigeminal neuralgia

Neoplastic: Head and neck neoplasms

Musculoskeletal: Cervical spondylitis, temporomandibular joint syndrome, Eagle syndrome

Pain isolated to the carotid artery:

Vascular: Carotid dissection, carotid body tumor, carotid aneurysm, fibromuscular dysplasia, acute carotid occlusion, large-vessel vasculitis
