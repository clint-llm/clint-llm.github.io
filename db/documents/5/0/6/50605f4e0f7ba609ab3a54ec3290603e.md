Membranous nephropathy (MN), also known as membranous glomerulopathy, is one of the many glomerular diseases causing nephrotic syndrome. It is characterized by massive proteinuria (>3.5 g/day) and clinically presents with peripheral edema, hypertension, frothy urine, and manifestations of thromboembolic phenomena. Laboratory investigations show hypoalbuminemia, dyslipidemia, and acute kidney injury with elevated creatinine. The lack of active sediments with the absence of hematuria and red cell casts in urine microscopy differentiates it from nephritic syndromes. The nephrotic range proteinuria is attributed to podocyte injury and loss of membrane anionic charge barrier, causing albuminuria. This is in contrast to a nephritic syndrome, which involves an inflammatory process in the glomerular basement membrane.
