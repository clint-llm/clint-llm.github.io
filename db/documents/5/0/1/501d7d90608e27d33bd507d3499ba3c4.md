All patients with suspicion for Eisenmenger syndrome should undergo a detailed history and physical, with particular attention on determining triggers for PAH. Patients should also undergo an evaluation to determine the degree of PAH as well as ventricular function. As there is evidence supporting symptomatic improvement with vasodilator therapy as in PAH, patients should also undergo vasoreactivity testing.

Workup should include pulse oximetry, chest radiograph, EKG, pulmonary function tests, complete blood count, iron studies, and cytidine monophosphate testing. Complete cardiac catheterization should occur at centers that specialize in the management of adult congenital heart disease and PAH.

Loud murmurs may not be present in Eisenmenger syndrome. In such cases, left ventricle pressure may be similar to right ventricle pressure, creating a very small gradient. Without turbulence, there is no readily appreciable murmur on auscultation.
