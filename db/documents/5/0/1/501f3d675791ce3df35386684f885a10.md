Histologically, MVP is characterized as a myxomatous degeneration or connective tissue disorder. The spongiosa of the mitral valve leaflets proliferates with mucopolysaccharide deposits with excessive water content. Thus resulting in leaflet thickening and redundancy.

Type III collagen content increases, and elastin fibers are fragmented.
