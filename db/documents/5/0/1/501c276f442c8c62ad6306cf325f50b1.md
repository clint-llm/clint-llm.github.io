The dimorphic fungus Coccidioides causes coccidioidomycosis, also known as San Joaquin Valley fever, which is endemic to the arid regions of the Western Hemisphere. Coccidioides was first discovered by a medical intern in 1892 and was later named Coccidioides immitis. Coccidioidomycosis has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic infection to fatal disease. This activity reviews the pathology of coccidioidomycosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of coccidioidomycosis.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with coccidioidomycosis.
- Summarize the treatment options for coccidioidomycosis.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of patients with coccidioidomycosis.
