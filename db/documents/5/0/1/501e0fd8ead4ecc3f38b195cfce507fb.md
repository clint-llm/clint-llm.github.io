Enhancing outcomes associated with postpartum pubic symphysis diastasis rely on clinician knowledge of the injury leading to early detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Early imaging studies including ultrasound and a standard AP pelvis radiograph, in cases of sustained or out-of-proportion pelvic pain following childbirth, should be considered. Interprofessional communication between obstetric and orthopedic clinicians is important in early diagnosis. Team-centered patient care including physical medicine and rehabilitation as well as physical and occupational therapy should be utilized to optimize outcomes.
