Bilirubin, a yellow-orange bile pigment, is the catabolic product of heme metabolism. Approximately 85 percent of the heme moiety comes from the hemoglobin degradation of red blood cells, while the remaining derives from the ineffective erythropoiesis and the breakdown of other hemoproteins such as cytochromes, myoglobin, and catalase.

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia arises in one of the three major pathophysiologic conditions or a combination of them:

- Increased bilirubin production

- Impaired bilirubin uptake

- Impaired bilirubin conjugation

Increased bilirubin production and consequential unconjugated hyperbilirubi­nemia can result from increased catabolic degradation of hemoglobin and other heme proteins, typically due to accelerated hemolysis, a large hematoma, dyserythropoiesis (e.g., megaloblastic and sideroblastic anemias), or sometimes due to destruction of transfused erythrocytes. In these conditions, patients with normal liver function efficiently conjugate and excrete the excess bilirubin.

The impaired hepatic uptake of bilirubin can be the result of decreased bilirubin delivery to the liver and inefficient uptake of bilirubin by hepatocytes, usually resulting from reduced hepatic blood flow (congestive heart failure and portosystemic shunts) and drugs/contrast administration. The unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia induced by several drugs (rifampin, flavaspidic acid, novobiocin, and various chole­cystographic contrast agents), generally resolves within 48 hours of drug discontinuation.

Impaired bilirubin conjugation can result from hereditary defects, including Gilbert syndrome and the Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I and II, that cause a decrease or loss of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1) activity, an enzyme responsible for conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid.
