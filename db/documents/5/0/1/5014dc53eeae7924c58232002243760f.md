A T-tube is a T-shaped tube placed in the common bile duct following procedures involving the duct, such as after choledochotomy. T-tubes can also be used for persistent duodenal fistulas, pancreaticoduodenectomies, or hepaticojejunostomy in liver transplantation. T-tubes provide external drainage of bile via a controlled route the original pathology is resolving. T-tubes should not be confused with tracheal tubes or tympanoplasty tubes. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in placing T-tubes and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of T tube.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to T tube placement and care.
- Recall, analyze, and select appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and clinical significance of T tube and bile duct obstruction.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication regarding management of T-tubes to improve patient outcomes.
