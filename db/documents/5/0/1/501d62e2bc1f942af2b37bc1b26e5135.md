In subacute thyroiditis, the predominant inflammatory cells are lymphocytes with a unique type of follicular disruption with predominant histiocytes surrounding colloid masses, producing giant cells. Interestingly, even though the entire thyroid gland is tender on gross examination, histologic examinations show patchy changes with varying stages of the disease. In the early phase, follicular cells are disrupted and are replaced with microabscesses and neutrophils. The classic granulomatous changes appear a little later in the disease with a large aggregation of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and large histiocytes in the damaged thyroid follicles. Multinucleated giant cells surround the fragments of colloid, and sometimes colloid can also be seen in the giant cells. In the late stages, there are many lymphocytic infiltrates and fibrosis. Rarely different histologic stages can be found in the same gland suggesting the confluence nature of destruction.

Subacute thyroiditis has both granulomatous and non-granulomatous patchy lesions under electron microscope examination. The predominant finding seen in granulomatous lesions is loss of honeycomb cellular architecture of follicular cells with decreased or shortened size of follicular cell microvilli with predominant giant cells. In the non-granulomatous lesions, the follicular basement membrane is disrupted and is replaced with T lymphocytes, monocytes, and histiocytes.
