Warthin tumor is the only benign neoplasm of salivary glands associated with smoking.Hildebrand proposed that the lesion may be remnants of the branchial pouches and a variant of the lateral cervical cyst. Later, Albrech and Artz proposed the heterotropic origin of Warthin tumor from the neoplastic proliferation of salivary gland ducts present within intra- or para-parotid nodes. This theory is widely accepted and was sustained by immunohistochemistry findings, which demonstrated that basal and luminal epithelial cells of Warthin tumor bear characteristics similar to those of the basal cells and striated duct cells of the excretory duct of the salivary gland.
