Complications from Z-plasty transposition parallel those of any other cutaneous flap surgery: pain, bleeding, infection, worsened scarring, and need for further surgery. Because of the complicated geometry of Z-plasty transposition, there exists the opportunity for misjudgment of flap orientation or length as well as skin laxity or viability. In the event of such an error, or in the case of poor tissue quality or vascularity, the resulting postoperative scar may appear worse than the initial one, or distortion of surrounding tissues may be exacerbated.

Because the technique involves raising flaps, more specific risks include hematoma development and venous congestion, either of which may result in flap necrosis and/or wound dehiscence. Necrosis is made more likely by poor tissue vascularity, excessively thin flaps that do not incorporate the subdermal plexus, or overly narrow flaps (<30 degrees at the tip). Conversely, flaps that are too wide (<60 degrees at the tip) are more likely to result in standing cutaneous deformities ("dog ears") that are likely to require revision at a later stage.
