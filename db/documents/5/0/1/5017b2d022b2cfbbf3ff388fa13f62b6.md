In a healthy person considered to be hemodynamically stable, cardiac output is sustained to reduce a mismatch between oxygen delivery to tissue and organ demand. For example, to meet the oxygen demands that occur during situations of a low-exercise aerobic load (not maximal load) cardiac output increases due to a linearly increasing heart rate and non-linearly increasing stroke volume response.
