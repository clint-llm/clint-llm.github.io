E. coli O157: H7 causes an estimated 63,000 hemorrhagic colitis cases annually in the United States. Review of database and studies from 10 out of 14 world health organizations subregions showed the global incidence of E. coli to be 2.8 million cases per year.Â E. coli O157: H7-induced HUS can result in systemic morbidities, such as acute renal failure, primarily in children. E. coli 0157: H7-induced HUS has become an important etiology of acute renal failure in children over the last two decades. While E. coli 0157: H7 causes diarrheal illness in both children and adults, systemic complications occur more frequently in children. In adults, E. coli 0157: H7 colitis can occasionally cause HUS and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Outbreaks of E. coli 0157: H7 typically occur sporadically in outbreaks with exposure to contaminated food sources.
