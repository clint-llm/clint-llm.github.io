A detailed understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the penis is required for penile prosthesis implantation. The erectile tissues of the penis are separated grossly into three compartments. These include the corpus spongiosum, which encompasses the urethra, and paired cylindrical corpus cavernosum, which form the main erectile bodies. These corporal bodies connect via a midline septum, allowing for free communication between the erectile tissues.

The aforementioned compartments are encased by several fascial layers that are relevant to the erection. The outermost layer, the penile skin, surrounds the superficial (Dartos) fascia. Underneath this layer is the deep (Buck) fascia. Buck fascia splits to surround the corpus spongiosum ventrally and the corpus cavernosum dorsally. The cavernosal bodies are enveloped by a layer of dense connective tissue, tunica albuginea. The tunica albuginea fibers are stretched during erection, which allows for rigidity.

The blood supply to the erectile tissues is multifaceted. Superficially, the external pudendal arteries, via the femoral artery, supply the penile skin. The deep blood supply is maintained by the internal pudendal artery with three main branches to the penis.

The venous drainage of the erectile bodies is less predictable. Most often, the cavernosum and spongiosum drain into emissary veins, which collect into the dorsal vein of the penis.
