After the completion of a surgical procedure or when a patient is weaning towards extubation,  NMBA might be reversed pharmacologically to prevent unwanted side effects and facilitate quick extubation. Traditionally neostigmine reverses NMBAs. The mechanism of action of neostigmine is inhibition of acetylcholine esterase (AChE), the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh). The increased level of ACh will compete with NMBA and stimulate the nicotinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction enhancing signal transmission.

Recent advances in anesthesia have seen the introduction of a new drug sugammadex, which is the cyclodextrin that selectively binds to plasma NMBA. By the process of encapsulation, it rapidly nullifies the effect of the NMBA as it is unavailable to act at the neuromuscular junction.

Sugammadex produces a safe and quick reversal of commonly used NMBA like rocuronium, vecuronium, and pancuronium. Sugammadex can quickly reverse both moderate and deep neuromuscular blockage (NMB).

With the introduction of Sugammadex, deep NMB can be administered for a long period for surgical procedures with no fear of a prolonged recovery period. Deep NMB creates improve working conditions for a surgeon with the need for less insufflation pressure for laparoscopic surgery.
