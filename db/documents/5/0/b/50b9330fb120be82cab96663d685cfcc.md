In the United States, there are more than 1.2 million cases of invasive cancer diagnosed yearly, and about one-half of these patients will receive radiation therapy to help manage the cancer. About 3% to 5 % of the patients who have had radiation therapy for cancer will develop delayed effects of radiation therapy such as soft tissue radionecrosis or problems with wound healing. The risk of developing this problem is dependent on the amount of radiation delivered, the type of ionizing radiation and the tissue that was radiated.
