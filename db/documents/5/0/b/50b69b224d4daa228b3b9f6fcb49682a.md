Pulse oximetry is rarely contraindicated, but understanding its limitations is helpful. A relative contraindication may be a need to measure pH, PaCO2, total hemoglobin, and abnormal hemoglobin as in the setting of carbon monoxide toxicity. It is also essential to monitor the location of the probe for changes in skin conditions, such as blisters or damage to the nail bed. Patients with burns may also require the probe to be repositioned every two to four hours.
