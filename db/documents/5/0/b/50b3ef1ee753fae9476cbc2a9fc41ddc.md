**Toxicity**

Although there is no antidote or treatment for an overdose of ziconotide, this medication can be discontinued without concerns for serious withdrawal symptoms if there are adverse side effects.

**Clinical Studies**

Three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have studied the safety and efficacy of intrathecal ziconotide. Ziconotide was associated with statistically significant pain relief, both for malignant and nonmalignant pain. Additional studies revealed that a low-dose, slow titration regimen had a lower incidence of adverse events, although its degree of pain relief was slightly less.Â  Long-term multicenter trials of intrathecal ziconotide have shown its efficacy, tolerability, and safety in the treatment of severe refractory chronic pain. Most adverse events experienced were mild or moderate in severity, the most common being nausea, dizziness, headache, confusion, and somnolence. The most common adverse events leading to discontinuation of ziconotide were psychiatric in nature. No related drug deaths, intrathecal granulomas, cardiovascular or permanent adverse events occurred with ziconotide therapy. There were no cases of respiratory depression, anaphylaxis, dependence, tolerance, or withdrawal. Most adverse events reported (58.6%) were unrelated to ziconotide.

Clinically significant elevations in CK above three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 5.7% of patients at one month. 33.7% of patients had >30% improvement in their pain scores from baseline.

**Conclusion**

Intrathecal ziconotide is an option for patients with severe, refractory chronic pain. It is a safe and effective medication not only for reducing pain but also for improving function. Ziconotide is a non-opioid analgesic that provides another approach to the treatment of severe chronic pain. Adverse events are generally not life-threatening and resolve upon discontinuation of the medication. If serious adverse events occur, ziconotide may be stopped immediately without any concern for the development of withdrawal symptoms.
