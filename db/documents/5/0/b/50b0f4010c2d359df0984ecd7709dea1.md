Pain and instability resulting from wrist arthritis is the most common indication for wrist arthrodesis, and it can be caused by a multitude of factors. Depending on its location, the most common form of wrist arthritis is the scapholunate advanced collapse or SLAC. The second most common form of arthritis is the scaphotrapezial-trapezoidal arthrosis, which can be identified in approximately 40% of wrist radiographs. Other forms of arthritis, depending on the location of the injury, are the scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse or SNAC, the distal radio-ulnar joint arthrosis, and the pisotriquetral arthrosis.

Looking at the pathophysiology, arthritis can be degenerative, or it can be post-traumatic following SLAC, SNAC, fractures of the wrist, or brachial plexus injuries.
