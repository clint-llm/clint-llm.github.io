The neonates become symptomatic 3 to 72 hours after birth. Most symptomatic babies have poor sucking, respiratory distress, and generalized hypotonia in association with a weak cry and facial diplegia. Gavage feeding for swallowing difficulties and ventilator-support due to breathing difficulties can be necessary in severe cases. In contrast to older children, ptosis (may be unilateral, bilateral, and symmetric) and ophthalmoplegia are relatively uncommon in neonatal MG.

The physical examination in neonates with MG can be significant for the frog-leg position suggestive of diffuse hypotonia. Open mouth and apparent ptosis can be helpful in the diagnosis. Flabby muscles and prominent head lags are common. Deep tendon reflexes are generally intact, but primitive reflexes can be difficult to elicit or absent.
