Pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is recommended during the postoperative period providing there are no contraindications. Postoperative blood transfusion is only recommended if the hemoglobin is below 8 g/dL or the patient is symptomatic with their anemia.

The postoperative rehabilitation is as important as the initial surgery. The aim of the surgery is to restore mobility, and therefore early mobilization should be commenced. Patients who have undergone arthroplasty or fixation of an extracapsular fracture can usually mobilize immediately after surgery without weight restrictions. Following fixation of an intracapsular fracture protected weight bearing is often recommended to reduce the risk of subsequent fracture displacement.

Regular intensive physiotherapy is required to encourage the rapid progression of mobility to restore the patient’s original mobility status. Medical management must also be optimized to reduce the risk of associated complications. Unfortunately, many patients do not regain their previous level of mobility or independence and therefore require social care input.
