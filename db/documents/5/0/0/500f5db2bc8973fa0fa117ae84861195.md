Linezolid is the first available oxazolidinone to inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by interfering with translation. Linezolid binds to a site on the bacterial 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S subunit, which prevents the formation of a functional 70S initiation complex.

Linezolid is bacteriocidal against the majority of streptococcal strains and bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci; this makes linezolid a poor option for immunosuppressed patients.

Linezolid is also a reversible, nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor.
