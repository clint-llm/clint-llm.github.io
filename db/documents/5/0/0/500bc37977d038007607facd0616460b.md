According to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) guidelines, HTG is classified into mild: TG level 150-199 mg/dL, high: TG 200-499 mg/dL and very high: TG > 500 mg/dL. ****As per the current guidelines, a triglyceride level of less than 150 mg/dL is desirable from a management perspective.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) monitored risk factors for cardiovascular disease for more than three decades and as a part of the study looked at the prevalence of triglyceride levels among the US population. Based on the findings from this study, serum triglycerides are usually higher in men than in women, especially until 70 years of age. ****The prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia was about 42% in people aged 60 years or older. The triglyceride levels were very high (>500 mg/dL) in about 2% of the subjects.****The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia is higher among Mexican-Americans as compared to white Americans and lowest in African-Americans.

The significance of HTG as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease still remains debatable. However, high levels of triglyceride levels at baseline have been associated with low HDL-C and high LDL-C, and the combination is well known for increased risk for atherogenesis. ****The lowering of the triglyceride levels from baseline in these patients has shown to reduce cardiovascular risk irrespective of drug class or lipid fraction.
