Antacids are a group of drugs that have been on the market for many years. They were initially first-line defense against peptic ulcer disease; however, the discovery of proton pump inhibitors revolutionized the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Currently, antacid use is restricted to relieve mild intermittent gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with associated heartburn. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, pharmaceutical action, adverse events, and other key elements of antacid therapy in the clinical setting as relates to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with heartburn and mild GERD.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action antacids.
- Summarize the indications for antacid therapy, including relevant interactions with other medications. 
- Review the potential adverse events associated with the use of antacids.
- Outline the role of interprofessional coordination in guiding patient care and improving outcomes when using antacid therapy.
