Because of its potential malignant transformation, the diagnosis is usually by a skin biopsy. HPV subtyping may also be a recommended next step. Microscopic findings show typical a feature of Bowenâ€™s disease with only a few differentiating features. The distinction rests in the circumscribed plaque-like pattern, the multiplicity of lesions, the age of the patient, and less dyskeratosis and atypia and more dilated vessels in the dermis in pathology.

An extensional assessment of HPV infection is mandatory, including examination of the oral, genital, and anal area. Besides, anoscopy should be performed in the case of receptive anal sex. All this must be performed for the patient as well as the partner.
