Varicose veins in the lower extremities involve the great and small saphenous veins and their tributaries between the fascia and the skin. Varicose veins are characterized by subcutaneous dilated, tortuous veins greater than or equal to three millimeters, involving the saphenous veins, saphenous tributaries, or non-saphenous superficial leg veins with age and family history considered important risk factors. For several reasons, including cosmetic complaints and complications with thrombosis formation, varicose veins should be treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of varicose veins. It highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.
