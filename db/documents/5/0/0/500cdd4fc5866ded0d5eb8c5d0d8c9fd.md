Salter-Harris I and II fractures can be treated with closed reduction, casting, or splinting. The reduction should be performed carefully to avoid damage to or grating of the physis on any metaphyseal bone fragments.

Salter-Harris III and IV fractures usually require open reduction and internal fixation (avoiding crossing the physis).

Salter V fracture diagnosis may be delayed unless there is a high degree of clinical suspicion, and often the diagnosis is not made at the initial presentation. An emergent orthopedic consultation should be obtained if the fracture is recognized. As these fractures involve the germinal matrix, they have a potential for growth arrest.

In all cases, a reexamination in seven to ten days is necessary to monitorÂ proper reduction and healing. This is also important to determine whether any complications, such as growth arrest, have occurred. If clinically indicated, an additional follow-up radiograph may be obtained at six and 12 months to reassess for any growth arrest.

The complications include growth arrest with the potential for deformity and limb length discrepancy. Entrapment of the periosteum within the fracture is a rare complication that requires an MRI scan. Beware that entrapped periosteum can prevent a complete reduction of the fracture.
