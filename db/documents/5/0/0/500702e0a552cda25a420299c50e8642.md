Abstinence and medication-assisted treatment improve outcomes for pregnant women and their children. Pregnancy is a strong motivator for abstinence, and most women refrain from or decrease their use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine by the second trimester. Those with OUD receiving medication-assisted treatment, enrolled in a comprehensive program with behavioral counseling and psychosocial support, usually maintain sobriety until delivery. However, postpartum relapse is frequent, especially for tobacco, marijuana, and alcohol, with rates as high as 80% in the first year after giving birth.
