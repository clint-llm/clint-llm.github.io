Approximately 2% to 3% of all congenital anomalies are attributed to perinatal infections.

Many of the clinical syndromes for those viruses that present in the immediate neonatal period overlap with each other. They usually cause a rash, which can be maculopapular, petechial (blueberry muffin rash), or purpuric. Microcephaly, sensorineural hearing loss (particularly with CMV), and chorioretinitis may be present. Hepatosplenomegaly and cardiac anomalies are also frequent findings.

The incidence of maternal CMV and toxoplasmosis are 2 to 10 per 1000 births.
