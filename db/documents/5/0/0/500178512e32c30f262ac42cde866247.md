If there is evidence of ST elevation on the ECG, the patient should be sent for emergency cardiac angiography to the catheterization lab with a goal door-to-vessel open time of under 90 minutes. Thrombolysis should be considered, depending on facility capability or anticipated long transport time to an interventional catheterization lab. If there is evidence of right ventricular infarction, avoid nitrates and provide volume to assure adequate preload. The right ventricle contains less myocardium than the left and is dependent on adequate preload to assure adequate cardiac function. If there is damage to the right ventricle, preload reduction from nitrates could result in significant hypotension. If this occurs, resuscitation with intravenous crystalloids and possible vasopressors are needed. Other treatment includes aspirin load with 162 to 325 mg, unfractionated heparin, GP IIb/IIIa antagonist, and additional P2Y12 anti-platelets such as clopidogrel.
