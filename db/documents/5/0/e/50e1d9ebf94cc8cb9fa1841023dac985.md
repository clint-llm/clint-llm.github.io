Exotropia is the outward deviation of eyes, i.e., away from the nose. Exodeviations can be congenital or acquired. These can be concomitant or incomitant. Concomitant deviation means that the divergent deviation of the visual axis remains the same in all positions of gaze. Incomitant deviation implies that the divergent deviation of the visual axis is variable in different gazes. These are often associated with the limitation of extraocular movements resulting either from paralytic or a restrictive etiology. The concomitant exotropia is further divided into congenital, primary, sensory, or consecutive exotropia.

Incomitant exotropia is divided into paralytic (third nerve paralysis, isolated medial rectus paralysis, paralysis of convergence), A, V, or X pattern, or restrictive (Duane retraction syndrome, thyroid myopathy, restriction due to trauma or following surgery). The intermittent or constant deviation can be graded as exophoria, intermittent exotropia, or exotropia (constant exodeviation).
