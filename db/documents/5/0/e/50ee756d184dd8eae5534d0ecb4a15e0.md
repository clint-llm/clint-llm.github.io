Various modalities to confirm the diagnosis of CAR are as follows:

**Visual Fields**- Visual field testing usually shows constriction of fields. Other visual field defects include central, cecocentral, or equatorial scotomas and enlargement of the blind spot.

**Fundus autofluorescence (FAF)**- This is an important non-invasive tool used to analyze patients with CAR. It uses a scanning laser ophthalmoscope and is based on the evaluation of lipofuscin.

CAR is characterized by the presence of a hyper-autofluorescent parafoveal ring with normal autofluorescence within the ring and hypo autofluorescence outside the ring primarily centered in the macular and peripapillary region. Hyper-autofluorescent rings can also be seen in multiple disorders, including retinitis pigmentosa, X-linked retinoschisis, Leber congenital amaurosis, and cone dystrophy.

The Robson-Holder ring represents an area of lipofuscin accumulation around a preserved subfoveal RPE.

**Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA)**- It is usually normal. Infrequent findings include optic nerve head staining, perivascular leakage in vasculitis, and petaloid leak at the macula in cystoid macular edema. Peripheral subtle window defects corresponding to retinal degeneration may also be seen.

**Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT)**- This provides an objective measure of the amount of retinal damage that has occurred and is also helpful in diagnosing CAR. It may detect the presence of CAR in the early stages.

SD-OCT shows loss of the outer retinal complex, including disruption of the ellipsoid zone (EZ) and thinning of the photoreceptor layer. Abazari et al. showed the presence of outer retinal abnormalities and/or decreased central macular thickness on SD-OCT in CAR patients. Similarly, Sepah et al. showed statistically significant loss of the photoreceptor layer in CAR patients.

OCT findings depend upon both the severity and the duration of the disease. Diagnostic delay accounts for deterioration in the visual acuity and imminent reduction in the sub-foveal EZ. Cystic spaces or the presence of cystoid macular edema (CME) is also a frequent finding. Larson et al., in a study among 17 patients with autoimmune retinopathy, showed CME to be the most prevalent finding seen in 24% of the patients. Patients with CME at initial presentation have a greater rate of EZ loss than those without CME.

The condition is also more aggressive in patients with CME, which manifests in reduced a and b waves in the electroretinogram.

**Electrophysiological tests**- These measure the electrical activity generated by the eye, the optic pathways, and the visual cortex. The full-field electroretinogram (ffERG) provides information about activity in the rod and cone systems and other neural elements.

ERG may be a more sensitive tool than OCT, and ffERG is abnormal in the very early stage of the disease. However, some cases may have involvement of the central cones, which is only evident on multifocal ERG (mfERG). The mfERG indicates the topographical location of the response within the retina. Measurement of the integrity of the retinal pigment epithelium is given by the electrooculogram (EOG). The a-wave of full-field ERG indicates the response of the photoreceptors. The b wave can be photopic and scotopic. The photopic, cone-driven b wave reflects the activity of the on and off bipolar cells whereas, the scotopic, rod-driven b wave reflects the activity of the on-type bipolar cells. Photoreceptor damage affects both the a and b waves, while conditions affecting the bipolar cells result in an absent b wave with a wave showing negative deflection. Oscillatory potentials (OPs) represent the activity of a complex feedback circuit which includes the amacrine cells, bipolar cells, and interplexiform cells.****Responses such as delayed b wave, the extinguishing of a and b waves involving the rods and cones, reduced b wave, and an electronegative ERG may be seen in patients with CAR.

Electronegative ERG is more typical of melanoma-associated retinopathy. Full-field ERG is almost always abnormal, showing absent or attenuation flash responses in photopic and scotopic conditions. When cones are mainly affected, full-field ERG might be normal, but the multifocal ERG is abnormal.

In a case series of 10 patients by Thirkill et al., loss of rod and cone amplitudes with normal or prolonged implicit times were seen in patients with anti-recoverin antibody-associated CAR. Weleber et al., in a case series of 12 patients, showed that anti-enolase-associated retinopathy is associated with more central or global cone dysfunction than rod dysfunction. In a case series of 39 patients, Adamus et al. showed abnormal electroretinogram findings in patients with anti-rod transducin-α associated with npAIR and CAR.

**Antibody testing**- The presence of antiretinal antibodies in cancer patients was first shown by Kornguth et al.

Patients with anti-α-enolase antibodies have limited involvement of the central cones. CAR associated with transducin-α antibodies has more rod degeneration. Serum antibody levels may be found to be elevated even after completion of treatment of the primary neoplasm, and it may also be associated with the progression of CAR. However, fluctuating auto-antibody levels in the serum do not indicate cancer recurrence or progression.

The role of serial serum anti-retinal antibody levels for longitudinal monitoring requires further research and technical difficulty, and cost limits its regular use. It is important to note that anti-retinal antibodies can be found even in the normal population and patients with non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy. Ko et al. showed the presence of anti-retinal antibodies in 42% of normal individuals. Hence, positive anti-retinal antibodies alone are not diagnostic of CAR. Anti-retinal antibodies can also be found in the sera of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases like Behçet disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and age-related macular degeneration.

As CAR can precede the underlying cancer diagnosis by several months, running a systemic survey facilitated by the primary care physician is essential. This includes a thorough medical history with physical examination, complete blood investigations, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, computerized tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, whole-body positron emission tomography (PET), and other appropriate tests such as mammogram, colonoscopy, prostate and genitourinary system evaluation, and others. This extensive methodology is pivotal in determining the treatment protocol and prognosis of the patient.

There are no set diagnostic criteria for CAR. The diagnosis is made by combining the patient's clinical symptoms, exam findings, diagnosis of systematic cancer, and positive antibodies against retinal proteins. A patient's visual symptoms may precede cancer diagnosis, making the diagnosis of CAR difficult initially.
