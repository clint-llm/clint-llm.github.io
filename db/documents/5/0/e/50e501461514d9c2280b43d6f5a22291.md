The pathophysiology of SCN, MCN, and ICN entrapment is similar in so far as they all essentially involve the mechanical irritation of the nerves when they are compressed locally or direct damage to the nerves. This compression could be due to edema around the nerve from direct damage, traction, friction, or repetitive compression, and/or it could be due to anatomical, traumatic, or inflammatory changes or differences preventing the appropriate course or movement of the nerves with body posture, locomotion, positioning, or abnormalities of muscle tone or contraction.

The ICN runs at the inferior border of the ischial tuberosity, passing under a fibrous expansion between the deep gluteal fascia and the ischial tuberosity, which is a common location where entrapment may occur, ICN entrapment may also occur between the insertions for the gluteus maximus and hamstring muscles, and additionally, it may occur from sitting on a hard seat from compression against the ischium and hamstring muscles.
