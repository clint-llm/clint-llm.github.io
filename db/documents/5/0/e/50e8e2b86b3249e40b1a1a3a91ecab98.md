Median nerve injuries are the primary causes of emergency department access for peripheral nerve injuries. In the United States, there are about 8,000,000 reported cases of injuries per year.

Carpal tunnel entrapment of the median nerve is the most common nerve mononeuropathy. However, 7 to 10% of median nerve entrapments occur more proximal along the nerve.
