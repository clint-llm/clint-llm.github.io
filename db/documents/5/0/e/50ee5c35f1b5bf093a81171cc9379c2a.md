Complete surgical resection of thyroid and radioiodine ablation can cause hypothyroidism. So these patients need lifetime exogenous thyroxine therapy and should be monitored for hyperthyroidism. Dose adjustments by endocrinologists are crucial as the patient is at risk of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.

Antithyroid drugs, MMI and PTU, cause agranulocytosis. Patients on these drugs should be monitored with CBC, especially white cell count. If the white cell count starts decreasing, these drugs should be discontinued due to the increased risk of infection.

Other toxicities can cause hepatic failure, cholestasis, rash, gastrointestinal toxicity, and musculoskeletal pains.
