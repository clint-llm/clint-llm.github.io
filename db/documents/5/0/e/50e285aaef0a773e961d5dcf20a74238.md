The anatomy associated with the Heimlich maneuver mainly focuses on expelling a foreign body by standing on the rear of the patient, placing arms around, and delivering a sharp inward and upward thrust to the abdomen below the rib cage.

Physiologically, the abdominal thrust maneuver is effective due to increasing intrathoracic pressure affecting the lung/airway, stomach, and esophagus produced by diaphragmatic thrusts.
