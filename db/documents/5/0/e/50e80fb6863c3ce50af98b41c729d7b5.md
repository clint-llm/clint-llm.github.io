Neck and upper back pain from somatic dysfunctions of the thoracic spine are very common. However, there are limited, non-pharmacologic treatment options. SCS and FPR are options that can provide immediate relief. Also, patients who see osteopathicclinicians will receive a holistic and whole-body approach to care. Clinicians will treat the thoracic spine as well as any associated dysfunctions throughout the kinetic chain, including cervical, lumbar, pelvic, and sacral dysfunctions; this will lead to overall better and longer-lasting treatment.
