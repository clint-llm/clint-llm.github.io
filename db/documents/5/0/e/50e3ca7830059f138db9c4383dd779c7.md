If a patient begins to display signs of potential tendinitis or tendon rupture, the recommendation is to immediately discontinue the quinolone and avoid using the affected joint. Such signs can include tendon pain, swelling, or inflammation. It is also recommended to discontinue quinolones and initiate immediate supportive measures in cases with serious adverse events, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, hepatotoxicity, and anaphylaxis.
