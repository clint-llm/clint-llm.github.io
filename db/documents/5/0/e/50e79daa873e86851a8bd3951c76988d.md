**Epidermis**

- Hyperkeratosis surrounding the lesions

- Atrophic epidermis underlying the scutulum

- A mass of spores and hyphae in the stratum corneum, around and within the hairs (endothrix infection), and in the scutulum clearly stained by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) or Grocott staining

- Well-preserved hyphae in the periphery of infected lesions

- Granular debris and degenerating mycelium in the center of lesions

**Dermis**

- Inflammation with neutrophils and lymphocytes, round-cell infiltrate

- Some small cavities between hyphae (degenerated fungi)
