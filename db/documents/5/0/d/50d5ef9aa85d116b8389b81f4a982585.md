The ODA aimed to decrease research and development costs and encourage the development of drug treatments for rare diseases by offering expedited regulatory reviews, tax credits, and extended market exclusivity.

Before the passing of the ODA in 1983, only ten drugs for orphan diseases were accessible on the market for patient use. As of 2015, the FDA has approved over 550 orphan drugs and granted over 3,600 orphan drug designations, targeting 277 rare diseases.

In addition to changing the landscape of drug development in the United States, the enactment of the ODA inspired similar changes internationally in regions such as Europe, Australia, Singapore, and Japan.
