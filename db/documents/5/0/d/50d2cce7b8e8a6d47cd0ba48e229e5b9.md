Fatty acids are carried on the albumin in the blood. In tissues such as muscle and kidney, fatty acids undergo oxidation for energy. In the liver, fatty acids convert to ketone bodies that are oxidized by tissues such as muscle and kidney. During starvation (after fasting has lasted for about three or more days), the brain uses ketone bodies for energy. The ketone bodies, acetoacetate, and Î²-hydroxybutyrate serve as a source of fuel. The liver uses glycerol as a source of carbon for gluconeogenesis, which produces glucose for tissues, including the brain and red blood cells.
