Mesenteric artery stenosis is relatively common, occurring in up to 10% of the population over 65 years of age. However, CMI has a very low incidence, accounting for less than 1 in 1000 hospital admissions for abdominal pain. Patients are typically between the ages of 50 and 70 years of age, with a strong female predominance, and have other coexisting manifestations of atherosclerotic disease.
