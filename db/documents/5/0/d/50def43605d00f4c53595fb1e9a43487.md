Enalaprilat is a widely used drug in the ICU for the management of hypertension. It is often prescribed by nurse practitioners, intensivists, cardiologists, and internists. The drug is effective with a rapid onset of action. However, nurses need to monitor the patient as hypotension can develop quickly. It is preferable to have an arterial line for continuous blood pressure monitoring while using enalaprilat. Nursing should verify the dose before administering the dose to patients and also inform the patients of potential adverse reactions. Pharmacists need to perform medication reconciliation and inform clinicians of any issues. Open communication and collaborative work among health care providers can result in the successful treatment of patients needing treatment with enalaprilat while in hospital. Clinicians need to verify that patient is converted to an equivalent oral dose of enalapril before discharge if needed to continue anti hypertensive treatment with it. [Level 5]
