Lower lid blepharoplasty via a subciliary approach may be performed for a variety of cosmetic and functional indications. Some of the most common include:

1. **Dermatochalasis**: Excess lower eyelid skin with thinning and laxity forms the most common indication for transcutaneous lower lid blepharoplasty. It can be associated with loss of orbicularis muscle tone or its hypertrophy and canthal laxities, which need to be addressed during surgery.

2. **Steatoblepharon**: Fat prolapse in the lower lid is another common indication. Many prefer a transconjunctival approach in young patients with no skin excess. Transcutaneous is mainly preferred in cases with fat prolapse and excess skin. The tear trough and lid-cheek junction giving double convexity appearance is another concern of these patients, which can be blended with fat repositioning.

3. **Ectropion**or**entropion**: Senile lid changes like ectropion or entropion with associated redundant skin forms a functional indication for transcutaneous lower lid blepharoplasty.
