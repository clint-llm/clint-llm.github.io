Symptoms of psoas syndrome can often mimic a symptomatic herniated disc of the lumbar region. Other musculoskeletal causes on the differential for suspected psoas syndrome include arthritis of the hip and femoral bursitis. Snapping hip syndrome or coxa saltans should also be considered as part of the differential.

There can also be visceral causes of pain, which present similar to psoas syndrome. Visceral causes of pain include prostatitis, appendicitis, diverticulitis, salpingitis, nephrolithiasis, and colon cancer. A labral tear of the hip also presents with a slipping or catching feeling in the hip, as well as the reproduction of pain with knee flexion, making distinguishing it from psoas syndrome on exam difficult.

Medial to the psoas muscle is the ureter; thus, patients with a renal stone can often experience symptoms similar to psoas syndrome due to irritation of the psoas muscle secondary to a stone within the ureter. Similarly, the appendix can lie anterior to the psoas muscle. In the case of appendicitis, the psoas muscle can once again become irritated.

There can be considerable overlap between snapping hip and psoas syndrome, iliopsoas bursitis, hip impingement, iliopsoas tendonitis, and hip labral pathology. Thus making the diagnosis difficult.

On exam, weakness in hip flexion of an abducted hip can be seen in either snapping hip or iliopsoas syndrome.
