Despite an association with certain medical conditions as described previously, it is unknown why some patients develop IIC patterns, and others do not, even after experiencing similar underlying illnesses. There is no evidence to suggest that certain behaviors reduce the risk of this pattern developing on EEG. If there is concern that such a pattern reflects ongoing nonconvulsive seizures, attempts to treat this pattern should be considered in the context of the entire clinical picture. Efforts to obtain diagnostic clarity should be pursued judiciously with an understanding of the risks of both treating and not treating the patient.
