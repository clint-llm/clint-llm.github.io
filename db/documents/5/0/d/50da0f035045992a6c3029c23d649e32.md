Focal atrial tachycardia may be challenging to distinguish from other regular, narrow complex tachycardias.

As the management of focal atrial tachycardia differs from other narrow complex regular tachycardias, distinguishing focal atrial tachycardia from other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias is important. Below is a differential of similar appearing arrhythmias with their identifying features.

**Narrow complex, regular tachycardias**

- Sinus tachycardia

- P wave with superior axis

- Atrial flutter

- Biphasic, sawtooth appearing F wave
- Difficult to identify isoelectric, baseline PR segment
- Typical atrial flutter

- Involves circuit around the tricuspid annulus
- Counterclockwise flutter produces F waves that are negative in lead II and positive in lead V1
- Clockwise flutter produces F waves that are positive in lead II and negative in lead V1


- Atypical atrial flutter

- Involves circuit aroundÂ the scar, left atrium, otherwise non-cavotricuspid isthmus dependent

- AVNRT

- Typical, slow-fast AVNRT

- Short RP interval
- P wave may be absent or within the S wave


- Atypical, fast-slow AVNRT

- Long RP interval
- P wave negative before QRS

- AVRT

- Baseline EKG may demonstrate pre-excitation
- P wave, PR interval, QRS are variable depending on accessory pathway location and conduction direction

- Orthodromic (propagation proceeds down AV node, His bundle, Purkinje fibers, retrograde through accessory pathway and back to AV node)

- QRS width: Narrow
- RP interval: Long


- Antidromic (propagation proceeds through the accessory pathway, and then retrogradely through the Purkinje system, to His bundle, through the AV node and back through accessory pathway)

- QRS width: Wide
- RP interval: Short

- 
Atrial tachycardia (Focal)

- Junctional tachycardia

- P wave may be absent or inverted
- If retrograde VA conduction, inverted P wave may occur just before or after the QRS complex

**Narrow complex, irregular tachycardia**

- Atrial fibrillation

- Irregularly irregular rhythm

- Atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia with variable AV block

- Has features of atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia, although variable block leads to irregular rhythm

- Multifocal atrial tachycardia

- P wave morphology with greater than or equal to 3 distinct morphologies
