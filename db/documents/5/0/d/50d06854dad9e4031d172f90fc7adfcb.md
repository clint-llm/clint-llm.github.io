Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy occurs in men and women with equal distribution across all races.  Females tend to be more symptomatic causing more disability and present at a younger age.  A 1995 study by Maron et. Al. concluded that it occurs at a rate of 1:500 in the general adult population. In the United States alone, there are fewer than 100 deaths per year due to HOCM at a rate of 1:220,000 athletes.

Most patients present in the second/third decade of life. However, some adults may present between the fourth and sixth decades of life.
