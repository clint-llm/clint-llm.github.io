The ribs are very important, and healthcare workers should know of the anatomical structures that lie deep to the ribs. The ribs can be counted by palpation to determine the site of thoracentesis or a thoracostomy tube. The rib count is also done before surgery to ensure that one opens the thoracic cavity in the proper location.
