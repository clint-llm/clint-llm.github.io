There are many anatomic variants in the course of the medial brachial cutaneous nerve.  In most individuals, proximal to the medial epicondyle, there is an arborization of two to three cutaneous branches, although few have been found to have four or five.

The variability in the course of this nerve is important for surgical dissections of the medial part of the arm. The course of the medial brachial cutaneous nerve is quite variable. One study done on ten fresh cadaver specimens showed that in 9 out of 10 cadavers (18 arms), there was a link to the intercostobrachial cutaneous nerve (ICBCN).

Additionally, research has found some variants in the brachial plexus where there is an absence of the posterior cord, causing the lateral and medial cords connecting with the communicating branches and that course in front of the axillary artery.
