In primary skin lesions, sweat gland tumors account for approximately 1% of cases. Eccrine and apocrine poromas are believed to account for approximately 10% of these.

The incidence of eccrine porocarcinoma is lower than poroma, representing only 0.005% of epithelial cutaneous neoplasms, and it is more common in elderly patients.
