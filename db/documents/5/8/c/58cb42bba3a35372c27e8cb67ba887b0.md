The first law of thermodynamics states that the storage of heat is equal to the metabolic energy change minus heat loss. Managing the core body temperature is essential to survival because enzymes do not operate optimally under temperatures outside a strict range. The naked human body prefers an ambient temperature of 20 to 25 degrees C. However, the temperature of the surroundings can vary widely, and yet the core body temperature can remain between 36.1 to -37.2 degrees C. Intrinsic thermoregulatory mechanisms are responsible for this adaptability that facilitates survival in environmental temperatures ranging from 55 to 130 degrees F.
