Antihistamines are a pharmaceutical class of drugs that act to treat histamine-mediated conditions. There are two main classes of histamine receptors: H-1 receptors and H-2 receptors. Antihistamine drugs that bind to H-1 receptors are generally used to treat allergies and allergic rhinitis. Drugs that bind to H-2 receptors treat upper gastrointestinal conditions that are caused by excessive stomach acid.

H-1 antihistamines are further classified according to first and second-generation agents. First-generation H-1 antihistamines more easily cross the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system (CNS), whereas second-generation H-1 antihistamines do not.Â The first-generation drugs will bind to both central and peripheral histamine-1 receptors, whereas second-generation drugs selectively bind to peripheral histamine-1 receptors; this leads to different therapeutic and side effect profiles.

**FDA-approved Indications**

**H-1 Antihistamines**

- Allergic rhinitis

- Allergic conjunctivitis

- Allergic dermatological reaction(s)

- Sinusitis

- Urticaria

- Angioedema

- Atopic dermatitis

- Bronchitis

- Motion sickness

- Nausea

- Vomiting

**H-2 Antihistamines**

- Peptic ulcer

- Acid reflux

- Gastritis

- Zollinger Ellison syndrome

Non-FDA-approved uses for H-1 antihistamines include insomnia, and for H-2, antihistamines include indigestion. Use of dual H-1 and H-2 antihistamines has been used for refractory urticaria that fails therapy with an H-1 antihistamine.

There are two other classes of histamine receptors: H-3 and H-4. While compounds exist that bind them, there is no specific clinical benefit to clinicians using those compounds in humans.
