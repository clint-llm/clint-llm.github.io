Although evident in fetal ultrasound at 18 to 22 weeks gestation, many cases may go unrecognized in whom the mother refuse prenatal care or does not have access to the appropriate maternal healthcare resources. In these situations, the case may be first recognized on history and physical examination usually at birth. The clinical presentation of the PAVSD is highly variable depending on the degree of pulmonary atresia. Some of the common symptoms in history include:

- Central cyanosis may present as bluish discoloration of the face, particularly around the mouth and lips. In severe cases, it may be seen in peripheral limbs as well.

- Increased respiratory rate or shortness of breath due to poor oxygenation of blood. May not be evident at rest and only present at exertion i.e during crying or breastfeeding.

- Easy fatigability may present as weak cry, loss of tone, and poor latch to breast.

- Difficulty feeding.

The physical exam may reveal central cyanosis, a holosystolic murmur at the left sternal border that may radiate to the back or axilla, single accentuated second heart sound S2, a machine-like continuous murmur of PDA best heard at upper chest or the interscapular region on the back, weak grip, low weight for age, and lethargy. Peripheral edema, clubbing, and worsening cyanosis may indicate congestive heart failure if presented very late.
