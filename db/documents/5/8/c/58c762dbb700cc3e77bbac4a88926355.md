**History**

The clinical symptoms depend on the size of the shunt. Most coronary cameral fistulae are asymptomatic, particularly if there are small and not compromising coronary blood flow. Ischemia of the myocardium distal to the coronary fistula may occur in some cases, referred to as coronary artery steal phenomenon. This situation results in aÂ syndrome of angina, particularly in conditions associated with increased myocardial oxygen demand, such as during feeding in infants or during exercise in adults. In infants, angina manifests as diaphoresis, irritability, tachycardia, and tachypnea. On the other hand, adults will complain of chest pain.

**Physical Examination**

Clinical examination findings in patients with coronary cameral fistulae include:

- Collapsing pulse

- Wide pulse pressure

- Diffuse apex beat

- Palpable third heart sound (S3)

- Loud continuous murmur on auscultation that peaks in mid to late diastole heard best at the mid to lower sternal border depending on the site of drainage of the fistula.

- Signs of heart failure: elevated jugular venous pressure, S3 gallop, crepitations on auscultation of the lung bases, hepatomegaly, ascites, and pitting edema of lower limbs.
