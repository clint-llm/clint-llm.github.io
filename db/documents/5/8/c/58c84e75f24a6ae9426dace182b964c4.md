The workup of a patient with suspected periprosthetic distal femur fracture should begin with a complete x-ray evaluation of the extremity from hip to ankle. Adequate visualization of the ipsilateral hip and knee is critical for determining what implants would be available to the performing surgeon. Of utmost importance is whether the implant has subsided from its position on primary arthroplasty.

Classification systems play a significant role in orthopedics, and most fractures in the body have a classification system designed to dictate treatment. Neer developed the first classification for periprosthetic fractures in 1967. Neer classified 100 supracondylar distal femur fractures into three subtypes based on displacement and comminution.

- Neer classification of supracondylar fractures

- Type I: Nondisplaced (<5 mm or 5 degrees angulation)
- Type II: Displaced fracture > 1 cm

- IIa: Condylyes displaced medially
- IIb: Condyles displaced laterally


- Type III: Conjoined supracondylar and shaft fracture

- Su classification

- Type I: Fracture originates proximal to the femoral component
- Type II: Fracture arising at the proximal aspect of the femoral component and extends proximally
- Type III: Fracture in which any part of the fracture line can be seen distal to the upper edge of the anterior flange of the femoral component

- Lewis and Rorabeck classification of supracondylar periprosthetic distal femur fractures proximal to knee arthroplasty

- Type I: Nondisplaced; component intact
- Type II: Displaced: Component intact
- Type III: Displaced; component loose of failing
