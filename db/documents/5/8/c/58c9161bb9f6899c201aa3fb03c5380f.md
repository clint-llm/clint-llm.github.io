It is essential for health care providers to educate patients on the importance of holding these medications for the specific duration before the procedure and on their prompt resumption. This counsel is possible through direct counseling, educational materials, and the use of technology to send reminders. The potential risks and benefits of this strategy have to be discussed with patients by the interprofessional team. This interprofessional approach is vital in ensuring an appropriate treatment plan. In addition to the specialists, surgeons, and other clinicians, nursing will monitor the patient following the procedure. A board-certified pharmacotherapy pharmacist can consult with the clinicians to stop and resume anticoagulation therapy surrounding the procedure.

A patient-centered interprofessional team consisting of the primary care provider, gastroenterologist, cardiologist, or hematologist, pharmacists, and nurses have to be involved in guiding patients on handling the change in their medication regimen, monitoring for bleeding, titration of therapy, and early recognition of any complications should they occur. This team paradigm will positively drive patient outcomes.
