Patients should be aware of the possible risk factors for duodenal perforation and try to avoid them. Peptic ulcers are still the leading cause, so prevention of duodenal perforation is the same as peptic ulcer disease.

- Patients need to avoid using NSAIDs

- If patients need to take NSAIDs for any reason, they should try to take them at a low dose and for the shortest duration.

- Consider prophylaxis (such as PPI or H2 blockers) if patients require NSAIDs for a long time.

- Patients with peptic ulcer disease should follow gastroenterologist recommendations.

- Quit smoking
