Staging any neoplastic disease is crucial for determining treatment options and prognosis.  Gastric lymphoma lacks a uniform staging system. TNM staging has proven to be ineffective in lymphomas.  As a result, the Ann Arbor classification system has historically been used for Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The Ann Arbor classification system lacks specific relevant features needed to stage extra-nodal gastric lymphomas

The most commonly used staging system is the Lugano staging system which is one of the proposed modifications of Ann Arbor classification.  Lugano staging consists of Stage I, Stage II (1, 2, & E), and stage IV.  There is no stage three disease and correlates with many experts who believe gastric lymphomas should be categorized as low or high-grade lymphomas.  Stage I is defined by lymphoma confined to the gastrointestinal tract.  Stage II indicates gastrointestinal lymphoma that extends into the abdomen. Stage II1 indicates local nodal involvement, whereas Stage II2 indicates distant nodal involvement. Stage IIE is defined as an invasion of the serosa to involve adjacent organs or tissues. Stage IV is defined as disseminated extra-nodal involvement and/or the presence of supradiaphragmatic nodal involvement.

The Paris staging system is occasionally used in addition to Lugano with a focus on depth of invasion into the gastrointestinal wall to delineate disease stage more accurately.
