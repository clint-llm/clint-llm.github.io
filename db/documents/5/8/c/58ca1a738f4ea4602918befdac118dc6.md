**Molecular Genetic Testing**(first line): targeted analysis of the DMPK gene appears positive for a heterozygous pathogenic variant in nearly 100% of affected individuals. If the diagnosis is uncertain, the panel can be completed. The multigene panel can include testing for the DMPK CTG repeat expansion and other disorders of interest, depending on the laboratory.

**Serum CK:**normal to mildly elevated.

**Muscle Biopsy**(if negative genetic testing): increased internalized nuclei (boxcar appearance), ring fibers, sarcoplasmic masses, and type 1 fiber atrophy with a pyknotic clump.

**Electromyography:**records myopathic units (distal muscles), fibrillation potentials, and positive sharp waves. Fast runs of single-fiber discharges approaching the pattern of myotonic discharges are seen, without typical waxing and waning electrical myotonia.

**Brain MRI:**may show ventricular dilatation, cortical atrophy, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, and white matter abnormalities.
