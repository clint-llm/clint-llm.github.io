The blood supply to the hypothenar eminence comes from the ulnar artery. The ulnar artery will enter the hand and form the superficial palmar arch. This arch will be responsible as the main blood supply to the hypothenar eminence. While the radial artery also provides collateral blood flow. The radial artery will form the deep palmar arch in the hand. The deep palmar arch has anastomoses to the superficial palmar arch or the ulnar artery. These anastomoses will provide collateral blood flow to the hypothenar eminence if the ulnar artery's blood flow is insufficient.

The lymphatic drainage of the thenar eminence will drain toward the cubital fossa. The cubital fossa contains cubital lymph nodes. Then the lymph fluid will drain toward the axilla and eventually return to either the right lymphatic duct or the thoracic duct. The right lymphatic duct will drain the right hypothenar eminence while the thoracic duct will drain the left eminence.
