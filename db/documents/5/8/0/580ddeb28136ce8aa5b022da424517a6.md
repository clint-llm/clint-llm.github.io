Cataract surgery and intravitreal injections are the leading causes of endophthalmitis presently. However, endophthalmitis is a rare condition that has been controlled by the advent of antibiotics. In the pre-antibiotic era from 1920 to 1940, the incidence of post-cataract surgery, bacterial endophthalmitis was 2% and decreased to 0.3% by 1950. Today, of all patients undergoing cataracts surgery, approximately only 0.1% will suffer from endophthalmitis. Traumatic penetrating eye injury, however, can cause bacterial endophthalmitis 1% to 18% of the time. Hematogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is the rarest form with an incidence rate of between 0.04% to 0.4% and is associated with intravenous drug use, diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, malignancy, prolonged hospital stay or intravenous antibiotic administration.

Cataract surgery is the single most significant cause of bacterial endophthalmitis and has risk factors associated with preoperative, intraoperative, postoperative stages:

Preoperative risk factors:

- Blepharitis or lid abnormalities

- Application of 2% xylocaine gel before povidone-iodine

- Diabetes mellitus

- Advanced age

- Immunocompromised status

Intraoperative risk factors:

- Poor sterile technique

- Posterior capsular rupture

- Vitreous loss and wound leak

- Use of intracameral miotics/staining dyes and epinephrine

- Contamination during mixing of compounded medications

Postoperative risk factors:

- Postoperative wound leak

- Nonsilicon intraocular lens type

Endogenous endophthalmitis is associated with infectious diseases involving the liver, lungs, heart, brain, the urinary tract, as well as patients suffering from diabetes mellitus and immunosuppression or people with a history of recent hospitalization or surgery. Hematogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is the rarest form with an incidence rate of between 0.04% to 0.4%.
