Based on the fact that there are two different types of IUDs, including levonorgestrel and copper-containing, it should be understood that there are different indications for each of these. All IUDs are indicated for the use of contraception.

For the levonorgestrel-containing IUD, there are three different strengths of levonorgestrel available, 13.5 mg, 19.5 mg, and 52 mg. They are all equally effective at providing reliable contraception.

The copper IUD is approved for contraceptive use for up to 10 years. However, there is a documented off-label indication to use this as emergency contraception within 5 days of unprotected intercourse. The failure rate after placement for emergency contraception is approximately 0.1%.

IUDs may be placed immediately post-partumÂ within 10 minutes of delivery of the placenta, delayed post-partum within 4-6 weeks of delivery, and post-abortion, so long as it was not a septic abortion.

Additionally, there are also indications for the removal of the IUD. The primary indication for removal is the patient's preference for any reason, including, but not limited to, desire for pregnancy, irregular bleeding pattern, heavy vaginal bleeding, and discomfort or pain, which may represent the displacement of the device.
