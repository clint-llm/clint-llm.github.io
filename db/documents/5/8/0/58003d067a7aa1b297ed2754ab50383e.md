Vecuronium is a nondepolarizing agent that achieves skeletal muscle paralysis by competing with acetylcholine for cholinergic receptor sites and binding with the nicotinic cholinergic receptor at the postjunctional membrane of the motor endplate. Anticholinesterases antagonize the neuromuscular blocking properties of vecuronium.

When a patient is under balanced anesthesia, the time to recover to 25% of control is approximately 25 to 40 minutes. Recovery is usually 95% complete at about 45 to 65 minutes after the intubating dose. The presence of volatile halogenated anesthetics such as sevoflurane or desflurane slightly enhances the neuromuscular blocking action of vecuronium. If vecuronium is administered in conjunction with an inhalation induction of anesthesia with a volatile agent, the intubating dose of vecuronium is typically decreased by 15% due to the mild muscle relaxation effects of the volatile halogenated anesthetic.
