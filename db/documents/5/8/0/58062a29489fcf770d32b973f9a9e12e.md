Proper diaphragm function is essential for adequate ventilation and the function of the lungs. The diaphragm is considered the most important muscle for inhalation than the scalene, intercostal, and sternocleidomastoid muscles. It is also an important barrier that separates the abdominal and thoracic cavities. The diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve separately on both the left and right sides. The phrenic nerve is composed of cervical nerve roots three through five. The diaphragm contracts downward to cause a negative intrathoracic pressure to allow lung expansion and passive airflow into the lungs for gas exchange.

Diaphragm paralysis can be unilateral or bilateral; however, unilateral paralysis is more common.Â Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is a condition in which either the right or left side of the diaphragm loses the ability to contract to allow proper inspiration. This can result from muscular issues in the diaphragm or loss of innervation from the phrenic nerve to the hemidiaphragm.
