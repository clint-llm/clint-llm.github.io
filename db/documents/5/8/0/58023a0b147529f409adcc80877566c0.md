The sympathetic trunk is comprised of a nerve bundle that runs from the skull base to the coccyx. Its main function is to mediate the body's "fight or flight" response, and it also plays an integral role in maintaining homeostasis in conjunctionÂ with the parasympathetic nervous system. The lumbar sympathetic trunk is located along the anterolateral aspect of the first through fourth lumbar vertebra. The preganglionic neurons exit the spinal cord via white rami of the ventral roots of spinal nerves L1 to L4 and then synapse at the appropriate lumbar sympathetic ganglion. From there, the postganglionic neurons extend distally and innervate specific sites. The densest portion of lumbar sympathetic ganglia resides in L2 and L3, therefore, lumbar sympathetic blocks are most commonly performed along with the lower third of L2 or the upper third of L3 levels.
