The Pap test is performed in order to screen for cervical cancer. The cells at the squamocolumnar junction of the endo and ectocervix are susceptible to HPV infection and dysplastic change. HPV is responsible for >90% of cervical cancer. This virus incorporates its DNA into the developing cell and turns off the tumor suppressor gene (p53 and RB) function allowing the cells to become dysplastic. This process is a slow, gradual process that has many stages of development that can be identified before the dysplasia progresses to cervical cancer.

Because there are time and an adequate screening test that allows for sampling these changing cells (the Pap test), the process can be identified early and treated before progressing to cervical cancer. The dysplastic process is not limited to the cervix as the vaginal and vulvar tissue are also susceptible to the HPV virus. Colposcopy of the cervix and vagina are essentially identical, but the vulval tissue has a delayed absorption of the acetic acid, so the procedure is slightly modified.
