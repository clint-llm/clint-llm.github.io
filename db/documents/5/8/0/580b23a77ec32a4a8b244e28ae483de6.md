Patients with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, particularly the severe types, do have a significant number of complications that increase both morbidity and mortality. According to a report by Golomb et al., about 11 patients with symptoms of PMD, perinatal complications like meconium aspiration, and pneumothorax have occurred requiring rehabilitation in the form of tracheostomy and compression machine at the age of 10 months. Besides, there were feeding problems which required gastrostomy. Other complications include scoliosis and sleep disturbances, which were responsive to melatonin.

Early intervention in patients with PMD can prevent complications and further neurologic deterioration. According to a case report by Jang et al., a patient received neuro-developmental training to improve balance and developmental delay. The results were promising as the child showed improvement in his motor functions. This emphasizes the importance of training to prevent complications in the long run.
