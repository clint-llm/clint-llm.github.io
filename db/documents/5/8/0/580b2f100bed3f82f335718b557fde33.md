A study published by Karayilmaz et al., examining the long-term prognosis of avulsed teeth, concluded that the replantation of avulsed teeth is a highly successful procedure. However, the long and short-term prognosis is strongly affected by the dry time. In another study, the long-term survival of replanted avulsed teeth was only 20%, which was attributed to the lack of follow-up treatment.
