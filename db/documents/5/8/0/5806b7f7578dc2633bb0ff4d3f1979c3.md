- Avoid any unnecessary manipulation of the globe (including tonometry) to prevent any extrusion of intraocular contents.

- Obtain appropriateÂ imaging to rule out concomitant bony injury or intracranial trauma.

- Provide analgesia and antiemetics to prevent Valsalva maneuvers that may worsen globe rupture or retrobulbar hematoma.

- A protective rigid eye shield should be utilized to prevent any additional injury; eye patches are contraindicated.

- Provide prophylactic antibiotics to help prevent endophthalmitis.

- Seek emergent Ophthalmology consultation for definitive measures, but do not delay lateral canthotomy for patients with known retrobulbar hematoma.
