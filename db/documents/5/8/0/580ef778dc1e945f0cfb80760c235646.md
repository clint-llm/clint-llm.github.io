Much of this information can appear abstract, especially when talking about compartments that are more of a theoretical space. Therefore, it is crucial to have a way to physically measure the volumes of the different compartments. The way to measure the different spacesÂ is by using the indicator-dilution method.

- Total body water (TBW) - To measure, you have to inject radioactive titrated water or antipyrine. The idea behind this is that water gets uniformly distributed among all the different compartments. So if one can measure the radioactive water, it follows you to determine the TBW.

- Extracellular fluid volume (ECFV) - To measure this volume, labeled inulin, sucrose, mannitol, or sulfate can be injected. These are large molecules and are therefore impermeable to the cell membrane and will only be able to diffuse to the plasma and interstitial spaces.

- Blood volume - Red blood cell volume can be measured with 51Cr-tag RBCs or by using the formula: **Calculated Blood volume= Plasma volume X 100/ [100-(0.87 X Hct %)]**, where 0.87 is the trapping factor.

- Plasma volume (PV) - Can be calculated using radioiodinated serum albumin (RISA) or Evans Blue dye, as they are specific to the plasma space.

- Intracellular fluid volume - Cannot be measured directly but can be calculated by subtracting ECFV by TBW, as the latter two variables are measurable.

- Interstitial fluid volume - Cannot be measured directly but can be calculated by subtracting PV by ECFV, as the latter two variables are measurable.
