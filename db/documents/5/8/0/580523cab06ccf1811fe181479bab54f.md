The forearm is the portion of the upper extremity extending from the elbow to the wrist. The skeletal framework for this region arises from two primary osseous structures: the radius laterally and the ulna medially. These long bones serve as origins and insertions for many muscle groups allowing for the normal physiologic dynamic movements of the upper limb. They also provide the supportive structure needed for the passage of neurovascular bundles between the proximal and distal aspects of the upper extremity.

The extent of clinical pathology involving theÂ anatomic osseous structures of the forearm includes conditions ranging from non-displaced and displaced fractures to osseous tumors and malignancy.
