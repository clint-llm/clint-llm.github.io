Drug testing can be divided into two categories: screening and confirmation. Screening tests, be they point-of-care (POCT) or laboratory-based immunoassays, generally have lower sensitivity or specificity than definitive tests as they mainly serve to detect the presence of a drug in the system. The primary benefit of a screening test is a quick result that allows for immediate intervention. Therefore, presumptive tests should be used when it is a priority to have more immediate results. If the results of a speculative or screening test are disputed, the test should be confirmed using a definitive method. Definitive confirmatory tests are performed when the screening test is positive or when there is a need to test for drugs for which no immunoassays are available.

Different techniques for screening tests exist; lateral-flow immunoassays are common in POCT testing, and immunoassays are frequently performed in the laboratory.

Depending on the setting, the laboratory might add a confirmation test as a reflex test when the screening is positive or if the test does not include medications the patient takes; otherwise, the confirmation test should be ordered separately. For confirmation, chromatographic techniques like gas or liquid chromatography are used, coupled to (tandem) mass spectrometry, including high-resolution mass spectrometry.
