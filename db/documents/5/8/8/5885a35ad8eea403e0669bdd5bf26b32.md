Microscopy shows papillary fronds lined by bland columnar epithelium. Mitotic activity, nuclear pleomorphism, and necrosis are typically absent.

On immunohistochemistry, tumors are positive for cytokeratin, vimentin, podoplanin, and S-100.

Genetic analyses have reported germline mutations in the TP53 gene in some patients with choroid plexus papilloma.

**Feature of atypical choroid plexus papilloma:**

The presence of more than 2 mitoses in the high-power field

**Features suggestive of choroid plexus carcinoma:**

The presence of any four of the following malignant characteristics:

- Brisk mitotic activity (> 5 mitoses per 10 high-power fields)

- Nuclear pleomorphism

- High cellularity

- The blurring of the papillary growth pattern and

- Necrosis

DNA methylation profiling has shown three distinct and molecular subgroups for CPTs

- Supratentorial pediatric low-risk choroid plexus tumors (CPP and aCPP)

- Infratentorial adult low-risk choroid plexus tumors (CPP and aCPP) and

- Supratentorial pediatric high-risk choroid plexus tumors (CPP and aCPP and CPC).
