**First 5 MSR**

The patient should be positioned so that they can have the muscles above and below the joint completely relaxed and the joint can hang in a roughly 90-degree position.  This may require supporting the distal component of the joint (for instance, when testing the biceps reflex, the elbow will naturally hang limply at nearly 180 degrees of extension but can be supported to approximately 90 degrees while remaining fully relaxed by placing it on the patient’s thigh if seated, or by supporting it in a clinician’s arm). The infant’s heads should be positioned midline when assessing any reflex.

**Jaw Jerk**

The patient should be positioned with their jaw hanging in a relaxed, unlocked position. Therefore, the mouth should be slightly open.
