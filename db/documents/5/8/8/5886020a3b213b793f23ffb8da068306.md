Spinal nerves own a vital role in medicine, operating as the relay axons between the central and peripheral nervous systems.  They play a role in a full degree of clinical practice.

Cutaneous innervation of the periphery maps into dermatomes, which are areas of skin supplied by nerves arising from a single spinal root.  Understanding the topographical distribution is central to the diagnosis of a wide range of pathology.  Herpes zoster, a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus within the dorsal root ganglion of a spinal nerve, presents as a prominent and painful red rash within a specific dermatome.  Meanwhile, peripheral radiculopathy is more readily diagnosed if the affected nerve, and its subsequent spinal contributions, can be identified.

Similarly, myotomes are the motor equivalent of dermatomes.  The myotome refers to the group of skeletal muscles that a single spinal nerve innervates.  While dermatomal distribution exhibits discreet separation by spinal nerves, there is a notable amount of overlap in motor innervation. Most prominent peripheral nerves originate from multiple spinal roots, some of which may arise from an adjacent but separate spinal region.  Similarly, individual muscles often share multiple sources of spinal nerve innervation.  Thus, myotomes are instead grouped by musculature action rather than strictly by anatomical location.  Applying this concept in the clinical setting, motor deficits of a specific action in many muscles can help identify the presence of neurological motor deficit.
