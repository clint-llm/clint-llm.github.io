As with every image-guided procedure, planning begins with reviewing the patient’s history, clinical indication, and relevant prior imaging, including plain film, ultrasound, CT, and MRI. After reviewing the history and available imaging, a decision should be made about whether the procedure requested is medically indicated and if it is the best procedure available to address the clinical concern. All medications should be reviewed with specific attention to the use of any anticoagulation therapy, blood thinners (including fish oil and vitamin E), and aspirin use. Risks and benefits for holding or continuing anticoagulation should be considered on a case-by-case basis and may involve discussion with the prescribing provider.

Once the requested procedure is determined to be clinically indicated, the patient should be made aware of the risks, benefits, and alternatives.  While nearly all musculoskeletal injections are considered low risk, some potential risks of ultrasound-guided procedures include pain, infection, bleeding, damage to nearby structures, allergic reaction, steroid flare, and failure to address the clinical concern (e.g., failure to relieve pain). Additionally, if steroids are inadvertently injected into the subcutaneous soft tissues, atrophy of the subcutaneous fat or skin discoloration can occur. Although extremely rare, it has been documented in the literature that steroid injections can weaken tendons; thus, there is a theoretical risk of tendon rupture.
