Life-long follow-up with a cardiologist trained in CHD should be emphasized to all patients. In the long-term, patients and physicians should pay close attention to changes in exercise tolerance, history of palpitations or syncope, or the emergence of edema and dyspnea. It is important to note any diastolic murmur as a sign of valve insufficiency or conduit regurgitation, pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema as a sign of CHF, and elevated jugular venous pulse or hepatomegaly as a sign of increasing right heart pressures.

Routine testing with serial echocardiography is recommended to evaluate the RV-PA connection, biventricular function, and truncal valve stenosis or insufficiency. Patients with symptoms of heart failure or arrhythmia will require more frequent evaluations with electrocardiography, echocardiography, or stress-testing. If these tests are insufficient, further testing with MRI or computed tomography is useful.
