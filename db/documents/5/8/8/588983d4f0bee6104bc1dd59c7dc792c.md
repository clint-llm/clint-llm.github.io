Carbon dioxide laser skin resurfacing is a technique effective for both cosmetic and medical applications. It is an excellent modality for treating and preventing wrinkles and skin laxity that occur with photoaging. It is also effective in the treatment and prevention of keratinocyte skin cancers.

Appropriate patient selection and education are essential for successful outcomes with CO2 laser treatments. Patients with Fitzpatrick skin types I-II are most amenable to treatment with CO2 lasers; however, CO2 lasers may also be used for patients with skin types III-VI with careful adjustment of treatment parameters, particularly when a fractionated delivery system is employed.

Infectious complications, including herpes simplex virus reactivation, and bacterial and fungal infections, can impair healing, and appropriate prophylaxis should be administered. Patients should be followed carefully after treatment to provide clinicians the opportunity to identify and promptly manage any complications that may arise.
