Prelabor rupture of membranes requires immediate attention. Accurate diagnosis and knowledge of gestational age are crucial to determining the management of the patient. Gestational age dictates management. It is imperative to monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection. The patient must be evaluated in a clinical setting in orderÂ to determine if a rupture of membranes has occurred. A physician must always tell the patient to present to Labor & Delivery or an OB/GYN clinic for evaluation. A team approach is necessary for favorable outcomes. The OB/GYN will evaluate the patient and dictate the management, a nurse must participate in the monitoring of the patient, and pediatrics must be aware of the patient's status and treatment plan. It is important that the pediatric team is informed about the patient's course so they can be prepared for delivery of the infant. Anesthesiology must also be informed should the patient require a cesarean section or obstetric anesthesia. It is always important to discuss the wishes of the patient regarding the care of the newborn should the newborn be severely preterm.

PPROM is associated with a prenatal morbidity and mortality rate in excess of 20%, and the outcomes are primarily dependent on the gestational age at delivery. The key to reducing the adverse effects of PPROM is to make a prompt diagnosis, admission and start antibiotic coverage.
