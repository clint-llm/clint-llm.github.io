Pericarditis may be confused with myocardial infarction, esophageal disorders, or other non-cardiac chest pain. It is therefore essential to use the diagnostic criteria and rule out other life-threatening causes of chest pain. Respiratory conditions including pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax can cause pleuritic chest pain and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pericarditis.
