Treatment options for Chance fracture include conservative management through immobilization and surgical stabilization. In patients with a purely osseous injury and no neurological deficits, conservative treatment is appropriate. Immobilization in a cast or TLSO (thoracolumbosacral orthosis) can be performed, as bony healing will occur with time. However, neurological deficits and ligamentous injury are indications for surgery. While there are several surgical methods, the literature predominantly supports long-segment posterior fixation using pedicle screws, with or without interbody fusion.

The chance fracture is usually reduced on a Risser table by applying hyperextension to the injured thoracolumbar area. A custom-designed plaster or fiberglass is then applied. The biggest drawback is patient compliance because the orthotic device is uncomfortable. The cast is maintained for 8-12 weeks. X-rays are then obtained to determine any residual deformity, but overall, union rates are high with conservative management. An extensive rehabilitation program is necessary to regain muscle strength and mobility.

Conservative management may not be an option in obese and large individuals; these patients may benefit from surgery. The availability of percutaneous techniques of screw insertion has reduced the morbidity of open surgery.
