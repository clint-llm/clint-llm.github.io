Capone et al. found that intraoperative periprosthetic femur fractures account for 1.7% of primary and 12% of revision total hip arthroplasties.

In the postoperative setting, minor trauma accounts for the majority of presentations of periprosthetic fractures. At-risk patients include those with osteoporosis, metabolic disease, medication-related bone loss, and substance abuse. Stress shielding of the proximal femur weakens the bone adjacent to an implant and creates a stress rise susceptible to fracture. The majority of total hip implants are a combination of a few metals, such as cobalt and chromium. Cuppone et al. evaluated the elastic modulus of cortical bone and that of a mixed metal arthroplasty component. Their study found the difference in elastic modulus from the surrounding cortical bone to be 7.7% that of the femoral component.
