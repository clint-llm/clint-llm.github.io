Dental nurses often undertake decontamination tasks when there is no dedicated member of staff on duty for cleaning and sterilizing instruments. All dental care professionals must understand and be trained in cross-infection control, which is essential in dentistry due to exposure-prone procedures.

During oral surgical procedures, sharp instruments are utilized by the dental practitioner, such as the scalpel and local anesthetic needle. It is, therefore, essential that at the end of the surgery, the dentist takes the responsibility to dispose of these sharp instruments carefully. Proper sharps management reduces the risk of sharps injuries and contact with potentially infectious material to the person who clears the instrument tray.
