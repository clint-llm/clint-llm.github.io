The patient is positioned comfortably in a traditional chin rest. They are asked to focus on an internal fixation target, which is mobilized depending on the area of interest. The type of imaging is enface reflectance imaging. Once the site of interest appears on the graphic display in the user interface, the cones are brought into focus. Images are acquired over a 4-degree * 4-degree area at 9.5 frames/ second using a low noise-charged coupled device (CCD) camera. The illumination source is a near-infrared (850 nm) light-emitting diode (LED).

The software acquires 40 images, of which 20 with the best Sobel contrast are chosen. They are summed together using an auto-correlation algorithm to generate a single image with a good signal-to-noise ratio. The final image is obtained by subtracting the computed image from the background image. The brightness and contrast of the resultant image are adjusted while saturating the bright pixels. Every averaged image finally undergoes visual checks to rule out apparent artifacts. Automatic image alignment may be used to track the same retinal area with accuracy in microns for the progression of the disease, the natural history of the disease, or the response to therapy.
