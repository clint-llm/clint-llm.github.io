The management of patients with hydrocarbon toxicity is with an interprofessional team that also includes ICU nurses. All patients presenting with suspicion or symptoms of hydrocarbon exposure should immediately be placed on a cardiac monitor as well as pulse oximetry. There are no specific quantitative tests for hydrocarbons, but identification of the specific hydrocarbon substance may help guide management and anticipate adverse events. A chest radiograph is indicated in any patient suspected of inhalation or aspiration of hydrocarbons.

There is no specific treatment for hydrocarbon toxicity, but close monitoring of the cardiovascular and pulmonary organs is highly recommended.
