TREX1 is a widely expressed protein that acts as part of the SET complex in granzyme A-mediated apoptosis to degrade single-stranded DNA. TREX1 encodes a 3'-exonuclease 1 protein that removes nucleotides from the 3' ends of DNA molecules to remove unneeded fragments that may form during DNA replication. The TREX1 gene has also been found to play a role in immune regulation and viral infection. Research has found that mutations in this gene correlate with many diseases, including Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), familial chilblain lupus (FCL), Cree encephalitis, cryofibrinogenemia, and retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy (RVCL).
