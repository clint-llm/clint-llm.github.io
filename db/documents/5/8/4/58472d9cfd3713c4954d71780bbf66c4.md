The gold standard test for the evaluation of a COVID-19 suspect, presently, is an RT-PCR of the appropriate respiratory (nasopharyngeal or endotracheal or bronchoalveolar lavage) samples.

A case with respiratory distress in pregnancy is likely to have several differential diagnoses.

COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of pulmonary embolism.

Blood investigations for the patients include routine blood investigations, including a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, liver, and renal function tests. The CBC may show signs of a typical viral disease with leukopenia or another cell line depression. Patients presenting late in the illness may show leukocytosis suggestive of a secondary bacterial infection. A neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) may be of prognostic significance, with high ratios closely related to poor outcomes.

Liver function tests may show raised transaminase levels in the patients at baseline.

IL-6 levels, CRP levels, and ferritin levels may help assess the level of inflammation.

An electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and cardiac enzymes may be relevant in individual cases with suspected myocarditis.

From the obstetric point of view, a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia can undergo cardiotocography to assess fetal well-being. Depending on the presentation, ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging to assess for preterm birth (by cervical length measurement) and fetal parameters to estimate corresponding gestational age in a patient may be necessary.
