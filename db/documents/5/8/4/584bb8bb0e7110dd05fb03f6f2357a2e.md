Polycythemia vera (PV) is a condition where the bone marrow goes into “overdrive” and makes too many red blood cells, along with too many white blood cells and platelets. This can put you at risk for life-threatening blood clots, bleeding, and certain blood cancers. It is, therefore, important to have frequent follow up with a hematologist for close monitoring and treatment to lower these risks. Treatment options include phlebotomy, daily aspirin, and certain medications to suppress the bone marrow.
