The prognosis of catatonia is favorable if detected early and treated. It is more favorable if catatonia is associated with mood or anxiety disorders. Catatonic schizophrenia carries a poorer prognosis. Most clinical studies that have focused on the use of lorazepam in the treatment of catatonic schizophrenia show poor results.

Another acclaimed study also studied the effects of lorazepam on patients with catatonic schizophrenia and catatonia secondary to other disorders, and importantly patients with catatonic schizophrenia showed only partial remission while the others showed full remission.

The use of ECT is encouraged in catatonia that does not respond to benzodiazepines. However, studies continue to show that catatonic schizophrenia also responds more poorly to ECT compared to catatonia secondary to mood disorders.

The group lead by Gabor S.Ungvari discusses the psychomotor symptoms that are seen in chronic schizophrenia and underdiagnosis and recognition of the same. Chronic patients may display more stereotypes, automatic mannerisms, and bizarre postures.

This group focuses on the presence of psychomotor symptoms in both acute and chronic schizophrenia and the recognition of catatonia within this phenomenon.
