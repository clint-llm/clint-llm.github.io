Traumatic lumbar spondylolisthesis, also known as traumatic lumbar locked facet syndrome, is an acute anterior shift of a lumbar vertebral body (L1 â€“ L5) over another. This rare injury arises from complex trauma and high-energy mechanisms resulting in pathoanatomical changes at the intervertebral articulations. Usually, lumbar spondylolisthesis is encountered in degenerative diseases. Moreover, reported cases of traumatic lumbar spine injuries commonly involve either the thoracolumbar or lumbar sacral region. Herein, we review the anatomy of lumbar vertebras emphasizing the intervertebral joints and the mechanism of injuries. Next, we discuss radio-clinical presentations as well as management options.
