Histologically, DDD is characterized by an increase in pigmentation of the basal layer and downward elongation of the rete ridges with thinning of the underlying suprapapillary epithelium. This often appears filiform or antler-like when arising from the under surface of the epidermis and hair follicles. Dermal melanophages and a mild perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate are also present.Galli-Galli disease is a variant of DDD that has prominent suprabasal non-dyskeratotic acantholysis in addition to the classic histologic features previously described.
