A wide range of disease processes can lead to peripheral neuropathies, which routinely require an interprofessional team approach to diagnosis and treatment. This team should include physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and, when necessary, pharmacists, all working collaboratively to achieve optimal patient care and outcomes. [Level 5] Neuropathies can be both painful and debilitating for patients. Thus it is vital to acquire a prompt diagnosis of the underlying condition followed by the initiation of appropriate treatment(s) to reverse, slow, or stop the progression of the disease. Identifying patients most at risk for neuropathies and implementing a preventative approach to their care can undoubtedly improve outcomes for patients, as seen in the case of diabetic neuropathy. As primary care providers and nurse practitioners are often the first to work up these patients, it is imperative that they are familiar with the full range of etiologies that play a role in the development of peripheral neuropathies, including testing and referrals to the appropriate specialists.
