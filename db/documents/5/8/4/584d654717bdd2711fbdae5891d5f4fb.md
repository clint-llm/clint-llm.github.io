Adrenal metastases are the most common malignant lesions involving the adrenal gland and the second most common tumor of the adrenal gland after benign adenomas. With the increasing role of CT, MRI, and PET in diagnosing, staging, and follow-up of malignancies, adrenal metastases are increasingly found incidentally.
This activity describes the etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of adrenal metastasis and highlights the role of interprofessional teams in improving outcomes for such patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, and histopathology of patients with adrenal metastasis. 
- Outline the evaluation in patients with adrenal metastasis. 
- List the conservative and surgical treatment options available for patients with adrenal metastasis. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination to facilitate early diagnosis and targeted management of patients with adrenal metastasis and primary tumor lesion.
