Detailed measures for infection control are vital for preventing infections from cupping therapy. Hand washing and wearing the appropriate protective equipment (gloves, mask, protective eyewear, gown) are essential in preventing the spread of infection. Disinfecting beds or chairs used during treatment ensure a sterile environment. Using disposable equipment for cups, surgical blades, and vacuum pumps is preferable to disinfecting.

To minimize complications and adverse effects of cupping, a detailed medical history is recommended. Compiling a checklist that includes known contraindications to cupping therapy is a simple and effective method of automating the initial encounter. A physical exam should also be performed to evaluate whether or not the patient has any other abnormalities that would hinder or contraindicate treatment.
