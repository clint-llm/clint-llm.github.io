Arginase deficiency (argininemia) rarely presents in the newborn/infant period. Hyperammonemia may still be present, but it is not life-endangering. After 1 to 3 years of life, patients develop intermittent episodic hyperammonemia, which can be induced by catabolic states (infections), high dietary protein intake, or medications (valproate). This status can only be recognized when the patient presents with an acute, precipitating incident.

While developing, patients progressively present a reduction of linear growth (100%) and spastic diplegia (the most obvious sign of the condition) while cognitive development stagnates or regresses.

If no treatment is provided, patients will develop severe complications of the abnormalities stated above. Objective neurologic findings discovered through brain imaging studies consist of seizures, microcephaly, and cortical atrophy.
