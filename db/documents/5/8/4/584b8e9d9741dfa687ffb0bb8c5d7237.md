Atypical fibroxanthoma is a rare, low-grade superficial sarcoma that frequently presents as a red nodule or plaque. It is considered a superficial variant of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (formerly known as malignant fibrous histiocytoma). Although atypical fibroxanthomaÂ has similar histologic features to undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, it behaves less aggressively.
