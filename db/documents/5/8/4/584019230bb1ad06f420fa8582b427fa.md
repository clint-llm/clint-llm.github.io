Recurrent ankle sprains are a common condition, with effective treatment provided by podiatrists, orthopods, and physical therapists. The ability of the practitioner to assess and differentiate between functional and anatomical instability to the ankle joint post index sprain is imperative for proper treatment and good outcomes. Surgical and conservative therapies can be formulated appropriately when the patient has undergone a full assessment, including ankle anatomy (including subtalar instability), biomechanics, and overall pathology.
