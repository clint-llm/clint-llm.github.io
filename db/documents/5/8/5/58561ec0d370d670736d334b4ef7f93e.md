Dental infections that may have migrated to the surrounding facial tissues require an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, dentists, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. Pharmacists review antibiotic prescriptions and check for drug-drug interactions. They also educate the patient's about use, side effects, and the importance of compliance. Usually, patients with dental infections initially present to the emergency department, primary care provider, or urgent care. When systemic symptoms are consistent with a deep neck infection or osteomyelitis should be immediately identified and admitted to the hospital after stabilization. Initial stabilization should include IV antibiotics and close monitoring of the airway. Patients stable enough for outpatient treatment should get a referral to a dentist or other specialists like endodontists or oral and maxillofacial surgeons. Delay in treatment can worsen the dental infection and lead to tooth loss or spread of disease. [Level V]
