MAT is best managed by an interprofessional team, including cardiology nurses. In general, MAT is benign and usually resolved if the offending agent or disease is managed.Â  Therapies that have not been found to have a role in the treatment of multifocal atrial tachycardia include antiarrhythmics, cardioversion, or anticoagulation. Studies have found most cases of multifocal atrial tachycardia will resolve without specific antiarrhythmic therapy. Antiarrhythmics such as quinidine, procainamide, lidocaine, and phenytoin have yet to be proven successful. Furthermore, digitalis has also not been shown to have any benefit. Cardioversion has not been shown to be effective in converting to sinus rhythm and should not be used in the treatment of multifocal atrial tachycardia. While one study found 55% of patients with multifocal atrial tachycardia developed atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, current guidelines do not support the use of anticoagulation.
