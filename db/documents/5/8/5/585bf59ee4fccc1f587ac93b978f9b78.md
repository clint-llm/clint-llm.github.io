Cyclosporine is a widely used immunosuppressive drug, especially in transplant patients. The majority of patients on cyclosporine can be followed as outpatients by the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, internist, and specialist. The clinical staff must monitor cyclosporine levels regularly to prevent acute rejection, nephrotoxicity, and predictable dose-dependent adverse reactions.

Further, the pharmacist and nurse should educate the patient on potential complications of the drug and the need to follow up regularly. Pharmacists should verify dosing, and also, given the extensive drug-drug interaction list for cyclosporine, thorough medication reconciliation is in order, with any red flags reported promptly to the rest of the healthcare team. Nursing can monitor both for treatment effectiveness and the adverse effects of the medication, alerting the treating physician of any concerns. Finally, patients on cyclosporine are at a slight risk of lymphoproliferative malignancies and infections; thus, a thorough history and physical exam are vital at each clinic visit.

Cyclosporine therapy has a much higher opportunity for patient success with the communication and collaboration of an interprofessional healthcare team. [Level 5]
