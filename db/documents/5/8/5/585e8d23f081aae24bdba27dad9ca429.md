The management of an air leak is with an interprofessional team and includes a pulmonologist, thoracic surgeon, radiologist, respiratory therapist, and nurse. Air leaks often prolong hospital stay and patient morbidity. The nurse usually monitors patients with an air leak and should grade the air leak during each shift. At the same time, monitoring the patient's respiratory status, including oxygenation, is vital. Since many patients with an air leak are connected to wall suction, ambulation can be difficult. Hence, the nurse should ensure that the patient had compression stockings and prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis. Patients should also have a dietary consult to ensure that they are receiving adequate calories, which is important for healing. X-rays need to be ordered regularly to determine lung expansion, and the physicians need to be notified when these are done.

**Outcomes**

The prognosis of air leak or air leak syndrome is dependent on several factors, including:

- Male gender

- Use of steroids

- Large leak

- Leak with a pneumothorax

All the listed factors increase the risk of the persistence of an air leak.
