The female reproductive system is an intricate arrangement ofÂ structures that can separate into external and internal genitalia. The external genitalia comprises the structures outside of the true pelvis, including the labia majora and minora, vestibule, Bartholin glands, Skene glands, clitoris, mons pubis, perineum, urethral meatus, and periurethral area. The internal genitalia is the structures within the true pelvis, including the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, the latter being the focus of this article. It is vital for medical professionals, especially those in the field of obstetrics and gynecology, studying the female reproductive system to understand anatomy exclusive to females.
