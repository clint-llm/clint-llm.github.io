The lateral corticospinal tract is a very long structure. Damage to various vasculature may result in damage to the tract, depending on its location.

The primary motor cortex for the face and upper extremity receives its arterial supply from the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The primary motor cortex for the lower extremity receives its supply from the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). Damage to the lateral corticospinal tract here would result in contralateral motor deficits with UMN signs. An MCA occlusive lesion (stroke) will cause predominant face and arm weakness while an ACA occlusion will lead to lower extremity weakness. The corona radiata and internal capsule are supplied by the lenticulostriate arteries (branches of MCA). Occlusion of a lenticulostriate artery causing an ischemic infarction of the internal capsule (a lacunar infarct) will cause contralateral weakness of both the face, arm, and leg.
