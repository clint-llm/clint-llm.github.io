Generally, the majority of the PAES cases are due to the embryological anomalies while fewer patients have been documented having acquired (fibrous bands) causes for the PAES

- **Type I:**An aberrant medial course of the popliteal artery around aÂ normally positioned MHG

- **Type II:**MHG attaches abnormally and more laterally on the femur causing the popliteal artery to pass medially and inferiorly

- **Type III**: Abnormal fibrous band or accessory muscle arising from the medial or lateral condyle encircling the popliteal artery

- **Type IV:**Popliteal artery lying in its primitive deep or axial position within the fossa, becoming compromised by the popliteus muscle or fibrous bands

- **Type V:**The entrapment of both the popliteal artery and vein due to any of the causes mentioned above

- **Type VI:**The muscular hypertrophy, resulting in a functional compression of both the popliteal artery and vein

The functional PAES (Type VI or F) describes another subtype of the disease that is not due to inherited anatomic abnormalities

A more straightforward and practical classification system for the PAES was also introduced by Heidelberg et al.

- **Type 1:**The problem lies in the course of the popliteal artery

- **Type 2:**The muscular insertion is atypical

- **Type 3:**Both of the abovementioned conditions are present
