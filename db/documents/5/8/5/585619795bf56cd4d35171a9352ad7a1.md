According to indinavir overdose data, it was determined that 70% (46/66) overdoses were accidental.

To decrease the likelihood that a patient misinterprets dosing instructions or is unable to read or comprehend them, patients must receive adequate counsel from a pharmacist and/or clinician. Additionally, those responsible for the patient's care should adequately follow up with the patient to ensure that the patient is dosing indinavir correctly, as compliance is essential for effective treatment. Nurses with specialty training in HIV patient care can educate patients and their families about the importance of compliance and side effects. Since ineffective dosing and administration can lead to therapeutic failure, these collaborative strategies can significantly improve patient outcomes with indinavir therapy. A study concluded that an interprofessional approach using psychosocial training providers, such as social workers, health educators, and community outreach workers, in collaboration with primary care can enhance  HIV continuum services.
