ELISAs can be used in many settings, including rapid antibody screening tests for Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), detection of other viruses, bacteria, fungi, autoimmune diseases, food allergens, blood typing, presence of the pregnancy hormone hCG, laboratory and clinical research, forensic toxicology, and many other diagnostic settings.

In HIV testing, a blood or saliva specimen is collected for testing, typically using indirect ELISA-based tests.**,**Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), which commonly infects the skin of children and young adults, can be detected by ELISA testing.

ELISA has also been used to detect desmogleins 1 and 3 and bullous pemphigoid antigen 180 autoantibodies implicated in pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid autoimmune blistering diseases, respectively.
