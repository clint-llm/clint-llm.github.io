Cyclobenzaprine is FDA-approved as an adjunct to rest for the treatment of muscle spasms associated with acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions. Cyclobenzaprine is a part of a group of medications referred to as cyclical antidepressants. Cyclobenzaprine is a tricyclic amine salt that works in the central nervous system (CNS) as a depressant that reduces muscle hyperactivity. These cyclical antidepressants have roles in treating depression, neuropathic pain, migraine prophylaxis, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, and potential muscle relaxation properties. In addition, this activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of cyclobenzaprine for members of the interprofessional team who will potentially prescribe or encounter patients taking cyclobenzaprine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of cyclobenzaprine.
- Review the FDA-approved indications for cyclobenzaprine.
- Outline the important potential adverse events with cyclobenzaprine.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients for whom cyclobenzaprine is a therapeutic option.
