Sheehan syndrome occurs when the anterior pituitary gland is damaged due to significant blood loss. Classically, this happens after delivery, in which the mother loses a significant amount of blood. This blood loss results in the pituitary gland not being able to produce hormones. The diagnosis of Sheehan syndrome is not always apparent immediately after childbirth. Occasionally, the signs and symptoms of Sheehan syndrome may not present until months after childbirth or significant trauma. The first and most common symptom of Sheehan syndrome is the absence of lactation, also known as agalactorrhea. Other symptoms are associated with loss of pituitary gland hormone production and may include amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, hot flashes, and/or decreased sex drive. Symptoms of hypothyroidism such as fatigue, bradycardia, hypotension, weight gain, and constipation may occur months later, along with the loss of axillary and pubic hair. Adrenal insufficiency can also occur with symptoms of fatigue and weight loss. Laboratory values that may support secondary adrenal insufficiency due to Sheehan syndrome could include hyponatremia, anemia, and hypoglycemia.
