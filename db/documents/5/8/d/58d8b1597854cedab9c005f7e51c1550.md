**Surveillance for Patients withBRCA1 and BRCA2Â Mutations**

An increased level of monitoring is mandatory for all patients with known BRCA mutations. The NCCN guidelines are widely accepted in the management of patients with BRCA mutation. The main goal of monitoring is early detection of malignancy and high-risk premalignant lesions. Early detection begins with breast awareness and self-breast examination beginning at age 18 and annual or semiannual clinical breast examination at age 25 (though neither of these has shown to benefit survival)

Breast MRI increases sensitivity from approximately 33% to approximately 80% sensitivity in the detection of malignancy in patients with a familial or hereditary predisposition and has proven especially useful in this younger subset of patients. According to the NCCN guidelines, annual screening breast MRI with contrast is recommended annually from age 25 to 29 if available, or mammogram annually, if not. From age 30 to 75, annual mammogram and MRI of the breast with contrast is performed

The treatment is personalized for each patient who is found to have a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. This may include increased surveillance only, chemoprevention using tamoxifen or raloxifene, bilateral prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy and or bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. Bilateral prophylactic mastectomy reduces the risk of developing breast cancer by 90% to 95%
