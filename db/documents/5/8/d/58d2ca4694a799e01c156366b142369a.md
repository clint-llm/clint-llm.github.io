Mild AKI can often be managed on an outpatient basis. AKI, more often than not, is a co-existent problem for hospitalized patients. It is usually appropriate for these patients to be on the general medical floor unless they also have an electrolyte imbalance or significant volume overload, in which case, they may require a higher level of care. The most important issues to realize for clinicians dealing with AKI are adjusting the dose of any medications these patients are taking and avoiding nephrotoxic medications as much as possible. The other important factor to consider is an appropriate fluid challengeÂ whenever possible.
