H2 receptor blockers, or H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), are a class of gastric acid-suppressing agents frequently used in various gastric conditions. They are FDA-approved for short-term use in treating uncomplicated gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastric or duodenal ulcers, gastric hypersecretion, and mild to infrequent heartburn or indigestion. H2 receptor antagonists may also be used off-label for stress ulcer prophylaxis, esophagitis, gastritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or urticaria. These drugs are also sometimes included in a multidrug regimen for Helicobacter pylori eradication.

Although antacids are generally considered first-line agents for heartburn during pregnancy, H2 receptor antagonists are pregnancy category B with no known teratogenic effects and may be used if needed.

There are currently three FDA-approved H2RA agents for use in the United States available either over-the-counter (OTC) or by prescription only. Famotidine and cimetidine are available either OTC or by prescription, depending on the dose. Nizatidine is available by prescription only. Ranitidine was previously available but has been withdrawn in the United States and suspended in Europe and Australia for carcinogen contamination during manufacturing.
