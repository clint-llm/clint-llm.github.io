A detailed history and neurological examination are warranted due to the extensive myriad of diseases associated with epilepsia partialis continua (EPC).

Classically, EPC presents as a focal form of status epilepticus (SE) with a preserved consciousness that is restricted to one part of the body, occurring for one hour or more, recurrent, and associated with postictal confusion and weakness. Due to the complex nature of the disease, patients rarely fall into a single diagnostic criterion and, therefore, require a detailed history and physical examination to delineate the nature and possible causes of the seizures.

Neurological deficits are closely related to the nature and degree of severity of the underlying pathology. Motor deficits ranging from quadriparesis to subtle soft palate paresis may be noted. Sensory deficits, similarly, are variable but are less common compared to their motor counterparts. The involvement of the upper extremities is more common. Altered mentation may be seen in patients due to both****the associated inter/postictal confusion and the nature/severity of the underlying pathology.
