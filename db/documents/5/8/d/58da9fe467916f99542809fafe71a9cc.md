Transthoracic echocardiography is often the first study obtained. Findings consistent with a left ventricular false aneurysm include sharp discontinuity of endocardium into the aneurysm sac and an orifice-to false aneurysm diameter ratio of more than 0.5.

Angiography of the left ventricle and coronary arteries is the best diagnostic test for a false aneurysm.

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) can be used in the diagnosis and will demonstrate the absence of endocardium and myocardium along with the aneurysm. CMR is an effective test to assess myocardial function, contractility, tissue perfusion, and turbulent blood flow in the cardiac chambers and across the false aneurysm.

Computed tomography (CT) will depict the abrupt ending of the heart wall at the boundary of the aneurysm. CT is instrumental in redo cardiac surgeries as it offers higher quality noninvasive angiography of native coronary arteries and bypass grafts important in the surgical management of false aneurysm patients.

Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can show lesion location, dimensions, presence of thrombus, and involvement of other cardiac structures.

A chest x-ray can show an abnormal mediastinal contour with a bulge on the lateral or posterior aspect of the heart.

Electrocardiograms can depict vague variations and inversion of T waves in inferior or lateral leads.
