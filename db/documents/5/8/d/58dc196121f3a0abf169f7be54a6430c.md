Large amounts of intravenous fluids can cause hypervolemia and potentially electrolyte imbalance. In septic shock, overzealous use of intravenous fluids for a prolonged period can cumulatively increase the total body water, especially in patients with compromised renal, cardiac or hepatic function. This excess free water often accumulates in the extravascular lung (pulmonary edema) and subcutaneous tissues (pedal or sacral edema) and poses problems during recovery, for example, failure to wean from the ventilator and muscle weakness, both of which will cause prolongation of hospital stay and increase the associated risk of nosocomial complications. A 0.9% saline causes hyperchloremic acidosis following excess use and is associated with nephrotoxicity.
