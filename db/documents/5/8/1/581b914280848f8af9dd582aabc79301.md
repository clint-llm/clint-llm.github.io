Insulinoma is a type of functional neuroendocrine tumor (NET) that manifests with hypoglycemia caused by inappropriately high insulin secretion. It more commonly presents as a solitary benign tumor, but it can sometimes be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1). Patients with insulinoma have hypoglycemic episodes, more characteristically as fasting hypoglycemia. Insulinoma is usually diagnosed by biochemical testing when there is high clinical suspicion. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment choice. Localization with imaging studies is fundamental to characterize the tumor better before surgical resection. Other treatment options are also available depending on the stage and grade of the tumor.
