The neck has several important anatomical structures which include the carotid arteries bilaterally. While the injury to the carotid artery is not a common event, when it does occur, it is not usually an isolated arterial injury secondary to the proximity of other vital structures. Injury to the artery may be due to either penetrating or blunt trauma. When the trauma is penetrating, exsanguination and hematoma formation can quickly compromise the airway. When the carotid artery is injured bluntly, the sudden trauma usually initiates an intimal dissection and/or a hematoma formation. This activity reviews the causes, presentation, and diagnosis of carotid artery contusion and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the zone of the neck and structures injured during trauma.
- Review the symptoms of a patient with carotid artery contusion.
- Summarize the treatment options for carotid artery contusion.
- Explain the modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by carotid artery contusion.
