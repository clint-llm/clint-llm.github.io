Abdominal wall hematoma can occur from a variety of causes. The patient often presents with abdominal pain, which can be mistaken for a number of abdominal pathologies; hence an interprofessional approach to management is necessary. Nurses should be aware of and familiar with abdominal hematomas as they can occur from repeated heparin or insulin injections; they can consult with the pharmacy team to ensure proper dosing and no drug interactions that contribute to the condition. The diagnosis can be difficult to confirm clinically. Imaging studies are usually necessary. Most abdominal hematomas resolve spontaneously over 4 to 6 weeks. Nowadays, mortality rates from abdominal wall hematomas are negligible because of the availability of imaging studies. Patients who recover usually have no residual sequelae. These outcomes are made possible, as described above, by interprofessional teamwork and collaboration/communication, contributing to positive patient outcomes. [Level 5]
