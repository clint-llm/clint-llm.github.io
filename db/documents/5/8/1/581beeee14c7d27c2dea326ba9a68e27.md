Cytogenetic testing provides us with an opportunity to improve the management of congenital disorders, blood malignancies, and solid tumors. Parents can be counseled about expectations of a certain congenital disorder, review fetal and maternal risks, and even decide on the continuation of the pregnancy. The risks involved in the termination of a pregnancy are higher without an early cytogenetic diagnosis. Proper assistance for a child with a congenital disorder may include screening for cardiac defects, hearing, and vision assessments, and specialized education, which may not be adequately offered without a timely diagnosis.

Correct diagnosis, prognostic evaluation, and improved therapeutic options often require appropriate cytogenetic testing in acute leukemias and other forms of cancer. Broader availability of diagnostic tools is key for the advancement of cancer management and survivorship.
