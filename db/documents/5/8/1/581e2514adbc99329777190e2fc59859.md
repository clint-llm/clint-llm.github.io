The inguinal region is a relatively anatomically complex region. Amon the several clinically important structures, it contains the inguinal canal which will be the focus of this article. The inguinal canal is a passage in the lower anterior abdominal wall located just above the inguinal ligament. It starts from the internal inguinal orifice, extends medially and inferiorly through the abdominal wall layers and ends in the external inguinal orifice. This canal is about four to six centimeters in length. The length changes from over the growth period from the pediatric age to adulthood. It functions as a passageway for structures between the intra- and extra-abdominal structures. In males, it transmits the spermatic cord, gonadal vessels, and lymphatics. While in females, it transmits the round ligament of the uterus
