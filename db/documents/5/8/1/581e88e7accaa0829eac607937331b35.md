The key to the diagnosis is the identification of key risk factors and hallmark symptoms. The "classic" presentation is the immunocompromised patient, with rhinosinusal involvement, demonstrating a very rapid progression of infection, and the presence of tissue necrosis. If there is **any**suspicion, early endoscopic biopsy is warranted to avoid disaster potentially.

Depending on the degree of immunosuppression and predisposing conditions, the progression of the disease can be acute, fulminant, or chronic.

The identification of the exact species that cause mucormycosis is not straightforward due to the difficulty of isolating the fungus in culture media. However, regardless of the causative species and clinical presentation, therapeutic management is the same.
