Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) diagnosis relies on excluding the other differential diagnosis; thus, the healthcare providers should be aware of these differentials while making the final diagnosis. The following diseases encompass the most likely differential diagnosis:

- β-microglobulin amyloidosis

- Calciphylaxis

- Chronic graft vs. host disease

- Carcinoid syndrome

- Borreliosis

- Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans

- Lipodermatosclerosis

- Early cellulitis

- Early panniculitis

- Eosinophilic fasciitis

- Fibroblastic rheumatism

- Drug-induced fibrosis

- Radiation-induced fibrosis

- Scleroderma

- Scleromyxedema

- Phenylketonuria

- Porphyria cutanea tarda

- Superficial fibromatosis

It is essential to note that the history of GBCAs exposure during the MRI examination will favor NSF among the differential diagnosis.
