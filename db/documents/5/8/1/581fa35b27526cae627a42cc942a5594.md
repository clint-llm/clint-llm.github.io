The most common complications seen with sympathetic ophthalmia are cataract development and ocular hypertension leading to glaucoma.

However, final visual acuity depends on the extent of the patientâ€™s posterior segment disease. Ocular hypertension can occur in the setting of acute inflammation causing trabeculitis or in the chronic setting secondary to extensive peripheral anterior synechiae formation or pupillary block secondary to posterior synechiae.

Chronic serous retinal detachments can lead to subretinal fibrosis, which can severely compromise vision if the macula is involved. Compromised choroid and RPE can lead to choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which may require anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) intravitreal injections.
