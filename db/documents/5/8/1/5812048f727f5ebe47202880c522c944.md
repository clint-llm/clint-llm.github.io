The suprachiasmatic nucleus consists of two nuclei comprised ofÂ approximately 10000 neurons located on each side of the third ventricle, directly above the optic chiasm. The SCN divides into "core" and "shell" subregions, with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) in the retino-recipient core and arginine vasopressin (AVP)-expressing cells in the shell.

In the core subregion, VIP increases during the dark period, whereas GRP increases during the light period and is specifically activated by direct inputs from photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina via the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT).
