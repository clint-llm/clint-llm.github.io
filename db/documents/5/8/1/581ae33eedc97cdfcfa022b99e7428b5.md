PPS is not appropriate in certain conditions and contexts.

- Appropriate equipment for monitoring and resuscitation is not available.

- Operator training.Â  If the provider is not PALS certified or does not have the skill set required to secure an unstable airway, from intubation to emergent cricothyrotomy, PPS cannot be performed.

- The patient has known allergies or adverse reactions to medications used in PPS.

- The patient requires more than a brief painful procedure, necessitating general anesthesia in the operating room setting.

- At the time of the procedure, the patient's condition is high-risk ASA class III or higher and may be safer with management by an anesthesiologist or subspecialist.

- Published guidelines recommend a 2 hour fast for clear liquids, 4 hours for breast milk, and 6 hours for solid food before scheduled procedures. High risk of aspiration has been considered a contraindication in the past. Still, recent studies demonstrate no significantly increased risk of adverse events based on fasting times for unscheduled procedural sedation. Waiting for previously recommended fasting times can cause increased stress on pediatric patients and families in the emergent setting.
