Skin disorders linked to M. furfur are chronic and relapsing for susceptible individuals. Immunosuppressed patients have higher rates of recurrence. Specific environmental exposures may worsen or improve symptoms, as cold weather aggravates SD, and PV is seen more commonly during summer months. PV generally responds to topical treatment, though the pigment alteration after infection can take months to resolve.
