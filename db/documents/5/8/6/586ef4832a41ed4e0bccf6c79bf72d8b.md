Because the inferior hypogastric plexus is a paired structure, injury is a commonly known complication of pelvic surgeries. Damage to the plexus can lead to urinary dysfunction, specifically urinary incontinence. The bladder will be non-compliant with a fixed external sphincter tone. The integrity of the somatic and autonomic pelvic nerves is essential to maintaining normal sexual function and a normal micturition-continence cycle.
