Eye care providers must be able to detect conditions like optic atrophy and papilledema, as this may be the first opportunity to diagnose a much more severe disease. Clinicians who suspect FKS in a patient must immediately send for detailed brain scans to localize the location of the ICSOL.

The results of these scans can direct neurosurgeons on the best route of action. While clinicians tend to prefer surgery as first-line treatment, chemotherapy and radiotherapy have also shown promising results in some patients. As with all tumors, the risk of metastasis and multiple organ involvement is always possible. FKS patients must be appropriately counseled on management, treatment options, quality of life, the likely prognosis, risks of metastasis, and fatality of the disease.

Interprofessional teamwork involves clinicians and nursing staff, and when medical management is part of the picture, pharmacists are important in optimizing care for patients with FKS. ALl te4am members must be diligent in documenting their findings, monitoring patient progress, contributing from their area of expertise, and keeping all other interprofessional team members informed of any status changes so corrective action can be implemented if necessary. This interprofessional approach will yield the best possible outcomes. [Level 5]
