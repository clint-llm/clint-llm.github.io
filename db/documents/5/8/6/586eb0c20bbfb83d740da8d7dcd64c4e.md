In the United States, urinary discomfort is a common complaint in patients seeking medical attention. UTIs are one of the top 10 diagnoses made in emergency departments annually. Nearly half of all women will experience a UTI in their lifetime, and between 5% and 20% of non-hospitalized patients, the infection will be due to S. saprophyticus. Despite highly successful treatment rates, up to 60% of all patients will experience a recurrent UTI within one year.
