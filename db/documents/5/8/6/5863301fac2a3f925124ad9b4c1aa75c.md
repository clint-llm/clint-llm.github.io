Cephalosporins are contraindicated in patients with a known allergy to the cephalosporin group of antibiotics. Nevertheless, an allergy to a cephalosporin in one class may not induce any cross-reactivity to another agent within the same or different class/generation.

Ceftriaxone has the affinity for binding to albumin by replacing bilirubin and is contraindicated in jaundiced neonates at risk for bilirubin encephalopathy.

Although not contraindicated, considerable attention is necessary while using cephalosporins and warfarin, as this combination correlates with an increased risk of bleeding.

Use in pregnancy and lactating mothers: Because third-generation cephalosporins are pregnancy category B medications under the prior FDA rating system, they are not contraindicated in pregnancy. Compared with cephalosporins of the first and second generations, the third-generation drugs have significantly lower oral bioavailability, and all members of this group are believed compatible with breastfeeding.
