Using light microscopy to observe the histology of alveoli sections, type I pneumocytes are visible, occupying a majority of each alveolus. These cells are flattened and squamous.

Occasionally within the alveoli, one can typically see type II pneumocytes. They are not as abundant within the alveoli. These cells are large and cuboidal or round and mostly concentrated in the alveoli septum. Granules containing surfactant are visible within the cytoplasm.

The visual examination also reveals alveolar macrophages within the lumen of the alveoli. These cells are round and can be larger than type II pneumocytes. They have an indented nucleus with granules within their cytoplasm.
