High doses of ranolazine can cause dose-dependent increases in dizziness, tremor, dysphagia, hallucinations, unsteady gait, nausea, and vomiting. Supportive therapy should be given in cases of overdose. ECG monitoring may be necessary if a ranolazine overdose occurs. Ranolazine is about 62% bound to plasma proteins, so hemodialysis will not effectively clear it in case of an overdose.
