The differential diagnosis of diaper dermatitis includes any skin condition that can present around the diaper area.

- Seborrheic dermatitis usually presents in the first month of life. Characterized by skin erythema and scaling, that begins in the scalp and distributes to the face. It has the potential to spread to the diaper area, making babies more susceptible to the development of irritant diaper dermatitis.

- Atopic dermatitis usually presents between 3 and 12 months of age. The presentation includes extreme pruritus with dryness and erythema. Lesions typically involve skin flexures. The diaper area is generally spared.

- Allergic contact dermatitis, secondary to reactions to fragrances or preservatives. It usually occurs after the introduction of a new skin product, and it involves any part of the skin where the product was applied.

Other differential diagnoses that need to be taken into consideration include tinea cruris, scabies, acrodermatitis enteropathica, biotin deficiency, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Letterer-Siwe disease),Â congenital syphilis, Kawasaki disease, and HIV infection.
