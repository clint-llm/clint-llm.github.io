Cutaneous melanoma is the fifth most common cancer diagnosis in the United States, and the incidence continues to increase with a projected 110000 new cases in the year 2030 compared to around 65000 new cases in 2011.

Evidence-based clinical guidelines from different professional societies are available to aid in the accurate diagnosis and management of malignant melanoma. In this article, we review the staging of cutaneous malignant melanoma and provide a summary of the clinical guidelines from the American Association of Dermatology (AAD), European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and Cancer Council Australia for the management of cutaneous malignant melanoma.

All the clinical guidelines adopt clinical staging based on the eighth edition of Tumor, Node, Metastases (TNM) staging of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).
