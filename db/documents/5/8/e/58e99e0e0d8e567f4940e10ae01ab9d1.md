- Taking a careful history and quantifying the burning pain.

- Examining oral mucosa to rule out local and systemic causes of oral pain.

- Asking for information about psychological well-being.

- Measuring salivary rate and taste function with objective methods.

- Performing neurological examination and imaging to rule out degenerative disorders or other neurological pathologies.

- Taking oral cultures to rule out suspected bacterial, fungal, or viral infections.

- Performing allergy patch tests for allergic patients.

- Investigating for gastric reflux disease.

- Ruling out hormonal, autoimmune, and nutritional anomalies.

It is worth noting that if the tongue looks normal during the examination, no biopsy is required - it is only indicated when a lesion is seen.
