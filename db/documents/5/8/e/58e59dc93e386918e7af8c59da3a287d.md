Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) covers a group of autosomal recessive disorders caused by a deficiency of one of the enzymes required for steroid biosynthesis (cortisol, aldosterone, or both) in the adrenal glands. The most common cause of CAH is a 21-hydroxylase deficiency due to mutations or deletions of CYP21A, which accounts for more than 90% of CAH cases. On the other hand, a 17-hydroxylase deficiency is a rare cause of CAH, accounting for approximately 1% of cases. This activity reviews the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and treatment of 17-hydroxylase deficiency and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of 17-hydroxylase deficiency.
- Summarize the management of 17-hydroxylase deficiency.
- Outline the clinical presentation of a patient with 17-hydroxylase deficiency.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by 17-hydroxylase deficiency.
