Infants with tense or high muscle tone are not good candidates for the Kernig test. The test is also unreliable for very lethargic, paraplegic, or comatose patients because these individuals may not have obvious meningeal signs. Further, there is no correlation between the Kernig sign and the severity of meningeal inflammation. Therefore, it should be avoided in patients with leg, knee, or hip injuries.
