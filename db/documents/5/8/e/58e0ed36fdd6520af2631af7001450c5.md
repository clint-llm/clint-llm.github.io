Pars defects (spondylolysis) subdivide into five categories according to the Wiltse-Newman Classification

- **Dysplastic**: congenital abnormalities/attenuated pars (approximately 20%)

- **Isthmic:**lesions in the pars resulting from a stress fracture or acute fractures (approximately 50%)

- 
              
- **Type II-A:**pars fatigue fracture
              
              
- **Type II-B**: pars elongation due to a healed fracture
              
              
- **Type II-C**: pars acute fracture

- **Degenerative**: degeneration of the intervertebral discs that results in segmental instability and alterations of the articular processes

- **Traumatic**: an acute fracture that results in fractures to various regions of the neural arch

- **Pathological**: bone disease such as tumors and infections that result in lesions to the pars

Classification of spondylolisthesis is according to the Meyerding Classification.

- Grade I less than 25%

- Grade II 25 to 50%

- Grade III 50 to 75%

- Grade IV 75 to 100%

- Grade V greater than 100% (spondyloptosis)
