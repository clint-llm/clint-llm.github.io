Clinicians use cystoscopy to examine the urinary bladder mucosa for pathologic lesions, which may be diagnosed via biopsy sampling. Benign lesions include von Brunn’s nests. These islands or nests of the urothelium are separated from the luminal surface and consequently found within the lamina propria. Von Brunn’s nests of benign urothelium may undergo degeneration to form cysts (cystitis cystica).

After prostate cancer, the second most common type of malignancy in the genitourinary tract is bladder cancer. Urothelial carcinomas are the most frequently diagnosed type of bladder cancer and are graded based on their depth of invasion into the bladder wall. Clinically 75%-85% of urothelial carcinomas are superficial, and 15%-25% of the cases are invasive and metastatic at the time of initial diagnosis.
