**Radiologic Imaging**

Diagnostic imaging is a practical method for evaluating a blind loop. Applicable radiologic studies include x-rays, computerized tomography (CT) scans, barium series, and CT enterography. Although abdominal films and CT scans are simple and cost-effective modalities, they have limited utility in the context of this syndrome. Accordingly, evidence of obstruction or dilatation on X-ray/CT should prompt further workup when BLS is suspected.

Barium studies are beneficial as they provide added information concerning the structure and motility of the bowel. In addition to assessing transit time, they can detect aberrations like jejunal diverticula, intestinal strictures, and fistulas. Ultimately, CT enterography is the superior test for identifying mechanical causes of overgrowth. Although similar to the barium series, it is more sensitive and provides greater detail.

**Breath Tests and Cultures**

If there is high clinical suspicion for blind loop syndrome, it is valid to consider ordering additional testing. A sensible workup may include any of the following: a qualitative fecal fat test, hydrogen breath test, D-xylose absorption test, bile acid breath test, or small bowel aspiration.

Initially, testing for fecal fat is an appropriate first step, as it can confirm the presence of malabsorption; otherwise, it has limited diagnostic relevance in this condition. Next, the hydrogen breath test and its more accurate counterpart, the D-xylose absorption test, are applicable for detecting the presence of bacterial overgrowth. However, neither are notably useful for expressly identifying blind loop syndrome.

Alternatively, the bile acid breath test is more specific, assessing for both bacterial overgrowth and bile acid malabsorption. Overall, it is a simple and effective test.

**The Schilling Test**

Of note, the Schilling test was once widely used to confirm the presence of a blind loop. In this test, medical professionals would assess for urinary cobalamin. Excretory patterns mirrored that of pernicious anemia but would correct with the addition of antibiotics. Regardless of its benefit in BLS, most medical centers have deemed this test obsolete, and no substitute exists.
