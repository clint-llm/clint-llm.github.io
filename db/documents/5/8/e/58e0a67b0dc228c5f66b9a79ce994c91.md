Hyperammonemia is itself a condition that may result from a multitude of disorders, as described above. Laboratory and radiological investigations should be done to rule out CNS diseases with clinical findings resembling those seen in hyperammonemia. Examples include meningitis and sepsis in neonates and meningitis, encephalitis, brain tumors, and pseudotumor cerebri in adults.

Multiple disorders can present with hyperammonemia like picture but with ammonia levels within a normal range. Disorders of carbohydrate metabolism present with hypoglycemia and hyperuricemia. Ataxia, with genetic and biochemical defects, is caused by various hereditary defects affecting the CNS at multiple levels. Developmental delay and neuronal regression are frequently seen. Methylmalonic acidemia, an inherited disorder of amino acid metabolism with encephalopathy and stroke as a common presentation. Stroke is not seen in patients of hyperammonemia. Homocystinuria is a disorder of methionine metabolism that presents with features of stroke, ectopia lentis, and marfanoid habitus. Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, diffuse hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and seizure disorders may present with neuroimaging findings similar to that of hyperammonemia but occur due to other causes and usually do not have raised levels of ammonia.
