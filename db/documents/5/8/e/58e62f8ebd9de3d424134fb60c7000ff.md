Poikilocytosis is the term used for abnormal-shaped red blood cells (RBCs) in the blood. Normal RBCs (also called erythrocytes) are typically disk-shaped, are thinner in the middle than in the edges, with a diameter of 6.2 to 8.2 micrometers, a thickness at the thickest point of 2 to 2.5 micrometers, and a thickness in the center of 0.8 to 1 micrometers. Poikilocytosis generally refers to an increase in abnormal-shaped red blood cells that make up 10% or more of the total red blood cells. Poikilocytes may be flat, elongated, teardrop, or crescent-shaped, or they may have point-like or thorn-like projections or may have any other abnormal feature. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of poikilocytosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of poikilocytosis.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of common causes of poikilocytosis.
- Review the management options available for different types of medical conditions associated with poikilocytosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care of patients with poikilocytosis and improve patient outcomes.
