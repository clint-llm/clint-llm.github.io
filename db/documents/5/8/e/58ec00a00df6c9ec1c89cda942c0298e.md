Patients with rosacea are usually seen by primary care physicians initially, where first-line therapy can be initiated. Since early recognition and treatment may help prevent disfigurement, any patient with an uncertain diagnosis or lack of response to therapy should be referred to a dermatologist. Screening for ocular symptoms should be performed in all rosacea patients, and referral to an ophthalmologist should be considered with any ocular symptoms.
