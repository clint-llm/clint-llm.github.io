Rheumatic heart disease has a variety of clinical manifestations including myocarditis, decompensated congestive heart failure, arrhythmias (i.e., atrial fibrillation), and valvular heart disease.

Myocarditis can result in conduction disturbances in the heart. Therefore, an electrocardiogram (EKG) is necessary. An EKG can show varying forms of heart block including first-degree, second-degree, or third-degree AV block.

A chest x-ray should be completed to evaluate for cardiomegaly or pulmonary vascular congestion, which can be signs of congestive heart failure.

A transthoracic echocardiogram is more sensitive and specific than auscultation during the physical examination for detection of rheumatic heart disease. Rheumatic heart disease seen on transthoracic echo without evidence of a murmur on auscultation is referred to as “subclinical rheumatic heart disease.”

Mitral regurgitation is the most common presentation of rheumatic heart disease in young people. However, rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of mitral stenosis worldwide.

In 2012, the World Heart Federation released criteria for echocardiographic diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease. The criteria are dependent on age and are broken down into older or younger than 20 years old.

**Echocardiographic Criteria for Individuals Aged Less Than or Equal to 20 Years Old**

**Definite Rheumatic Heart Disease (either A, B, C, or D)**

A: Pathological mitral regurgitation and at least two morphological features of rheumatic heart disease of the mitral valve

B: Mitral stenosis mean gradient greater than or equal to 4 mmHg

C: Pathological aortic regurgitation and at least two morphological features of rheumatic heart disease of the aortic valve

D: Borderline disease of both the aortic valve and mitral valve

**Borderline Rheumatic Heart Disease (either A, B, or C)**

A: At least two morphological features of rheumatic heart disease of the mitral valve without pathological mitral regurgitation or mitral stenosis

B: Pathological mitral regurgitation

C: Pathological aortic regurgitation

**Normal Echocardiographic Findings (all four)**

- Mitral regurgitation not meeting all four Doppler echocardiographic criteria (physiological mitral regurgitation)

- Aortic regurgitation not meeting all four Doppler echocardiographic criteria (physiological aortic regurgitation)

- An isolated morphological feature of rheumatic heart disease of the mitral valve (for example, valvular thickening) without any associated pathological stenosis or regurgitation

- The morphological features of rheumatic heart disease of the aortic valve (for example, valvular thickening) without any associated pathological stenosis or regurgitation

**Echocardiographic Criteria for Individuals Aged Greater than 20 Years Old**

**Definite Rheumatic Heart Disease (any one of the four)**

- Pathological mitral regurgitation and at least two morphological features of rheumatic heart disease of the mitral valve

- Mitral stenosis mean gradient greater than or equal to 4 mmHg

- Pathological aortic regurgitation and at least two morphological features of rheumatic heart disease of the aortic valve, only in individuals aged less than 35 years

- Pathological aortic regurgitation and at least two morphological features of rheumatic heart disease of the mitral valve

**Morphological Features of Rheumatic Heart Disease**

**Mitral Valve**

- Anterior mitral valve leaflet thickening greater than or equal to 3 mm (age-specific)

- Chordal thickening

- Restricted leaflet motion

- Excessive leaflet tip motion during systole

**Aortic Valve**

- Irregular or focal thickening

- Coaptation defect

- Restricted leaflet motion

- Prolapse

**Pathologic Mitral Regurgitation (All four Doppler criteria must be met)**

- Seen on two views

- On at least one view jet length greater than or equal to 2 cm

- Peak velocity of greater than or equal to 3 meters/second

- Pansystolic jet in at least one envelope

**Pathologic Aortic Regurgitation (All four Doppler criteria must be met)**

- Seen on two views

- On at least one view jet length greater than or equal to 1 cm

- Peak velocity greater than or equal to 3 meters/second

- Pandiastolic jet in at least one envelope
