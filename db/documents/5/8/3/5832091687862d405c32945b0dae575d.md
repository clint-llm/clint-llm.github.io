Diagnosis of the etiology is essential, as the treatments for exudative and transudative etiologies differ significantly. Exudative effusions almost always require a further investigative workup, which may include cytopathology studies, biopsy, or even an emergent thoracotomy. Attempts should be made to determine the etiology of a patient with an exudative effusion. Conversely, transudative effusions usually do not require treatment, and therapy should be directed toward the underlying heart failure or cirrhosis. Malignant pleural effusion is common and denotes a poor prognosis. Dyspnea and a unilateral, large pleural effusion are the typical presentations of malignant pleural effusion. CT and ultrasound can help differentiate between benign and malignant pleural effusion.

Management of pleural effusion should be as follows:

- Diagnostic or therapeutic thoracentesis or chest tube drainage

- Obtain pleural fluid and serum studies of protein and LDH

- If indicated consider additional pleural fluid studies such as cell count, differential, cultures, or triglycerides

- Evaluate fluid using the Light criteria to determine if it is exudative

- Narrow differential diagnosis based on whether transudative or exudative
