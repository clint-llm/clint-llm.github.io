Treatment centers on improving quality of life, avoiding the complications of hereditary spherocytosis, and treating them appropriately when present. For pediatric population hemoglobin is generally kept above 7 to 8g/dL; however, for newborns, there is no clear consensus regarding hemoglobin threshold to transfuse red blood cells. The decision to transfuse neonates focuses on their hemodynamic stability and degree of hemolysis.

A previous study showed that erythropoietin treatment was beneficial for most infants with hereditary spherocytosis to increase hemoglobin levels and possibly decrease the need for red blood cell transfusion.

Neonates with hyperbilirubinemia due to hereditary spherocytosis should be promptly treated to avoid kernicterus.

Splenectomy largely improves symptomatology in most patients as the spleen is the principal organ where erythrocyte destruction takes place. However, while most patients show a positive outcome after surgical excision of the spleen, a study showed that clinical response to splenectomy correlates with the degree of spectrin deficiency.

Due to the increase in erythropoietic activity compensating for hemolysis, patients with hereditary spherocytosis have increased consumption of folate. For this reason, adequate supplementation is necessary, particularly in patients with moderate to severe disease.
