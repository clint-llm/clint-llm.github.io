McArdle disease typically results from mutations involving the muscle-specific isoform of the glycogen phosphorylase enzyme (abbreviated as PGYM). This enzyme plays a key role in the first step of glycogenolysis that releases glucose-1-phosphate monomers in muscle fibers. As a result, the carbohydrate metabolism of the skeletal muscle is affected, and energy cannot be generated from the glycogen stores of muscles. The genetic mutations of the PYGM gene on 11q13 make the enzyme inactive.

From the study of the genetics of McArdle disease, 179 variants have been identified that together affect the PYGM gene. Missense mutations have been found to be the commonest variants in European and US White populations (around 60% of all mutations). It has been reported that the majority of the patients do not have myophosphorylase, regardless of the type of mutation, such as missense, nonsense, insertion, deletion, and splicing.
