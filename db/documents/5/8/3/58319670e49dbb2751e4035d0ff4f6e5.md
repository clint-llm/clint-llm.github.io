**Hyperthyroidism**

Hyperthyroidism is a condition characterized by excessive secretion of thyroid hormones. A variety of medical conditions lead to hyperthyroidism, including Graves' disease, thyroid neoplasm, thyroid adenomas, excess TSH secretion, or exogenous T3 or T4 administration. Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include increased basal metabolic rate, weight loss, increased appetite, sweating, tremors, heat sensitivity, irritability, diarrhea, and insomnia. In primary hyperthyroidism, as in the case of a thyroid adenoma, TSH levels tend to decrease due to negative feedback inhibition exerted on the anterior pituitary by T3 and T4. In secondary hyperthyroidism, as in the case of a TSH or TRH secreting tumor, both TSH and T3/T4 levels increase.

**Hypothyroidism**

Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland fails to produce thyroid hormone in sufficient amounts. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto thyroiditis, which is a condition caused by autoantibodies that attack thyroid follicular cells leading to decreased thyroid hormone synthesis. Other common causes of hypothyroidism include radiation therapy, thyroid surgery, overtreatment with anti-thyroid medications, congenital hypothyroidism, iodine deficiency, or pituitary tumors. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include decreased basal metabolic rate, weight gain despite the decreased appetite, cold sensitivity, decreased cardiac output, hypoventilation, lethargy and mental slowness, drooping eyelids, myxedema, growth retardation, mental retardation in perinatal patients, and goiter. In primary hypothyroidism, as in the case of Hashimoto thyroiditis, TSH levels increase due to loss of negative feedback inhibition. In secondary hypothyroidism, as in the case of a benign pituitary gland tumor, TSH levels go down. Treatment for hypothyroidism includes thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

**TSH and Estrogen**

Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) binds most T3/T4 in the blood. A small portion of thyroid hormones circulate freely in the blood and constitute the physiologically active form. Estrogen increases the synthesis and decreases the clearance of thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG). Therefore, excess estrogen states, such as pregnancy or the use of oral contraceptives, cause TBG levels to increase. An increase in binding activity (increased TBG) initially lowers the concentration of the free hormone. However, an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis quickly normalizes free hormone levels and restores homeostasis. As such, TSH and free T3/T4 levels remain normal while Total T3/T4 increases. In contrast, patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism rely on exogenous thyroid hormone (levothyroxine) to maintain adequate free T3/T4 levels. As such, they fail to respond appropriately to a drop in free thyroid hormone levels. Therefore, an increase in TBG in those patients would cause a decrease in free T3/T4. The loss of negative feedback inhibition on the pituitary causes TSH levels to go up. Those patients require an increase in levothyroxine dosage to maintain euthyroidism.
