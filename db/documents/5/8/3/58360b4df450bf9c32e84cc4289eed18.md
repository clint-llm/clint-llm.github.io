Macroscopically, CTE is characterized by diffuse atrophy of the brain including the cerebral cortex, mammillary bodies, corpus callosum, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum. There is also ventricular dilation, fenestrated cavum septum pellucidum, as well as pallor of the locus coeruleus and substantia nigra. Histologically, there are tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles and astrocytic tangles preferentially deposited in the sulcal depths, periventricular areas, superficial cortex, around small vessels, and in subpial areas. It is this characteristic distribution that enables CTE to be distinguished histopathologically from other tauopathies.
