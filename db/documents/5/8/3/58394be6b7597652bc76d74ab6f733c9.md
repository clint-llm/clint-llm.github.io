Histological and cytological studies of the heart are necessary for diagnostic purposes, assessment of allograft rejection after a cardiac transplant, or evaluation of the effect of drug toxicity on the heart. An endomyocardial biopsy obtains cardiac tissue to be analyzed.

During an endomyocardial biopsy procedure, 1 to 2 mm3 of endocardium and myocardium are taken from the right ventricle.

Depending on the purpose of the endomyocardial biopsy, the method to prepare the tissue may vary. For instance, if viral myocarditis is on the differential, a frozen sample is needed for the identification of the virus through a polymerase chain reaction.
