For most patients with good performance status who are symptomatic, malignant pleural effusion re-accumulates rapidly (e.g., less than one month), we suggest drainage via an indwelling pleural catheter or chemical pleurodesis by the catheter or by either thoracoscopy or pleuroscopy, rather than repeat therapeutic thoracentesis.
