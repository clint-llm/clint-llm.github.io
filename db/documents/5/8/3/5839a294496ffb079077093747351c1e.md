Successful PAB often results in significant improvement in cardiac hemodynamics, resolution of signs/symptoms of congestive heart failure, improvement in pulmonary over circulation, and reduction in ventricular end-diastolic volume. The mortality rate among patients undergoing PAB is more reflective of the complexity of underlying congenital heart defects rather than the procedure itself. The patients who often undergo PAB in preparation for a staged surgical repair may have been considered high risk for a definitive repair. Therefore, early studies reported approximately 25% mortality with PAB.
