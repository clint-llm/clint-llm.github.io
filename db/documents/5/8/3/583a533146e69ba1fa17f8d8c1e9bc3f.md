Sympathectomy is the most common surgical treatment used to fix severe hyperhidrosis. Hyperhidrosis is a condition that results in excessive sweating in specific areas of the body, such as the face, hands, and armpits. Several studies have explored the effects of ramicotomy in treating hyperhidrosis. One of the main side effects of both sympathectomy and ramicotomy involves compensatory hyperhidrosis, which is the compensatory sweating in other large areas of the body. Compensatory sweating is typically the chief post-operative patient complaints.

Severe axillary hyperhidrosis, palmar hyperhidrosis, and craniofacial hyperhidrosis have received treatment with ramicotomy. In all types of hyperhidrosis, selective ramicotomy of the upper thoracic region has shown an improvement in the quality of life and reduced focal sweating. Some instances showed that ramicotomy often resulted in a lowered rate of compensatory sweating, while other cases displayed an increased rate of compensatory sweating. Post-operative compensatory hyperhidrosis due toÂ ramicotomy for the treatment of severe hyperhidrosis can display a wide range of severity.
