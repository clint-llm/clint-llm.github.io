Cherry hemangiomas are the most common type of acquired vascular proliferation of the skin and are diagnosed clinically by appearance.

Although these lesions are most often asymptomatic, theyÂ may bleed with trauma, and patients may want to remove the lesion for either cosmetic reasons or for prevention of bleeding following trauma. The involvement of a provider capable of electrocauterization, shave excision, cryotherapy, CO2 laser therapy, curettage, pulsed dye laser, or intense pulsed light is warranted.
