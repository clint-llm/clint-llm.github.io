Prognosis depends on the severity of the presentation. Senthil et al., in their study, found 51% of patients had glaucoma among eyes with microspherophakia. Success rates following trabeculectomy were reported as 86% following trabeculectomy till six months of follow up and 77% till one year. These results were the same till seven years of the follow-up period. Blindness was reported as high as in 20% of eyes at the time of presentation, and up to 30% of eyes till last follow up.

Senthil et al., in another study, reported outcomes following trabeculectomy in 29 eyes of 18 patients with microspherophakia. They reported the probability of complete success in 96% at one year and 88% at two years of follow-up. These results were maintained till a follow-up period of 7 years.et al. reported trabeculectomy in one eye, which required lensectomy, vitrectomy with a scleral fixated intraocular lens, and Molteno tube shunt implant for the management of persistent flat anterior chamber following trabeculectomy.

Another study by Garudadri et al. on 61 eyes with microspherophakia reported that 12 needed laser iridotomy and 40 eyes needed surgical intervention in the form of trabeculectomy, lensectomy, or drainage procedures. Twenty eyes (16%) were blind due to glaucoma.
