The mechanism of action of the inhalational agents is still unclear. Inhalational anesthetics are thought to work via interaction with different ion channels present throughout the central and peripheral nervous system by blocking excitatory channels and enhancing the activity of inhibitory channels. Other proposed mechanisms are that these agents work by affecting the membrane bilayer. The structure of desflurane is similar to that of isoflurane except for the addition of a fluorine atom. This addition changes the physical properties of desflurane compared to other inhalational agents. The vapor pressure of desflurane at 20 degrees Celsius is 681 mm Hg, with a boiling point of 22.8 degrees Celsius. Desflurane requires the use of a temperature-controlled, pressure-regulated vaporizer, as opposed to a variable bypass vaporizer. The molecular weight of desflurane is 168 grams, and a very small percentage of the anesthetic is metabolized by the body compared to other inhalational agents.
