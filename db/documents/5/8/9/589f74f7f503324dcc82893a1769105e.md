Abdominoperineal resection is a procedure for low rectal cancers, resulting in a permanent colostomy after removing the distal colon, rectum, and anal sphincter complex. This activity examines a brief history of abdominoperineal resection and the important anatomical and operative steps involved, focusing on common complications and the role of the interdisciplinary team in the management of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for abdominoperineal resection.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and techniques required for abdominoperineal resection.
- Explain the potential complications of an abdominoperineal resection.
- Outline the interprofessional team strategies for improving the care of patients receiving abdominoperineal resection in the pre-op, intra-op, and post-op settings.
