**Imaging**

If a forearm fracture and dislocation are suspected, radiographs are warranted. An anteroposterior and lateral view will usually identify the injury. An additional oblique view may help better classify the injury. Additional radiographs of the distal wrist and proximal elbow should be obtained with any suspicion of coexistent injury.

If a distal to mid-shaft radial fracture is seen on the radiograph, close examination of the DRUJ is merited. Signs of DRUJ disruption include:

- Widening of the DRUJ on the PA view

- Ulnar styloid fracture

- Displacement of the ulna dorsally on the lateral view

- Radial shortening greater than 5 mm (would need to compare with unaffected limb)

Usually, advanced imaging is not needed for initial assessment. For pre-operative planning, a CT scan may be used to evaluate for non-union, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help evaluate for TFCC tears and interosseous membrane disruption.
