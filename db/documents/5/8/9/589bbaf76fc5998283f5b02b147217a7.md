Acute allergic dermatitis is caused by contact with bruised or broken parts of plants within the Toxicodendron species. Urushiol is the primary inciting compound causing the release of local cytokines and inflammatory mediators that initiate the process of sensitization. The compound is rapidly absorbed due to its lipophilic nature and picked up by Langerhans cells in the epidermis, making additional efforts to wash or remove the compound ineffective after absorption.
