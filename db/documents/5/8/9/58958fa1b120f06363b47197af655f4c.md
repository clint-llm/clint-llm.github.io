Working with a familiar multi-disciplinary theatre team that has operation awareness, appreciates the nuances of the procedure - the human factors - and knows the surgeon's preferences makes a tremendous difference.

Many, if not all, surgeons will elect to perform brachioplasty amongst other body contouring operations with staff known to them who are familiar with the operation. It enhances patient safety, reduces surgeon stress, and has better camaraderie in the workplace. At a minimum, there will be a surgeon, an anesthetic provider (whether the procedure is performed under general anesthesia or with conscious sedation), and an operative/circulator nurse. Additionally, there may be a scrub nurse or technician and a surgical assistant or co-surgeon.
