While less common than chalazion, neoplasms must be considered, particularly in recurrent chalazia in the elderly. Carcinoma such as a sebaceous cell, basal cell, and squamous cell must be ruled out by biopsy if there is a clinical concern. Infectious etiologies such as blepharitis, dacryocystitis, herpes zoster, herpes simplex, molluscum contagiosum, Leishmaniasis, and cellulitis should be considered and treated when appropriate. Benign lesions such as papillomas, hordeolum, juvenile xanthogranuloma, and xanthelasma should be considered if appearance is not typical for chalazia.
