Genetic research has found this disease of osteoclastic dysfunction to have an association with at least 8 gene mutations.

Six of these eight genes are associated with a malignant, autosomal recessive form of the disease. Loss of function mutations in TCIRG1, CLCN7, OSTM1, PLEKHM1, AND SNX10 lead to an osteoclast rich version of autosomal recessive osteopetrosis. In this version, osteoclasts are plentiful. However, the osteoclasts that are present are unable to resorb bone due to defective ruffled border formation effectively. Loss of function mutations in TNFSF11 and TNFRSF11A lead to disrupted osteoclast development and a condition of osteoclast poor osteopetrosis.

Intermediate autosomal recessive osteopetrosis is the result of a loss of function mutation in CAII, the gene responsible for the production of the carbonic anhydrase II protein.

Autosomal dominant osteopetrosis is the result of the dysfunction of chloride channel 7 secondary to a dominant-negative mutation of CLCN7.
