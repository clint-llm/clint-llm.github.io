Development of psychomotor, social, educational, and communication skillsÂ is inhibited with persistence or re-emergence of primitive reflexes demonstrated in patients with brain damages, such as cerebral palsy or stroke. Several studies discussed strong predictive properties of retained spontaneous (not evoked) ATNR in infants with high perinatal risk factors for cerebral palsy and developmental disorders with increasing age. More severe primitive reflex patterns resulted in more developmental retardation. However, the criteria for the presence and absence of primitive reflexes and their corresponding predictive abnormality are age-dependent, as a whole.
