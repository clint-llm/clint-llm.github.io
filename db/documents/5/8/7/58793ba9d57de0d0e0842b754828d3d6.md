The glenohumeral joint of the shoulder is the most commonly dislocated joint in the body and accounts for approximately 50% of all major dislocations seen in the emergency department. Most shoulder dislocations are anterior, and inferior shoulder dislocations occur are much lower frequencies. Inferior dislocations are generally not difficult to diagnose as the classic presentation is not subtle and can often be made from the doorway of an exam room. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of inferior shoulder dislocations and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of inferior shoulder dislocations.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with an inferior shoulder dislocation.
- List the treatment and management options available for inferior shoulder dislocations.
- Explain the importance of enhancing care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to optimize outcomes for patients with inferior shoulder dislocations.
