The prevalence of child abuse and neglect varies widely. Available estimates suggest that as much as a quarter of the world adult population may have experienced some form of abuse or neglect during childhood with a slightly higher incidence in female subjects.

These values may not truly represent the actual incidence due to under-reporting.

Abuse of the elderly is equally common. In the United States of America,Â 1 in 10 people older than the age of 60 may have experienced some form of abuse, amounting to about 5 million cases per year.
