Mortality at the time of injury is observed in 25%Â to 40% of patients.

Most of the survivors are usually neurologically intact. However, this can harbinger the risk of instability at the atlantoaxial region and spinal cord injury, causing Brown-Sequard syndrome, spinal Cord transection, cruciate paralysis, myelopathy, and persistent disabling neck pain in around 25% of patients.

There can be concurrent injuries associated with and complicating the odontoid fractures, which include:

- Anterior cervical wedge fracture

- Atlanto occipital dissociation

- Cervical burst fracture

- Cervical facet dislocation

- Cervical spinous process fracture

- Extension cervical teardrop fracture

- Flexion cervical teardrop fracture

- Hangman's fracture

- Isolated transverse process fractures, and

- Jefferson fracture
