In first-generation antipsychotic medications, the postsynaptic blockade of dopamine D2 receptors in the mesolimbic system of the central nervous system (CNS) is the mechanism of action. Evidence suggests strong antagonism of D2 receptors in both striatal and cortical areas, a higher association between D2 receptor binding and its potency, and a consistent requirement of 65% D2-receptor occupancy for antipsychotic efficacy in functional imaging studies. The nonspecific localization of dopamine binding throughout the central nervous system (CNS) is consistent with the risk of movement disorders (Parkinson's disease) and prolactinemia.

Second-generation antipsychotics differ from first-generation by transiently occupying D2 receptors, followed by rapidly dissociating, allowing normal dopamine neurotransmission. They also have fast D2 dissociation, antagonistic properties on the 5HT2A receptor, and 5HT1A agonism. Second-generation antipsychotics have fewer side effects and are generally considered safe in adult and older populations. These differences account for the normal prolactin levels, lessened cognitive deficits, and preclusion of extrapyramidal symptoms.
