Severe hypothermia can be lethal; however, the prognosis may be favorable depending on the scenario. Patients with primary hypothermia and cardiac stability that receive proper treatment with active external and minimal invasive rewarming techniques have a survival rate of approximately 100% with full neurological recovery. For those patients that suffer cardiac arrest who then receive extracorporeal rewarming, the survival rate approaches 50%. Full recovery might be possible in cardiac arrest with extracorporeal rewarming if there were no preceding hypoxia, serious underlying disease, or trauma. Full neurological recovery has been witnessed in accidental hypothermia of up to 14 C.

Frostbite is a complication of hypothermia. It is a form of dry gangrene. When gangrene becomes infected, it becomes wet gangrene. Wet gangrene that has crepitus indicates a gas-producing organism. Clostridium perfringens classically cause superinfections with crepitus.
