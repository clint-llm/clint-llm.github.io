Filoviruses can cause high morbidity and mortality due to severe disease that commonly involves vomiting, diarrhea, and infrequently hemorrhaging and a comatose state leading to death, also known as Ebola infection. This activity reviews the diagnosis and management of filovirus diseases with a focus on the Ebola virus disease and emphasizes the interprofessional and public health role in managing patients with this disease and containing outbreaks.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of filovirus.
- Describe the history and physical findings expected with filoviruses.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for filoviruses.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to treat and contain filovirus infections/outbreaks and to improve outcomes.
