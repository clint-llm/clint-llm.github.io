Glaucoma is a set of ocular disorders often defined by increased intraocular pressures leading to optic neuropathy and vision loss if untreated.

The commonly accepted range for intraocular pressure is 10 to 22 mmHg. Three factors that affect the intraocular pressure are the rate of production of aqueous humor by the ciliary body, the resistance to aqueous outflow through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemmâ€™s canal, and the episcleral venous pressure. The normal flow of aqueous humor starts in the ciliary body, goes through the pupil, and out through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal in the angle of the anterior chamber. In acute angle-closure glaucoma, intraocular pressure increases rapidly due to outflow obstruction of the aqueous humor. Several factors lead to the obstruction in acute angle-closure glaucoma, but the major predisposing factor is the structural anatomy of the anterior chamber leading to a shallower angle.
