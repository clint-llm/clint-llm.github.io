Chronic interstitial nephritis in agricultural communities calls for careful health education. The occupational health team can play important roles in recognizing kidney disease risks among agricultural workers, advocating for prevention strategies such as using pesticides according to federal regulations, use of PPE, shade, rest, and water supply to prevent heat stress, dehydration, and volume depletion.

Occupational and community health teams should assess work, and it is essential to identify patient occupation, provide guidance in the management of pain to prevent overuse of NSAIDs, educate patients on the potential risks of self-treatment with antibiotics for urinary symptoms, and encourage them to seek professional care to decrease the risk of acute kidney injury.

CKD screening in high-risk patients based on their medical and occupational history should include the history of prior occupation, such as farm work, type of crops, spraying of pesticides, and sugar cane cutting.
