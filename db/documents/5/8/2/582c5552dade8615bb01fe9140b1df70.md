GLP-1 acts on the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), which belongs to the class of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs).

After release, GLP-1 is degraded by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) to GLP-1 (9–36) amide.

Neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP 24.11) is another enzyme that catabolizes GLP-1. It is a zinc metallopeptidase and is expressed in several locations, particularly in the kidneys. However, its contribution to GLP-1 degradation only becomes clear following inhibition of DPP-4, as otherwise most of the GLP-1 reaching the kidneys is already degraded by DPP-4.

Proteolysis by DPP-4 limits the half-life of endogenous GLP-1 to 1-5 minutes. Analogs of GLP-1 in clinical use are thus chemically modified to be resistant to the effects of this enzyme, and therefore have much longer half-lives than endogenous GLP-1 (e.g., liraglutide, exenatide). Another mechanism of prolonging the actions of GLP-1, apart from degradation-resistant synthetic analogs, is the inhibition of their degradation by the action of the class of drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors (e.g., sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin).
