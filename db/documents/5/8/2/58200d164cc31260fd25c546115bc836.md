Lipoprotein-X (LP-X) is a 30-70nm lipid bilayer vesicle that encloses a fluid compartment.

To evaluate patients with lipoprotein X-induced dyslipidemia, CBC, CMP, liver function test including bilirubin, lipid panel, Lp-X, and Apo B100 should be checked. Not all laboratories are equipped with measuring serum Lp-X levels. Methods that have been used to get serum Lp-X levels include electrophoresis using agarose gel, ultracentrifugation, and magnetic spectroscopy.

Images such as computed tomography scans of the abdomen and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) could also be done to evaluate for common bile duct dilation, which is a sign of cholestasis. Patients with liver disease like cholestasis usually present with elevated levels of liver function tests, including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin levels, and also very high levels of total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, and low levels of HDL.
