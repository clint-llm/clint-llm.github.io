Healthcare providers should educate patients regarding a proper rate of ascent and the importance of time to acclimatize. Emphasize recognition of early symptoms of HAPE and stop ascent to allow additional time to acclimatize; descend/seek treatment if symptoms are more pronounced. Education should be available regarding means by which patients should seek medical attention if symptomatic, and individuals should familiarize themselves with available local resources prior to a trip to altitude.

Patients diagnosed with or suspected to have HAPE shouldÂ receive education on the possibility of recurrence with subsequent trips to altitude. Pharmacologic prophylaxis and a slow rate of ascent (with altitude gains of 300 meters/day or less above 2500 meters) with additional time to acclimatize are critically important if patients with a history of HAPE wish to perform high-altitude activities in the future.

Nifedipine is the most studied agent for HAPE prophylaxis, typically dosed at 30 mg every 12 hours. This regimen should be initiated a day before ascent and continued for five days at peak altitude.

Although less studied, sildenafil and tadalafil may prevent HAPE. Prophylaxis dosing varies, with a common regimen being sildenafil 50 mg every 8 hours or tadalafil 10 mg every 12 hours.

Dexamethasone clearly can prevent AMS/HACE, and one small study showed promise for HAPE prophylaxis with a dose of 8 mg every 12 hours.
