Paraneoplastic disorders may affect diverse organ systems, and complications mainly involve endocrine, neurologic, dermatologic, rheumatologic, and hematologic systems. Complications should be suspected when clinical symptoms are much more severe and the patients are less responsive to the traditional treatment regimen.

Most notable laboratory complications at initial presentation include:

- Endocrine:

Severe hypo-osmotic, euvolemic hyponatremia: Serum Sodium level at presentation may be less than 125 meq/l.

Moderate to severe hypercalcemia: Calcium levels may be 12 to 14 mg/dl.

Severe hypoglycemia: Serum glucose may be as low as 20mg/dl.

- Hematologic:     Secondary thrombocytosis: Platelets >400 X 10/L.           Pure RBC aplasia: hematocrit <20.       Secondary granulocytosis: granulocyte (neutrophil) count >8 X 10/L     Eosinophils: >0.5 X 10/L

Other complications to note include treatment-related complications. Paraneoplastic syndromes are mainly treated with immune-modulatory medications (corticosteroids, Intravenous Immune globulins (IVIG), Interferon alpha, plasmapheresis, medications like cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, etc.) However, as the main treatment for paraneoplastic syndrome is treating the primary cancer with chemotherapy and radiation, treatment-related complication rates are high in these patients. They are at increased risk for hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, cardiotoxicity, and pulmonary toxicity.
