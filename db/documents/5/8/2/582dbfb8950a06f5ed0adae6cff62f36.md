The primary adverse effects of glipizide include hypoglycemia and weight gain. The most common adverse reactions are gastrointestinal and include nausea and diarrhea. In rare cases, cholestatic jaundice may result from glipizide therapy, and this requires immediate discontinuation of the medication.

Allergic reactions to glipizide are rare but can occur. They may present with erythema, pruritis, and eczema. If these symptoms are severe or persistent, the clinician should discontinue the drug; this will typically result in cessation of allergic symptoms.

Reports exist of hepatic porphyria in some patients. Additionally, some patients may develop a disulfiram-like reaction, but at present, this is only referenced anecdotally in the literature.

Rarely, glipizide may cause the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and hyponatremia. This adverse effect is also known to occur with several other sulfonylurea agents.

In general, glipizide is a relatively safe oral hypoglycemic, and the risk of adverse reactions is veryÂ low.
