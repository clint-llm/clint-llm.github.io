Pregabalin is a widely used medication for the management of seizures and pain disorders. While the drug is relatively safe, the primary care provider, pharmacist, nurse practitioner, and internist must regularly monitor the patient. The drug is known to cause depression and suicidal thoughts, so a mental assessment is advisable at each visit. Patients should be educated about the other side effects and told not to drive when taking the drug or combine it with other anti-seizure medications or alcohol. Pharmacists should perform medication reconciliation and watch for potential drug interactions. Nurses should verify the dose before administering and report any concerns to clinicians. The patient should have a neurologist, psychiatrist, or specialist consult before changing the treatment plan.
