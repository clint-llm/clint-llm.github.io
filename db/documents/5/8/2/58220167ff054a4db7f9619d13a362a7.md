One of the most important factors contributing to the success of free flap surgery is timely intervention in the case of early complications, especially flap failure; to that end, recognition of complications through proper monitoring and good postoperative care is critical. The role of ward nurses and other allied staff is critical to increase the likelihood that patients who undergo ALT flap reconstructions experience good outcomes. To ensure these goals are met, there should be a good understanding and coordination among the members of the plastic and reconstructive surgery team, with each member having a clear understanding of his or her own roles, responsibilities, and limitations.

Postoperative monitoring of ALT free flaps is most critical during the first 24 to 72 hours and should be performed diligently until at least the first week after surgery. Proper monitoring improves salvage rates of failing free flaps, as there is an inverse relationship between the length of time a failed flap takes to get to the operating room and its chance of survival. Hourly flap monitoring by nurses includes: color, warmth, turgor, capillary refill, handheld doppler signals from flap pedicle, signs of hematoma, bleeding, and checking for compression or pressure over the flap pedicle. During the initial 48-72 hours, hourly flap monitoring is mandatory. Once the danger period has passed, monitoring the flap every three to four hours for a few days should be sufficient.
