While many will recover from measles with no complications, there is a risk of a poor prognosis.  The more common complications due to infection with measles include otitis media and diarrhea.  The otitis may lead to hearing loss.  Those more likely to have severe complications include infants and children under the age of five years, adults over the age of twenty, pregnant women, and those who are immunocompromised.  Encephalitis may occur in 1 out of every 1000 infected children, and 1-2 of all infected children will die of neurologic or respiratory complications from measles.
