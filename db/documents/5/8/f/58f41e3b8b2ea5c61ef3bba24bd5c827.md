An interprofessional team approach to managing patients requiring injections with hydroxocobalamin is essential in establishing an effective treatment regimen and assessment of patient response. This interprofessional team includes clinicians, mid-level practitioners, pharmacists, and nursing staff, all working collaboratively and sharing information to achieve optimal patient outcomes. It is important to emphasize that although rare, there may be hypersensitivity or allergic reactions to components of the hydroxocobalamin injection in some individuals. Open communication among members of the healthcare team is essential under these circumstances. There should be coordination between the nurse or practitioner administering the injection and the prescriber to ensure appropriate administration and monitoring of therapeutic response. The pharmacists can verify dosing and watch for potential interactions. All members can counsel the patient on administration and signs of therapeutic effectiveness as well as possible adverse reactions. There should be clear communication with patients on the quantity and frequency of injections needed. This information should be given initially by the prescriber and then again by the nurse or other healthcare provider administering the injection.
