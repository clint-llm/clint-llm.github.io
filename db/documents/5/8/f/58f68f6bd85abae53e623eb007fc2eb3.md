The urothelium, lamina propria, muscularis propria, and serosa may be seen under the light microscope in a histological section of the bladder wall. The urothelium's most superficial layer comprises dome-shaped umbrella cells whose shape becomes flat in a distended bladder. The cells of this layer are often multinucleated. Below the umbrella cells, the urothelium contains the multi-cell-layered intermediate and a single-cell layer of basal cells contacting its basement membrane. The cells of the intermediate layer are uninucleated; the number of layers in the intermediate layer depends on the stage of distension of the urinary bladder. The basal layer contains mononucleated, cuboidal cells with mitotic capability. Even though the turnover rate is gradual, this layer demonstrates a great regenerative capacity.
