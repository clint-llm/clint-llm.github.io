Father: This can be a precipitating factor for depression in the father as this will be a stressful event for the entire family.

Infant: Children of mothers who have untreated depression can develop behavioral and emotional problems. More commonly seen are delays in language development. They can also suffer from sleeping problems, eating difficulties, excessive crying, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
