Ursodeoxycholic acid is a film-coated tablet available for oral administration. The absorption of the drug is enhanced by other bile acids; therefore, it is recommended to take the drug during meals with food to facilitate biliary secretion by the gallbladder.

The dosing of UDCA is as follows:

**For gallstone dissolution:**8 to 10 mg/kg/day orally divided into three or four doses.

**For gallstone prophylaxis:**300 mg orally twice daily.
