Many regions in the United States lack appropriate EMS medical physician oversight.  Whether it is a private, military, state, county, or volunteer EMS services, increasing the safety of the general public is well within the scope of practice of an EMS medical director.  If EMS leadership is unsure of how to begin to improve their EMS service, a great first step is a simple EMS ride-along.  Utilizing the experience and expertise of EMS personnel can help EMS directors better generate ideas, identify problems, and create solutions.
