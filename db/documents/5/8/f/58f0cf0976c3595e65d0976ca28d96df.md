In resource-poor regions of the world, insufficient nutrition complicated by chronic inflammation from regular gastrointestinal (GI) infections leads to frequent micronutrient deficiencies and is the most common etiology of vitamin A deficiency worldwide.

Vitamin A concentration in breastmilk varies based on maternal nutrition status. In resource-poor settings, the average breastmilk vitamin A concentration only meets the infant's minimum daily need. This does not allow the build-up of liver reserves, resulting in high levels of vitamin A deficiency shortly after weaning.

In the developed world, pancreatic, liver, and intestinal pathology are the leading causes of VAD. Similar to the frequent GI infections seen in the developing world, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal mucosa, and, when combined with decreased oral intake, it can lead to vitamin A deficiency.

Pancreatic insufficiency can result in VAD due to poor exocrine function and insufficient production of the hydrolases required for absorption.
