Amphotericin B is amphoteric (can act as both an acid and a base) and virtually water-insoluble. It is not absorbable via oral or intramuscular administration.

Amphotericin B intravenous (IV) infusion administration is over 2 to 6 hours. If the patient experiences any of the following; fever, hypertension, chills, or nausea, premedication 30 to 60 minutes before administration with a combination of acetaminophen/ibuprofen plus diphenhydramine and/or hydrocortisone should merit consideration.  The risk of nephrotoxicity increases at doses greater than 1 mg/kg, and there is no evidence supporting doses greater than 1.5 mg/kg per day. Pretreating the patient with 1 liter of normal saline can attenuate nephrotoxicity.

Topical use of amphotericin B for peritoneal or bladder wash has been reported in the literature but not recommended. Topical amphotericin B is irritating to the skin; therefore, the decision to use topical amphotericin B should be made based on expert consultation.

Amphotericin B achieves high concentrations in tissue such as the liver, spleen, bone marrow, kidney, and lungs. Although concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are low (5% of serum), it is effective in the treatment of fungal infections of the central nervous system (CNS) when given intrathecally (higher risk of toxicity).

A high interindividual variability characterizes the reported pharmacokinetic data in children. Children seem to clear the drug from plasma more rapidly than adults.
