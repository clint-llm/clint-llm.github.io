The cyst of cavum veli interpositi must be distinguished mainly from other midline intracranial cysts.

The key to the differential diagnosis is an accurate anatomical evaluation of these structures:

**Cavum septi pellucidi (CSP)**: cavum with the same triangular shape but with the apex pointing posteriorly. CSP is anterior to the foramen of Monro, between the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles.

**Cavum vergae:**cavum with a rectangular shape in cross-section. It is superior to the columns of the fornices, which are displaced inferiorly.

**Pineal cyst:**This is common, usually asymptomatic, and incidental finding as for CVI. The pineal cyst is located below the internal cerebral veins abutting the colliculi.

**Arachnoid cyst:**an arachnoid cyst of the region of the quadrigeminal cistern can mimicking a CVI. It is usually eccentric, located below the cerebral veins, and not triangular in cross-section.
