The prevalence of polymorphic light eruption varies worldwide. Affected individuals may experience it every time they go outdoors, or only occasionally. It is more common in Northern Europe (15% in the UK) than in Australasia (5%). It affects all skin types but is more common in lighter skin especially Fitzpatrick skin phototype 1, than in darker skins. It most often (about 75% of cases) begins in females aged 20 to 40 years but may start in childhood or later in life.Â More people experience polymorphic light eruption at high altitude than at sea level.
