Multiple studies have shown that there is a durable, long-term clinical success from this procedure with an extremely low mortality rate. Because this procedure uses biological valves, it obviates the need for oral anticoagulation which would have otherwise been necessary for this particularÂ group of patients because they would have needed mechanical valves.
