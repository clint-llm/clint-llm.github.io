The treatment of distal humeral fractures requires a team effort from the initial presentation to the ultimate post-surgical period. A majority of these injuries will first be seen and evaluated in the emergency room or urgent care setting, so practitioners within these settings must be familiar with this particular type of fracture pattern both to initially stabilize the patient as well as educate them on the typical treatment course of these types of injuries. Setting realistic expectations from the initial point of contact can allow patients to adequately prepare themselves physically and mentally. In addition to being able to counsel the patient, being familiar with this type of injury can allow the treatment staff in the acute setting to properly consult with an orthopedic specialist to ensure that proper follow-up can be obtained. Since a vast majority of cases will require surgical fixation, recognizing these type of fracture patterns early so the necessary imaging can be obtained may expedite surgical planning, and ultimately, definitive fixation. The time to definitive treatment and, subsequently, the application of an early ROM program postoperatively gives the patient the best chance for a successful union of their fracture and reduces the risks of associated complications. (Level V)
