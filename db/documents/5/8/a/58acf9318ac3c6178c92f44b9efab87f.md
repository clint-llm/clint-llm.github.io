After a three to five-day incubation period, well-described cutaneous lesions develop, progressing through six stages, about a week in duration.

- Maculopapular - erythematous

- Target lesion - target shaped with a necrotic center and surrounding red halo

- Acute nodular/weepy - draining papule

- Regenerative/dry - firm crusted papule

- Papilloma - papillomatous surface

- Regressive stage - resolution with little if any scarring
