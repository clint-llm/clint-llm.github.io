Tetrahydrofolate is involved in single carbon transfer bound to positions N5, N10, or both. The carbon sources for the one-carbon pool are serine (the major source), glycine, histidine, and tryptophan. They donate the single carbon to THF in various oxidation states and can be oxidized or reduced. Hence, folate can exist in multiple forms,, namely N10-formyl THF (most oxidized form),  N5, N10-methenyl THF,  N5, N10-methylene THF, and N5-methyl THF (most reduced form). All these forms carrying these single carbon groups are collectively known as the "one-carbon pool.”

Histidine and Tryptophan are other less common one-carbon sources that result in the formation of N5, N10-methenyl THF, and N10-formyl THF, respectively. These forms are interconvertible; however, once a methyl group is formed, it is not readily oxidized back to N5, N10-methylene THF and hence N5-methyl THF tends to accumulate in the cells.

Folate is a vitamin B present in green leafy vegetables, fruits, and legumes in the diet as polyglutamate.  The synthetic analog of folate is folic acid. It is also a synthetic oxidized dietary supplement that plays no direct biological role nor is it considered biologically active. It is absorbed in the jejunum and ileum after being reduced by folate reductase to N5-methyl THF which is the major form present in the blood and stored in the liver.
