Conventional angiography is usually performed within an interventional radiology suite, closely resembling an operating room. It is performed under sterile conditions and uses intravascular contrast to image basic vascular anatomy and integrity. The use of fluoroscopic imaging systems provides dedicated, small fields of view while allowing for the versatility and computer software required for digital subtraction vascular imaging. Dedicated angiography is useful for evaluating blood supply in cases of avascular necrosis, such as Kienb√∂ck disease.

Similar to direct (conventional) angiography, CT and MRI angiography techniques also use intravenous contrast agents to aid in the assessment of vascular structures and pathology. The timing of contrast administration and imaging by the technologists provide the radiologist a cross-sectional view of various anatomy with the vascular system enhanced by contrast (venous versus arterial). Like dedicated angiography, general anatomic information and vessel integrity are visualized, but with the added benefit of increased clarity of surrounding anatomy compared to conventional angiography.

CT and MRI angiography, however, does not have the benefit of image-guided intravascular treatment. CT guidance of percutaneous procedures such as biopsy and therapeutic injection is common, but endovascular CT image guidance is not commonly performed.

Examples of appropriate uses of angiography for wrist pathology may include:

- Vascular integrity

- Vascular supply (variant anatomy, stenosis, etc.)

- Aneurysm evaluation and treatment

- Pseudoaneurysm evaluation

- Raynaud phenomenon

- Occupational and vibrational induced pathology

- Imaged guided tumor embolization and chemotherapy administration (such as uterine artery embolization for treatment of uterine fibroids)
