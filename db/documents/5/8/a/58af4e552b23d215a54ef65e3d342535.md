Digital health refers to the use of information and communications technologies in medicine and other health professions to manage illnesses and health risks and to promote wellness. Digital health has a broad scope and includes the use of wearable devices, mobile health, telehealth, health information technology, and telemedicine.Â  Digital Health has been gaining momentum because it is envisioned to:

- Improve access to healthcare

- Reduce any inefficiencies in the healthcare system

- Improve the quality of care

- Lower the cost of healthcare

- Provide more personalized health care for patients

There is some evidence to show that the use of digital medicine allows patients to better track their own health and wellness. For example, the use of digital devices like the smartphone not only helps with communication, but these devices now have a huge number of apps that can help monitor blood pressure, record blood sugars, ensure compliance with medications, and track the amount of physical activity.
