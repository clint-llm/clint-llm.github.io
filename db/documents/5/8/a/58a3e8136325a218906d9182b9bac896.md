The limiting factor for performance during training and competition in high-intensity sports of long duration is energy intake. A substantial percentage of energy intake is provided through carbohydrates, and to a lesser extent, proteins and fats. To maintain optimal energy availability, increased energy expenditure should ideally justify increased nutritional intake. However, this is not always the case.  Many female athletes, either deliberately or inadvertently, fail to maintain adequate energy intake. There exists a direct correlation between carbohydrate availability and reproductive and skeletal health.
