While splints are commonly used, they are often applied improperly or inadequately.

- Loss of fracture reduction

- Skin irritation or breakdown

- Joint stiffness. Every effort should be made to immobilize the fewest number of joints possible.

- Thermal injury - Both plaster and fiberglass support materials exhibit exothermic reactions when activated by water. Avoid skin burns by using room-temperature water when activating the support material and through careful monitoring after splint placement.

- Neurovascular compromise - Acute carpal tunnel syndrome is a rare complication following the reduction of a wrist dislocation. Similarly, the reduction of a supracondylar humerus fracture may inadvertently occlude the brachialÂ artery. Both scenarios are exacerbated through splint placement and require prompt splint removal, followed by a possible operative intervention.

- Compartment syndrome - Excessive compression may occur through splint placement, mainly if a splint is circumferential, becoming a cast.
