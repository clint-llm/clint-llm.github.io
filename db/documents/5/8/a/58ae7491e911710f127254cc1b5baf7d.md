The right pericardiacophrenic artery courses caudally between fibrous pericardium and pleura along the right margin of the heart as it accompanies the phrenic nerve anterior to the root of the lung to the diaphragm. The left pericardiacophrenic artery is displaced laterally by the developing heart and passes along the left (obtuse) margin of the heart to the diaphragm, also in the company of the phrenic nerve. The pericardiacophrenic artery arises from the internal thoracic artery, a branch of the first part of the subclavian artery.

The pericardiacophrenic arteries travel between the pleura and pericardium and constitute a collateral blood supply to the coronary arteries to the heart.

The pericardiacophrenic veins, which are veni communicantes, each of which can be single or double, begin on the anterosuperior aspect of the diaphragm and drain superiorly into the brachiocephalic veins directly or via their internal thoracic venous tributaries.
