The main issue of concern in regards to BMI involves the growing obesity epidemic and the increasing population with high BMI numbers. The U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) of 2007 indicated that 63% of Americans are now in the overweight category and 26% are in the obese category.

The data collected for NHANES from 1988 to 1994, 1999 to 2000, and 2015 to 2016, demonstrates the age-adjusted prevalence of obesity in the United States has been increasing progressively: from 22.9 to 30.5 to 39.6 percent. In 2016, the incidence of obesity in American men rose to 37.9 percent, and the prevalence of obesity in American women increased to 41.1 percent. The age-adjusted prevalence of class III obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 40Â kg/m^2) has risen from 5.7 percent to 7.7 percent between 2007 and 2016.
