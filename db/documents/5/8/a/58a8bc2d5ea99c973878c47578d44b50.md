Tubal ligation is usually done by the obstetrician but initially most women come for advice on the topic to their primary care provider or nurse practitioner.Â  The key about tubal ligation is that the patient must be informed that it is a permanent procedure and should never be done as an emergency. While the mortality of the procedure is low, a number of serious complication may ocur. The patient should be counseled with the spouse before a decision is made to undertake the procedure. The outcomes for most patients who undergo tubal ligation are good.
