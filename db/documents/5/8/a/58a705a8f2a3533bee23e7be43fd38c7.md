Most patients will present with a large palpable nodule in the anterior neck, or an incidental nodule is found on imaging studies performed for other reasons. Most thyroid nodules are asymptomatic, and most individuals with thyroid nodules are euthyroid, with less than 1% of nodules causing thyroid disease. Some patients may complain of neck pressure or pain, particularly when spontaneous hemorrhage occurs.

Palpation of the thyroid is the easiest but least sensitive method for detecting thyroid nodules, with a prevalence of 4% to 7%.

The combined physical examination findings of a solitary nodule along in addition to cervical lymphadenopathy (greater than 1 cm) and vocal fold paralysis, have an approximate positive predictive value of 100% for thyroid malignancy.

Appropriate social history is important and may aid in identifying patients with MEN II syndrome. These are at higher risk for pheochromocytomas and need appropriate workup before surgical intervention.
