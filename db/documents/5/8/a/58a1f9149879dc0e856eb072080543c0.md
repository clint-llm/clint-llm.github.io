All patients with acute limb ischemia secondary to a thrombosed popliteal artery aneurysm should have an arteriogram to evaluate for the presence of suitable outflow vessels for revascularization or bypass.Â  This examination can be done with either CT arteriogram or formal arteriogram, depending on the grade of acute limb ischemia and the urgency of intervention required.
