Tricyclic antidepressants, like all antidepressants, are used in a group of patients that are already at increased risk of attempted suicide. Thus, overdose with such drugs is something that needs to have a plan at hand. Furthermore, TCAs are often used in drug-resistant depression, which makes them even more of a risk than the first-line SSRIs and SNRIs. Thus protriptyline is a very potent TCA and a dangerous drug for overdose.

Treatment of protriptyline toxicity includes gastrointestinal decontamination with gastric lavage and activated charcoal l and treating the symptoms that arise due to the overdose as necessary; for example, norepinephrine and IV fluids for hypotension, IV sodium bicarbonate for prolonged QRS duration, and benzodiazepines for anxiety, agitation, or seizures.
