Clinical presentation of ventricular tachycardia varies, depending on the patients` age, co-morbid conditions, underlying structural heart diseases, and mechanism of ventricular tachycardia. Although the common symptoms of ventricular tachycardia include palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, and syncope, the patients may present with cardiac arrest or even sudden cardiac death.

Ventricular tachycardia in the presence of coronary artery disease may present with chest pain, syncope, shortness, and cardiac arrest. Ventricular tachycardia in the presence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction is not tolerated well and results in significant hemodynamic compromise patients usually present with syncope, shortness of breath (due to pulmonary edema), cardiac arrest, and even sudden cardiac death. While those with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may present with ICD shocks.

The clinical examination of ventricular tachycardia may include hypotension and signs of heart failure. Elevated jugular venous pressure and cannon waves can be found even in hemodynamically stable patients. The detailed precordial examination may reveal the signs of underlying structural heart disease and signs of adverse effects of antiarrhythmic drugs, e.g., amiodarone.
