Treatment goals for SpA are reducing symptoms, reducing functional limitations, and decreasing complications associated with the disease. A mainstay of therapy is an exercise to preserve spine and peripheral joint strength and range of motion. Often, formal physical therapy is beneficial

In axial disease (AS), biologics (TNF inhibitors) are the next line of therapy. Five TNF inhibitors, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab, are shown to achieve partial or full remission of symptoms. Of note, active infection (including latent or active tuberculosis which should be treated before starting treatment), advanced heart failure, lupus, multiple sclerosis, and cancer are contraindications for treatment with TNF inhibitors. Secukinumab, a monoclonal antibody to interleukin 17A, has been recently approved to treat AS and has been shown to be quite effective in those who cannot tolerate TNF inhibitors
