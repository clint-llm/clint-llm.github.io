Appendicitis is a frequent presentation to the emergency department and all nurses should be familiar with the disorder. It is the triage nurse who is responsible for expediting the admission of the patient to the emergency department so that the patient can be seen promptly by the staff. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, patients are kept NPO, started on antibiotics and hydrated. Surgery is usually done the same day. Nurses also play a vital role in the monitoring of the patient post-operatively. Appendectomy can be performed either laparoscopically or via a small abdominal incision. Data indicate that the laparoscopic procedure is associated with less pain and a faster recovery. However, the long term outcomes are similar.
