Isolated lateral wall myocardial infarction (LMI), similar to other acute myocardial infarctions (MI), is caused by acute atherosclerotic plaque rupture with subsequent thrombus formation in the left circumflex (LCx) coronary artery or one of its branches. More commonly the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery is involved in the ensuing anterolateral MI. In patients with recent drug-eluting stents, medication non-compliance can cause stent restenosis resulting in acute MI. This activity reviews the medical team's role in evaluating acute lateral wall myocardial infarction and in treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of a lateral wall myocardial infarction.
- Review the electrocardiogram (ECG) findings in a lateral wall myocardial infarction.
- Outline the treatment options of a lateral wall myocardial infarction.
- Summarize the interprofessional coordination of management of a patient with a lateral wall myocardial infarction.
