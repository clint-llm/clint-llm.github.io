Labs to evaluate the cause of oligomenorrhea includes the following:

**Blood Tests**

- FSH Levels; if increased, they show primary ovarian insufficiency.

- TSH levels; if decreased, then it shows hyperthyroidism.

- Prolactin levels; if increased, then prolactinoma may be the cause.

- LH levels; the ratio of FSH\LH is useful in diagnosing polycystic ovarian disease.

- Free testosterone levels; increased in congenital adrenal hyperplasia and polycystic ovarian disease.

- 17 â€“OH levels; these are useful to diagnose congenital adrenal hyperplasia as a cause of oligomenorrhea.

- Overnight dexamethasone suppression test; is done to diagnose Cushing syndrome as a cause of oligomenorrhea, especially if the patient presents with signs of this condition.

- HbA1C

**Investigations**

- Ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis; it may indicate polycystic ovaries, signs of pelvic inflammation, and ascites.

- CT scan is useful with suspicion of adnexal or adrenal masses.

- MRI pituitary helps to confirm prolactinoma if prolactin levels increase.

- Endocervical swabs are taken if there are signs of pelvic inflammatory disease.
