The management of MALT lymphoma is complex and needs an interprofessional team approach. Hematologists and oncologists are always involved in the care of these patients, but other interprofessional team members, including radiation oncologists, pathologists, gastroenterologists, and radiologists, are also pivotal. It is recommended that these complex patients are discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board for a consensus treatment plan. This approach will facilitate optimal patient care, individualized treatment decisions, and also improve enrollment in the clinical trials.

Other allied health professionals, including the pharmacists, nurses, social workers, dieticians, physical therapists, also are involved in the care of these patients. Constant interaction and discussion between these health professionals improve the outcomes of these patients. Having oncology trained psychologists as part of the team also plays a significant role in addressing psycho-social issues pertaining to the diagnosis and management of lymphomas. Family and friends are also involved in the care of the patient, and every effort should be made to communicate with them and educate them regarding the disease. [Level 5]
