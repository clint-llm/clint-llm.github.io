The suboccipital muscles, similar to all striated and smooth muscles, are derived from the mesoderm. With attachments to the base of the skull, there is a complex interaction between the mesoderm and the occipital sclerotomes that form the occipital bone. During embryologic development, derangements can lead to anatomic variations in the suboccipital muscles.
