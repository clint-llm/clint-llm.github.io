The history of patients presenting with globe rupture should focus on the etiology of the ocular and/or periocular trauma. The patient may present with sudden eye pain and vision loss after a potentially penetrating injury. Common penetrating causes of globe rupture may include glass or metal fragments, shotgun or bb pellets, and wood shavings from wood grinding. Globe rupture resulting from blunt trauma may result from mechanical falls, syncope, seizures, motor vehicle accidents with airbag deployment, or assaults with blunt objects.

The physical exam on patients with potential globe rupture requires a detailed ophthalmologic assessment. Careful evaluation of the patientâ€™s baseline visual acuity is critical. A slit-lamp examination should be performed to assess the anterior portion of the globe and the anterior chamber. It is essential to carefully assess the conjunctiva, looking for defects, visible foreign bodies, or lacerations. Particular attention should be paid to the equatorial sclera immediately posterior to the insertion of the rectus muscles, as this area is one of the most common locations for globe rupture because the sclera is thinnest at this location.
