The anatomy of the head and neck is very complicated secondary to the numerous fine structures that have a variable course and depth as they traverse through the tissue.  There are several very important neurovascular structures anatomically situated in the head and neck, which may suffer a potential injury during surgical dissection. The neck divides into subdivisions and compartments that aid in the organization and help make sense of this complex region. The anterior and posterior triangles are the two primary subdivisions and are delineated by easily recognized anatomic structures. Each triangle houses muscles, nerves, vasculature, lymphatics, and adipose tissue. The objective of this article is to provide an in-depth understanding of the anatomy of the triangles of the neck and to relate this information to relevant clinical and surgical considerations.
