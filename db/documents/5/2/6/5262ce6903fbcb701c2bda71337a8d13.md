The risk of femoral head collapse with AVN can be stratified into three groups based on the modified Kerboul combined necrotic angle. This is calculated by the summation of the arc of femoral head necrosis on mid-sagittal and midcoronal MR image.

- Low-risk group: combined necrotic angle less than 190 degrees

- Moderate-risk group: combined necrotic angle between 190 and 240 degrees

- High-risk group: combined necrotic angle greater than 240 degrees
