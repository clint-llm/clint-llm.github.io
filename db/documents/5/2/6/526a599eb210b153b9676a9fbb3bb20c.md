Factors like lesion size, number and location, immune status of the patient, personal preferences of the patient, and the type of treatment available at a particular healthcare facility dictate the chosen treatment.

Topical, intralesional, or oral chemotherapy with fluorouracil (5-FU), podophyllin, cidofovir, interferon, and imiquimod, as well as systemic chemotherapeutic drugs e.g., bleomycin, cisplatin, and leucovorin have been used as neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy and for treating tumor recurrences after surgery.

Radiation therapy, in spite of its neoadjuvant application in a limited number of GCBL cases, has largely been avoided, mostly because of the fear of causing further anaplastic transformations.

Autologous vaccination therapy as a treatment for GCBL has also shown promising results.
