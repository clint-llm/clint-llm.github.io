The P wave and PR segment is an integral part of an electrocardiogram (ECG). It represents the electrical depolarization of the atria of the heart. It is typically a small positive deflection from the isoelectric baseline that occurs just before the QRS complex. It can sometimes have abnormalities in morphology or timing that can be indicative of significant clinical pathology.
