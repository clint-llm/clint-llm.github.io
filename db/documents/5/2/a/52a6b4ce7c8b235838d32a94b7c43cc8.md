Early and accurate diagnosis of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is essential to prevent chronic renal damage associated with urinary reflux. Since VUR is commonly diagnosed in childhood and often requires multiple follow-up examinations, minimizing radiation exposure is of great importance to reduce both the stochastic and deterministic effects of ionizing radiation. The two most common radiologic procedures used to diagnose VUR include radionuclide cystography (RNC) and conventional fluoroscopic contrast-enhanced micturating cystourethrograms (MCU). MCU utilizes x-rays to view iodinated contrast instilled into the bladder via a catheter. Then a combination of still and cine images are acquired using fluoroscopy. Both X-rays and gamma rays are forms of ionizing radiation that can cause direct and indirect DNA damage. When comparing RNC and MCU, RNC is not only more sensitive in detecting VUR, but it uses approximately 1/20th of the overall radiation dose.

To give perspective, the RNC effective dose is 0.0024 mSv, which is nearly ten times lower than that of a posterior-anterior (PA) chest radiograph, which is approximately 0.02 mSv.
