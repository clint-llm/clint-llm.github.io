The pathophysiology of depression is a complex phenomenon. The brain areas which control our mood are— frontal cortex (cognitive function, attention), ventral hippocampus (cognitive function, memory), nucleus accumbens (response to emotional stimuli), the hypothalamus (regulation of sleep, appetite, energy, libido), ventral tegmental area (sends dopaminergic projections), dorsal raphe nucleus (sends serotonergic inputs), locus coeruleus (sends noradrenergic input to other areas). Depression leads to dysregulation of these cortical structures.

The interaction of depression with medical comorbidities among older adults needs a special mention. Individuals having a cerebrovascular accident, Parkinson’s disease, and status post-myocardial infarction are at increased risk of developing a major depressive disorder and vice versa.

The depression in late life differs from early-onset depression as in the elderly symptoms of the sad mood are less common. They are more likely to express somatic, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms. Comorbid cognitive impairment is common in late life. The elderly are less likely to report guilt. Suicide rates are higher in older depressed individuals as compared to young people.
