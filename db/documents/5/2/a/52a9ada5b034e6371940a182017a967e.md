Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare autosomal recessive genodermatosis that results due to mutations in nucleotide excision repair. The condition is characterized by severe photosensitivity, skin pigmentary changes, malignant tumor development, and occasionally progressive neurologic degeneration. This activity describes the evaluation and management of xeroderma pigmentosum and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of xeroderma pigmentosum. 
- Review the clinical presentation of the patient with xeroderma pigmentosum.
- Outline the management considerations for patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by xeroderma pigmentosum.
