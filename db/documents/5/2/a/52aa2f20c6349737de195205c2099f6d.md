Carotenoids are organic hydrocarbons mainly found in plant sources. Beta-carotene is the main carotenoid found in plants. Other carotenoids include alpha-carotene, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein, and lycopene.

Many individuals with diabetes mellitus have increased serum carotene levels; however, only 10% of these patients have yellowing of the skin. Carotenemia could be associated with hyperlipidemia, restricted dietary habits, or a deficient hepatic conversion of carotene into vitamin A.

The commonly accepted pathophysiological mechanism underlying carotenemia in hypothyroidism is a deficient conversion of carotene into vitamin A, as well as hypercholesterolemia. The thyroid hormone is an antagonist to vitamin A and mediates its rate of catabolism. The consumption of vitamin A is reduced in hypothyroidism, and the conversion rate from carotene to vitamin A is decelerated.

Anorexia nervosa is also associated with carotenemia.
