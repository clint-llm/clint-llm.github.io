Portal hypertension causes portocaval anastomosis to develop to decompress portal circulation. Normal portal pressure is between 5-10 mmHg but in the presence of portal obstruction, the pressure may be as high as 15-20 mmHg. Since the portal venous system has no valves, resistance at any level between the splanchnic vessels and right side of the heart results in retrograde flow and elevated pressure. The collaterals slowly enlarge and connect the systemic circulation to the portal venous system. Over time, this leads to a congested submucosal venous plexus with tortuous dilated veins in the distal esophagus. Variceal rupture results in hemorrhage.

Pathophysiology of portal hypertension:

- Increased resistance to portal flow at the level of hepatic sinusoids is caused by:

- Intrahepatic vasoconstriction due to decreased nitric oxide production, and increased release of endothelin-1 (ET-1), angiotensinogen, and eicosanoids

- Sinusoidal remodeling disrupting blood flow.

- Increased portal flow is caused by hyperdynamic circulation due to splanchnic arterial vasodilation through mediators such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and TNF.

Risk factors for variceal bleeding:

- Size of the varices; the larger the varix, the greater the potential for rupture

- Advanced Child classification also increases the risk of hemorrhage

- Presence of red color markings on the varices during endoscopy is also associated with a potential for rupture

- Active alcohol consumption
