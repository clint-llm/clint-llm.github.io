NCCN (the National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines recommend adjuvant chemotherapy for completely resected stage II to IV granulosa theca cell tumors based on retrospective data showing a progression-free survival benefit.

Regarding stage I disease, there is no evidence that adjuvant chemotherapy will prevent recurrence or improve survival. The MITO 9 study was a retrospective multi-institutional review of patients with GCT of the ovary at FIGO stage IC designed to assess the efficacy of first-line postoperative chemotherapy. Still, it failed to show any disease-free survival advantage.

Although there is limited data, angiogenesis inhibitors [bevacizumab], hormonal therapy (including gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, tamoxifen, or the aromatase inhibitors) have also demonstrated activity, especially for the treatment of adult-type granulosa cell tumors.
