Cardiac rhabdomyoma is a rare and benign mesenchymal tumor of striated muscle origin. It most commonly involves the head and neck.

Most cardiac rhabdomyomas are multiple and pursue a course of spontaneous regression; surgical resection is not advisable unless the patient is symptomatic. The symptoms develop as a result of the obstruction of blood inflow or outflow, resulting in congestive heart failure. Arrhythmias can also occur ranging from bradycardia secondary to sinus or atrioventricular node (AVN) dysfunction to atrial/ventricular tachycardia, AVN reentrant tachycardia, or ventricular pre-excitation.
