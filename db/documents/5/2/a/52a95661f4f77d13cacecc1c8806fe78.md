To monitor the effectiveness of therapy in treating edema, the patient should show an increase in urine output and a decrease in total body weight. In managing hypertension, a lowering in blood pressure should be seen within a few weeks of initiation of therapy. Current guidelines for high blood pressure treatment suggest assessing blood pressure monthly when starting or adjusting therapy and every 3 to 6 months for patients at goal.

Additionally, because of the adverse effects of metolazone, serum electrolytes should be monitored at baseline and routinely while continuing therapy, including sodium, potassium, magnesium, and chloride.

Failure to decrease extracellular fluid volume despite using diuretics appropriately is termed ‘diuretic resistance.’  Diuretic resistance can be expressed as a fractional sodium excretion (FE) of <0.2%.
