Skin biopsy and microscopic analysis are valuable in confirming the diagnosis in atypical and severe cases as the histopathologic features are largely the same regardless of the distribution or subtype. Principal findings consist of thickening of the stratum corneum without nuclei present (hyperkeratosis without parakeratosis); irregular thickening of the stratum granulosum;Â destruction of the stratum basale; alteration or loss of rete ridges resulting in a sawtooth appearance; and a dense band of lymphocytes infiltrating the dermis along the dermo-epidermal junction (interface dermatitis). Additionally, idiopathic LP (almost) never has eosinophils whereas drug-induced LP may have eosinophils.

Apoptotic keratinocytes are often seen near the basal layer and are termed colloid or Civatte bodies. Direct staining by immunofluorescence may display colloid bodies with irregular deposits of IgA, IgM, IgG, or C3.
