**Diagnosis of Ischemic Heart Disease With Intermediate-risk for CAD and or Risk Stratification of Patients with an Intermediate or High Likelihood of CAD**

- For identification of extent, severity, and location of myocardial ischemia

- Assess the functional significance of intermediate  coronary artery stenosis

- Intermediate Duke Treadmill score (**score**between 4 and -11) on exercise stress test (ETT)

- Repeat testing  in patients with a change in their ischemic symptoms

- Repeat testing in 1 to 3 years in patients with a high likelihood of coronary artery disease

- Severe coronary calcification on CT angiogram with unpredictable ECG

- Asymptomatic patients but with high-risk occupation( such as firefighters and pilots)

MPS is contraindicated for the screening of  asymptomatic patients with a low likelihood of ischemic coronary artery disease

**Assessment of Interventions and Therapy in Ischemic Heart Disease**

- To assess patients 3 to 5 years after revascularization (either CABG or Coronary angioplasty) in high-risk asymptomatic patients

- Repeat testing to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy in patients with ischemic heart disease

MPS is contraindicated for routine assessment of patients after coronary angioplasty or CABG

**Before Non-cardiac Surgery**

- Intermediate-risk surgery or vascular surgery and risk factors with poor functional capacity (<4 METS)

MPS is contraindicated in low-risk surgery and intermediate-risk surgery or vascular surgery and good functional class.
