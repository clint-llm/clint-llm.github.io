Most commonly, popliteal artery aneurysms are asymptomatic. If patients exhibit chronic symptoms, these are usually secondary to mass effect and compression of adjacent structures, such as the tibial nerve, which causes leg pain or paresthesias. The popliteal vein also may be compressed, which causes calf swelling. Progressive luminal narrowing of the popliteal artery from thrombus formation may cause an insidious onset of claudication. Approximately 50% of the patients present with bilateral aneurysms.

When an aneurysm acutely thromboses, the most common symptoms are acute lower extremity ischemia resulting in the acute onset of pain, paresthesias, paresis, pallor, and poikilothermia due to either aneurysmal intraluminal thrombosis or distal embolization of thrombus. Distal embolization can manifest as blue toe syndrome and/or acral cyanosis.

Approximately 30% of untreated patients experience acute thrombosis and distal embolization with the risk of possible limb loss. Patients who develop acute thrombosis or embolism have a relatively poor prognosis with a 15% amputation rate due to occlusion of runoff vessels.

The popliteal fossa should be examined bilaterally with the knee in a semi-flexed position. About 60% of patients with popliteal aneurysms have a palpable pulsatile mass at the level of the knee joint.
