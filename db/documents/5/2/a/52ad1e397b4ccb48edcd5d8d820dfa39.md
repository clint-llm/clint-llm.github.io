# Introduction

Opioids, benzodiazepines, stimulants, and other controlled substances are widely prescribed in the medical field, but these medications may also be misused, abused or diverted for nonmedical purposes. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid use (prescription and illicit) was involved in the deaths of 42,249 people in 2016, representing a 5-fold increase from 1999 (Drug Overdose Death Data, CDC). One contributing factor is the increased number of total opioid prescriptions administered.

The Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) was implemented to help mitigate prescription misuse and diversion, as well as to monitor and analyze prescription and dispensing data for controlled substances. The PDMP system consists of independent statewide electronic databases that track prescriptions of controlled substances within that particular state. This data can be utilized by health authorities to obtain timely information on prescribing practices and patient behaviors. The concept of the PDMP dates back as early as 1918 in the state of New York, while California maintains the oldest continuously operating PDMP program since 1939.

# Function

PDMPs have been implemented in 49 of 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 1 United States territory (Guam).

One model is operated through non-mandated use, where prescribers and dispensers access the database voluntarily. Another model involves proactive reporting, where in addition to voluntarily checking databases, prescribers and dispensers also receive unsolicited reports on patients obtaining a dangerous dose or combination of controlled substances, or if they are acquiring prescriptions from multiple providers.

Features of well-functioning and resourceful PDMPs have been described by the CDC, noting requirements to have providers check a state PDMP report prior to prescribing a controlled substance (mandated model), providing real-time data on when controlled substances are dispensed, and permitting access to state health departments to analyze the behavior of the opioid epidemic and assess interventions (Drug Overdose Data, CDC).

Access to PDMP data varies per state law, although healthcare prescribers and pharmacists are usually allowed to obtain reports on patients they are directly treating. Some states provide reports to law enforcement organizations, state Medicaid programs, licensing and regulatory boards, medical examiners, and various research programs.

# Issues of Concern

Major deficiencies are present within the currently deployed PDMPs.

# Clinical Significance

The evidence basis for establishing the positive impact of state-wide PDMPs remains mixed. A recent review by Finley and colleagues in 2017 evaluated outcomes of PDMP implementation in 4 key domains: opioid prescribing, opioid diversion and supply, opioid misuse, and opioid-related morbidity and mortality.

# Other Issues

Similar to all electronic databases, problems that may be encountered include difficulty with obtaining login access, inability to use the database when systems are offline for maintenance and other purposes, lack of integration of comprehensive information into clinical workflow, and presence of incomplete data.

The formation of certain guidelines has also been met with resistance by primary care providers due to the hindrance of patient-provider trust. For instance, some guidelines recommend the use of written agreements (pain contracts) and urine drug screening, which may be interpreted as a confrontational approach by some patients and thus introduce a source of mistrust.

The PDMP has been developed at the level of individual states, leading to considerable variation in policies, query generation, and data reporting.  This lack of consistent data collection and report standardization between states makes it challenging to interpret results for providers needing to access multiple different state-specific PDMPs. It is likely that these PDMP deficiencies have hindered clinical outcomes research.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

All healthcare workers who write prescriptions should be familiar with PDMP. This program has been implemented in 49 of 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 1 United States territory (Guam).
