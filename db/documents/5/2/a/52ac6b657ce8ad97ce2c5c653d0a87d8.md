The main differential for contrecoup injury is the condition of diffuse axonal injury (DAI). In DAI, petechial hemorrhages forms at the gray-white matter junction, corpus callosum, and brainstem. It is theÂ result of traumatic acceleration/deceleration or rotational injuries, not attributed to a direct impact to the skull. It is a frequent cause of persistent vegetative state in patients.
