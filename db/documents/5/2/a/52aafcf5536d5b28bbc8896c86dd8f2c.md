Patient education is of the utmost importance with patients treated for pain. Patients should receive information that facet joint disease is a lifelong and progressive disease. Complete resolution of the patientâ€™s pain is typically not observed, and this is a crucial component of any discussion with the patient. Prevention of disease progression through a healthy lifestyle, diet, and exercise is imperative; this can help reduce the stress on the facet joints, therefore reducing inflammation and pain.
