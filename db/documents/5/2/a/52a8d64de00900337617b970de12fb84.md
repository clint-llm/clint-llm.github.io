Treatment of a branchial cleft cyst is complete surgical excision. If a cyst is found during an infection, the surgeon should allow adequate time for the infection to resolve before scheduling the procedure. Incision and drainage should be avoided if possible as it can make definitive excision more difficult. For treatment of third and fourth branchial cleft cysts, a partial thyroidectomy may be required. Direct laryngoscopy with visualization of any opening in the pyriform sinus can aid in localization of tract. Some consider cautery of pyriform sinus tract alone as adequate for treatment of third and fourth branchial cleft cysts.
