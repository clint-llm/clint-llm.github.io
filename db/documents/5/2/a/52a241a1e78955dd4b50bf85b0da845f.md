Sick sinus syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes cardiology nurses. To improve patient outcomes, clinicians should consider the dual-chamber pacing due to the increased risk of AV block in sinus node dysfunction. Anticoagulation should be addressed in patients with paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmias since these patients are at increased risk of stroke. Dual-chamber pacemaker is recommended in patients with sinus node dysfunction due to increased risk of AV block. Moreover, atrial pacing, attained with a dual-chamber pacemaker, may reduce the incidence of AF and subsequent risk of systemic thromboembolism and stroke compared to patients who receive ventricular pacing only.

The outcomes for most patients with sick sinus syndrome are guarded because of advanced aged and other comorbidities. Failure to anticoagulate in the presence of atrial arrhythmias is another reason for high morbidity of the disorder.
