- Anterior spinal artery - branch of the vertebral artery, supplies the anterior 2/3 of the spinal segment

- Left and right posterior spinal arteries - The pair posterior branches of the vertebral artery supply the posteriorÂ third of the spinal segment

Radiculo-medullary branches from the anterior and posterior spinal arteries and the costocervical trunk anastomose supply the cervical region of the spinal cord. The thoracolumbar segments of the spinal cord receive extra arterial blood supply through radiculo-medullary branches of segmental arteries from the aorta; of note is the great radicular artery called the Adamkiewicz artery.
