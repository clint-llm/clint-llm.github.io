**Who to Scan?**

It is important to remember that less than 25% of individuals present with the classic triad of hypotension, abdominal pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass.

Consider sonographic assessment of the abdominal aorta in the following instances:

- Greater than 50 years old with one of the following: chest, abdominal, flank, groin, or back pain; renal colic; hematuria; or hydronephrosis

- Cardiac Arrest

- Hypotension

- Syncope

- Thromboembolic events to the lower extremities

- Neurologic deficit of the lower extremities

Expert consensus regarding sonographic screening for AAAs in asymptomatic individuals includes the following.

The United States Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) & the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) recommendations:

- Men greater than 65 years who ever smoked

Society for Vascular Surgery recommendations:

- All men age greater than 65

- Women greater than 65 with family history of AAA or who have ever smoked
