**Leydig Cell Tumor**

This differential includes Leydig cell hyperplasia, lymphoma, plasmacytoma, adrenal, testicular rest tumors (in males with congenital adrenal hyperplasia), and Sertoli cell or germ cell tumor. IHC stain with Inh-A (inhibin-A) helps to differentiate from germ cell tumors but not from Sertoli cell tumors. Calretinin is a positive marker for LCT while WT-1 for SCT. SALL4, which is a newer marker, is negative in LCT and positive in GCTs.Â NKX3.1 is expressed routinely in Sertoli cells and P501S in Leydig cells and rete testis epithelium.

**Sertoli Cell Tumors**

These include juvenile GCT, LCT, and mixed Sertoli-Leydig cells. Many tumors classified as SCT not otherwise specified (NOS) can be categorized as juvenile GCT. SCT is positive for cytokeratin and inhibin and is negative for placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP). SALL4 is negative in SCT also.

Other differentials include testicular lymphoma, hydrocoele, varicocele, epidydimal malignancies, scrotal malignancies, epididymo-orchitis.
