Corns are thick round skin lesions typically appearing on the toes. Repetitive rubbing or pressure (e.g., shoe) is the leading cause of corns. Corns have a hardened central core, whereas calluses do not. Certain deformities, such as hammertoes, can cause corns as the crocked toes rub on the shoes.

Numerous treatment options for corns exist, ranging from conservative to surgical approaches. Results and patient satisfaction are very good. Foot and ankle surgeons can provide the best treatment options when corns become exceptionally painful. The recurrence rate is high unless the underlying cause of the corn is not addressed. Due to the potential to create a wound or serious infection, it is best to avoid self-removal at home and use medicated corn pads.

Patients with peripheral neuropathies should try to avoid the application of plasters that contain salicylic acid because these plasters might cause sloughing of normal skin if placed incorrectly. Calluses and corns are not caused by viruses and are not contagious. Patients should be instructed to trim their nails and wear wider shoes to avoid any pressure or repeated trauma, which might lead to the development of corns.
