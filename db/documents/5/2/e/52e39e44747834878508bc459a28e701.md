Educating women about the physiology behind post-menopausal symptoms is essential so that they can understand the changes that occur with decreased estrogen. Many women are embarrassed and shy to talk about this topic. Primary care clinicians and obstetricians-gynecologists should ask and encourage women to talk about their symptoms. Providers will better be able to offer advice, tips, and education, as indicated.

An interprofessional healthcare team approach is the optimal path to follow when initiating or considering initiating estradiol therapy. The family clinician and gynecologist should coordinate their efforts. A pharmacist should review the patient's medication record, verify that dosing is appropriate, and counsel the patient regarding potential adverse effects to report these to the prescriber should they present. Nursing must also assist the team by counseling the patient so they are aware of possible adverse events. They can also monitor the patient on follow-up visits and determine how effectively the patient responds to treatment. This interprofessional team paradigm optimizes treatment and avoids adverse events, thereby improving patient outcomes. [Level 5]
