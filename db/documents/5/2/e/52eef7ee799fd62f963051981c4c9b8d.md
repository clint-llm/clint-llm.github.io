If there is a bile duct injury or leak noted intraoperatively, the surgeon must decide whether he has adequate training, staff, and resources to evaluate and treat the injury appropriately. If the surgeon decides to proceed, cholangiography must be performed to delineate anatomy and plan treatment.

In patients presenting postoperatively, an abdominal ultrasound can identify the presence of a fluid collection in the gallbladder fossa or ductal dilation, which can pair with clinical findings of abdominal pain and hyperbilirubinemia to indicate the presence of a bile leak. CT scan is very sensitive to evaluate free fluid within the abdomen. A HIDA scan

There are many proposed classification systems of injuries to the bile duct.

The Strasberg-Bismuth classification defines injuries and biliary strictures based on their anatomic location within the biliary system relating to the biliary confluence.

The McMahon classification system classifies injuries after laparoscopic cholecystectomy as either major or minor based on the depth of injury. A laceration of less than 25% of the circumference of the common bile duct or cystic-CBD confluence ranks as a minor injury. A complete transection or laceration greater than 25% to the CBD or any postoperative bile duct stricture is a major injury.

The Stewart-Way classification system stratifies injuries based on mechanism after examining surgeon operative reports and the described process of injury.
