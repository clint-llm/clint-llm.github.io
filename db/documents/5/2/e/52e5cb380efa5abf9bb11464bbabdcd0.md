Electrical alternans is most commonly attributed to pericardial effusion and tamponade pathology. In this scenario, the classic ECG rhythm is due to the pendulum-like motion and rotation of the heart from beat to beat manifesting as varied amplitudes when detected by the ECG electrodes. Electrical alternans is also seen in conduction and refractory changes in various rhythms including those mentioned above resulting in varied QRS amplitudes as detected by the electrodes. The mechanism that leads to these ECG changes will be further discussed in pathophysiology.
