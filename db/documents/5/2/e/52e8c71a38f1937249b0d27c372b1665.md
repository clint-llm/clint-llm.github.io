Prognosis of tibial fractures can be evaluated using the RUST (Radiographic Union Score for Tibial fractures) score, in which all the bone cortices are evaluated, looking for the presence/absence of fracture line and bone callus. The Nonunion Risk Determination (NURD) score considered are the RUST scores, open/closed fracture, compartment syndrome, fracture classification (IIIB tibia), concomitant chronic disease, smoking status, infection, female sex, and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score. This model allows the clinician to identify those patients at risk of nonunion within 3 months of injury

The reported average healing time for cases of aseptic tibial nonunion treated with reaming and exchange nailing was from 5 to 9 months
