The mediastinum is a cavity that separates the lungs from the other structures in the chest. Generally, it is further divided into three main parts: anterior mediastinum, posterior mediastinum, and middle mediastinum. Cancers in the mediastinum can develop from structures that are anatomically located inside the mediastinum or that transverse through the mediastinum during development, and also from metastases or malignancies that originate elsewhere in the body.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of mediastinal cancers.
- Explain how the history and physical examination findings usually vary by the type of mediastinal cancer, where it is located, and the aggressiveness of the tumor.
- Discuss the tests performed most commonly to diagnose and evaluate mediastinal cancers.
- Review strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by cancer of the mediastinum.
