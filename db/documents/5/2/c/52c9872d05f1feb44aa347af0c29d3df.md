Acquired hemophilia can lead to several complications if the appropriate treatment is not initiated in a timely fashion. A few common complications include

- **Intramuscular Bleeding:**These episodes can be severe and can result in compartment syndrome or even tissue death due to pressure on neurovascular structures.

- **Mucosal Bleeding:**Nasal (epistaxis), gastrointestinal, genitourinary (hematuria), respiratory (hemoptysis) bleed can occur.

- **Bleeding From the Wound/Operative Site:**Invasive procedures, including surgeries and arterial puncture procedures, can predispose a patient with AHA to a life-threatening and uncontrollable hemorrhage.

- Intracranial hemorrhages (rare).

- Intra-articular bleeding episodes that frequently occur in congenital hemophilia are, however, uncommon in the acquired form.

- Large spontaneous subcutaneous hematomas.
