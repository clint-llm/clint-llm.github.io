The only proven option in managing HIV encephalitis HART has proved to be of benefit in patients with HIV encephalitis, with significant improvements demonstrated in neuropsychiatric and cognitive test scores. The treatment has been shown to decrease and effectively reverse the pathologic damage caused by HIV clinically and radiographically.Â ART also helps to delay or prevent the onset of neurocognitive impairment in patients with HIV disease.

Drug regimens that have higher CNS penetrance have been proven to be of better effect in managing patients with HIV encephalitis.

In patients diagnosed with HIV-associated dementia in whom initiation of ART is planned, the preferred regimen is tenofovir, dolutegravir plus emtricitabine, or a combination of lamivudine, abacavir plus dolutegravir.

Drugs such as lithium, memantine, and minocycline have not proven beneficial in patients with HIV encephalitis.
