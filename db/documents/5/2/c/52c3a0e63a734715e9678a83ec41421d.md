There are four muscles involved in the boundaries of the cubital fossa.

Pronator teres forms the medial border of the fossa. It receives nerve supply from the median nerve, and its main action is the pronation of the forearm. The pronator teres has two heads - the ulnar head originating from the coronoid process of the ulna and the humeral head originating from the medial epicondyle, the heads come together to attach to the midshaft of the radius. The median nerve passes through the two heads in 75 to 80% of the population.

Brachioradialis forms the lateral border of the cubital fossa. It receives nerve supply from the radial nerve, and despite originating from the posterior compartment of the forearm, it acts to flex the forearm. It originates from the distal humerus at the lateral supracondylar ridge and attaches to the distal radius.

Brachialis forms the proximal aspect of the floor. It receives nerve supply from the musculocutaneous nerve, and it is a weak flexor of the forearm. It originates from the shaft of the humerus and inserts into the ulna tuberosity of the ulna.

The supinator forms the distal aspect of the floor. Its nerve supply is from the posterior interosseus branch of the radial nerve, and its function is the supination of the forearm. It has two heads, with one from the lateral humeral epicondyle, and the other originating from the posterior ulna. They come together and insert into the posterior radius.
