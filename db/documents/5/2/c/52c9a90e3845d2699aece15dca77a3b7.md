# Introduction

Oligodendroglioma (OG) is a type of diffusely infiltrating glioma and constitutes approximately 5% of primary intracranial tumors.

# Etiology

OGs were originally named by Bailey and Bucy in 1929 because of their resemblance to oligodendrocytes when viewed under the microscope. However, there is unclear evidence that they arise from mature oligodendrocytes.

# Epidemiology

OGs are uncommon, with an incidence of 0.2 per 100,000 people and are the third most common primary brain neoplasm after glioblastoma and diffuse astrocytoma. OGs comprise approximately 5% of all primary CNS tumors.

OGs have a slight bimodal distribution but are predominantly an adult neoplasm with a peak incidence in the fourth and fifth decades and a smaller peak of tumor incidence that occurs in children 6 to 12 years of age.

# Pathophysiology

OGs are found predominantly in the cerebral hemisphere white matter (80 to 90% supratentorial), most commonly in the frontal lobes, but temporal and parietal lobe involvement is not uncommon. The tumor predominates in the cortical-subcortical location with diffuse infiltration throughout the adjacent white matter. OG has also been found to be intraventricular or subependymal, but this is rare.

# Histopathology

The traditional macroscopic appearance of OG demonstrates a gelatinous gray mass, often with cystic areas and small focal hemorrhages, and there are often macroscopic calcifications.

The microscopic appearance typically demonstrates sheets of regular cells with spherical nuclei surrounded by clear cytoplasm and perinuclear halo, described as a “fried-egg” appearance. This appearance is due to routine processing with formalin and paraffin fixation. There is a network of thin blood vessels distributed throughout the tumor, described as a “chicken-wire” pattern in appearance. There are scattered calcifications and psammoma bodies within the tumor. Myelin-like structures can also be seen on the surface but do not meet all the qualifications for a myelin sheath.

Histologically, OGs can show markers seen in oligodendrocyte and astrocyte cell lineages. For example, OGs lack myelin basic protein (MBP), which is found in myelin-producing oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. They can stain positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker of astrocytes.

# History and Physical

Clinically, patients with OG most often present with non-specific symptoms such as headache. However, seizures are also a very common presenting symptom, and reported in 35 to 85% of individuals, with some studies as high as 91% of participants.

# Evaluation

Often, non-contrast-enhanced computed tomography (NECT) is the initial imaging tool for nonspecific neurologic symptoms, typically because of the desire to quickly evaluate for intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic infarction, or other acute abnormality. On NECT, OGs typically appear as a hypodense or sometimes isodense peripheral mass that may appear cortically based with focal gyral expansion. Because of their peripheral cortical-subcortical location and slow-growing nature, calvarial remodeling may be seen. Coarse calcification is also a common finding, seen in up to 90% of cases. More specifically, a gyriform pattern of cortical calcification is more favorable to represent an OG.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a better characterization of the tumor than CT and can help define the true extent and infiltrative nature of OG. T2 weighted sequences demonstrate a circumscribed heterogeneously hyperintense tumor that is often cortical/subcortical in location and may have a mild peri-tumoral hyperintense signal. There are frequently small areas of cystic change, microhemorrhage, and macroscopic calcifications demonstrated with T2 hypointense signal due to susceptibility signal loss and increased tumor heterogeneity. OGs are hypointense to gray matter on T1 weighted imaging, and enhancement in low-grade tumors is common, ranging from patchy enhancement to moderate enhancement, and enhancement does not necessarily correspond to higher grade OG. OG typically has facilitated, rather than restricted diffusion, with hyperintensity on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.

More advanced MRI techniques such as spectroscopy and perfusion may be complementary to anatomic imaging and may be helpful in characterizing and grading the tumor. However, since most OGs are low grade, these advanced imaging techniques may not add much additional information to the more traditional anatomic imaging. Spectroscopy tends to show a mildly elevated choline and decreased N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) peaks, seen in most neoplasms, and is more prominent in high-grade versus low-grade gliomas due to increased mitotic activity. There may be elevated myoinositol, and the presence of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) suggests IDH mutation status.

Preoperative evaluation of white matter tracts using MRI diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences and tractography can demonstrate the position and proximity of white matter tracts to the tumor and typically shows displacement rather than the destruction of white matter tracts. Additional evaluation with functional MRI (fMRI) can also show the proximity of the tumor to the eloquent cortex, such as important language, motor, sensory, and visual areas.

The MRI imaging appearance alone is insufficient to distinguish OG from other intracranial neoplasms, especially other low-grade tumors, and histopathologic evaluation and genetic marker testing are required for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. All patients with a tumor will require a biopsy for diagnosis. In 2016 the WHO changed the criteria for the classification of CNS tumors to include both phenotypic and genotypic analysis. The diagnosis of OG is now made using molecular markers, and the tumor must possess both an IDH1 or IDH2 mutation and 1p/19q codeletion to be classified as an OG.

# Treatment / Management

Treatment of OG is multifactorial, consisting of surgical, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy treatment methods.

Surgical treatments are approached on a case-by-case basis. Tumor location, patient comorbidities, and other surgical risk factors are used to decide on the type of surgery. Complete, or gross total, resection is the primary treatment of choice. This leads to increased overall survival time and can be curative. Thus all attempts are made to achieve this level if possible.

Surgical resection techniques depend on the location of the OG, as the eloquent cortex and vital structures need to be spared. The location of craniotomy utilized for each approach and access will vary, and some surgeons prefer to perform the resection on an awake patient in order to stimulate, test, and map adjacent parenchyma to help determine the extent of tissue that can safely be removed. Intraoperative imaging techniques, such as intraoperative MRI or ultrasound, have also been used to assist in improving the extent of resection. These adjunct imaging techniques may be more efficacious than standard stereotactic navigation but also increases operative time and may require special equipment and training. The use of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) fluorescent dye can also be a helpful surgical tool. 5-ALA is a heme precursor that has been shown to cause fluorescence in malignant tissue by creating fluorescent porphyrins and can be evaluated intraoperatively. It has also been shown to have statistically significant improvement in the extent of resection of high-grade gliomas over conventional stereotactic navigation, and overall similar in efficacy to intraoperative MRI, though it has only been shown in smaller sample sizes.

Radiation oncology with radiotherapy (RT) also plays an important role in the treatment of OG, most often after surgical resection. There does not appear to be a difference in overall survival between early or delayed postoperative RT, but an increased time to progression has been shown with early treatment, in addition to better seizure control following surgery.

Standard focal or limited field hyperfractionated RT is typically employed. The field consists of the resection bed, area of residual enhancement on T1 post-contrast imaging, and a margin of up to 3 cm, including the adjacent T2/FLAIR hyperintensity that may represent infiltrating disease. This margin is modified to minimize the involvement of critical structures or if microscopic/infiltrating disease is thought to be less likely.

RT is usually withheld from children to minimize some of the negative long-term effects of radiation, such as cognitive impairment, personality changes, hypopituitarism, motor and coordination abnormalities, and the development of other neoplasms.

In addition to RT, chemotherapy is a commonly used adjunct, demonstrating increased survival in RT/chemotherapy groups compared to RT alone.

An additional, non-cytotoxic treatment is approved for use in the USA, Canada, and parts of Europe for recurrent glioblastoma but may also have a beneficial use for anaplastic OGs that demonstrate increased vascularity as evidenced by enhancement and peritumoral edema on MRI. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and these antibodies bind to the VEGF receptors decreasing neovascularization, permeability and help to stabilize the blood-brain barrier. This eventually leads to less peritumoral edema and decreased need for corticosteroids, improving symptoms, and in some studies, progression-free survival, though this treatment overall appears limited to recurrent disease, palliative treatment, and in patients suffering from radiation brain necrosis.

# Differential Diagnosis

Diffuse astrocytoma is the primary differential diagnosis on imaging and is nearly indistinguishable from OG. Diffuse astrocytoma often has less dystrophic calcification on imaging and often has more white matter and less cortical involvement than OG. However, the main discriminating factors are genetic markers, namely, the lack of 1p/19q deletion in astrocytoma.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is an important diagnostic consideration from OG, as they have a much poorer prognosis and are unfortunately much more common. GBM will typically have more avid and heterogeneous enhancement (though it may be harder to distinguish from higher-grade, enhancing anaplastic OG). GBM sometimes have patchy areas of restricted diffusion and areas of central necrosis, both uncommon in OG. Calcification is uncommon in GBM and very common in OG. Histologically, GBM will have more aggressive features, such as necrosis and neovascularization, and they lack the 1p/19q deletion and are often IDH compared to OG.

Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNET) is another low-grade cortical/subcortical based neoplasm that can look similar to OG, although DNETs tend to have a more “bubbly” cystic T2 hyperintense appearance and may have adjacent cortical dysplasia. They are also more often found in children and young adults, as opposed to OGs, which are more often diagnosed in older adults.

Ganglioglioma is another cortical/subcortical neoplasm that occurs more often in children and young adults and can be a seizure focus. Gangliogliomas typically present as a cyst with enhancing nodule on MRI and are more commonly seen in the temporal lobe as opposed to OG.

A multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor (MVNT) is a cortical/subcortical lesion that may have imaging overlap with OG and typically appears as a cluster of small bubbly cysts that are T2/FLAIR hyperintense and do not typically enhance. The lesion is typically incidentally found and maybe a malformation/dysplastic lesion as opposed to a true neoplasm.

# Prognosis

Low-grade OG (WHO Grade II), which by definition have 1p/19q deletion and IDHmt, have a better prognosis than other astrocytomas without these genetic markers. OGs have a median survival time of 10-12 years and 5-year progression-free and overall survival rates of 51-83%. Younger patients, patients without other comorbidities, and those with a greater extent of tumor resection also tend to do better.

# Complications

Complications from OG may include seizure, postsurgical complications, and thromboembolic events, chemotherapy side effects including myelosuppression limiting treatment with PCV, as well as nausea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal symptoms with TMZ, and long-term effects of radiation, such as cognitive deficits, gait abnormalities, or radiation necrosis. Residual or recurrent OG can also undergo malignant degeneration over time.

# Pearls and Other Issues

OG is a low-grade (WHO Grade II) CNS neoplasm that shares many imaging characteristics with other astrocytomas, and tissue sampling is essential in diagnosis. OG is defined by its IDHmt and 1p/19q deletion status and several imaging features that suggest OG as opposed to astrocytoma to include course calcification and cortical-subcortical location.

OG is chemo- and radiosensitive with a good prognosis when compared to other glial neoplasms, and higher-grade anaplastic OG (WHO Grade III) has a worse prognosis.

Current studies are ongoing to evaluate the best combinations of RT and chemotherapy regimens, as well as evaluating other targeted therapies.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

OG is the third most common glial neoplasm, and although it is a low-grade tumor, it can present significant morbidity depending on its location relative to the eloquent cortex and its preponderance for producing seizures. An interprofessional team working together to coordinate the care of these patients is vital. OG is a slow-growing, infiltrative lesion that is most commonly seen in older adults in their 4th and 5th decades. Early diagnosis and complete surgical resection lead to improved outcomes, and the chemo- and radiosensitive nature of OG results in the tumor often responding well to therapy and have a much better prognosis compared to other astrocytomas.
