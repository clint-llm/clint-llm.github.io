Diseases of the retina divide into two categories, those involving the death of photoreceptors (rods and cones) at the outer nuclear layer and those involving cells in the inner retina such as the bipolar and ganglion cells.

Diseases of the photoreceptors (rods and cones) are characterizable by their pattern of cellular and visual loss.

- **Retinitis pigmentosa**- rods affected first, then cones; peripheral vision loss precedes central loss

- **Leber’s congenital amaurosis**- rods affected first, then cones OR both rods and cones; peripheral vision loss precedes central loss

- **Macular degeneration**- RPE (retinal pigment epithelium), cones, & rods affected; central vision loss precedes peripheral loss

- **Stargardt disease**- RPE, cones, & rods affected; central vision loss precedes peripheral loss

- **Cone-rod dystrophy**- cones affected first, then rods; peripheral vision loss precedes central loss

- **Retinoschisis**- rods, cones, & bipolar cells affected; both central and peripheral vision loss

- **Congenital stationary night blindness**- affects the connection between photoreceptors & bipolar cells, uniform vision loss

Diseases of the inner retina:

- **Glaucoma**- ganglion cells involved; peripheral vision loss

- **Optic nerve neuropathy**- ganglion cells involved; uniform vision loss

When viewed using histological methods, retinal pathology can appear structurally disorganized. For example, rosette-like structures can present in diseases of the retina, including retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic retinopathy, and retinoblastoma.
