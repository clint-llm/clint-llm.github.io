When taking a history from a patient with suspected labyrinthitis, it is important to screen for risk factors. These include recent viral infections (commonly upper respiratory tract infections), cholesteatoma or history of ear surgery, history of temporal bone or skull fracture, meningitis, and acute/chronic otitis media.

Nausea, vomiting, and severe ‘room spinning’ vertigo are the most common symptoms of labyrinthitis.

On examination, patients will often display nystagmus; the fast phase will move away from the affected ear. Patients may also present with gait and balance disturbances; therefore, both Romberg’s and tandem gait are critical components of the required comprehensive neurological examination (including cerebellar and meningeal tests). Rinne and Weber hearing tests will likely demonstrate sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear, and formal audiological evaluation is required if the patient reports any hearing abnormalities. Otoscopy may give clues to the etiology of the disease, e.g., otitis media or cholesteatoma. Finally, if querying bacterial meningitis, thoroughly examine the patient for the classical non-blanching rash.
