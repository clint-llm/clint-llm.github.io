For stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, the indication is for a continuous intravenous drip administration. Dopamine half-life in the systemic circulation is between 1 to 5 minutes; thus, slower forms of administration, such as oral administration, are typically ineffective.

In addition to its peripheral sympathetic effects, DA is also critical for neurological movement function in Parkinson’s disease.
