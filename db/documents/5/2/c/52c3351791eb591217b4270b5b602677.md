The DASH diet is a nutritionally based approach to prevent and control hypertension. The diet has been tested in several clinical trials and has been shown to lower cholesterol, saturated fats, and blood pressure. The DASH diet has been recommended as the best diet to help people who want to lose weight, maintain a healthy weight and lower the blood pressure. The key fact is that this diet needs to be promoted to patients. Besides clinicians, both nurses and pharmacists play a key role in educating patients about the benefits of this diet. Before discharge, nurses are in a prime position to educate all patients and their families about the DASH diet and its benefits. Similarly, when patients visit a pharmacy, the pharmacist should educate the patient about the DASH diet. The most important feature about the DASH diet is that it requires a lifestyle change and adopt a healthy way to eat. In addition, patients should be urged to stop smoking, abstain from alcohol, and do some physical activity regularly.

**Outcomes**

The DASH diet has been well studied in many clinical trials, and most of them have been associated with lowering blood pressure. Further, there is evidence to show that the DASH diet also lowers the risk of adverse cardiac events, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Unfortunately, compliance with the diet remains low. Outside of clinical trials, there are limited studies on the long-term effectiveness of the DASH diet.
