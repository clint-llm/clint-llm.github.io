Phenol is a historical disinfectant with continued use in industry, laboratories, and some health care settings. Phenol is a protoplasmic poison that can result in multisystem organ failure in severe toxicity. This activity will describe the mechanisms of toxicity of phenol, the expected clinical manifestations of phenol toxicity, and the management of phenol poisoned patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical effects seen with systemic phenol toxicity.
- Identify the correct decontamination fluid for dermal phenol exposure.
- Explain the mechanism of toxicity of phenol.
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional team communication when managing a patient with multisystem organ failure due to severe phenol toxicity.
