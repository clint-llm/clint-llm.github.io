The main differential diagnosis is photosensitivity associated with lupus erythematosus, which may behave and appear similar but tends to be more persistent. Solar urticaria occurs during or shortly after exposure and resolves within an hour or soÂ of covering up. Photosensitivity dermatitis is more persistent with eczematous morphology.
