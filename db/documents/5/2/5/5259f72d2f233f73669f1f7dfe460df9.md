The dorsal interossei receive innervation from the deep palmar branch of the ulnar nerve. As such, injury to the ulnar nerve can manifest as weakness or even atrophy of the interossei muscles and is typically caused by nerve root impingement, brachial plexus compression, or nerve entrapment at the elbow, forearm, or wrist. Ulnar nerve entrapment is the second most prevalent compression with which neuropathy patients present.

Several clinical examinations are used to assess the integrity of ulnar nerve function. Clinicians can evaluate dorsal interossei by instructing a patient to abduct their second through fifth digits against the clinicianâ€™s resistance. A weakness of this action would indicate an ulnar nerve injury.
