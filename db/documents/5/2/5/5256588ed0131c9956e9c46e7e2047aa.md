Plasma cell neoplasms are a group of disorders involving mature B-cells. These disorders result in the excessive production of specific monoclonal heavy-chain immunoglobulins. This class of neoplasms includes monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), plasmacytoma, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition diseases, plasma cell myeloma (PCM), and plasma cell neoplasms with associated paraneoplastic syndromes. This activity reviews the presentation and evaluation of the different plasma cell neoplasms and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in their management.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the risk factors for plasma cell neoplasms.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a plasma cell neoplasm.
- Summarize the treatment options for plasma cell neoplasms.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by plasma cell neoplasms.
