The differential for medial elbow pain remains narrow, given its specific anatomical location. Important diagnoses to rule out are ulnar collateral ligament tear, medial epicondylopathy, ulnar neuropathy, or local muscular injury. Partial or full thickness UCL tear presents similar signs and symptoms as medial epicondyle apophysitis, but the patient is usually greater than 15 years old.

Ulnar neuropathy should be suspected if there is associated paresthesia in an ulnar nerve distribution.
