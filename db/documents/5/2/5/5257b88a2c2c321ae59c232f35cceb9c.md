A pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) is a rare pulmonary condition described as a pathologic right-to-left shunt which impairs gas exchange and normal filtration of venous blood through the pulmonary circulation. PAVMs are most commonly associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). This activity reviews the evaluation and management of PAVM to prevent complications and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.
- Describe the physical exam findings of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.
- Summarize the treatment options for patients with pulmonary arteriovenous malformation.
- Review pulmonary arteriovenous malformation and summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance patient care and improve outcomes for patients affected by this condition.
