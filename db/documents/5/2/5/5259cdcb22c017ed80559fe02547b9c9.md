The goal for surgical repair of a pulmonary artery sling (PAS) is to adjust the left pulmonary artery so that it no longer travels between the trachea and esophagus - to relieve the compression.  It is also essential to ensure long-term patency of the vascular supply to the left lung. The congenital tracheal stenosis or intracardiac lesions can be addressed simultaneously during the same operation.

There are two types of surgical repair techniques for an anomalous origin of the left pulmonary artery from the right pulmonary artery: 1) reimplantation of the left pulmonary artery into the main pulmonary artery, 2) tracheal transaction, and left pulmonary artery translocation. PAS can be performed from a left thoracotomy or median sternotomy.

The procedure is initiated similarly to other open cardiac surgery procedures. A median sternotomy is done, and cannulation is performed for cardiopulmonary bypass. Mild hypothermia for temperature target is about 32 degrees Celsius. Bicaval venous cannulation and cardioplegic arrest are recommended if concomitant intra-cardiac lesions need to be repaired as well. The ligamentum arteriosum or patent ductus arteriosus should also be ligated. The left pulmonary artery is dissected and usually arises from the posterior/right pulmonary artery. It is ligated from the anomalous origin on the right pulmonary artery, brought anterior to the trachea, and reimplanted to the main pulmonary artery.

There is some controversy surrounding the optimal tracheal repair for long-segment congenital tracheal stenosis.

Grillo and associates describe this surgical technique for long-segment stenosis.

In planning complex procedures and surgical repair of multiple abnormalities, the order can vary depending on preferred techniques. If a tracheal repair needs to be performed, this can be done after left pulmonary artery reimplantation. Bronchoscopy can also be performed at this part of the procedure. Sengupta and Murthy present a detailed operative approach for concomitant tracheal stenosis and PAS repair, preferring to complete the tracheal surgery before cardiac defect repair.  Some tracheal release maneuvers may need to be performed, including a "Montgomery-type supra-hyoid release" to allow a tension-free anastomosis. An endotracheal tube (ETT) should be secured at the portion of the tracheal anastomosis. Bronchoscopy should be performed to clear the airway and identify residual stenosis. A leak test should also be performed with saline and increasing airway pressure with a Valsalva maneuver. A "Grillo" stitch can also be placed after the chest is closed, which anchors the chin down to the chest wall to prevent extension and disruption of the anastomosis postoperatively.

When right-sided lung hypoplasia is present, additionally, an aortopexy can be beneficial to move the aorta away from the airway.
