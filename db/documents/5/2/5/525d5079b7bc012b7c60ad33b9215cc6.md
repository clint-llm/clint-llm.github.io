When a clinician detects the findings described above, a thorough exam is mandatory to start the search for other signs that could help in making the diagnosis of a neurocutaneous disorder. The diagnosis of neurocutaneous syndromes is clinical, and studies are usually helpful to confirm the diagnosis and to counsel the family. To diagnose a patient with NF1, the patient has to meet 2 or more criteria. These criteria are six or more café-au-lait macules larger than 5 mm in prepubertal children or larger than 15 mm after puberty, skinfold freckling, two or more neurofibromas, or one plexiform neurofibroma, long bone or sphenoid wing dysplasia, optic glioma, Lisch nodules or a first-degree relative with NF1.

A child with a risk for NF 2, because of a first-degree relative affected with the disorder, should undergo evaluation by an audiologist, followed up with a head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if any abnormalities. A child diagnosed with NF2 requires at least an MRI of the brain by adolescence.

TSC is also a disorder in which the diagnosis is clinical. For the clinician to make the diagnosis, the patient has to meet two major criteria or 1 major and 2 or more minor criteria. The major criteria are three or more hypopigmented macules of at least five mm of diameter, three or more angiofibromas or a fibrous cephalic plaque, two or more ungual fibromas, a shagreen patch, multiple retinal hamartomas, cortical dysplasias, subependymal nodules, a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, a cardiac rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphangioleiomyosarcomatosis and two or more angiomyolipomas. Minor criteria are: several small hypopigmented lesions grouped together, also called “confetti” skin lesions, three or more dental enamel pits, two or more intraoral fibromas, a retinal achromic patch, multiple renal cysts, and nonrenal hamartomas.
