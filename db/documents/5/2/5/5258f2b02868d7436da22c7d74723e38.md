Obtain an electrocardiogram to evaluate for active ischemia or evidence of previous infarction.

Obtain a chest x-ray to assist in ruling out noncardiac explanations for chest pain (i.e., infection, trauma, pneumothorax, etc.)

Obtain a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, and troponin. Lab work is important in risk stratification purposes and ruling out noncardiac explanations (i.e., anemia, infection, renal disease, etc.)

Use previous work up to risk stratify, consider stress testing versus further coronary evaluation in moderate to high-risk individuals.
