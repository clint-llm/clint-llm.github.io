The divisions of the lower leg are made up by intermuscular septa that are extensions of the overlying fascia. Within the posterior compartment of the leg, an additional septum further separates the compartment into two additional layers; superficial and deep. It was traditionally felt that the fascia overlying specialized organs and tissues within the body are irrelevant and only served to hold in place a particular tissue type.

The three muscles within the superficial posterior compartment include the gastrocnemius, soleus, and plantaris muscles. Together these three muscles form the triceps surae.

Gait is most commonly subdivided into a stance phase and a swing phase (although additional phases can exist depending on clinical scenario).
