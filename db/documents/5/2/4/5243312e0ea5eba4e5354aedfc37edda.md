Corticobulbar tact receives supply from branches of the middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, and basilar artery.

Thrombosis, embolism, rupture, trauma, or compression of a blood vessel supplying genu of the internal capsule can cause injury to corticobulbar and adjacent tracts. As in the internal capsule, tracts are closely packed, infarction of small areas can lead to damage of several descending and ascending tracts.
