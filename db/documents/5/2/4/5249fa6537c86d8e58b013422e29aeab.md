Subspecialist consultation depends on the results of the patient’s physical examination and any applicable laboratory testing and/or imaging. Simple fractures of the femur, tibia, fibula, and foot require splinting with cast application within one week by a pediatric orthopedic surgeon. If the fracture is complex, for example, angulated or associated dislocation, then prompt consultation with a pediatric orthopedist is indicated. If any lesions are encountered on imaging that suggests malignancy, both pediatric oncology, and pediatric orthopedics should be promptly consulted before the disposition of the child. Laboratory studies that suggest osteomyelitis should indicate consultation with both pediatric orthopedics and pediatric infectious disease.
