Initial laboratory investigation in a suspected case of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) should include routine urinalysis with urine cytology,, especially if urothelial tumors are suspected. Assessment of anemia and platelets should be done with a complete blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Renal function tests and electrolytes to assess renal insufficiency in order to help make decisions on the use of contrast for radiologic tests.

RCC is frequently associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, which include hypercalcemia, erythrocytosis, and non-metastatic hepatic dysfunction (Stauffer syndrome), etc. Thus, laboratory studies in the evaluation of RCC should include exploration for the paraneoplastic syndromes. Liver function tests help rule out hepatic metastasis and paraneoplastic (non-metastatic) hepatic involvement. Serum calcium and other tests should be included based on the patientâ€™s clinical presentation.

Imaging studies provide both diagnostic confirmation and help plan management. It is important to differentiate between the distinct histologic subtypes of the common RCCs. It is possible to non-invasively discriminate the subtypes based on gross morphologic imaging appearances, signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRI), and the degree of tumor enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography imaging.

The tests most commonly utilized are as follows:

- Renal ultrasonography (often the initial study)

- The initial study may include CT excretory urogram.

- Confirmation is done by a staging CT of the abdomen and pelvis.

- Chest X-ray or CT scan for lung metastasis

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for venous invasion and metastatic tumor progression

- Renal arteriography and venography after RCC have been confirmed, and inferior vena cava involvement is suspected.

- Bone scan and alkaline phosphatase levels to diagnose or assess bone metastasis and follow-up

- CT head, if cerebral metastasis is suspected or clinical picture suggests metastasis.

- MRI may also be used where contrast cannot be used due to patient tolerance

- Urgent magnetic resonance imaging should be performed to rule out cord compression, and high-dose dexamethasone therapy should be started.

- Where the hereditary disease is suspected, either due to the young age at presentation or RCC patients with a family history of the disease, genetic testing for a familial syndrome should be performed.

- Ultrasound or CT guided percutaneous needle biopsy can be done for suspicious lesions and cystic lesions suspected to be malignant.

Biomarker development is a rapidly growing field in oncology as a potential tool for diagnosis and prognosis. Although serum and urinary compounds have been evaluated e.g., TNF, HSP27, serum amyloid A, osteopontin, etc. in serum and nuclear matrix proteins-22, neutrophil gelatinases, aquaporin-1, kidney injury molecule-1, etc. in urine; no serum or urinary biomarker has yet received validation for RCC. Imaging remains the mainstay in RCC for diagnosis, screening, follow-up, and treatment monitoring.
