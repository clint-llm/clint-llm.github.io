In open cardiac procedures, such as coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), the left atrial appendage is often isolated or ligated. This process is especially important in patients with a history of AF, as isolation and catheter ablation correlates with a decrease in AF recurrence and a reduction in stroke risk.

Furthermore, the addition of LAA occlusion added no significant extra time to heart bypass during the concomitant procedure being performed. Despite removing the proposed source of embolic stroke from circulation, the authors did not recommend ceasing therapeutic anticoagulation following LAA occlusion, given the lack of evidence comparing LAA occlusion alone versus anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Interestingly, despite a hypothesized increase in heart failure one might observe in patients following LAA occlusion owing to the physiologically impaired ability to excrete sodium and water in volume overload from reduced atrial natriuretic peptide production, there was no statistical difference in the incidence of heart failure between the groups in LAAOS III, either immediately post-operatively or at long-term follow-up.

Although providing solid evidence for the use of LAA in the cardiac surgery setting for patients with atrial fibrillation, there remains a question as to the best way to manage ischaemic stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation who do not have cardiac surgery planned. Any surgical intervention carries risk, and randomized control trials are needed to interrogate the relative benefit of continuing anticoagulation alone or undertaking LAA occlusion in patients with atrial fibrillation with no cardiac surgery planned.
