NMS is a medical emergency that is best managed by an interprofessional team. These patients are ideally managed in the ICU with very close nursing monitoring and reporting to the team. A pharmacist trained in toxicology and a toxicologist should be involved in assisting with treatment and management decisions. The key is hydration and supportive therapy. There is no specific drug to reverse this disorder. Anecdotal reports on dantrolene continue to appear but a few case studies indicate that the drug may neither be effective or safe.

For most patients in whom the offending drug is discontinued, the prognosis is good. An interprofessional approach to the education of the family, monitoring, and treatment by clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists will provide the best outcomes. [Levell 5]
