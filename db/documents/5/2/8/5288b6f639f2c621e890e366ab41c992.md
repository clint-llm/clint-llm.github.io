Most treatment options offered for patients experiencing homonymous hemianopsia involve forms of rehabilitation. One option utilizes prisms to project the image from the visual field defect side to the intact side. This can allow the patient to see what is in their blind spot, though it tends to be disorienting.

More commonly are therapies anchored on working with the visual field loss. For instance, programs aimed at teaching patients how to read with assistance (following the text with a finger) or move their eyes into the field loss (saccadic training) may improve overall functionality.
