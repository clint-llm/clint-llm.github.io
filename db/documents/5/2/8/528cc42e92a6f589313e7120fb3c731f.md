Regenerative medicine has been in existence for many decades, and many therapies have received Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approval for wound healing and orthopedic applications. Regenerative medicine is a field that applies biological science principles to promote regeneration by delivering or replacing organs, cells, or tissues in an attempt to restore diseased and damaged tissues and whole organs.

Viscosupplementation: Injection of hyaluronic acid (HA) into intra-articular space can restore viscosity and elasticity of osteoarthritic synovial fluid.

Prolotherapy: Prolotherapy is the injection of a solution to rehabilitate an incompetent structure and promote sclerosis at the injection site.

Platelet-rich plasma: Platelet-rich plasma [PRP] releases bioactive proteins which stimulate the body’s ability to heal due to its regenerative, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties.

**Mesenchymal Stem Cell**

According to the International Society for Cellular Therapy, the criteria for cells to be considered Mesenchymal Stem Cell [MSC] include:

- Plastic adherence when maintained under standard culture

- Expression of CD73, CD 90, and CD 105 and not the expression of CD11b, CD14, CD19, CD34, CD45, or HLA-DR

- Ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondroblasts, and adipocytes in-vitro
