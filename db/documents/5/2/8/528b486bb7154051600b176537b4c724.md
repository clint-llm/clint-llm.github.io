Symptoms of nausea and vomiting are so nonspecific that they could have a wide variety of differential diagnoses. But the following conditions mentioned below could pose a very similar presentation to gastroparesis.

1. Gastric Outlet Obstruction: very similar presentation but with underlying mechanical obstruction.

2. Cyclical vomiting syndrome: Typically has recurrent cyclical episodes of intractable nausea and vomiting lasting few hours to days.

3. Functional dyspepsia: diagnosed by Rome IV criteria for functional dyspepsia.

4. Rumination syndrome: A behavioral disorder consists of daily, effortless regurgitation of undigested food after ingestion of a meal. In contrast, it is not preceded by nausea or wretching.

5. Psychiatric diseases – many psychiatric conditions, including anxiety neurosis, eating disorders like anorexia nervosa, bulimia could have persistent upper GI symptoms confusing with gastroparesis. It could get complicated, especially as some psychiatric medications can cause delayed gastric emptying.
