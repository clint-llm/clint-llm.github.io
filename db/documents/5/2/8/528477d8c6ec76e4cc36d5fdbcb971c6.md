Crohn disease is a relapsing inflammatory bowel disorder that is challenging to diagnose and manage. Management of Crohn disease should include a multidisciplinary team, including a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, hospitalists, gastroenterologist, surgeon, dietitian, ostomy nurse, and a pharmacist. Crohn can affect any organ in the body, and thus, appropriate specialists should be consulted early in the disease course.

Nurse practitioners or physician assistants can follow the patient throughout the hospitalization and monitor the course of the disease. The pharmacist should educate the patient on different medications, their benefits, adverse effects, and the importance of compliance. Ostomy nurses will guide the patient on proper care of the ostomy bag. Nutritionists will provide diet recommendations to avoid symptoms exacerbation, disease flare-up, and possible readmissions.
