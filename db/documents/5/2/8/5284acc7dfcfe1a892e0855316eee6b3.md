The varicella vaccine is contraindicated in individuals who have a severe allergy or have had an anaphylactic reaction to neomycin or gelatin, which are components of this vaccine, or to the previous dose of a varicella-containing vaccine.

It is also contraindicated in individuals who are immunosuppressed or immunodeficient in any of the following ways:

- Severe combined immunodeficiency, lymphoma, leukemia, AIDS, blood dyscrasias, hypogammaglobulinemia, agammaglobulinemia, IgA deficiency, malignant neoplasms affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, patients receiving steroids, chemotherapy, or X-rays as a treatment for cancer or X-rays

- Any patient showing clinical signs of infection with HIV

- Any person who has a family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency in first-degree relatives unless there is demonstrable immunocompetence of the potential vaccine recipient

Patients can not receive the vaccine if they present with febrile illness or have active, untreated tuberculosis.

Vaccination is contraindicated in pregnant females, and women should delay pregnancy for three months after vaccination by using effective birth control. Maternal varicella infection has been shown to harm the fetus, but the vaccination effects have not had testing on pregnant women, and the effects on fetal development are currently unknown. It is also not known whether the varicella vaccine virus passes in breast milk, and it is best to avoid vaccination during breastfeeding for that reason.

There is currently no clinical data available on the efficacy or the safety of administration of the varicella vaccine in children younger than 12 months old.
