Patients require education regarding the benign nature of isolated sleep paralysis. The physician should encourage patients to manage their anxiety through medication and meditation. Another important issue that patients must understand is the hallucinations that accompany these episodes.

These hallucinations often invoke a great sense of apprehension and panic in these patients, and so patients must know their cause, their nature, and their consequences. It is only when patients fully understand the pathophysiology and limited consequences of sleep paralysis will they begin to be less fearful of it, which in turn imparts a positive effect on the prognosis.
