Cylindromas are classically described as variably sized rounded islands of basaloid cells which are arranged together in a fashion reminiscent of a “jigsaw puzzle.” These islands are mostly contained within the dermis, but also often extend into the sub-cutis. These islands should not connect to the overlying epidermis. The islands are composed of two cell populations, with a palisading peripheral lining of smaller cells with more hyperchromatic nuclei and an inner population in the islands with larger, more differentiated pale cells and nuclei and small duct-like structures. These islands are surrounded by an interconnecting hyalinized sheath which looks like a thickened dense pink lining. Within these basaloid islands interspersed small round pink globules, or “hyaline droplets,” are often seen.
