**Patient Counseling**

Patient education and counseling are key to a successful outcome, particularly because of the inconvenience and potential social consequences of the flap's pedicle between the initial and final stages of the procedure. Bruising, swelling, infection, and the appearance of the anticipated scar should be discussed. More time should be spent, however, attempting to prepare patients for the presence of the flap pedicle between the forehead and the nose, particularly if a delay occurs prior to dividing it. In addition, patients should be educated regarding wound care for the donor site and pedicle, avoidance of cigarette smoking, follow-up appointments, goals of reconstruction, and expectations for the final result.

**Preoperative Preparation**

Before surgery, measuring the defect and considering the length and width of the flap are of great importance. Determining the height of the anterior hairline and the amount of forehead laxity is also critical. In smokers, the supratrochlear artery should be traced up the entire forehead with a Doppler probe to rule out an obstruction in any segment of the vessel. Local anesthetic is injected, and the patient's face into the hairline is prepped with a surgical solution, usually povidone-iodine.
