Surgical care of esophagectomy and post-caustic ingestions may require intensive unit care. This is due to intubation procedures required though a recent study has shown that this may not be necessary. Airway management is critical in these patients due to the surgery site. Hemodynamic support may be required in these patients. Nutritional support is also critical in these patients, requiring a balance of protein and other nutrients to maintain adequate wound healing. Enlisting nutritional staff is critical in maintaining healing in these patients due to the change in eating habits, even long past postoperative care.
