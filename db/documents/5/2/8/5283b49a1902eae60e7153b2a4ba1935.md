As beeturia is a benign condition as such, it does not have a specific history and physical findings. A clinician would do well to complete a history and physical with particular focus given for those other diagnoses considered in the differential diagnosis, including renal calculi, renal cell carcinoma, hemorrhagic cystitis, urinary tract infection, arteriovenous malformation, renal failure, porphyria, anemia. Findings included would be an evaluation for CVA tenderness or fullness, suprapubic tenderness or fullness, skin exam with consideration for pallor, including pallor of conjunctiva or signs of other arteriovenous malformations. Case studies have reported underlying beeturia with a concomitant complaint of dark, tarry stool, both attributed to dietary beet intake, so any patient complaining of these concurrent complaints should undergo questioning regarding dietary choices and a history of similar events in the past.
