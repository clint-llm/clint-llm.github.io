Medical teams seeing ill patients recently ingesting seafood or swimming or injured in suspect waters should be mutually aware of the danger presented by V. vulnificus. Any suggestion of sepsis should trigger facility-specific protocols. This role is crucial to effective triage.Â  Starting with the nurse's assessment and then to the medical provider's history and physical, any essential historical event or significant physical finding should be shared amongst the team. Collaborative case summation with all team members, including medical providers, nurses, nurses' assistants, techs, wound care specialists, and pharmacists, can assist in arriving at the correct diagnosis, and instituting early indicated treatment. Infectious disease specialists should be involved early in such cases. Prompt surgical consultation should be pursued in any case with significant skin and soft tissue findings.
