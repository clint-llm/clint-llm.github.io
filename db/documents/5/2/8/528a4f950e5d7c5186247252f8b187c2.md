Patients with acute viral infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, influenza, hepatitis A, B, or C virus,Â have similar presenting complaints, such as febrile illness, hepatitis, and myalgia. Serological tests and PCR assays are used to identify these infections. Atypical pneumonia caused by Legionella and Mycoplasma needs to be considered. They can be ruled out by detecting urine antigen or serum antibody titers. Tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease, relapsing fever, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever manifest with fever and headache with or without a rash. Anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis present with fever, headache, and hepatitis, with a lesser incidence of rash. Tick-borne diseases are detected via PCR and/or serology. Zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis and leptospirosis can manifest as an acute flu-like illness with a history of exposure to animals or animal products.
