**Localized Disease**

Official guidelines for the treatment of thymic NETs are not available, as data lacks prospective trials and is mainly based on case reports and case series. Complete surgical resection, which remains the therapy of choice, entitles the resection of all the anterior mediastinal compartment, including hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.

In cases of local invasion, despite total complete surgical resection, microscopic resection may not be achieved, and the rate of recurrence is high.

**Metastatic or Recurrent Disease**

Even in the instance of recurrent disease, if the tumor is deemed to be resectable, surgical resection should be attempted.

A platinum-based chemotherapy regimen, such as carboplatin and etoposide, is used for intermediate to poorly differentiated tumors, based again on treatment guidelines for poorly differentiated NETs of the gastrointestinal tract and lung.

The role of radiation therapy remains palliative for symptomatic patients with recurrent or metastatic disease.
