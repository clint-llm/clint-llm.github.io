The diagnosis for central pain is primarily clinical, given that the laboratory workup, which includes a CBC, ESR, CRP, TSH, and CK, is generally negative.

Screening instruments for central pain are available. These tools included the central sensitization inventory (CSI) and the painDETECT measure. These tools can serve to assess neuropathic pain and centralized pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia, respectively.

Furthermore, imaging can help confirm central pain syndrome.Â MRI and functional neuroimaging (fMRI) have helped shed light on central pain. An fMRI can help distinguish structural and functional brain abnormalities in patients with various chronic pain disorders. Patients with fibromyalgia have demonstrated unique brain patterns on fMRI. It can be a useful tool in diagnosing and predicting patients at risk for developing various pain disorders.

Furthermore, fMRI is useful in helping to determine the connectivity between multiple regions of the brain. The extent of alteration correlates with the scope of the patient's pain. A functional MRI could be an objective measure of the severity of fibromyalgia.

On positron emission tomography and electroencephalography, increased pain responses have been seen in patients with central pain syndrome.
