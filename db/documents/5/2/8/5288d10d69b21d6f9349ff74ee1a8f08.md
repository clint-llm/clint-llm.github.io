Because of the impaired skin barrier, lesional skin may become secondarily infected.Â Staphylococcus aureus is the most commonly implicated pathogen. Impetiginized lesions can display purulent ooze and thicker golden crusting than noninfected lesions. A bacterial swab should be performed for culture and sensitivities. Doxycycline, or another antistaphylococcal antibiotic based on local antimicrobial resistance patterns, may be selected initially, and further treatment can be tailored according to the resultant sensitivities.

As with any inflammatory condition of the skin, there may be post-inflammatory dyspigmentation of the skin, including erythema, hypo-, or hyperpigmentation.
