The gag reflex is a natural somatic response in which the body attempts to eliminate unwanted agents or foreign objects from the oral cavity through muscle contraction at the base of the tongue and the pharyngeal wall.

In the first few months of life, the gag reflex is triggered by any food that the nucleus tractus solitarius (a region of the brain stem) deems too large or solid for a baby to digest. Starting around six or seven months of age, the gag reflex diminishes, allowing infants to swallow more solid foods.
