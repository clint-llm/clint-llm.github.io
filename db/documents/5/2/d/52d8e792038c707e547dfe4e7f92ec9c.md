Healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners, may frequently encounter skin growths in patients. Because the differential of dermal growths is large, these patients require a referral to a dermatologist or plastic surgeon for a definitive diagnosis. Atypical fibroxanthoma is one such growth that often presents in elderly persons of the White race. Risk factors for metastases include immunocompromised patients, tumor depth, vascular or perineural invasion, and the presence of tumor necrosis. The most commonly reported locations for metastases include the parotid gland, lymph nodes, and subcutaneous tissue. The treatment of choice for atypical fibroxanthoma is surgical excision. The key is to educate the patient on avoiding sun exposure and getting regular physical exams for early detection. Recurrence can occur, but metastatic spread is rare.
