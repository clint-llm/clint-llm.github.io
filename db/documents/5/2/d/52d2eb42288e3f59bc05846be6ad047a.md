The only absolute contraindication to cooling is normal or low body temperature. Hyperthermia in a patient may be a sign of sepsis, toxic ingestion, or withdrawal, or another etiology, in which case disease-specific treatment should not be overlooked. Care should be taken to prioritize the usual resuscitation and emergent management of airway, breathing, and circulation.
