The tibial nerve is the reference nerve structure for the gastrocnemius muscle.

Before dividing at the level of the upper corner of the popliteal fossa, in a tibial branch and a peroneal branch, these two nerves constitute the main trunk of the sciatic nerve; they are separated inside the sciatic by a fascial/adipose tissue or septum, known as the septum of Compton-Cruveilhier.

The tibial nerve arises from the trunk of the sciatic nerve above the popliteal fossa and descends into the popliteal fossa between the two heads of the gastrocnemius, anterior to the soleus muscle; about 15 centimeters above the ankle, it travels medially to the calcaneal tendon and superficially.
