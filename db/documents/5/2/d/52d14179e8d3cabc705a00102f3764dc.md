The complications for these patients are similar to patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance leads to increased afterload of the right ventricle (RV). In the early phase, RV remains adapted to afterload by increasing contractility without increasing RV chamber dimension. In the more advanced phase, RV function cannot remain matched to afterload, resulting in RV dilation, myocardial fibrosis, and low RV cardiac output, eventually leading to right-sided heart failure and volume overload from systemic venous congestion.
