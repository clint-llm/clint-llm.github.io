Clostridial myositis and myonecrosis (gas gangrene) are both life-threatening infections caused by the anaerobic, spore-forming, exotoxin-producing bacteria speciesÂ Clostridium perfringens. If not quickly recognized, gas gangrene can quickly lead to death. Thus, fast recognition and treatment are required whenever gas gangrene is suspected.
