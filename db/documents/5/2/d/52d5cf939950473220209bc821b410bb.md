While tachypnea can result from physiological causes such as exercise, there are pathologic causes that may be of concern. The complications that arise from these pathologic causes are ones that clinicians should be aware of as they can lead to worsening physical exam and patient care outcomes.

Tachypnea can be a symptom of sepsis or acidosis, such as diabetic ketoacidosis or metabolic acidosis. Patients with lung problems such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, pulmonary embolism, COPD, asthma, or an allergic reaction also present with tachypnea.

Anxiety states and hyperventilation during panic attacks would lead to tachypnea and can lead to hypocapnia or reduced carbon dioxide levels, reducing respiratory drive.
