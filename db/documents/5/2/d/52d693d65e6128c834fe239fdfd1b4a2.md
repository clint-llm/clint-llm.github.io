Management of an antalgic gait is aimed at identifying and treating the underlying cause of pain with referral to the appropriate specialist.

Sprains and fractures should be immobilized and splinted with appropriate orthopedic follow-up.

Inflammatory conditions should be treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and appropriate primary care or rheumatology follow-up. Physical therapy can also be helpful in the management of long-term conditions such as sciatica, degenerative disc disease, and lumbar radiculopathy.

Vascular causes of antalgic gait will require a specialist referral and possibly blood-thinning medication.

Infectious causes of antalgic gait can medical emergenciesÂ and require prompt diagnosis with emergent orthopedic consultation and/or admission for joint aspiration, intravenous antibiotics, and possible surgery.

Neoplastic causes require oncology input and possibly neurosurgical consultation and follow-up.
