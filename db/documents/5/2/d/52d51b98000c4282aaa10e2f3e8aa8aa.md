Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is reported to occur in different geographic areas and regions. It has a higher frequency in Caucasians. The Mayo Clinic conducted a study between 1972 and 2003 with 39 patients diagnosed with confluent and reticulated papillomatosis and determined the mean age of occurrence to be 15 years old with a range of 8 to 32 years and a male predilection of 1.4:1. A Japanese study had similar findings with a mean age of 17 years old and a range of 3 to 30 years and a slight male predilection. A Singaporean study reported a mean age of onset of 29 years old with a range of 16 to 55 years and a male bias of 2.6:1.
