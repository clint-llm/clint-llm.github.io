Histologic findings in telogen effluvium are best seen in transverse sections of a punch biopsy.

- The number and density of hair follicles are usually normal, but there is an increased percentage of the hair follicles that are in the catagen or the telogen phase.

- If 25% of the follicles are in the telogen phase, the diagnosis of telogen effluvium is confirmed.

- The percentage of telogen hair should not typically be higher than 50%.
