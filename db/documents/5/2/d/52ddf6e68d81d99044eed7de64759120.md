Candida species cause oral candidiasis, most commonly Candida albicans, isolated from more than 80% of lesions.

Although much less common, other implicated species include Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida kruesi, Candida guillermondii, Candida lusitaniae, Candida parapsilosis, Candida pseudotropicalis, and Candida stellatoidea. Non-albicans Candida species have been shown to colonize patients 80 years old and above more frequently than younger patients.

Candida is part of the normal oral microflora of immunocompetent individuals.

Risk factors for the pathologic colonization of Candida include but are not limited to malnourishment, age extremes (young children and elderly), metabolic disease, immunocompromising conditions, concomitant infections, radiation therapy, organ transplantation, long-term steroid treatment, antibiotic treatment, and salivary gland hypofunction.
