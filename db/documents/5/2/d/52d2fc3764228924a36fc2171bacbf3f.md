Patients with perioral dermatitis most commonly present with erythematous-grouped papules that are often bilateral but may be unilateral, surrounding the mouth, eyes, and nose. Since it often affects the skin surrounding other facial orifices, it also has been termed periorificial dermatitis. Other variable findings include scaling, vesicles, and pustules. The vermillion borders of the lips are typically spared of involvement. In the granulomatous variant, flesh-colored to erythematous to yellow-brown papules erupt in the same distribution, although rare involvement of the ears, neck, scalp, trunk, vulva, and extremities has been described.
