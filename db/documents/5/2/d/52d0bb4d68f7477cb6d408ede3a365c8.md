When the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, or the internist comes across a new patient with rhabdomyosarcoma it is important to refer these patients to an oncology. The treatment of these malignant lesions is complex and requires anÂ interprofessional team that includes an oncologist, radiation therapist, radiologist, and a surgeon. Rhabdomyosarcomas generally tend to be less responsive to chemotherapy and radiation; surgery is the sole method for cure, but recurrences are common. Patients need to be educated about the different treatments and their pros and cons. The overally survival of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma remain poor.
