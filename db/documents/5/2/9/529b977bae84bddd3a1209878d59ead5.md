Generally, in heart failure, the heart is weak and cannot appropriately provide sufficient blood to the body. If severe enough, patients can present with cardiogenic shock, and hallmark presentation is increased systemic peripheral resistance secondary to the body’s attempt to allow adequate perfusion. High output cardiac failure presents as clinical heart failure, however with a decreased systemic vascular resistance. Several different etiologies can lead to this condition and each requires a different therapy and management plan. The healthcare team should be prepared for management strategies in evaluating and treating patients with this condition. [Level 5]
