Many potential causes behind HP are:

- **Pancreatic inflammation**: Whether acute, chronic or hereditary, pancreatitis considered being the most common cause of HP, responsible for about 80% of the cases. Pancreatitis promotes inflammatory alterations within the pancreatic ducts, which eventually leads to vascular wall rupture. Moreover, gallstones within the duct and pseudocysts' development of the pancreas might trigger an inflammatory reaction within the duct. Ultimately, the pancreatic pseudocyst plays a potential pathological role through the activation of the lytic enzymes (especially elastase), which lyse the elastic component of the vessels, results in hemorrhage.

- **Arterial aneurysm:**Aneurysm developed from in or out of the pancreas is considered the second most common cause of HP, responsible for about 6 to 17% of cases. The most common artery affected is the splenic artery. Other vessels such as hepatic, gastroduodenal, and pancreatoduodenal arteries have also been explained. An aneurysm is generally caused by atheroma, congenital connective tissue disorder (Marfan syndrome and Ehler-Danlos syndrome), fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis, and α-1 anti-trypsin deficiency.

- **Pancreatic tumors:**Primary pancreatic mass including benign tumors such as serous cystic and mucinous cystic neoplasms and malignancy (such as pancreatic carcinoma and Neuroendocrine tumor); both were reported to cause HP. Even a Secondary metastatic tumor, especially renal cell carcinoma, could precipitate HP. Mechanism hypothesized by infesting the nearby organs by building communication between the tumor bed and the duct, prone to bleeding.

- **Iatrogenic:**HP has resulted as a complication following a biopsy with fine-needle aspiration, pancreatic duct stenting, endoscopic ultrasound, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), pancreatic duct sphincterotomy, pseudocyst drainage, or bariatric surgery.

- **Infectious process:**brucellosis and syphilis has been reported as case reports of HP.

- **Congenital anomalies:**Heterotopic pancreas and Pancreatic Divisum both cause recurrent bouts of pancreatitis that might be complicated with HP. It is considered to be one of the main causes of HP that bleeds into the accessory pancreatic duct.

- **Others:**such as blunt or penetrating trauma and arteriovenous malformation. A case of HP has been reported in a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia.
