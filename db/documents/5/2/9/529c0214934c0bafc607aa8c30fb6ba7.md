Diagnosing and treating venous disease requires cooperation and communication between multiple healthcare providers. There is often overlap between who is medically managing and treating the patient. Peripheral venous disease is at an interface involving interventional radiologists, interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons, hematologists/oncologists, and primary care physicians. This interplay can lead to confusing and sometimes counterproductive recommendations. A collaborative effort such as a specialized vein clinic with clearly defined roles is one of the current solutions to ensure the best possible outcomes.
