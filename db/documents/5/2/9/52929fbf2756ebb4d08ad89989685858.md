The vast majority of patients with panic disorder complain of chest pain, palpitations, or dyspnea on multiple occasions. Other common symptoms may include diaphoresis, tremor, a choking sensation, nausea, chills, paresthesias, or feelings of depersonalization.  Because most patients complain of physical symptoms, they often inquire about alternative explanations of their symptoms not related to mental health. They frequently shy away from care by mental health professionals and instead seek reassurance from specialty medical consultants. It is important to remember that conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, and vocal cord dysfunction also have many symptoms similar to panic disorder.
