Wintrobe hematocrit tube has graduation 0 to 100 from below upwards. Hence, the highest level of packed RBC is the HCT in percentage. For the microhematocrit method, the reading is from the HCT card or scale. However, for these two methods, even without any graduation or scale, the HCT value can be calculated with a simple scale as we compare the length of the RBC column with the total length of the fluid column. The final report is a percentage. HCT, along with RBC count and hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, is used to report other blood indices manually as follows:

The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) calculation uses HCT and RBC count.

- MCV (fL) = HCT (%) × 10 / RBC count (10^12/L)

Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is calculated with Hb concentration and HCT.

- MCHC (%) = Hb concentration (g/dL) / HCT (%) × 100
