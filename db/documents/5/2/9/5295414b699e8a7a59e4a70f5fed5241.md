Refeeding syndrome has been described in high-risk populations, including patients with eating disorders, depression, renal failure, malabsorptive conditions, previous bariatric surgery, and alcohol abuse. One of the main guidelines used for the evaluation and treatment of refeeding syndrome is the National Institute for Health Care and Excellence (NICE) guideline, which defines risk factors for refeeding syndrome as a “low body mass index (BMI), unintentional weight loss, starvation, history of alcohol abuse, and low initial electrolyte concentrations.”

The incidence of refeeding syndrome has been hard to establish due to a lack of uniform definitions and study methodology. Hypophosphatemia has been used as a surrogate marker for refeeding syndrome.

Numerous cases of refeeding syndrome patients are also observed in the critical care setting when patients have been nutritionally sustained with total parenteral nutrition (TPN); Use of TPN has been linked to hyperglycemia and a corresponding increase in insulin levels, which further exacerbate electrolyte abnormalities in refeeding syndrome.
