Patients having foot pain for long-duration should get their foot pathology evaluated, as stress fractures of metatarsals can present without any antecedent history of trauma and can remain undiagnosed. These fractures may be missed on plain radiographic examination and should be evaluated with higher imaging investigations. Also, patients with metatarsal fractures should get them adequately treated and rehabilitated as neglected fractures can lead to painful conditions like Morton's neuroma, with persistent disability.
