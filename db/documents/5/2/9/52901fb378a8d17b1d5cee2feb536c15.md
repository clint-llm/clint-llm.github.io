Normally, glucose is processed by the glycolysis pathway and is utilized for ATP production and energy. When glucose levels become exorbitantly elevated, other pathways are upregulated to handle the glucose effectively. These pathways include the glycation pathway, the hexosamine pathway, the protein kinase C pathway, the alpha-ketoaldehyde pathway, and the sorbitol pathway.

The first step in the sorbitol pathway is the conversion of glucose to sorbitol via the enzyme aldolase reductase. This step utilizes a hydrogen group donated by NADPH. This is also the rate-limiting reaction of this entire pathway. The second step in this pathway is the conversion of sorbitol into fructose via the enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase.  This step donates a hydrogen group to NAD+, creating a byproduct of NADH.
