Epithelial downgrowth is a rare, but vision-threatening, complication of penetrating ocular trauma or intraocular surgery. It ranges in the severity of presentation but can include decreasing visual acuity, redness, pain, tearing, and photophobia. A thorough history and physical examination, in addition to supplemental studies like imaging and histopathology, is crucial to diagnose epithelial downgrowth accurately. Treatment options depend on the extent of involvement and growth pattern and vary from conservative measures to surgical excision with corneoscleral transplantation.
