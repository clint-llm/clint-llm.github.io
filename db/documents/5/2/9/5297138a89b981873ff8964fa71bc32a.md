The iliac arteries and the arterial supply of the lower extremity are highly variable in their anatomy. Providing an individualized surgical treatment plan based on anatomical variations in surgical candidates is essential.

**Vascularized Bone Grafting**

In instances of significant bone loss, bone grafting may be beneficial. The fibular bone graft relies on the supply from the peroneal (fibular) artery. This arterial supply conveys better viability than nonvascularized bone grafts and synthetic alternatives. Fibular bone grafts are the most common vascularized bone grafts, although the iliac crest, pubis, rib, radius, ulna, scapula, femur, humerus, and metatarsal grafts are also options.

**The Meniscal Blood Supply**

The blood supply to the meniscus has three zones: red, pink, and white. These zones decrease in vascularity from the periphery to the interior. These differences are significant because many meniscal injuries occur in the interior zone with limited vascular supply and thus have limited ability to heal.

**Soft Tissue Flaps**

Many variations of soft tissue flaps derive from the lower extremities. These have widespread relevance. For example, they are important in treating traumatic injuries and ulcers due to diabetes mellitus. Choosing the appropriate flap can have a dramatic impact on the outcome of the procedure.
