Multiple factors can obstruct lymph flow. One factor depends on how hydrated the interstitial compartment is. Fluid crosses through the interstitial space across cells to eventually reach the lymphatic vessels. In instances of inflammation, filtration through the interstitium increases, which allows for the quick transfer of proteins and other molecules to the lymphatic system. When there is a decrease in the flow or dehydration of fluid across the interstitial space, it backs up into the extracellular space leading to swelling or lymphedema.  Others include external forces such as impairment in gut motility, causing impingement on the flow and internal forces where the lymphatic system has a deficit in contractility.

Lymphatic obstruction can lead to immunosuppression, meaning that it cannot perform its function of clearing foreign antigens from the gastrointestinal tract. This failure leads to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, playing a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn disease.

Obstruction of lymphatics of the scrotum can lead to scrotal lymphedema, also known as scrotal elephantiasis. It usually occurs in tropical regions where filariasis (Wucheria bancrofti) is endemic.

A cavity of clear serous fluid, called a seroma, can accumulate in the abdominal wall after surgery; this is due to a disruption of the lymphatic flow.

Consequently, when there is blockage of venous flow in the small intestine, studies have shown that the fluid accumulated is shunted to the lymphatic system, leading to inflammation in the intestines.

Hypothetically, malignant cells travel to the sentinel lymph nodes initially.
