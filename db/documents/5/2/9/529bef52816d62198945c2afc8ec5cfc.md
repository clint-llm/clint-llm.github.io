Unlike in adults, cardiopulmonary arrest in rare in children and less likely to be a primary cardiac event. Early onset of effective, high-quality CPR can improve survival. Children in need of resuscitation can be divided into several categories that include pulseless arrest (which may be the result of asystole), pulseless electrical activity, or ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia without a pulse. Regardless of the etiology, early initiation of CPR along with cardiac monitoring will determine which pulseless arrest pathway to follow. Subsequent management of patients with asystole and pulseless electrical activity include epinephrine administration every three to five minutes, as needed. This activity describes the role of health professionals working together to managing patient in cardiopulmonary arrest.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the evaluation of a patient who has survived a cardiac arrest.
- Summarize the treatment options for survivors of cardiac arrest.
- Review the causes of cardiac arrest.
- Summarize the role of health professionals working together to manage a patient in cardiopulmonary arrest.
