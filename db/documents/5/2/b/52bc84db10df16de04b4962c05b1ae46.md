After the procedure, the patient should be transferred to the intensive care unit for further monitoring up to 4Â to 7 days before discharge. The transvenous pacemaker should be left for 2 to 3 days. Patients should be monitored for the following signs.

- Any access site complications like groin hematoma and retroperitoneal hematoma

- Arrhythmias or heart blocks

- Hemodynamic instability

- Stroke/TIA

- Contrast nephropathy

- Myocardial ischemia

TTE should be done to assess LVOT gradient and mitral regurgitation before discharge. Patients should be followed up in the clinic and should be checked for any signs of access site complications like arteriovenous (AV) fistula, femoral artery pseudoaneurysm, hematoma, or infection. Appropriate, timely follow-ups should be arranged along with repeat ECHO within 3 to 6 months after the procedure to assess LVOT gradients.
