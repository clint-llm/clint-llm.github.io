Tocilizumab is FDA-indicated for the adult treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and giant cell arteritis and pediatric treatment of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Tocilizumab has a non-FDA-indicated use in the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients prescribed tocilizumab for rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of tocilizumab.
- Review the therapeutic uses of tocilizumab.
- Explain the side effects of tocilizumab.
- Outline ways in which the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team can enhance patient care when dosing and monitoring tocilizumab treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, giant cell arteritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
