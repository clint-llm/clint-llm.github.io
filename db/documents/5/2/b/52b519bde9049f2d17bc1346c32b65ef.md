Impaired neurotransmission or excess circulating levels of catecholamines leads to pathophysiologic effects. Congenital catecholamine deficiency may occur as an exceedingly rare inborn error of adrenal medullary development. Functional deficiency due to impaired mechanisms of catecholamine release, reuptake, or receptor sensitivity has neurophysiologic effects involving dysregulation of mood and attention. Excess catecholamines and their pathophysiologic equivalents may arise from several etiologies including exogenous administration of frank catecholamines, derivative adrenergic agonists (e.g., isoproterenol, phenylephrine), or reuptake inhibitors (e.g., amphetamines, cocaine). Excess levels also may occur from endogenous catecholamine overproduction from a pheochromocytoma. The pathophysiologic response is increased in an exaggerated sympathetic response due to the overactivation of adrenergic receptors.
