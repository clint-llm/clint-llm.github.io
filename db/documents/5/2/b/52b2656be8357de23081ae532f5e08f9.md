Primary care providers should coordinate the management of these patients. They must be aware of the nature of these lesions and follow them up accordingly. A referral to a dermatologist should be done whenever cutaneous malignancy is suspected or when pediatricians of family physicians do not feel comfortable managing these patients due toÂ insufficient experience, short consultation times, lack of equipment, etcetera.

Brain MRI should be performed in patients with risk factors (multiple lesions, large diameter, neurological symptoms) in the first 6 months of life to rule out neurocutaneous melanosis.[Level 3]

An interprofessional approach with communication between pediatricians, dermatologists, pediatric neurologists, plastic surgeons, and psychologists is essential in the appropriate management of these patients.
