Arising from the neck, posterior to the axillary artery and anterior to the subscapularis muscle, the axillary nerve travels toward the lower border of the subscapularis where it exits the axilla through the quadrangular space, alongside the posterior humeral circumflex artery and vein. The quadrangular space is bordered superiorly by the lower border of teres minor muscle, laterally by the surgical neck of the humerus, inferiorly by the upper boundary of teres major, and medially by the long head of the triceps brachial. After exiting the quadrangular space posteriorly, the anterior branch of the axillary nerve wraps around the surgical neck of the humerus, with the posterior humeral circumflex artery, to then innervate the deltoid muscle. The posterior branch continues from the quadrangular space to innervate the posterior portion of the deltoid, teres minor, and the skin of the lateral upper to mid arm.
