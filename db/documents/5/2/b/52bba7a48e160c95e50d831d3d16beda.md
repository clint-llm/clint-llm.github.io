Depending upon the duration of brain ischemia, there may be mild brain dysfunction, prolonged dysfunction with permanent damage to the brain, with or without permanent symptoms and disability.

Patient outcomes after cerebral ischemia can range from no permanent effects (transient ischemic attack) to permanent disability to death.Â  The severity of impairment is linked to the patient's functional status before the ischemic event. For example, patients with mild cognitive impairment or dementia had greater relative cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke, suggestive of lower neuronal tolerance of ischemia.
