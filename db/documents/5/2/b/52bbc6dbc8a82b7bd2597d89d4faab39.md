The trapezius receives its blood supply from the transverse cervical artery off the thyrocervical trunk; however, each fiber segment gets blood supply from different arterial branches, including the dorsal scapular artery, which traverses the trapezius on its way to the rhomboids. The levator scapulae have the same blood supply as the trapezius muscle, the transverse cervical artery.

This latissimus dorsi receives blood from a single artery known as the thoracodorsal artery, which is the continuation of the subscapular artery, which branches directly off the axillary artery.

Blood supply to both rhomboid major and minor is most commonly from the dorsal scapular artery; however, sometimes, it can receive blood from a deep branch of the transverse cervical artery.

The two posterior serratus muscles (superior and inferior) receive blood supply from the intercostal arteries.
