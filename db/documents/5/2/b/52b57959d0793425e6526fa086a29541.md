There are a number of actions that can be implemented to improve the performance of central line care on a broader scale. Following and promoting hospital-specific or collaborative performance initiatives have been shown to improve compliance with evidence-based practice. The patient care team should perform CVC necessity reviews daily to ensure that central venous catheters are removed as soon as they are no longer necessary. Additionally, initiating and supporting a dedicated vascular team to address CVC insertion, maintenance, evaluation, and removal will decrease the incidence of central line complications.
