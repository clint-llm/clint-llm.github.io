Atrial flutter, a supraventricular arrhythmia, is one of the most common rhythm disturbances of the heart. It is characterized by a fast atrial rate with a fixed or variable ventricular rate. There are several atrial contractions to one ventricular contraction and symptoms include fatigue, palpitations, and syncope. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of atrial flutter and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the role of the re-entrant mechanism in the etiology of atrial flutter.
- Describe the different pathophysiologies of typical and atypical atrial flutter.
- Summarize the use of electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and laboratory tests in the evaluation of atrial flutter.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team members to decrease the risk of embolic stroke and improve outcomes for patients affected by atrial flutter.
