A consultation with physical medicine & rehabilitation (PM&R) specialist is necessary.Â  A physiatrist will perform an evaluation, electrodiagnostic studies, and brace management.

Physiotherapy referrals are usually taken care of by the physiatrists.

They also can refer the patient to an orthotist for a brace.
