**Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency**

A pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency diagnosis most often results from a defective pyruvate decarboxylase subunit due to a mutated X-linked PDHAD gene.

**Thiamine Deficiency**

Early, acute thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency is referred to as dry beriberi while chronic deficiency is referred to as wet beriberi, resulting in cardiac symptoms such as dilated cardiomyopathy.

**Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 Mutation**

Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2(IDH2), an isoform of isocitrate dehydrogenase, mitigates oxidative damage. IDH2 is also frequently mutated in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia. This mutation causes IDH2 to catalyze its reaction to a final product of 2-hydroxyglutarate instead of the correct alpha-ketoglutarate.
