As the testicle twists around the spermatic cord, venous blood flow is cut off, leading to venous congestion and ischemia of the testicle. The testicle will become tender, swollen, and possibly erythematous. As the testicle further twists, the arterial blood supply is cut off which leads to furtherÂ testicular ischemia and eventually necrosis.

In most individuals, the testicle rotates between 90-180 degrees and compromised blood flow. Complete torsion is rare and quickly decreases the viability of the testes. Salvage is possible if the torsion is less than 8 hours but rare if more than 24 hours have elapsed.
