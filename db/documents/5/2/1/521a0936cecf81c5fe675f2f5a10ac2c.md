The thenar eminence will develop mainly from the ectoderm and mesoderm germ layers. The overlying skin and nerve innervation derive from the ectoderm layer. The neural crest cells from the ectodermal layer will form the ulnar nerve. The development of the hypothenar muscles is similar to the development of most muscles. The mesenchymal tissue from the mesodermal germ layer will differentiate into the muscles. The mesenchymal tissue will also form the blood vessels that perfuse the hypothenar eminence. The mesenchyme will form the ulnar artery and its branches to perfuse the hypothenar eminence.
