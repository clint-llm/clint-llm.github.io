A thorough history should include any potential occupational and environmental exposure within the past 2 to 3 weeks as initial sensitization may be unknown. Clinicians should be aware of local geographic distributions of the Toxicodendron species. Patients often initially present with complaints of intense pruritis and the beginning stages of a papular or vesicular rash in a linear pattern. Distribution may be scattered as patients often do not recognize exposure until they have contacted other body areas. Black spots may be noted on affected skin or clothing and should be avoided, and it is the result of oxidized urushiol exposed to air.
