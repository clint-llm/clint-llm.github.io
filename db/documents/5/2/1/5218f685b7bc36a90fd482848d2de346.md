Originally introduced by Dr. Yang and Dr. Gao at the Shenyang Military Hospital in the early 1980s, the radial forearm free flap has since been popularized as a workhorse flap. Though generally raised as a fasciocutaneous flap, the radial forearm is extremely versatile and can also be harvested as an adipofascial flap or with bone from the radius as an osteofasciocutaneous flap. Many studies have demonstrated the benefits of the radial forearm flap in intraoral reconstruction.

The osteocutaneous radial forearm flap is a variant of the fasciocutaneous radial forearm free flap wherein partial thickness of the radius is harvested and perfused by preserving the lateral intermuscular septum and the perforating vessels to the bone. Alternatives to this flap include the osteocutaneous fibular free flap, osteocutaneous scapular free flap, and the osteocutaneous iliac crest free flap. The advantages of the osteocutaneous radial forearm free flap are its skin paddle thinness, pliability, long vascular pedicle, and reliable vascular anatomy. The disadvantages of this flap center around the donor site morbidity relative to the size and quality of bone available for harvest. The osteotomized bone is at risk of fracture and causes reduced strength and function in the operated wrist. This article discusses the details of the procedure, as well as the risks and benefits of using this flap in order to facilitate its thoughtful utilization.
