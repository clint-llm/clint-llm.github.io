Neurochemical studies are inconclusive. The main pathophysiologic feature of central hypersomnias is a defect in the arousal CNS system rather than hyperactivity of sleep centers.

Impairment in the neurotransmission of orexin (a neuropeptide produced mainly by neurons in the lateral hypothalamus) is the hallmark pathology in narcolepsy with cataplexy (narcolepsy type 1), possibly due to an autoimmune process.
