Any patient with complaints of persistent itching, irritation, redness, or discharge should be examined in detail by an ophthalmologist to rule out phthiriasis palpebrarum infestation. In case of doubt regarding the diagnosis, the patient can be referred and managed by a cornea or external disease specialist or an oculoplastic surgeon. If the patient also complains of itching of the groin and other body areas, they should be referred to or managed in consultation with a physician or a dermatologist. The patient should also be evaluated to rule out sexually transmitted diseases (STD). In case of an STD, the patient and the partner should be referred to a venereologist for careful management and targeted drug therapy. If phthiriasis palpebrarum is diagnosed in a child, the physician should rule out sexual abuse, although manual contamination from infested body hair of the child’s father or mother is the most likely way of transmission. Physical examination and treatment of infested sexual partners are recommended.
