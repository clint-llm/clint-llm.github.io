The electroencephalogram recording electrodes are placed over the scalp. They measure the absolute electrical potentials generated by the neurons of the underlying cerebral cortex. An estimated cortical area of 10 cm2 discharging synchronously is required to generate a deflection on scalp EEG.

The cortical neurons and the subcortical structures are systematically connected through well-developed feedback linkages.

The commonly encountered waveform frequencies in EEGs are alpha (8 to 12 Hz), beta (13 to 30 Hz), theta (4 to 7 Hz), and delta (less than 4 Hz). The predominance of waveforms in an EEG varies based on the age and state of wakefulness of the individual. The EEG waveforms start with discontinuous backgrounds during the prenatal phase and mature to be continuous at a later age. The normal adult resting PDR of 8.5 Hz in the posterior head regions is noted after eight years of age. The slower waveforms are less during the wakeful state and dominate during later stages of sleep. There is also an anterior-to-posterior distribution of waveforms with faster frequencies present in the anterior and slower frequencies in the posterior head regions.

Other notable components/waveforms that appear during the first year of life and are useful to differentiate sleep stages are sleep spindles and K-complexes. There are also several benign EEG variants and artifacts that one should learn in order to avoid reporting a false-positive test.
