Physicians frequently deal with the loss of a patient in the emergency department and in intensive care units. These deaths are often due to unforeseen violent circumstances, such as gunshot wounds, motor vehicle accidents, suicides, and homicides. Only after extensive, failed resuscitation attempts will the emergency department team end their efforts. This harrowing experience takes not only a physical but emotional toll on the providers, as they are the last hope of survival for the patient. The loss of a patient’s life reflects immense personal and professional stress and anxiety on the emergency physician. However, they must put aside their grief to disclose the bad news to family members of a patient who has died unexpectedly. The physician likely lacks a prior intimate relationship with the family. This lack of familiarity makes it important that health professionals are aware of and ready for various emotional reactions from the family so that he or she can alleviate extended grief and bereavement.
