If left untreated, amoebic infections have very high morbidity and mortality. In fact, mortality is second only to malaria. Amoebic infections tend to be most severe in the following populations:

- Pregnant women

- Postpartum women

- Neonates

- Malnourished individuals

- Individuals whoÂ are on corticosteroids

- Individuals with malignancies

When the condition is treated, the prognosis is good, but recurrent infections are common in some parts of the world. The mortality rates after treatment are less than 1%. However, amoebic liver abscesses may be complicated by an intraperitoneal rupture in 5% to 10% of cases, potentially increasing the mortality rate. Amoebic pericarditis and pulmonary amebiasis have a high mortality rate exceeding 20%.

Today with effective treatment, mortality rates are less than 1% in patients with uncomplicated disease. However, rupture of an infected amebic liver abscess carries a high mortality.
