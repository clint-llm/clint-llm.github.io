The patient must remove contact lenses before staining the eye as the fluorescein will permanently stain them. The eye should be flushed with saline, and contacts should be left out about 1 hour after staining if no injury is identified.

Staining of the skin around the eye will fade over a few hours.

Another possible complication occurs as a missed ruptured globe due to the laceration or perforation being already sealed or in a location unable to be tested by Seidel test (posterior globe rupture).
