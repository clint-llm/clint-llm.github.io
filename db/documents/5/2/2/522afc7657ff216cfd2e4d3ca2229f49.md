Deglutition or swallowing is an innate function. Swallowing sounds like a simple physiological human function, but it is a complex, multifaceted process involving a variety of muscles and nerves. It is the starting point for the peristaltic transport of food to the stomach. Deglutition in humans can be of three distinct phases: oral phase, pharyngeal phase, and esophageal phase, of which the first one is voluntary, and the other two are reflex actions. The oral phase further divides into an oral preparatory phase and an oral propulsive phase. The location of the food bolus defines each of these phases as it descends towards the stomach. The oral and pharyngeal stages of swallowing share anatomy with the respiratory tract, so protection of the airway is of utmost importance. The anatomy of the structures involved in deglutition will be discussed furtherÂ in this article.
