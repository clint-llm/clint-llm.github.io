The B cell lymphomas result from the malignant proliferation of B cells during their various stages of development. Depending on the morphology, genetics, and immunophenotype of the neoplastic cells, a cell of origin (COO) is proposed. The development of B cells can be categorized into 3 stages- pre-germinal, germinal, and post-germinal center. Most of the B- cell lymphomas are derived from the germinal center. Like any other malignancy, B cell lymphomas can result from the genetic mutations affecting the proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes; however, the environment within the lymph nodes can also promote lymphomagenesis.

Genetic alterations in the BCL6 gene can be seen in 20% to 40% of the patients. Chronic immunodeficiency of T cells and B cell stimulation can be the possible cause for NHL in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients. Certain infectious agents can directly manipulate the DNA, as seen in Burkitt's lymphoma, where the Epstein Barr virus DNA is transported into the B cell nucleus, thus altering the B cell growth and development.

Likewise, an immunosuppressive medication used in transplant patients is a risk factor for the development of B-cell lymphomas. Also, the transformation from different kinds of lymphomas, including splenic marginal zone lymphoma, marginal zone (MALT) lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Ritcher transformation), can result in DLBCL. Other risk factors for the development of B-cell lymphomas include family or personal history of lymphoma, history of radiation, and chemotherapy. Chemical agents such as dyes and pesticides can also increase the risk for lymphoma. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is more common in obeseÂ and patients with an underlying history of autoimmune diseases.
