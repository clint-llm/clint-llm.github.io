The buccal fat pad, also known as Bichat’s fat pad, is an important anatomical structure that contributes to facial aesthetics and facilitates movement of the facial muscles. Many studies have researched the utility of the buccal fat pad in the areas of oral defect repair and trauma, as the buccal fat pad may be utilized as a pedicled autogenous graft for oroantral fistula repair. However, the buccal fat pad plays an important role in facial aesthetics and may be modified to enhance facial contour.

When indicated, the buccal fat pad’s removal enhances the zygomatic prominences and overall contour of the face. This article aims to discuss the anatomy and physiology of the BFP and discuss the indications, techniques, and complications associated with the removal of the BFP to enhance facial aesthetics.
