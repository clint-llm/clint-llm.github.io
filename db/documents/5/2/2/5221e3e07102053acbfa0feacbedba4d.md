The most common complication of NPPV is mask discomfort. More serious adverse effects include skin rash secondary to hypersensitivity or infection and rarely nasal bridge ulcers. Aerophagia and sialorrhea are also complications that may arise.

Patients may experience symptoms related to the pressure, including discomfort, ear and sinus pain, or gastric insufflation. Serious side effects from pressure include pneumothorax, pneumocephalus, and more recently, pneumomediastinum from NPPV in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.

Aspiration is a serious complication of NPPV, and steps should be taken during patient selection to ensure that patients on NPPV are at low risk of aspiration. Sedation in NPPV has not been well studied due to the thought process that it can lead to an increased risk of aspiration and hypoventilation.

Rarely when patients co-present with respiratory failure and compromised cardiac output, NPPV will cause hemodynamic compromise due to increased intrathoracic pressure and right ventricular afterload, as well as reduced preload.

The final complication arises from patient-ventilator dyssynchrony with BPAP. This falls under two categories: Failure to trigger and failure to cycle, leading to inadequate gas exchange and unnecessary expiratory muscle use. An example of failure to cycle would be during COPD, where rapid inhalations may not give the BPAP adequate time to cycle from inspiration to expiration. Thus, the patient will be expiring against the ventilatorâ€™s effort to deliver inspiratory pressure, leading to respiratory discomfort and distress.
