The diagnosis of HTC can be established based on the peculiar clinical symptoms of tumoral calcinosis and the pattern of blood investigation reports. The findings in various blood tests include:

- Elevated serum phosphate levels

- Normal serum calcium levels

- Elevated to inappropriately normal serum 1, 25 dihydroxy Vitamin D levels

- Inappropriately increased tubular reabsorption of phosphorus

- Low-normal serum parathyroid levels

- Normal kidney function

- Elevated serum levels of C-terminal fragments of FGF23 (assessed by ELISA immunoassay)

When the clinical and laboratory investigations do not confirm the diagnosis in a suspected patient, genetic testing for FGF23, GALNT3, or KL gene may be helpful.

**Plain Radiography**

X-ray of the affected part demonstrates a heterogenous calcified mass in HTC.

**CT Scan**

To characterize the anatomical features of the calcified masses, especially beforeÂ surgical excision, a CT scan may be done. However, the risk-benefit ratio must be adequately assessed given the exposure to a high amount of harmful radiation.
