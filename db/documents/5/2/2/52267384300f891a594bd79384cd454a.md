After a careful history and physical exam are completed, laboratory studies should be obtained. If the patient has altered mental status, bedside blood glucose should be obtained. Additional laboratory tests include a complete blood count a basic metabolic panel to assess for electrolyte abnormalities and kidney function. Additionally, a hepatic panel, creatine kinase, and urine analysis may be useful. If intentional ingestion is suspected, a salicylate and acetaminophen concentration should also be obtained. A baclofen level is not typically available in time to be clinically useful. However, a serum baclofen level may be sent to a specialty laboratory if confirmation is required.

Additional diagnostic tests include an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess for cardiac abnormalities and a computed tomography of the head to evaluate alternative etiologies of altered mental status. An electroencephalogram (EEG) may be helpful in a comatose patient with concerns for non-convulsive status epilepticus. If the patient has an intrathecal baclofen pump, the managing physician should be contacted, and the pump should be interrogated. Plain radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine can be obtained to confirm the location and patency of the pump and pump tubing.
