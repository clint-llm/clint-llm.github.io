Mallet finger injuries are best managed by an interprofessional team because the ideal treatment is not known. While conservative treatment with splints is widely used for mild injuries, the outcomes are unpredictable. Surgery is often done but again the results are not optimal. The nurse practitioner, emergency department physician, and primary care provider may need to refer these patients to a hand or plastic surgeon for further evaluation. Poorly treated mallet finger injuries are associated with high morbidity. Orthopedic or emergency department nurses should educate patients about splinting and communicate with the treating provider if there are issues. Irrespective of the type of treatment, patients should be encouraged to seek physical therapy. [Level 5]
