Physicians, nurses, and pharmacists in many parts of the world continue to use methimazole because of its effectiveness and low cost for treating hyperthyroidism (mainly for Graves disease). However, it is essential to know the side effects of methimazole, particularly severe drug allergy when taken with multiple medications, and side effects with the use of any thioamide medication in general. Furthermore, it is imperative to counsel the patient about rare side effects like agranulocytosis or liver failure before starting the medication.

In general, methimazole prescribing should be from an endocrinologist, with patient monitoring by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. Dose changes must not occur without first consulting with the endocrinologist. The pharmacist should verify all dosing, perform mediation reconciliation, and report any concerns to the healthcare team. Nursing can verify medication compliance along with the pharmacist, as well as observe for any adverse effects. It is essential to communicate openly with all interprofessional team members to improve patient safety and better patient outcomes associated with methimazole use.[Level V]
