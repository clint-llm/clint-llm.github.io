Keratosis pilaris is among the most common dermatologic conditions and can be considered a normal variant. It is the most common follicular keratosis. The condition is multifactorial and innocuous, affecting the extensor surfaces of the proximal extremities. Keratosis pilaris first appears in early childhood and progresses, becoming most extensive during the second decade of life. Keratosis pilaris is associated with many other conditions, including atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis vulgaris, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition. It can also present in conjunction with syndromes such as Down syndrome and Noonan syndrome.
