# Continuing Education Activity

Hemianopsia (hemianopia) is a clinical term used to describe the loss of one half of a vertical visual field. A careful history and physical examination may provide valuable information regarding the location of the pathologic lesion. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of hemianopsia and reviews the role of the clinician managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of hemianopsia and its association with neurological emergencies.
- Review the evaluation process for hemianopsia. 

- Outline the management options available for hemianopsia.
- Summarize some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of hemianopsia and associated pathologic conditions to improve patient outcomes.

# Introduction

Hemianopsia results from the disruption of visual pathways within the central nervous system. Understanding the functional anatomy of the visual pathway can help localize pathologic lesions. In brief, visual stimuli are received by each retina and transmitted along the optic nerves to the optic chiasm. Grossly, the retinal fibers divide into nasal and temporal fibers. The nasal fibers decussate at the optic chiasm allowing information about the right and left visual fields to split into their respective pathways for processing in the contralateral side of the brain.

Lesions may classify as prechiasmal, chiasmal, or retrochiasmal. Prechiasmal lesions impact the optic nerve and produce monocular blindness in the affected eye.

Homonymous hemianopsia, in conjunction with an afferent pupillary defect, localizes the lesion to the optic tract.

Homonymous hemianopsia with preservation of the central visual field, otherwise known as macular sparing, is suggestive of damage to the primary visual cortex, which receives dual vascular supply from the middle and posterior cerebral arteries.

# Etiology

Homonymous hemianopsia may result from stroke, head trauma, mass occupying lesions, invasive surgical procedures, or neurologic conditions such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, and epilepsy.

# Epidemiology

The epidemiology of hemianopsia depends on the type of pathologic insult. Stroke is the most common cause of homonymous hemianopsia.

In contrast, homonymous hemianopsia in non-stroke patients was a result of damage to the occipital lobe (24%, optic radiations (31%), optic tract (19%), or multiple locations along the visual pathway (25%).

# History and Physical

Patients presenting with visual complaints should undergo a complete physical examination, including a thorough neurologic evaluation. Signs and symptoms of neurologic emergencies, such as an acute change in mental status or the presence of new focal neurologic deficits, should prompt rapid acquisition of vital signs and appropriate airway, circulation, and breathing management.

A visual acuity test and complete cranial nerve assessment should be performed in all individuals to assess for visual deficits. The examiner should place particular attention on the pupillary examination as well as visual field testing. A bitemporal visual field defect localizes the pathologic lesion to the optic chiasm, whereas the presence of a homonymous visual field defect suggests damage to the areas posterior to the optic chiasm such as the optic tract, optic radiations, or primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Homonymous hemianopsia, in conjunction with an afferent pupillary defect, localizes the lesion to the optic tract.

# Evaluation

Neuroimaging, in conjunction with physical examination findings, may be used to characterize the cause of hemianopsia and guide clinical management.

Patients with focal neurologic findings suggestive of stroke and within the window for intervention (chemical or mechanical thrombectomy) should receive prompt imaging per institutional protocols or the AHA Stroke Guidelines.

MRI of the brain best evaluates both bitemporal hemianopsia and homonymous hemianopsia with contrast. In the case of bitemporal hemianopsia, special attention should focus on the structure of the optic chiasm and sellar region. With homonymous hemianopsia, the retrochiasmal structures, including the optic tract and occipital lobe, should be well characterized.

Diffusion-weighted imaging is preferable for detecting vasogenic edema associated with acute ischemic changes. Note that CT may be employed in emergent scenarios to evaluate for ischemia, mass lesions, or vascular aneurysms. CT angiogram is helpful in the case of large vessel pathologies, such as a middle cerebral artery or posterior cerebral artery occlusion.

# Treatment / Management

The results of physical examination and imaging studies should guide clinical management. Patients with cerebral infarct or hemorrhage require management accordingly. Consultation with neurology and neurosurgery should take place when appropriate. Patients with mass lesions or signs of increased intracranial pressure may also require admission for medical or surgical therapy.

Patients with visual field deficits may not realize the limitations of their condition and should be advised not to drive.

# Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of hemianopsia relates closely to the underlying etiology. It, therefore, should include vascular pathology (cerebral infarct, intracranial hemorrhage, aneurysm, dissection), mass lesions, trauma, inflammatory, and degenerative neurologic conditions.

# Prognosis

Visual loss in the setting of stroke suggests a poor prognosis. Studies suggest that only 17 to 18% of patients with homonymous hemianopsia regain their vision within 28 to 30 days of the inciting event. Opportunities for visual recovery decrease over time.

# Complications

Visual field impairment has a significant impact on patient quality of life. Failure to recognize patterns of hemianopsia may delay definitive treatment and opportunities for rehabilitation.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients should receive education regarding risk factors for stroke, including hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, vascular disease, and smoking. Importantly, patients with visual field deficits may not recognize the extent of their functional impairment and should be instructed not to drive.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Hemianopsia is a debilitating condition. Patients with visual impairment may have difficulty navigating environments or performing essential tasks such as reading, writing, and driving. Consequently, patients with visual field deficits may suffer from depression and anxiety. A team-based and patient-centered approach for rehabilitation may improve patient quality of life. Occupational, physical therapy, and psychological therapy are essential resources for facilitating recovery.
