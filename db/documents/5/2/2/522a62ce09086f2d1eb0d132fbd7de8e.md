Dementia is associated with significant decreases in life expectancy compared to age-matched controls, with a median survival from diagnosis ranging from 4.5 years for men with Lewy body or Parkinsonian dementia to 12 years for women with Alzheimerâ€™s disease. BPSD correlates with more rapid progression of dementia and earlier mortality; whether the treatment has any impact on these variables is unknown.
