Wound infection is a common complication. Cleaning the wound is essential. Local antibiotic ointments may be applied to superficial, contaminated wounds. Systemic antibiotics may need to be prescribed in large and deep abrasions. It is important to weigh the need to prevent infection against the increase in antibiotic resistance. The tetanus immunization status of the patient should be assessed.

Wide and deep abrasions may result in the development of soft scars that may persist for months or years. Individuals with a tendency for keloid formation may develop extensive scarring, especially over the chest and shoulders.

The nature and association of abrasions are perhaps the most important aspect and should require adequate attention from clinicians to prevent negligence claims. The documentation, including photography of the injuries, should be preserved for a specified period.
