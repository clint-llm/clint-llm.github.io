Since autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease is a rare and recently identified disorder, the exact prevalence has not been determined, neither in the United States of America nor worldwide.

ADTKD-UMOD may present in adolescence with gout; hyperuricemia is highly prevalent. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often diagnosed in late adolescence or early adulthood. ADTKD-REN could present with hyperkalemia, anemia, and CKD as early as infancy. ADTKD-MUC1 patients generally develop CKD in their early twenties. ADTKD-HNF1B could present with genitourinary abnormalities in childhood, gout or diabetes in the teenage years, and CKD in the third decade of life. Extrarenal abnormalities are also possible. All subtypes usually lead to progressive ESRD, occurring typically between 25 and 70 years of age, and those with gout experience its onset between the age range of 3 and 51 years.

ADTKD is believed to be one of the commonest monogenic forms of renal disease, and overall it accounts for around 5% of all monogenic causes of CKD.
