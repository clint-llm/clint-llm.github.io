Aflibercept is delivered as an intravitreal injection into the affected eye. Aflibercept is a colorless solution that comes packaged in prefilled syringes. It must be stored in a refrigerator for extended periods but can be kept at room temperature for less than 24 hours. Clinicians should practice proper sterile surgical procedures when delivering any intravitreal injection.

According to the initial FDA approval dosage and administration, the recommended dose for aflibercept is 2 mg (0.05 mL) administered by intravitreal injection every four weeks (monthly) for the first three months, followed by 2 mg (0.05 mL) once every eight weeks (two months).

Landmark trials have established the benefit of the Treat-and-Extend regimen (TAE) compared to fixed dosing, which involves fewer injections and visits in total and superior outcomes. This regimen, which has become standard of care, involves aflibercept injections based on response to treatment. Treat-and-extend dosing regimens minimize the risk of recurrence of submacular edema and reduce capacity-planning in AMD services and treatment delays.

Understanding administration guidelines and following a strict, standardized protocol is essential to avoid severe complications of intravitreal aflibercept administration such as endophthalmitis, retinal tear, retinal detachment, and lens injury.

**Injection Protocol**

- First, the patient is placed in a comfortable, supine position.

- Lids, lashes, and surrounding skin are sterilized with 10% povidone-iodine.

- Several drops of Proparacaine Hydrochloride are instilled in the conjunctival cul-de-sac.

- Following the instillation of povidone-iodine and proparacaine drops, a speculum is inserted in the eye.

- Then, the physician determines the injection site by measuring 3.5Â to 4 millimeters posterior to the limbus in the superotemporal quadrant. Accurate measurement from the limbus is critical to prevent lens damage in phakic patients. Additionally, superior temporal intravitreal injection is generally preferred to avoid iatrogenic inferior retinal detachment.

- The patient is instructed to look in a particular direction depending on the injection site.

- The medication is injected gently through pars plana.

- After injection, the speculum is removed, and the eye is washed with a basic saline solution.
