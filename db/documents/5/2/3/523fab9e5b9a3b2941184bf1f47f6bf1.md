The deep petrosal nerve carries postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers that originated in the intermediate gray horn of the spinal cord, traveled through the sympathetic chain, then synapsed in the superior cervical ganglion. After synapse, the nerve fibers traveled in the carotid plexus eventually to form the deep petrosal nerve.

During its path in the foramen lacerum, the deep petrosal combines with the greater petrosal, which carries parasympathetic fibers from the superior salivary nucleus of the pons.
