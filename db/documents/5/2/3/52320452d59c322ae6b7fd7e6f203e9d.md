A hydrocele is a collection of peritoneal fluid between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis, which directly surrounds the testis and spermatic cord. Hydroceles arise from an imbalance of secretion and reabsorption of fluid from the tunica vaginalis. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of hydrocele and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of hydrocele medical conditions and emergencies.
- Summarize the appropriate evaluation of hydrocele.
- Review the management options available for hydrocele.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance hydrocele and improve outcomes.
