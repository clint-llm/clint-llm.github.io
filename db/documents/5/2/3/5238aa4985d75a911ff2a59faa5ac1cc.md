Infectious diseases are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. On occasion, nuclear medicine modalities can play a role in helping a clinician evaluate for occult or suspected sites of infection. Nuclear medicine has historically helped evaluate sources of infectious foci through the use of a variety of radiopharmaceuticals when structural imaging modalities such as radiography, sonography, CT, and MRI do not yield sufficient diagnostic information.

While structural imaging modalities can still provide significant diagnostic information, nuclear medicine can play an important role in distinguishing acute from chronic changes, active from healed disease, and information on the abnormal metabolic activity of affected tissues in the human body. More recently, advances in camera technologies with the wider use of hybrid imaging devices such as SPECT-CT, PET-CT, and PET-MR scanners have improved the specificity and sensitivity of different nuclear medicine exams used in evaluation for infection by combining the pathophysiologic information of nuclear medicine modalities with the structural information of cross-sectional imaging.

By itself, CT imaging has a number of limitations, including lack of morphological tissue changes in early infection and the inability to distinguish acute changes in patients with chronic morphological tissue changes. MRI's high sensitivity to water with T2/STIR imaging can play a role in evaluating inflammation and infection; however, it also has a limited role in distinguishing post-surgical and healing changes from active inflammation.
