Prevention of chronic and disseminated strongyloidiasis should be considered in patients at high risk for the disease. This includes the screening of asymptomatic patients, especially those with exposure to endemic areas. Serologic testing in asymptomatic individuals is warranted in patients:

- Patients with exposure to endemic areas that now require immunosuppressive therapies

- Those who have relevant environmental exposure and are now becoming organ donors

- Military personnel with a history of service in endemic areas, regardless of how remote the exposure was

- Immigrants and refugees from endemic areas

As with other soil-transmitted helminth infections, prevention of disease incidence in endemic areas is undertaken by sanitation, access to clean water, hand washing, and general hygiene.
