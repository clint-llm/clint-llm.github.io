There is no effective physiological mechanism for the removal of excess iron from the human body. When a red blood cell (RBC) becomes senescent, the reticuloendothelial macrophage phagocytizes it. Inside the macrophage, the heme part of the RBC breaks down into iron and protoporphyrin. Free iron releases into the plasma. Two molecules of plasma free iron (Fe3+) then bind to one serum transferrin, the main iron transport protein. Transferrin then transports iron to the storage site by binding the transferrin receptor. In iron overload stats, transferrin saturation causes labile plasma iron (LPI) and non-transferrin bound iron (NTBI) to readily enter multiple organs through L-type calcium channels (LCC), ZIP14, and divalent metal transporter (DMT1).

Excess iron in the cytoplasm produces reactive oxygen species via the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reaction. Increased reactive oxygen species levels cause mitochondrial damage, peroxidation of lipids, cell membrane damage, and disruption of the electron transport chain. Over time this leads to apoptosis of the target organ.
