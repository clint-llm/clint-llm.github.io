Despite being a relatively rare condition with low incidence, mesenteric venous thrombosis has increased in prevalence over the last 2 decades since the advent of computerized tomography (CT). However, mesenteric venous thrombosis is often not suspected in many patients, which underestimates its incidence. Acute mesenteric venous thrombosis causes 6% to 9% of all mesenteric ischemia cases. It accounts for 1 in 5,000-15,000 in-patient admissions and 1 in 1000 emergency department admissions. Computed tomography identifies approximately 90% of mesenteric venous thrombosis cases. Although mortality remains high (19% to 23%), there has been an increase in earlier mesenteric venous thrombosis recognition without laparotomy since abdominal imaging has become more common. In general, mesenteric venous thrombosis is more common in males and individuals 40 to 60 years of age.
