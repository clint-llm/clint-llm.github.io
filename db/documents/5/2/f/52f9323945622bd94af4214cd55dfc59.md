Clinically, the two areas of interest in prostaglandin I2 function are selective inhibition of COX-2, thereby preventing PGI2 expression, and pharmacologic addition of PGI2.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, including aspirin, indomethacin, and ibuprofen, all inhibit COX enzymes non-selectively. Currently, however, celecoxib is one of the only approved drugs able to inhibit COX-2 selectively.

Pharmacologic administration of PGI2 analogs is useful in pulmonary arterial hypertension, peripheral occlusive disease, and diabetic vascular complications.

Additionally, several animal models have shown promising results for the use of inhaled iloprost in the treatment for asthma due to its immunomodulatory effects.

It is important to realize that the dose of aspirin(acetylsalicylic acid), a prostaglandin synthase inhibitor have selective effects on the synthesis of thromboxane A2, a prothrombotic prostaglandin, and PGI2, a platelet anti-aggregating agent. Low dose aspirin inhibits more thromboxane A2 without much impact on PGI2, whereas a higher dose inhibits both. That is the main reason why low dose aspirin (such as 81 mg) rather than the high dose (such as 650 mg) is used clinically as antiplatelet therapy in medical practice.
