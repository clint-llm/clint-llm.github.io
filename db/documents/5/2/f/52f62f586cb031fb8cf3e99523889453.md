A comprehensive history and a detailed physical examination are necessary to evaluate patients with thymic hyperplasia, focusing on its signs and symptoms. Thymic hyperplasia is usually discovered incidentally after imaging is performed for an unrelated chest complaint. The thymus is located in the anterior mediastinum closely related to airways and major blood vessels. Thymic hyperplasia can compress these structures, causing the following symptoms:

- Shortness of breath

- Dysphagia

- Cough

- Loss of appetite

- Weight loss

- Chest pain

The thymus is located near the superior vena cava, and a massive true thymic hyperplasia could compress it, leading to superior vena cava syndrome.

- Swelling of face, neck, and upper chest

- Cyanosis

- Headaches

- Dizziness

- Lightheadedness

- Dyspnea

- Venous dilatation over the trunk

- Facial Flushing

- Stridor

- Neurologic signs

The lymphofollicular thymic hyperplasia is associated with autoimmune diseases like myasthenia gravis, Graves disease, or collagen vascular disorders. Patients with these autoimmune disorders can present with varying signs and symptoms depending upon the underlying disorder.

- **Myasthenia gravis:**It is a neurological autoimmune disease caused by autoimmunity against the acetylcholine receptor component of the neuromuscular junction. The lymphofollicular form of thymic hyperplasia is evidently involved in the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis with anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies.

- **Graves****disease:**The relation between thymic hyperplasia and Graves' disease was first described in 1912. Patients with Graves' disease should undergo a thorough evaluation of thymus. There seems to be a complex hormonal and immunological mechanism involved, but the exact pathogenesis is unclear.
