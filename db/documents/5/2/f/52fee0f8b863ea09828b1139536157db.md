Most of the cases can be managed with antibiotics; surgery can be adjunctive.

Medical management in the form of antibiotics includes:

- Penicillin G

- Beta-lactams with a long course of oral amoxicillin

- Cephalosporin

If the patient is allergic to penicillin, alternatives include:

- Clindamycin

- Macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin)

- Doxycycline

A combination of metronidazole and a beta-lactamase inhibitor may be tried in polymicrobial infections.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not indicated due to predictable antibiogram.

The duration of therapy is usually 6 to 12 months but can be shortened if surgical resection of the infected site has been performed. Type of surgery will depend upon the site and extent of the disease, but it usually involves incision and drainage of abscesses, decompression of closed space, and excision of sinus tracts.

The response to treatment can be monitored with imaging.
