Consider patient safety at home when deciding if inpatient evaluation is appropriate.

Be cautious with special evaluation populations, especially the elderly who may have possible drug-drug interactions or infections, and immunocompromised individuals, for example, those with HIV/AIDS, those receiving chemotherapy, or those who are immunosuppressed as part of therapy for transplant or chronic medical illness.
