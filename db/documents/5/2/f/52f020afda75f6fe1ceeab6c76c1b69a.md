The fibrinolytic system functions to dissolve fibrin, one of the main products of thrombin activity. Within this system, plasmin, serves as the major protease, utilizing fibrin contained within clots as a substrate for proteolysis and producing soluble products and thus maintaining the patency within the vascular system.

Before continuing it is important to briefly mention that while plasminâ€™s role is largely thought to be contained to the fibrinolytic system, the activators of plasminogen seem to play roles beyond regulation of fibrinolysis. Interestingly deficiencies of plasminogen are not associated with increased thrombotic events, but rather is associated with thickening of mucous membranes from an accumulation of fibrin; the hypothesis is that the lack of tendency towards thrombosis is from subsequent increases in other serine proteases activity.
