Patients presenting with cervical myelopathy predominately experience upper extremity symptoms. These may include hand clumsiness and a limited ability to perform fine motor tasks such as buttoning a shirt, combing hair, holding small objects, and differentiating coin sizes. In cases of lower extremity signs, patients typically ambulate with a wide-based gait and weakness. Neck pain and radicular symptoms are also common. Additionally, physicians should examine for a Lhermitte sign (provocative positions that create an electric shock-like sensation either down the back or into an extremity). Indicators of poor prognosis include bowel or bladder dysfunction and general weakness.

Obtaining a history from the patient should focus on the timeline of pain, radiation of pain, and inciting events. A presentation of radiating pain correlates with canal stenosis. Radiating pain as the main issue has a much more predictable surgical outcome than a presentation of non-specific neck pain that is likely related to muscle fatigue and strain.

All physical examinations should include an evaluation of the neurologic function of the arms, legs, bladder, and bowels. The key to a thorough exam is organization and patience. The clinician should evaluate not only strength but also sensation and reflexes. It is also important to examine the skin along the back and document the presence of tenderness to compression or any prior surgical scars.
