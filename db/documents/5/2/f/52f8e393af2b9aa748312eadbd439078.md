Traumatic fibromas develop as a response to local trauma or irritation. Typically, they present on the buccal mucosa and tongue. These areas are repetitively subjected to trauma, specifically occlusal trauma.

Traumatic ulcerative granulomas with stromal eosinophilia (TUGSE) are longstanding ulcerative lesions that arise from mucosal trauma.

Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia is generally classified as a type of denture stomatitis resulting from poor oral hygiene beneath an existing denture, ill-fitting dentures, or patients who continuously leave their dentures in place throughout the day and night.

Foods or liquids can cause thermal injury with extreme temperatures.

Aspirin-induced oral lesions are chemical burns caused by the placement of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) directly on the oral mucosa in an attempt to alleviate pain.
