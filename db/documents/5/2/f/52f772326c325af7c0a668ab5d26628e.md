Pregnancy results in a state of immune alteration, which is needed to prevent the destruction of the fetus by the maternal immune system.

Infections of the female urogenital tract can similarly impact birth outcomes, even though they are not always vertically-transmitted to the newborn. Such infections include bacterial vaginosis, mostly by group B streptococci (GBS). Bacterial vaginosis is an abnormal overgrowth of bacteria occurring in the setting of pH changes. GBS colonizes genitourinary tracts in many women but can cause significant fetal morbidity and mortality if left untreated; the most significant for prevalence is chorioamnionitis occurring by ascending infection. Chorioamnionitis or intraamniotic infection (IAI) is a condition wherein the fetal chorion and amnion become inflamed and infected.
