The treatment aims to prevent malignancy transformationÂ and to preserve the normal tissue and function. Since the disease commonly occurs in young people and it frequently remits spontaneously, the management of BP is generally conservative. Without treatment, BP lesions may regress in an average of 8 months. Treatment modalities include locally ablative or destructive therapies such as carbon dioxide (CO2) laser vaporization, cryotherapy, electrocoagulation, 5-aminolevulinic acid-mediated photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT), excisional surgery, and 5 fluorouracil (5FU). Moreover, topical imiquimod cream 5% once a day on an alternate day for one month has proven good results on limited lesions of BP with viral clearance in some cases. However, relapse often occurs with all treatment modalities.

Furthermore, there are prophylactic vaccines to prevent infection with oncologic HPV subtypes. Moreover, prevention from recurrence correlates with cessation of cigarette smoking.
