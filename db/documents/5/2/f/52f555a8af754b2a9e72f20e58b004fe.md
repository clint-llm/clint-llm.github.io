The two main layers of the skin are the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis is composed up of epithelial cells, and the dermis is composed of dense, irregular connective tissue where blood vessels, hair follicles, sweat glands, and other structures reside. The hypodermis situates beneath the dermis and is composed mostly of loose connective and fatty tissues. Muscle, tendons, ligaments, bone, and cartilage are all located below the hypodermis.
