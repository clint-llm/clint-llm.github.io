Asymptomatic patients do not require treatment and often remain stable for many years. However, those who develop symptomatic lung or extrapulmonary disease tend to have a guarded prognosis.

However, prolonged treatment with corticosteroids is not benign, and the adverse effects of these drugs are common.
