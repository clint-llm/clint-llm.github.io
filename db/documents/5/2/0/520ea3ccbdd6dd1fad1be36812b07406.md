The incidence of CRAO is approximately 1 per 100,000 people with less than 2% presenting with bilateral involvement. Mean age at presentation is the early 60s. Men have a slightly higher incidence than women. Patients diagnosed with CRAO have a life expectancy of 5.5 years compared to 15.4 years for age-matched non-CRAO patients. Risk factors are similar to other thromboembolic diseases and include hypertension, smoking, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypercoagulable states, and male gender. Approximately one-third of patients with CRAO have clinically significant ipsilateral carotid artery stenosis.
