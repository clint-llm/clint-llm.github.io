PPCM will present after 36 weeks of gestation, and the majority of cases is seen in the first month after delivery. An earlier presentation can occur in patients with underlying cardiac comorbidities as valvular or ischemic cardiomyopathy.

Presentation of PPCM can vary depending on the degree of the disease at the moment of presentation. Symptoms related to heart failure and related to pregnancy are paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, pedal edema, orthopnea, and dyspnea on exertion. Other symptoms included a dry cough, palpitations, increase of abdominal girth, lightheadedness, and chest pain.

Findings in the physical exam like jugular venous distentions, displaced apical impulse, third heart sound, and mitral regurgitation murmurs are common.
