Small duct primary sclerosing cholangitis (SDPSC) is a rare disease with an unclear prevalence due to limited studies. The rarity of SDPSC causes challenges in diagnosis. The diagnostic criteria for small-duct PSC included biochemical features of chronic cholestasis with unknown etiology, normal cholangiogram, liver histology compatible with PSC.So, health professionals should be aware of etiologies that can cause abnormal liver enzymes and try to rule out them by choosing the correct laboratory or imaging tests. After excluding known causes of chronic cholestasis, patients should evaluate by cholangiogram (MRCP preferred) and liver biopsy to distinguish SDPSC from LDPSC. The study by Bjornsson et al. revealed the difference in prognosis between SDPSC and LDPSC. They concluded SDPSC has longer transplantation-free survival than LDPSC (13 years vs. ten years, respectively). Also, in this study, cholangiocarcinoma did not occur in SDPSC patients except one patient who already progressed to LDPSC.SDPSC can recur even after liver transplantation.

In terms of improving outcomes and treatments, no data is available. Only one study evaluated the effect of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in SDPSC patients which did not show the delay in the progression of the disease, despite improvement in liver enzymes.
