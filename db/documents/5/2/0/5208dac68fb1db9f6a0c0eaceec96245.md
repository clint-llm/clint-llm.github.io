Blood glucose monitoring helps to identify patterns in the fluctuation of blood glucose (sugar) levels that occur in response to diet, exercise, medications, and pathological processes associated with blood glucose fluctuations, such as diabetes mellitus. Unusually high or low blood glucose levels can potentially lead to life-threatening conditions, both acute and chronic. Blood glucose level (BGL) or blood sugar level (BSL) monitoring conducted outside of clinical facilities, such as the home, are often referred to as capillary blood glucose (CBG) tests. In contrast, blood glucose tests performed at clinical facilities may include CBG and plasma glucose venous blood tests.
