An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a life-threatening condition that requires monitoring or treatment depending on the size of the aneurysm and/or symptomatology. An abdominal aortic aneurysm may be detected incidentally or at rupture time. An arterial aneurysm is defined as a permanent localized dilatation of the vessel by at least 150% compared to a relatively normal adjacent diameter of that artery. Risk factors for AAA include atherosclerosis (most common), smoking, advanced age, male gender, White race, family history of AAA, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and prior history of aortic dissection. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms and the need for an interprofessional team approach to improve the recognition of abdominal aortic aneurysms and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the histopathology of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
- Identify the location of most abdominal aortic aneurysms relative to the origin of the renal arteries.
- Outline some actions patients diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysms can take to lessen the risk of rupture.
- Summarize how interprofessional team strategies can improve the diagnosis and management of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
