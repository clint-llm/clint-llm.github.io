The saphenous nerve (SN) exits the femoral triangle at its apex and enters the adductor canal immediately lateral to the femoral artery. The saphenous nerve travels through the adductor canal until it diverges from the femoral artery distally. The saphenous nerve proceeds to exit between the sartorius and gracilis muscles.

The nerve to vastus medialis (NVM) has been previously described to travel within the adductor canal. However, other studies dispute this claim and report that the NVM travels through the subsartorial space, superficial to VAM, and deep to the sartorius muscle (see the section on clarification above). The subsartorial space also houses the subsartorial plexus, which is formed by contributions from three nerves: the medial cutaneous nerve of the thigh, the saphenous nerve, and the anterior branch of the obturator nerve.****
