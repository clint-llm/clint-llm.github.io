FA results from a loss of function mutation in the frataxin gene located in the centromeric region of chromosome 9q (9q13-21.1).

Without frataxin, iron accumulates within mitochondria, reacting with oxygen to generate free radicals while simultaneously reducing mitochondrial antioxidant capabilities. Cells that produce the most frataxin are most sensitive to FA. The deficiency of frataxin ultimately results in cell death, particularly of neurons, cardiomyocytes, and pancreatic beta cells.

A repeat expansion of the trinucleotide GAA (guanine-adenine-adenine), typically in the gene's first intron, is the leading cause of this disease.

Larger GAA expansions, particularly on the smaller allele, are associated with earlier onset of the disease, faster muscle weakness progression, higher frequency of cardiomyopathy, and areflexia in the upper extremities.

The vast majority of patients with FA are homozygous for the GAA expansion mutation.

The three most common include the II54F mutation in Southern Italians, the ATG>ATT mutation on the start codon, and the G130V mutation that is notable for slower disease progression, hyperreflexia, and minimal dysarthria. Compound heterozygotes may have atypical presentations such as the age of onset over 25, normoreflexia or hyperreflexia, and isolated spastic paraparesis without ataxia.
