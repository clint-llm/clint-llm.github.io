Smoking is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the human population and is one of the most modifiable risk factors for preventing human disease. More than 400,000 individuals die prematurely each year in the United States from cigarette use. This statistic represents almost one of every five deaths in the United States. The major diseases caused by cigarette smoking include premature atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, aortic aneurysms, chronic airway obstruction, malignancies, and sudden infant death syndrome. It is a preventable risk factor that clinicians can modify through counseling and pharmacotherapy to decrease the burden of disease caused by smoking impacting the human population.

Nicotine is the principal constituent of tobacco and is responsible for its addictive behavior.

The first trials of varenicline began in 2006. Varenicline acts as a partial nicotine receptor agonist similar to cytisine. Varenicline is used as a smoking cessation aid to help people stop smoking in conjunction with education and counseling. Varenicline is the first drug of choice for smoking cessation because it has demonstrated a significant effect in preventing both short-term and long-term relapse. Varenicline has been shown superior to bupropion and has equal efficacy to nicotine replacement therapy.
