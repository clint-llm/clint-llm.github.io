Failure of the graft can occur due to fluid build-up under the graft, infection, shearing, excessive tension, or poor vascularity of the wound bed. These complications can generally be avoided if appropriate wound bed preparation is performed along with meticulous hemostasis. The graft is further protected by securing it in place and by the dressings. Care must be taken along each step of the way to provide the graft with the best chance of survival.

Long term contracture and scarring can result. Contracture over joints can be improved by early mobilization, but this must be carefully balanced to avoid damage to the underlying grafts.
