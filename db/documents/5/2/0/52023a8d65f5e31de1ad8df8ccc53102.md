Radiation esophagitis is inflammation of the esophagus due to radiation. Radiation esophagitis is typically an adverse effect that develops in individuals receiving radiation cancer therapy, most commonly for breast, lung, and other lymphomas. Symptoms present two to three weeks after the initial therapy and include throat pain, dysphagia, and the sensation that food is stuck. Amifostine is a medication used as a radiation protector in selected populations at risk of radiation esophagitis. Typically administered via injection 30 minutes before therapy, patient studies have been promising, showing a reduced risk of developing radiation esophagitis. The goal when treating this condition is adequate nutrition intake, and it is advisable for patients to refrain from eating hot or spicy foods that can further irritate the esophageal lining. In severe cases, perforations, ulcerations, dysmotility, and tracheoesophageal fistulas can be seen. Although there is no cure for radiation esophagitis, symptoms regress 2 to 4 weeks after the completion of radiation treatment.
