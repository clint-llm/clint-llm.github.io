Several complications have been described, more frequently involving the central nervous system resulting in cognitive, motor, or sensory deficits. Associated neurological sequelae include most commonly seizures (63%), but also paralysis, intellectual disability, and behavioral changes. Late diagnosis and intervention can result in multiorgan failure and autonomic dysfunction, and ultimately death.
