Measured in decibels (dB), loudness discomfort level (LDL) describes the point at which a subject perceives a sound as being uncomfortably loud. In patients with hyperacusis, LDL is decreased by 16â€“18 dB compared to the general population, in whom the average LDL is around 100 dB.

There are several other proposed mechanisms. The prevalence of hyperacusis in those suffering from Williams syndrome led to the theory that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) dysfunction increases auditory sensitivity, however, the high rate of otitis media in Williams syndrome may be more contributory.
