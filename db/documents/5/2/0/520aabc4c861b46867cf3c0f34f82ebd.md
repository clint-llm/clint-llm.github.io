Depending on the degree of aspiration, you may need an Intensivist for airway, gas exchange, and cardiovascular management. A patient with worsening A-a gradient, tachypnea, hypercapnia, or decreasing Pao2/FiO2 ratio should be emergently evaluated by a critical care or rapid response team. A gastroenterologist may be needed if there is a chronic cause for aspiration or if there is ingestion of toxic material. A pulmonologist (if not the intensivist) may be useful in cases where diagnostic or interventional bronchoscopy is necessary.
