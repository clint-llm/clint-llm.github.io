Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin essential in cell development, metabolism, immune competency, vision, and reproductive functions.

The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of vitamin A by the Institute of Medicine in healthy adults is 700 micrograms/day for women and 900 micrograms/day for men.

Vitamin A deficiency-associated ocular symptoms have been shown to develop at concentrations less than 10 micrograms/dL.

A 12 to 1 ratio of beta-carotene to retinol absorption in a diet of mixed fruits and vegetables is the estimated conversion used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
