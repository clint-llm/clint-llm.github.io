The symptoms and signs associated with mild to severe acute VCM exposure-shortness of breath, cough, dizziness, headaches, respiratory depression, and CNS depression-could be due to any number of industrial toxins, particularly other volatile halogenated hydrocarbons. A history of VCM exposure will help guide diagnosis.

The symptoms of chronic occupational exposure to VCM, to include Raynaud phenomenon, thickening of the skin of the hands and forearms, and AOL of the distal phalanges collectively can resemble systemic sclerosis. The diagnosis can be differentiated based on the absence of antinuclear antibodies and a history of VCM exposure. Raynaud phenomenon could also be secondary to mechanical arterial obstruction, hyperviscosity of the blood, or exposure to some chemotherapeutics, environmental conditions, or vibrating tools.

The diagnosis of HAS should raise the suspicion of a history of significant VCM exposure. This rare tumor has also has links to chronic arsenic exposure, as well as a thorium-based radiocontrast which has not seen any use for many decades.
