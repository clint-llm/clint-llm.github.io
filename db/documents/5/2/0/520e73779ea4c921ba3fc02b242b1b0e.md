The complications associated with secondary TCH depend on the attributable cause. Secondary brain injury can occur in SAH due to intracerebral hemorrhage, intraventricular hemorrhage, intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus, subdural hematoma, or delayed cerebral ischemia. Medical complications are common and significantly impact outcomes. Reported complications include pyrexia, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, cardiac dysfunction, anemia, hyponatremia, hyperglycemia, and deep venous thrombosis.

Although one- to two-thirds of patients with RCVS develop ischemic or hemorrhagic brain lesions (or both), most achieve functional recovery and independence. Overall, the long-term recurrence rate of RCVS is low, and the relapse is typically benign.
