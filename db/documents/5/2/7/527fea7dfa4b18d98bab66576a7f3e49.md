Ignited napalm burns for a duration determined by the underlying material fueling the combustion but frequently burns for several hours.  The hypoxia caused by burst ignition resolves relatively rapidly (seconds to minutes) in open areas but can take much longer in closed environments. High carbon dioxide levels may remain for hours in enclosed environments especially given that its density causes it to settle into the lowest levels of terrain where cross currents may not disperse the gas for some time. Carbon monoxide is roughly equivalent to the density of ambient air and will disperse at a rate dependent on the degree of cross-current ventilation.
