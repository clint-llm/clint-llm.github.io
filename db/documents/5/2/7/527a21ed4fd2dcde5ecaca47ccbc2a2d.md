The esophagus is a muscular tube that actively transports food boluses from the hypopharynx to the stomach. This complex organ is essential for enteral feeding. When issues arise within the esophagus, whether benign or malignant, alternative methods for obtaining nutrition must be evaluated, such as gastrostomy tubes or jejunostomy tubes, however, if the esophagus is removed, then esophageal reconstruction must be considered.
