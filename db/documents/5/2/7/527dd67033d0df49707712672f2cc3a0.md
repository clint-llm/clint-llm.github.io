Osteoradionecrosis often results in the following complications:

- Ulceration and necrosis of the mucosa with exposed bone, inevitably leading to infection and necrotic bone.

- Exposed bone often leads to irritation of surrounding oral soft tissues.

- Pathologic fractures can form in the weakened bone.

- Fistulae are a sign of spreading local infection, and can ultimately lead to systemic infection and even sepsis if not appropriately managed.
