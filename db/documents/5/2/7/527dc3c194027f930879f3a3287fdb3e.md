**Primary Congenital Glaucoma**

The outcome of primary congenital glaucoma depends on the age at presentation and disease severity at presentation. Early diagnosis and management are associated with a good outcome.

**Axenfeld-Rieger Anomaly**

Frequent follow-up in Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly is essential. Prognosis depends on the age at presentation and disease severity at presentation. Systemic anomalies like cardiac anomalies are associated with a poor prognosis.

**Aniridia**

In**a**niridia, conventional glaucoma surgeries have poor outcomes; however, glaucoma drainage devices have been found to have relatively better outcomes.

**CHED**

Endothelial keratoplasties can help in achieving a good outcome. The risks of corneal graft rejection at two years postoperatively have been reported as 1% for DMEK, 12% for DSAEK, and  18% for PK.

**Sclerocornea**

In sclerocornea with severe corneal scleralization, limbus translocation is combined with penetrating keratoplasty with relatively good outcomes.

**Congenital Ectropion**

Congenital ectropion associated with glaucoma has a poor prognosis and requires early surgical intervention.
