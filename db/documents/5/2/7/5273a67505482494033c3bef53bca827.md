Prophylaxis remains a longstanding subject in the matter of prevention of IE or cardiac abscess. Thus far, prophylaxis is mostly based on observational studies and, in fact, places such as the United Kingdom no longer endorse antibiotic prophylaxis for dental procedures to prevent IE, the leading source of cardiac abscess.

One point against prophylaxis is the fact that tooth brushing has been proven to cause bacteremia and, therefore, makes it difficult to assess the rare versus high magnitude transient bacteremia and its effect on IE and its sequelae. For this reason, the United States and European countries have agreed that the use of prophylaxis is reserved only for those at "highest risk."

On that same matter, the widespread use of antibiotics for the prevention and treatment of IE and abscesses could potentially create a setting where there will be an increased incidence of polymicrobial infection and antibiotic resistance, especially in immunocompromised patients.

Furthermore, the risk of drug-related adverse effects increases with prolonged drug exposure. In the case of antibiotic therapy, vestibular, auditory, and nephrotoxic adverse effects are of major concern. These adverse effects require close monitoring and an expert team in the management of IE and its complications; these are, unfortunately, not widely available.
