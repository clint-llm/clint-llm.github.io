Terbinafine is an antifungal medication that works through the inhibition of squalene epoxidase. It has activity against most dermatophytes, and it has approval for use as an oral therapy for the treatment of onychomycosis. Although most side effects are mild and self-limited, such as headache and gastrointestinal symptoms, taste disturbances (dysgeusia) can range from mild to severe, resulting in weight loss, and have rarely been reported permanent. This activity describes the indications, mode of action, and side effects of terbinafine and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in ensuring proper usage.

- Identify the mechanism of action of terbinafine.
- Describe the adverse effects of terbinafine.
