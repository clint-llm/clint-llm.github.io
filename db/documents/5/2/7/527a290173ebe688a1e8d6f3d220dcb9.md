Multiple options are currently FDA approved forÂ penile prosthesis implantation. These include malleable devices and inflatable devices. Proper selection of implant type depends on surgeon experience/preference, patient factors, and, finally, anatomical considerations. Malleable devices consist of two solid intracavernosal implants which can either be bent upward to stimulate erection or down when not in use. Benefits include ease of implantation, ease of use for the patient, and low failure rates. However, rates of erosion may be higher, and patient satisfaction rates may be slightly lower.

Three-piece inflatable prostheses are the current gold standard as they allow for rigid erection and flaccidity when desired.
