The kidneys predominately clear the radiotracer, and the patient should be instructed to void frequently following radiotracer injection as to minimize the dose to the bladder. The average radiation dose the patient for skeletal scintigraphy is approximately 4.2 mSv, which is approximately half the dose of the average abdominal CT scan.

Although the incidence is unknown, methyl diphosphonate has been known to cause low blood pressure in certain patients.  As such, care should be taken to monitor the patient following injection and throughout imaging to ensure the patient is able to move safely following radiotracer administration.

Technetium 99m tagged radiotracers show excretion into breast milk. If the patient is breastfeeding, formula or stored breast milk should be used for a minimum of 24 hours.  The patient should be instructed to pump and discard her breast milk for the 24 hour following the study.
