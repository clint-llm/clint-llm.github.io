Nociceptive fibers differentiated into four distinct subtypes according to their physical characteristics and potential sensory stimuli transmitted:

Aalpha-fibers: function in proprioception, no thermal sensitivity, myelinated, a diameter of 13 to 20 um, conduction speeds of 80 to 120 m/s, carry information regarding the position of limbs, muscles, and joint capsules.

Abeta-fibers: function in mechanoreception (1 to 1.5 mN force threshold), no thermal sensitivity, myelinated, a diameter of 6 to 12 um, conduction speeds of 35 to 90 m/s, carry touch and pressure information from the skin.

Adelta-fibers: function in nociception (5 mN force threshold), thermally sensitive, myelinated, a diameter of 1 to 5 um, conduction speeds of 5 to 40 m/s, carry heat, cold, and mechanothermal information from the skin, alternatively; subpopulations without thermal sensitivity instead carry information regarding touch from the skin.

C-fibers: function in nociception, thermally sensitive, unmyelinated, a diameter of 0.02 to 1.5 um, conduction speeds of 0.5 to 2 m/s, carry polymodal information regarding mechanical, thermal, and/or chemical nociception; subpopulations include C-mechanonociceptors, C-mechanoheatnociceptors, C-mechanocoldnociceptors, C-heat nociceptors, and silent fibers only become heat-sensitive following sensitization.

In summary, all A-fibers are myelinated, and all C-fibers are unmyelinated; A-fibers have faster conduction speeds and larger diameter axons as compared to C-fibers, but of the A-fibers only A-delta-fibers play a role in nociception.

Calcium ion studies have shown that the severity of the noxious stimulus, whether it is thermal energy or mechanical force, correlates to the intensity of activation of the polymodal C-fibers.

A final note is that while many electrophysiological studies have presented findings suggesting the vast majority of nociceptive fibers act in a polymodal fashion at all times, calcium ion studies have found that in vivo nociceptors often report only a single nociceptive modality, i.e., an Adelta-fiber reporting noxious heat but not noxious force.
