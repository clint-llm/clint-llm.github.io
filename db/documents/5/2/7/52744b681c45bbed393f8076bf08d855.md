Pralidoxime is a relatively nontoxic drug, and instances of its toxicity are rare. In healthy volunteers, dizziness, diplopia, headache, tachycardia, and blurred vision may occur in the event of an overdose. These symptoms, however, are difficult to discern in a patient with organophosphate poisoning. Supportive therapy is sufficient to treat pralidoxime toxicity.
