Initiate stool testing for C. difficile when patients have positive guaiac diarrhea in combination with radiographic evidence of toxic megacolon or the presence of C. difficile risk factors such as hospitalization, antibiotic or chemotherapy exposure, and marked leukemoid reactions. Screening for C. difficile as the causative agent for pseudomembranous colitis begins with screening for the C. difficile toxins.

A common lab algorithm utilizes an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to screen for glutamate dehydrogenase antigen, present in most C. difficile isolates followed by EIA sampling for C. difficile toxin A and toxin B.

Nucleic acid amplification tests, polymerase chain reaction, loop-mediated isothermal amplification for C. difficile have excellent sensitivity and specificity with high positive likelihood ratios; utilization of these assays aids in clarifying discrepancies between glutamate dehydrogenase and EIA toxin results. Nucleic acid amplification tests results should be interpreted with caution because they do not distinguish C. difficile colonization from active infection unless testing for concurrent toxin production.

Consider initiating testing for C. difficile colitis on inpatients having multiple, 3, liquid consistency stools per day. Avoid sending stool samples to test for a cure because assays remain positive in 60% upon completing therapy. With its inherent hazards and monetary fees, endoscopy is not recommended unless clinical suspicion persists despite negative diagnostic testing.
