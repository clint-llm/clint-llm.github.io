After pneumonia, inflammation, and narrowing of the bronchus leads to the formation of an endobronchial ball valve that leads to the distal dilatation of the bronchi and alveoli. The obstruction is believed to be caused by inflammatory exudates within the airway lumen or wall, allowing air to enter the cystic space but not to leave it. Subsequent enlargement of the pneumatocele occurs either due to pressure from the adjacent pneumatocele or intraluminal inflammatory exudates.

After trauma, pseudocysts are produced by shearing forces causing pulmonary laceration accompanied by the escape of air or fluid into the tissue.

Regarding traumatic pneumatocele, the exact mechanism is unknown, but several theories have been proposed.

Some suggest that concussive waves produced by blunt trauma create shearing forces that tear the lung parenchyma. The concussive forces of a high-velocity impact with low displacement of the chest wall result in a peripheral pseudocyst, whereas the compressive forces of a low-velocity impact with high displacement of the chest wall resulting in a central pseudocyst. An intraparenchymal pulmonary laceration with airway disruption and leaking of air into the pulmonary parenchyma occurs in both mechanisms.

Others are of the opinion that traumatic pneumatocele follows sudden, severe compression of a segment of the peripheral bronchial tree, which obstructs the bronchus and transmits an explosive pressure distally. This creates a "bursting lesion."

These theories led to the proposal of a two-step mechanism.

First, compressive traumatic forces increase intrapulmonary pressure until the parenchyma bursts, thus producing lacerations.

Second, decompression of the chest and increased negative intrathoracic pressure allow the elastic tissue of the lung to recoil, permitting the formation of small cavities filled with air or fluid.

Each cavity then continues to grow in size until the pressure within the cavity is equal to that of the surrounding parenchyma.

Following penetrating trauma, "one-way" or "check-valve" mechanism where air enters a laceration in the pulmonary parenchyma, but the defect seals quickly, the air becomes trapped and is unable to escape the pleural space resulting in pneumatocele formation. Continuous positive airway pressure in mechanically ventilated patients is thought to result in pneumatocele formation in a similar way.

Traumatic pneumatocele after a chest injury requires a violent impact directed on a pliable chest wall so that kinetic energy is transmitted to the underlying pulmonary parenchyma. The significance and behavior of the pneumatocele depend on the impact velocity, the degree of chest wall displacement, and the elasticity of the chest wall in blunt chest trauma. It is believed that the more elastic and pliable chest wall of young people and children permits the transmission of kinetic energy more efficiently to the underlying lung parenchyma. The condition is characterized by the appearance of pulmonary cavities with no epithelial lining, filled with air, fluid, or blood, which can be observed on radiological imaging. Pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum might coexist. The presence of a traumatic pneumatocele indicates that tissue disruption is more extensive, and the injury is more severe than a simple contusion.

It is important to note that the lesion may not be located in the immediate region of chest wall injury. In some cases of traumatic pneumatocele, the traumatic force is transmitted in a contra-coup manner. The velocity of impact and degree of chest wall displacement may also contribute to the location of pneumatocele.

A high-velocity impact produces peripheral alveolar injury while a low velocity, high displacement impact produces central parenchymal injury. All patients with traumatic pneumatoceles involved in a study of high-speed accidents developed pneumatocele lesions peripherally.

In literature, a case of extrathoracic pneumatocele in untreated tuberculosis patients has been described where communication between extrathoracic pneumatocele with the lung parenchyma was thought to be established by an old scar for cold abscess drainage.

Hydrocarbons induced lung injuries are characterized by rapid progression of respiratory difficulty without causative factors and the presence of ground-glass opacities, spontaneous air leak syndrome resulting in pneumatoceles, and consolidation with later diffuse centrilobular nodular opacity on chest computed tomography (CT).

Hydrocarbons contain polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG), oligo (2-[2-ethoxy]ethoxyethyl) guanidinium chloride (PGH), 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (CMIT), or 2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (MIT). PHMG and PGH are commonly thought to caused hydrocarbon associated lung injuries. Animal studies have not established definitive links between exposure to hydrocarbons containing CMIT and/or MIT despite the fact that patients exposed to hydrocarbons containing only CMIT and/or MIT showed clinically similar lung injuryÂ to that of hydrocarbons containing PHMG and/or PGH.

Persistent interstitial pulmonary emphysema (PIPE) when diffuse can be associated with pneumatocele formation. PIPE is a rare entity that is related to mechanical ventilation-induced lung damage in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome. Although PIPE localized in one lobe has the potential for curative resection, diffuse PIPE (DPIPE) affecting both lungs carries a poor prognosis.

Kohn's pores theory is explained in a Brazilian study as a cause of pneumatocele formation. It is speculated that undernutrition delayed development of Kohn's pores and undernourished children would then have lungs similar to a newborn when valvular obstruction occurs, air continues to enter with no way out of the segment due to the absence of Kohn's pores; this forms the pneumatocele. Kohn's pores importance in pneumatocele development may account for the scarcity of pneumatoceles in adults where the Kohn's pores are already developed.

Infectious agents associated with pneumatocele formation are as follows:

- 
Streptococcus pneumoniae

- Staphylococcus aureus, 60% cases result in pneumatocele, more common in children, less common pneumatocele in adults( Egyptian int med) r they related. In an analysis of burns patients, a patient who develops staphylococcal pneumonia develops pneumatocele as well.S. aureus and Candida colonization leading to multiple pneumatoceles is also reported. Pneumatocoeles were identified in 37 out of 100 S. aureus pneumonia cases, patients most of these were only noted on radiographs taken some days after admission

- Pneumocystis carinii in HIV

- 
Pseudomonas aeruginosa

- Group A streptococci

- Klebsiella pneumoniae

- Adenovirus

- Mycobacterium TB, pneumatoceles can develop during or after treatment of TB

- Proteus mirabilis and ESBL Proteus mirabilis

- Ecoli cavitary pneumonia has been associated with the formation of pneumatocele.

- 
Acinetobacter calcoaceticus

- 
Hemophilus influenzae B

- Bacteroid species, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Fusobacterium species
