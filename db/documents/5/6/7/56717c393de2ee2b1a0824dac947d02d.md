Priapism is a disorder in which the penis maintains a prolonged, rigid erection in the absence of appropriate stimulation. Definitions vary regarding duration, but any erection lasting four hours or longer is generally considered priapism.

Three broad categories exist for this disease: ischemic, non-ischemic, and recurrent ischemic. Ischemic causes of priapism are a true emergency and require prompt intervention to prevent damage to the penis, which can progress to complete and permanent erectile dysfunction. Emergent management of this disease is directed toward achieving detumescence.

Early intervention is essential for the functional recovery of erectile ability. If left untreated, penile corporal tissue necrosis and eventually fibrosis result along with permanent erectile dysfunction.
