The small, hyperkeratotic papules of reactive perforating collagenosis can be present in any area of the body. The inherited form begins in infancy as papules located on the extensor surfaces of the hands, elbows, and knees, most likely after superficial trauma to the area. Reactive perforating collagenosis lesions then grow into larger, umbilicated papulonodules with central adherent keratin plugging. The lesions will most commonly resolve spontaneously in six to eight weeks, leaving behind a hypopigmented area or scar. The patient will most likely complain of pruritus of the lesions. Koebner phenomenon of the lesions can occur. These lesions can occur, and most patients will experience a relapsing and remitting course of the disease throughout their life. Five cases reported of a giant variant of acquired reactive perforating collagenosis have been reported. In one case, a 60-year-old woman on hemodialysis presented with 1 cm to 10 cm papules with a central keratotic plug that showed transepidermal elimination of collagen on histology. She had a six-month history of pruritus with the lesions.
