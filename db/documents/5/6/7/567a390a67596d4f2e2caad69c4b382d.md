Cirrhosis and portal hypertension can trigger the neurohormonal cascade which leads to the development of HRS. This, in turn, causes the production and release of vasodilators and cytokines like nitric oxide and prostaglandins which cause splanchnic and systemic vasodilation. The systemic drop in circulating pressure triggers the carotid and aortic arch baroreceptors to activate three separate compensatory mechanisms. These include the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, vasopressin release, and activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The progression of the cirrhosis causes the fall in cardiac output and the fall in systemic vascular resistance in a cycle that induces further renal vasoconstriction.

The most common precipitating factors of HRS are spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, large volume paracentesis of ascites without plasma expansion and gastrointestinal bleeding.
