The cause of ileus has yet to be clearly defined. There are, however, several risk factors that have been shown to increase the likelihood and endurance of an ileus.

- Prolonged abdominal/pelvic surgery

- Lower gastrointestinal (GI) surgery

- Open surgery

- Retroperitoneal spinal surgery

- Opioid use

- Intra-abdominal inflammation (sepsis/peritonitis)

- Peritoneal carcinomatosis

- Perioperative complications (pneumonia, abscess)

- Bleeding (intraoperative or postoperative)

- Hypokalemia

- Delayed enteral nutrition or nasogastric (NG) tube placement

The risk for an ileus is influenced by a variety of factors, each affecting a small part of the complex neuroimmune system. These factors include pharmacological agents such as opioids, antihypertensives, and antiemetics, as well as medical conditions including pneumonia, stroke, and electrolyte abnormalities.
