Differentiation of sinus bradycardia from other bradyarrhythmias is done by establishing a relationship between P waves and QRS complexes on an electrocardiogram. Nondiscernible P waves are associated with junctional or ventricular escape rhythms. Whereas second or third-degree AV blocks will have more than a 1-to-1 relationship between P waves and QRS complexes

Rhythms on the differentials are:

- Sick sinus rhythm

- Wandering atrial pacemaker

- Junctional escape rhythm

- Ventricular escape rhythm
