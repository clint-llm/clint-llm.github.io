Spinal shock is a result of severe spinal cord injury. It usually requires high-impact, direct trauma that leads to severe spinal cord injury and spinal shock. The initial encounter with a patient with spinal shock is usually under a trauma scenario. Ischemia of the spinal cord can also produce spinal shock; for example, a hypotensive patient in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) or a post-angiography patient with thrombotic occlusion of arteries that supply the cervical spine can develop this disease. Treatment of ischemic spinal shock is different from traumatic spinal shock. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of spinal shock and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and pathophysiology of spinal shock.
- Outline the recommended evaluation and examination for patients presenting with suspected spinal shock.
- Summarize the appropriate management of spinal shock.
- Explain the significance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team when diagnosing and treating patients with spinal shock.
