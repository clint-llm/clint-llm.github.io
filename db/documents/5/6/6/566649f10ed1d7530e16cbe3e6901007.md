**Statistical Significance**

If the probability of obtaining a test statistic value by chance (p-value) is less than .05, then the experimental hypothesis is accepted as true. Another way of to think about p-values is the probability that the null hypothesis is true, which for a cutoff of p is less than .05 would mean there is a less than 5% chance that the difference observed is not a true difference.
