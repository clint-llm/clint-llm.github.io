As myoglobin is present in the muscle cells, myoglobinuria is associated with damage to the cell membranes of myocytes. Numerous etiologies can lead to the rupture of the myocytes' cell membranes. They can be categorized broadly into **physical and non-physical**causes.

1. Examples of **physical causes**are trauma, crush injury, heatstroke, hypothermia, malignant hyperthermia, extensive burns, seizures, strenuous exercise, and prolonged immobility.

2. The **non-physical**causes include hypoxic injury, metabolic disturbances, genetic disorders, infections, drugs, and toxins.

- Examples of hypoxic injury are carbon monoxide poisoning, vascular thrombosis, and vasculitis.

- Metabolic disturbances leading to myoglobinuria include hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, and hypernatremia.

- Genetic disorders leading to muscle cell breakdown include disorders of carbohydrate metabolism (e.g., McArdle disease, phosphofructokinase deficiency), disorders of lipid metabolism (e.g., carnitine deficiency), muscular dystrophy, dermatomyositis, and polymyositis.

- Infections mostly causing rhabdomyolysis include coxsackievirus, malaria, herpes virus, influenza virus, HIV, Legionella, and salmonella.

- Drugs and toxins which cause rhabdomyolysis are alcohol, sedative-hypnotics, cocaine, methadone, antilipemic drugs, and many others.
