The presence of a benediction sign indicates ulnar neuropathy. However, the diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy depends initially on the relevant clinical history and examination. On physical examination, other clinical signs of ulnar neuropathy are also usually observable.

- Froment sign: It is due to the weakness of the adductor pollicis muscle, which normally adducts the thumb. Therefore, when the clinician asks a patient to pinch a piece of paper between thethumb and index fingers, the distal phalanx of the thumb flexes due to involuntarily activation of the flexor pollicis longus, a median nerve–innervated muscle.

- Wartenberg sign: It is due to the weakness of the third palmar interosseous muscle. It results in the inability to adduct the little finger. Therefore, the little finger remains abducted and gets caught when the patient tries to put the hand in a pocket.

- Atrophy of the intrinsic muscles, particularly the hypothenar muscles, may develop in more progressed cases. Therefore, prevention and prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential for a favorable prognosis.

Since clinical history and physical examination are subjective and imprecise. Accordingly, electromyography and nerve conduction studies, and ultrasound studies are also used to confirm the diagnosis.
