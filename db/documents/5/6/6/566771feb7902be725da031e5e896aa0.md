When suspecting mediastinitis, patients should have a prompt primary assessment of the airway, breathing, and circulation. If necessary, resuscitative measures should precede labs and imaging. Once a patient is stabilized, obtaining critical imaging is the next step to evaluate for the diagnosis. A chest radiograph can be helpful if signs of mediastinal widening or pneumomediastinum are present; however, they often do not adequately portray the extension of the disease process.

Postoperative mediastinitis may be difficult to assess with imaging due to the physiologic postoperative changes that are often identified in radiographic studies. After 14 days of surgery, the sensitivity and specificity of computed tomography greatly increase.

Laboratory studies for acute mediastinitis can present with leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and procalcitonin. Blood cultures should also be sent, particularly in those with suspected postoperative mediastinitis as bacteremia is a common feature of the disease.

Fibrosis mediastinitis most commonly manifests as an infiltrative mass on computed tomography that distorts the mediastinal fat planes and extends into the surrounding mediastinal structures. It can be diffuse or localized to one area. Additionally, it can present as calcifications on imaging, notably when mediastinitis is associated with histoplasmosis. Frequently, the localized mass is in the hila, paratracheal, or subcarinal areas.
