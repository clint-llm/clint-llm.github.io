**Pacemaker**

Preoperatively, it is imperative to understand the indication for the device, battery status, and current settings. Patients undergoing surgery who have a permanent pacemaker may experience interference with function due to use of intraoperative electrocautery.

**Automatic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (AICD)**

Patients with an AICD who are undergoing surgery require deactivation of the device to avoid accidental defibrillation as a result of interference from electrocautery.

During the period of deactivation, the patient's electrocardiogram requires constant monitoring and the ability for prompt external cardioversion must be available.
