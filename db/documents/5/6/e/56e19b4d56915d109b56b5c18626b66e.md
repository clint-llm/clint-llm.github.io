Peripheral polyneuropathies can be encountered in many clinical settings regardless of specialty and cause significant morbidity to patients due to the accompanying pain, weakness, and deformity associated with them. In some estimates, its prevalence in the general population is 1Â to 3% and increases to 7% in patients older than 50.

Ideally, a thorough history by the primary care or referring physician should be performed, including past medical history, surgeries, medications used, diet, recreational drug or alcohol use, occupational exposures, and family history. The referring physician may choose to start a diagnostic workup with blood work based on the working differential diagnosis to assist the electrodiagnostician.

An interprofessional approach to patient care should be pursued, which would involve an open dialogue between the referring physician and the physician performing the electrodiagnostic testing. Ideally, a discussion about any relevant history, physical, or lab findings before the EDX testing can help narrow down the differential and assist in planning the NCV and EMG studies. The electrodiagnostic results can help the referring physician decide whether to pursue additional studies such as CSF analysis or nerve biopsy to assist with the diagnosis and treatment plan.
