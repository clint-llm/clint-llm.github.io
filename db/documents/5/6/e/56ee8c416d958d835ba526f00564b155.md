Early accounts of a distinctive Colorado brown stain were paramount to discovering the link between excessive fluoride ingestion and developing a hypoplastic dentition that wouldÂ later be termed dental fluorosis.

The element fluorine is found most abundantly in its fluoride form in nature.

The most common route of fluoride ingestion is via drinking water.

The provision of systemic fluoride supplements, artificial water fluoridation, and the direct topical application of fluoride-containing dentifrices are preventative measures employed to reduce the risk of caries development.
