Collaboration among ophthalmologists, neurologists, primary care doctors, optometrists, and opticians will allow for improved healthcare outcomes due to more prompt and accurate diagnosis, better treatment, and less risk of amblyopia, loss of binocularity, and loss of quality of life due to asthenopia, dizziness, diplopia, nervousness, headache, imbalance, nausea, spectacle intolerance, and distorted space perception. Neurologists and primary care doctors should include aniseikonia in their differential diagnosis when aniseikonia-specific symptoms are reported by a patient and refer to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for additional investigation.

When possible, ophthalmologists should avoid performing procedures likely to cause aniseikonia and promote procedures that can treat aniseikonia. Optometrists and ophthalmologists should treat aniseikonia with optical means such as contact lenses and contact lenses in combination with spectacles and refer for iseikonic spectacles when needed. Opticians should be trained on the optics and manufacture of iseikonic lenses and how to make them as cosmetically appealing and user-friendly as possible.
