The use of axial flaps is contraindicated in patients who present with an active infection at the recipient site, or if there is any compromise to the flap pedicle or inadequate debridement of the wound bed. Relative contraindications, including smoking, are common to all flap surgery as it increases the risk of flap necrosis. Furthermore, avoiding radiated skin areas as the donor site is recommended to reduce the risk of flap failure.
