VSD develops when there is a developmental abnormality or an interruption of the interventricular septum formation during the complex embryologic heart morphogenesis. VSDs are frequently isolated; however, they can occur in association with other congenital heart defects such as atrial septal defects, patent ductus arteriosus, right aortic arch, and pulmonic stenosis. They are also found in cases of aortic coarctation and sub-aortic stenosis, and they are a frequent component of complex congenital heart disease such as Tetralogy of Fallot and transposition of great arteries. Several genetic factors have been identified to cause VSDs including chromosomal, a single gene, and polygenic inheritance. A TBX5 mutation was recently discovered to cause septal defects in patients with Holt-Oram syndrome. Non-inherited risk factors have been implicated in the development of VSDs; these include maternal infection (rubella, influenza, and febrile illness), maternal diabetes mellitus, and phenylketonuria. Exposure to toxins like alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, and certain medications such as metronidazole and ibuprofen are also linked to VSDs.
