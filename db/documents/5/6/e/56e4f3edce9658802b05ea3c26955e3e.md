**Dyslipidemias**Primary disorders of lipid metabolism such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), chylomicronemia, familial combined hyperlipidemia, familial dysbetalipoproteinemia classify according to Fredrickson phenotype.

- Fasting triglyceride level:

- Normal: less than 150 mg/dL 
- Mild hypertriglyceridemia: 150 to 499 mg/dL
- Moderate hypertriglyceridemia: 500 to 886 mg/dL 
- Very high or severe hypertriglyceridemia: greater than 886 mg/dL

- LDL-C level:

- Optimal: less than 100 mg/ dL
- Near optimal/above optimal:100 to 129 mg/dL
- Borderline high: 130 to 159 mg/dL
- High: 160 to 189 mg/dL
- Very high: greater than 190 mg/dL

- HDL level: 

- Low: less than 40
- High: greater than or equal to 60

**Metabolic syndrome**There are five definitions of the metabolic syndrome:

- The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III), 2005

- International Diabetes Federation(IDF), 2006

- Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR), 1999

- World Health Organization, 1999

- American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), 2003;

Among these, The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) is the most widely used. Parameters for the definitions of metabolic syndrome are triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, glucose, hypertension, and obesity, and metabolic syndrome is diagnosed when three or more the followings are abnormal:

- HDL cholesterol: less than 1.0 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) (men); less than 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) (women) or pharmaceutical treatment for low HDL cholesterol, i.e., treatment with one or more of niacin or fibrates

- Triglycerides: greater than or equal to 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) or drug treatment for elevated triglycerides, i.e., treatment with one or more of niacin or fibrates

- Glucose: greater than or equal to 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) or drug treatment for elevated blood glucose

- Obesity: Waist greater than or equal to 102 cm (men) or 88 cm (women)

- Blood pressure: greater than or equal to 130/85 mmHg or drug treatment for hypertension

**Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular disease (ASCVD)**

- Coronary heart disease presents as myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, heart failure, or coronary death

- Cerebrovascular disease presents as a stroke or transient ischemic attack

- Peripheral artery disease, such as intermittent claudication

- Aortic atherosclerosis and thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysm, the diseases as mentioned earlier are often generalized as the term cardiovascular disease(CVD)

Atherosclerosis is the major culprit in most of the coronary heart disease.

Several factors are taken into account in 10-year risk cardiovascular assessment as following,

- Age (between 20 to 79)

- Sex

- Race

- Systolic blood pressure

- Diastolic blood pressure

- **Total cholesterol**
- **LDL cholesterol**
- **HDL cholesterol**

- History of diabetes

- On hypertension treatment?

- On a statin?

- On aspirin therapy?

The 10-year risk for ASCVD falls into the following categories:

- Low-risk (less than 5%)

- Borderline risk (5% to 7.4%)

- Intermediate risk (7.5% to 19.9%)

- High risk (greater than or equal to 20%)

Risk-enhancing factors such as family history of premature ASCVD, metabolic syndrome, chronic kidney disease, premature menopause, chronic inflammatory disorders, high-risk ethnic groups (e.g., South Asian), persistent elevations of LDL-C greater than or equal to 160 mg/dL or triglycerides greater than or equal to 175 mg/dL, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein greater than or equal to 2.0 mg/L, and ankle-brachial index less than 0.9.
