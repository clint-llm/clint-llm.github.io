Alcohol is one of the most commonly used substances in the world. Among patients with chronic alcohol use disorder, neuropathy is the most common harmful sequelae. It is estimated that in the United States 25% to 66% of chronic alcohol users experience some form of neuropathy; however, the true incidence in the general population is unknown. The majority of patients were middle-class, working men and continuous drinkers were more affected than episodic drinkers. Parental family history is a risk factor for developing this condition. Women are more likely to develop alcohol polyneuropathy and suffer from a more rapid onset and greater severity.
