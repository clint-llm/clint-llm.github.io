Milk thistle exhibits its hepatoprotective properties by three major mechanisms: 1) serving as an antioxidant, 2) an anti-inflammatory, and 3) an antifibrotic substance.

Milk thistle has also shown antioxidant properties on hepatocytes. It can inhibit free radicals derived from the metabolism of toxic substances such as ethanol, acetaminophen, and carbon tetrachloride. It stimulates protein synthesis by protecting cell membranes from free radical-induced damage and directly inhibiting radical formation. It can also act as a free radical scavenger and increase the intracellular content of scavengers.

In addition to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, silybin also shows promise as an antifibrotic agent, which is attributable to its ability to decrease platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) induced DNA synthesis in cells, which inhibits the transformation of stellate hepatocytes into myofibroblasts.Â By decreasing myofibroblasts, silybin indirectly prevents the deposition of collagen fibers that lead to liver injury progression.
