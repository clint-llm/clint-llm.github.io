For patients presenting with signs and symptoms of dyspnea, syncope, and/or the clinical examination reveals a systolic murmur, further evaluation with transthoracic echocardiography is necessary.Â Healthcare team members should be aware of the importance of timely referral in this disease entity. A cardiologist, a cardiovascular nurse specialist, a cardiac surgeon, a pediatric cardiologist, and a sports specialist should work together to devise activity limitations for these patients until a definite surgical correction is performed.
