The superior mesenteric artery is the second major branch of the abdominal aorta. It originates on the anterior surface of the aorta at the level of the L1 vertebrae, approximately 1 cm inferior to the celiac trunk and superior to the renal arteries. Anterior to the superior mesenteric artery lies the pylorus of the stomach, the neck of the pancreas, and the splenic vein. Posterior to the artery lies the uncinate process of the pancreas, the inferior portion of the duodenum, and the left renal vein. The left renal vein courses directly between the aorta and the takeoff of the superior mesenteric artery. This artery provides blood flow to the third portion of the duodenum, the jejunum, the ileum, the cecum, the ascending colon, and the proximal of the transverse colon.
