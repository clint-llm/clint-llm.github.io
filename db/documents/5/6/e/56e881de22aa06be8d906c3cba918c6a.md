Complications of chronic diarrhea will vary based on the specific cause.  In general, the main complication present for all patients with chronic diarrhea is malabsorption.  If the transit time is low in the intestines, the proper amount of nutrients and fluids cannot be absorbed.  The physician should look for signs of malnutrition such as anemia and unintentional weight loss. Another complication can be dehydration and acute kidney injury from dehydration.  If the gastrointestinal tract cannot absorb enough fluids, the dehydration will start to affect the renal function. Electrolyte abnormalities can also be concerning and require monitoring for replacement need.
