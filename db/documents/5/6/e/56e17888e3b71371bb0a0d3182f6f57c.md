Infections are one of the most common complications of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, both before and post-treatment, due to an abnormal functioning humoral and cell-mediated immune system. Mainly due to the immunocompromised state from both disease and treatments, patients are primarily susceptible to opportunistic infections such as herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, pneumocystis jirovecii, Aspergillus, and mycobacterial pathogens.

Hematologic complications are often seen, given the nature of the disease. Anemia is one of CLL's most common complications, mainly due to marrow infiltration from disease progression, marrow suppression from chemotherapy, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, hypersplenism, red cell aplasia, and gastrointestinal blood loss due to treatments and disease complications. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is estimated to occur in approximately 4 to 10% of CLL cases throughout the disease course.

Red cell aplasia is somewhat of a rare complication, with incidence not fully understood at this time; however, it is estimated to occur in 0.5% of CLL cases.

Gastrointestinal-related complications from CLL treatments include severe colitis and life-threatening diarrhea due to idelalisib and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) delta inhibitor. Furthermore, Idelalisib can also cause hepatotoxicity. In addition to gastrointestinal involvement, pneumonitis is another potentially fatal treatment complication of idelalisib and ibrutinib.

Secondary cancers related to CLL are largely hematologic and solid malignancies, including colon, lung, prostate, and breast.
