Cannabis consists of a large number of compounds, most of which are 60 pharmacologically active cannabinoids that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors in the body.

There are two primary types of endocannabinoid receptors: cannabinoid receptors type 1 (CB1) and cannabinoid receptors type 2 (CB2). Both receptors are classified as G-protein coupled receptors. CB1 receptors are located in the central and peripheral nervous system, specifically in the centers of the brainÂ involved in pain modulation, the nociceptive pathways of the spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.
