Significant variants that can be present within the femoral region involve angle of inclination of the femoral head and neck, the origin of the profunda femoris and its lateral circumflex branches of the femoral artery, and the locations of vessels within the femoral canal. For the angle of inclination, an average measurement for an adult male is between 115 -140 degrees, adult females tending to run more acutely in comparison.
