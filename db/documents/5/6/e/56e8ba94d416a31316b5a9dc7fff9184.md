Postoperative fever is defined as a temperature higher than 38 C (or greater than 100.4 F) on two consecutive postoperative days or higher than 39 C (or greater than 102.2 F) on any postoperative day. Knowledge of differential diagnosis, as well as a systematic approach, proves useful in narrowing down the differential diagnosis and instituting proper management. This activity reviews the causes of postoperative fever and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common etiologies of postoperative fever.
- Summarize the evaluation of a patient with postoperative fever.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for postoperative fever.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with postoperative fever.
