Ciguatera toxicity is a food-borne illness caused by eating fish contaminated with Ciguatoxin. This toxin is a potent neurotoxin, and it is produced by Dinoflagellates, such as Gambierdiscus toxicus. They adhere to algae, coral, and seaweed, where herbivorous fish eat them. Larger carnivorous fish will suffer a toxin build-up from consuming these herbivores. Ciguatera poisoning is endemic to tropical and subtropical regions, mainly in the South Pacific and Caribbean. However, it can be found anywhere fish is consumed. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of Ciguatera toxicity, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the basic pathophysiology and toxicokinetics of ciguatera toxin in the human body.
- Review the evaluation procedures for diagnosing ciguatera toxicity, including any applicable laboratory testing.
- Summarize the treatment and management strategy for ciguatera toxicity.
- Evaluate possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of ciguatera toxicity and improve outcomes.
