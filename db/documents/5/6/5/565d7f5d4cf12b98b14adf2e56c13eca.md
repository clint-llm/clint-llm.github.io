Pilonidal derives its name from Latin- pilus meaning “hair,” and nidus meaning “nest.” The name “pilonidal disease” has been attributed to R.M. Hodges in 1880. The disease was first described in 1833 by O.H. Mayo. Another early reference of the disease, with a description of management, followed shortly after by A.W. Anderson, in 1847. Many U.S. soldiers were diagnosed with pilonidal disease during the wars, and was referred to as “Jeep disease.”
