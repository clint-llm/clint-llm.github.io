The differential diagnosis for the elevated appearance of the optic nerve is broad and can group into either true disc edema or pseudopapilledema.

The differential for disc edema includes:

- Papilledema (Elevated intracranial pressure)

- Disc edema

- Inflammatory (demyelinating, granulomatous, uveitis, perineuritis, etc.)
- Ischemia/vascular (NAION, AION, CRVO, BRVO, diabetic papillitis, hypertension)
- Tumors/infiltration (meningioma, glioma, orbital masses, etc.)
- Intraocular hypotony or intracranial hypotension
- Inherited conditions (Leber hereditary optic neuropathy)

- Pseudopapilledema

- Optic disc drusen
- Hyperopic crowded nerve, myopic tilted nerve
- Bergmeister papilla
- Myelinated nerve fiber
- Vitrepapillary traction
- Peripapillary mass

It is important also to remember that a patient can have two diagnoses: the presence of ODD does not exclude true disc edema or papilledema as the two may co-exist.
