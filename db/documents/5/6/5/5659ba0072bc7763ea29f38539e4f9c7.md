**Classification of atrial fibrillation**

- Paroxysmal AF is when the episodes terminate spontaneously or with treatment within 7 days. But they may recur with an unpredictable frequency

- Persistent AF is when the AF is continuous and lasts for more than 7 days, and fails to terminate spontaneously.

- Long-standing AF is when the continuous AF lasts more than 12 months

- Permanent is when AF is accepted, and no further treatments are attempted to restore or maintain normal sinus rhythm

- Non-valvular AF occurs in the absence of rheumatic mitral valve disease, mitral valve repair, or a prosthetic heart valve.
