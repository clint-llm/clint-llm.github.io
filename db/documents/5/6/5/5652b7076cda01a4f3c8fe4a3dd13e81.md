Over the course of the past year, the utility of a multidisciplinary approach has been proven in the care of patients with COVID-19. For hospitalized patients requiring oxygen, early involvement of infectious disease consultants as well as pulmonary physicians can help direct therapy. This leads to standardization of care for patients with respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Hospitals have formulated peer review and planning committees for early incorporation of evidence as soon as new trials are published. The involvement of physicians working at the grass-root level in such committees leads to efficient incorporation of new policies and guidelines. The involvement of pharmacists in the process of patient selection and drug approval has been a tried and tested patient safety mandate. Regular education and knowledge update are key to the efficient management of patients with COVID-19.
