The disaccharide lactose found in breastmilk and most infantÂ formulas is metabolized to the monosaccharides glucose and galactose. In galactosemia, the enzymes needed for further galactose metabolism are deficient. Classic galactosemia is caused by galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT) deficiency, whereas galactokinase and UDP-galactose epimerase deficiencies may cause similar clinical consequences by disrupting the normal galactose metabolism (see figure). Ultimately, levels of galactose-1-phosphate reach toxic levels, and galactose may be alternatively reduced to its sugar alcohol form, galactitol. Galactitol is thought to cause direct damage to tissues leading to hepatomegaly, cirrhosis, renal failure, feeding intolerance, vomiting, hypoglycemia, seizure, lethargy, intellectual impairment, and cataracts. Untreated, mortality is at least 75%. Even when treated from a young age, sequelae may include cognitive or behavioral impairment, speech difficulties, low bone mineral density, ataxia or tremors, and primary ovarian insufficiency or failure in most girls.
