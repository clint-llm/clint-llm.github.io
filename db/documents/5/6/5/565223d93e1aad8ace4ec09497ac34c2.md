**Acute Cellular Reaction**

Pathology shows lymphohistiocytic infiltrates on small arterioles and venules, as well as bronchioles. Acute cellular rejection is thus graded by severity of inflammation separately in the vascular compartment (A0 to A4) and airway (B0 to B2R).

**Acute Antibody-mediated Rejection**

The distinguishing feature from acute cellular rejection is a form of acute lung injury with diffuse alveolar damage without capillaritis.

**Bronchiolitis Obliterans Syndrome (BOS)**

Histopathology demonstrates a fibrotic process obliterating the lumen of small bronchioles resulting in an irreversible, progressive obstructive disease.

**Restrictive Allograft Syndrome (RAS)**

The pathological process involves pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis involving upper lobes. Acute fibrinoid organizing pneumonia (AFOP) has also been reported in transbronchial biopsies. Bronchioles are patent, unlike BOS with peribronchial and alveolar fibrin deposits.
