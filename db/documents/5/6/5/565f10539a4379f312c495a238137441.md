Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by rigidity and stimulus triggered painful muscle spasms of predominantly axial and proximal limb muscles. It was first described in 1956 by Frederick Moersch and Henry Woltman based on a case series of 14 patients with progressive fluctuating tightness of the spinal, abdominal, and thigh muscles. This condition was formerly named stiff-man syndrome and is also known as Moersch-Woltman Syndrome.

The current clinical classification of SPS includes:

- Classic SPS

- Partial SPS variants

- Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM).

Classic SPS is the most common clinical form, present in 70Â to 80% of SPS patients. It is associated with anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies.

Several clinical variants of SPS have been described and include stiff limb syndrome, jerky SPS, cerebellar variant, SPS with epilepsy, and dystonia.

PERM, first described in 1956, is known as SPS-plus syndrome. Patients have the rigidity of axial and limb muscles, diffuse myoclonus in addition to prominent autonomic instability.

There is increasing evidence for immune-mediated etiology of this disorder. Identification of associated antibodies and common comorbidities with other autoimmune diseases and malignancies has been important for a better understanding of disease mechanisms and approaches to treatment.
