The Epley maneuver is a low-cost, safe, and relatively benign treatment option for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. It requires few resources and is a simple bedside solution to BPPV, whether in the clinic or emergency department. In a Cochrane review that compared the Epley maneuver to a control or sham maneuver, the Epley had a significant likelihood of symptom resolution (OR 4.4%, NNT=3).
