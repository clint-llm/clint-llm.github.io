After careful examination of the extremity involved, studies to confirm and determine the type of lesion are performed. These include EMG, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound.

EMG is most useful after a 2- to 3-week delay to permit denervation changes to occur in the affected muscles. In a complete neurapraxia lesion, needle EMG will show no motor unit action potentials (MUAPs) under voluntary control, but fibrillations are not present. In complete lesions (neurotmesis), the appearance of fibrillations and positive sharp waves is time and length-dependent. They do not appear for a number of days after the injury. In proximal muscles, they appear after 10 to 14 days and in distal muscles after 3 to 4 weeks. The presence of MUAPs by EMG examination indicates that reinnervation is occurring. The EMG is more sensitive than the physical examination for detecting early reinnervation, so the return of MUAPs on needle examination in the muscle closest to the injury site is typically the first evidence of reservation.

MRI has become the mainstay of imaging methods to assess peripheral nerve injury. It can display the morphologic changes of nerves and provide quantitative indexes to monitor nerve degeneration and regeneration dynamically.

Recent advancements in MRI, especially diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) derived from DTI, can provide three-dimensional maps of fiber tracts that intuitively display the orientation and density of nerve fiber bundles within the tissue, have significantly increased the utility of MRI for assessing peripheral nerve injuries, including the connective tissue element.

In acute situations, the ultrasound is most useful to differentiate between nerve axonotmesis and neurotmesis.
