Patients with an intra-abdominal abscess may present with abdominal pain, fever, anorexia, tachycardia, or prolonged ileus. The presence of a palpable mass may or may not be present. If the presentation is delayed, some individuals may appear in septic shock.

If the abscess is retroperitoneal or located deep in the pelvis, there may be no clinical signs. In such cases, the only suspicion may be a fever, mild liver dysfunction, or prolonged ileus.

In post-surgery patients, the diagnosis of an abdominal abscess is difficult because of analgesia and antibiotics, which often mask the signs of an infection.

A subphrenic abscess may present with shoulder tip pain, hiccups, or atelectasis.

Most patients with an abdominal abscess will show signs of dehydration, oliguria, tachycardia, tachypnea, and respiratory alkalosis.

The following clues imply that anaerobic infections are the leading cause of abdominal abscess formations; 1. putrid odor, 2. gas formation with the crepitus sensation in palpation and the vascular structure, including the hepatic-portal venous gas formation, 3. gram staining of the aspirate, indicating a polymicrobial flora, or anaerobes, 3. classic presentations of clostridial syndromes, including but not limited to necrotizing enteritis.
