While prevention modalities such as effective antiviral therapy, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, or natural immunity are lacking, the public health measures of rapid case identification and containment are of the utmost importance. The fact that patients during the prodromal phase of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have lower contagiousness allows the application of containment precautions once they become symptomatic to be effective in containing transmission.

Control of the disease relies on early identification of suspect cases, isolation, and strict infection control measures. SARS-CoV may also spread by the fecal-oral route as evidenced by the outbreak in the Amoy Gardens building in Hong Kong. Therefore, in addition to respiratory secretions, fecal material and urine should be considered infectious materials. SARS-CoV can remain viable on surfaces for several days.
