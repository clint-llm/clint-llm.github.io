Management is mainly **operative**for both stable and unstable SCFE.

**In situ fixation with Percutaneous Screws**

The aim is to prevent further slippage of the epiphysis. The epiphysis is fixed in situ. If a reduction is indicated, a serendipitous reduction is performed rather than a forceful one to reduce the risk of osteonecrosis.

Controversy exists about whether to use one or two screws. A single screw is sufficient; however, the advantage of two screws is being more biomechanically stable but at the expense of a higher complication rate, including articular surface violation.

The screw should be perpendicular to the physis and central in the head, both in the anteroposterior and lateral views. To achieve that, the entry point should be anterior in the proximal femur; however, care should be taken not to be medial to the intertrochanteric line to avoid impingement in flexion between the acetabulum and the screw head. Screws should be advanced until 5 mm from the subchondral bone in all views, with at least five threads engaging the epiphysis to prevent slip progression.

The procedure is performed under fluoroscopy guidance. The screw tip should not violate the articular surface in all views. Approach-withdraw technique has been performed to confirm the correct position of the screw. This is accomplished by maximally internally and externally rotating the hip under live fluoroscopy. The screw tip is viewed as approaching and then withdrawing from the subchondral bone. The point of the change is the appropriate position of the screw.

Postoperatively patients are allowed to bear weight after fixation in case of stable slips and partially weight-bearing for six weeks in unstable slips.

**Capsulotomy**has been shown to reduce intracapsular pressure in unstable SCFE. However, there is no clear evidence that it reduces the avascular necrosis rate.

Prophylactic fixation of the contralateral hip is another controversial modality. It is indicated when there are high-risk factors for a contralateral slip. Such as; obesity, male gender, initial slip in a younger than ten years old, endocrine disorders

**Open Reduction and Internal Fixation of the Slipped Epiphysis (Modified Dunn Procedure)**

The aim is to correct the deformity of the proximal femur and stabilize the epiphysis, meanwhile protecting the femoral head blood supply.

The procedure involves the surgical dislocation of the hip through the Gibson approach. The patient is positioned in lateral decubitus. The incision is straight lateral over the greater trochanter. The approach utilizes the plane between the gluteus maximus and medius. A trochanteric flip osteotomy is performed—Z-shaped anterior capsulotomy to expose the metaphysic. The slipped epiphysis is initially primarily stabilized by k wire prior to dislocation; then, the hip is dislocated using a hook around the femoral neck for traction. Once the hip is dislocated, an incision of the periosteum is performed over the anterior neck and proximal femur to the lesser trochanter. Periosteal flaps are developed bluntly anteriorly and posteriorly. The epiphysis is freed completely from the metaphysis using a chisel; then, the metaphysis is debrided. The epiphysis is reduced and fixed to the metaphysis using two or three K wires, both antegrade and retrograde. Postoperatively, patients are instructed to only partially weight bear for six weeks.

This is another controversial management modality indicated in unstable and severe slips. It is performed through a modified Dunn procedure which is capital realignment.

After initial management, patients may develop consequences that can be symptomatic, and these can also be addressed by operative management such as; femoroacetabular impingement as a result of a cam lesion from a metaphyseal bump or cases of SCFE deformity with a slip angle < 30 degrees. Both can be managed by ostochondroplasty.

However, cases of severe SCFE deformity with slip > 30-45 degrees which is painful or limiting function in the absence of hip osteoarthritis or osteonecrosis, can be managed by proximal femoral osteotomy. Several proximal femoral osteotomies have been described in the literature, with the most commonly used one being intertrochanteric (Imhauser) osteotomy. The greatest deformity correction is achievable by femoral neck cuneiform osteotomy. Also, subtrochanteric (Southwick) osteotomy has been described.

**Osteochondroplasty**is indicated in mild and moderate chronic SCFE deformity cases where a prominent metaphyseal bump results in pain and a restricted range of motion. Osteochondroplasty can be performed arthroscopically with a burr or through a limited anterior arthrotomy via a modified smith-Peterson approach.
