The timing of the onset of symptoms related to the injection or application of large doses of lidocaine will most likely make the diagnosis. However, coincidental seizures due to a seizure disorder or panic attacks with hyperventilation may confound the diagnosis.

For direct local toxicity symptoms after lidocaine injection such as radicular pain, first exclude other causes, such as hematoma, that may compress structures in the spinal canal and require urgent surgical decompression. The timing of an epidural abscess in relation to a central neuraxial block would make that diagnosis unlikely. Most epidural abscesses, however, are spontaneous and could potentially coincide with the injection.
