Bowel necrosis is a surgical emergency. Initial treatment requires early recognition with aggressive fluid resuscitation, pressor support, broad-spectrum antibiotics such as vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, and pain control. If the patient is profoundly septic and altered, they may not be able toÂ protect their airway and will need intubation. Treatment algorithms recommend emergency exploratory laparotomy in all patients who remain hemodynamically unstable despite aggressive resuscitation. In those who stabilize, advanced imaging with CT angiography is recommended to tailor the surgical intervention.

If imaging reveals acute arterial embolism, without evidence of peritonitis, perforation, or necrosis, angiography with embolectomy or systemic or catheter-directed thrombolysis may be indicated. Mesenteric arterial thrombosis may be amenable to surgical revascularization, angioplasty, or stenting depending on severity, time course, and comorbidities. If CT imaging or angiography reveals venous thrombosis, anticoagulation may be the only intervention required. In any patient who remains hemodynamically unstable, septic, or with radiographic evidence of perforation, free air, or necrosis, exploratory laparotomy with excision of non-viable tissue is recommended.

If nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia is suspected, initial resuscitation is still recommended but with a focus on underlying factors such as heart failure, arrhythmias, vasoconstrictive medications, or dialysis. If the patient improves, admission for optimization is indicated. If they continue to complain of abdominal pain without peritonitis, contrasted CT imaging is recommended for perforation, free air, or signs of necrosis. In cases of stenotic or spasming arteries, catheter-directed vasodilators are indicated. If the patient continues to exhibit peritoneal signs or remains hemodynamically unstable, exploratory laparotomy without imaging is recommended. Many patients with non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia will require a second look either via laparotomy or angiography despite initial approach therapy.
