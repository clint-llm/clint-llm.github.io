The majority of complications of central lines are immediate complications that result from the insertion procedure like pneumothorax, vascular perforation, and venous air embolism.

- The main delayed complications are those of CVC-associated infection, and it is these which are focused upon in this article. This complication is a relatively frequent event, affecting around 5% of patients with an inpatient stay in the United States. Although this rate is falling, it is a severe event with mortality of between 12 and 25%.

- CVCs can also be complicated by line dysfunction, where the CVC fails to function either due to increased resistance or blockage. This can be due to site, patient positioning, and formation of fibrin sheaths within the lumen and blocking the distal ports.

- Rarer complications include; fracture, where high pressures cause the CVC lumen to fracture, causing trauma to the vessel, central venous thrombosis, and stenosis associated with the CVC Site or portions of the catheter promoting coagulation and endovascular fibrous growth.
