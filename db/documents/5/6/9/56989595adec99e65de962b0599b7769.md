The first complication of concern is neurovascular damage, either iatrogenic, during surgery, or directly from the patientâ€™s injury. Depending on the extent of the damage would then indicate if any further intervention was required.

With any operation, infection is a risk; this is particularly relevant with foreign material and a penetrating injury. Although copious lavage is used, an infection can still occur. This may be treated with a course of antibiotics; however, it may also require further debridement in theatre.

Unfortunately, some foreign bodies are extremely small and can be very difficult to find on exploration, even if using loupes; thus, one final complication is a failure to remove foreign bodies. Sometimes the decision needs to be made to stop exploration for the objects if it is going to be more damaging. This can usually be done safely with ongoing observation and treated expectantly.

With all these complications, the patient should have been counseled at the time of injury or before surgery so that adequate consent is obtainable.
