The administration of the drug is via IV infusion with a loading dose lasting over 2 hours, weekly maintenance dose over 1 hour. Do not administer as an IV push or bolus. Do not shake or dilute. Administer via infusion pump or syringe pump. Following the infusion, an observation period of 1 hour is recommended; a longer observation time following an infusion reaction may be necessary. Premedication with an antihistamine alone is acceptable, although the addition of a glucocorticoid (with or without an H2 receptor antagonist) is reasonable for those living in high-incidence areas. Dosing prescribed as initial loading dose 400 mg/m^2 infused over 120 minutes and a maintenance dose of 250 mg/m^2 infused over 60 minutes for colorectal cancer, metastatic, KRAS wild-type (without mutation), and head and neck cancer (squamous cell).
