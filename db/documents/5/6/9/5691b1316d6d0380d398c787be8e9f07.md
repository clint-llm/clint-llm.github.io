All age groups can be affected by PH, and present estimates suggest a prevalence of approximately 1% in the global population, with left heart disease (LHD) being the leading cause, followed by lung disease especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

At least 50% of patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction either have IpcPH or CpcPH.****The prevalence of PH increases with disease severity in these patients, with 60 to 70% of patients with severe and symptomatic mitral valve disease and 50% with symptomatic aortic stenosis affected by PH.****Mild PH is common in patients with advanced COPD and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Only 1-5% of patients with advanced COPD were found to have severe PH. In patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, the prevalence increases with increasing severity and is as high as 60% in patients with end-stage disease.****

Data from registries indicate the incidence and prevalence of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) to be 2-6 and 26-39 cases per million adults, respectively.****In patients with sarcoidosis, PH can be common and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity.
