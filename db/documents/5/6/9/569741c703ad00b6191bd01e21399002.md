SLE is a heterogeneous condition composed of many responsible biochemical pathways and a wide array of phenotypes. An interprofessional healthcare team approach to treating SLE that includes clinicians (including mid-level practitioners), specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists is necessary.

Overall, anifrolumab is a novel IFNAR1 antagonist that can assist in achieving clinical remission or low disease activity in patients with SLE. If approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration, anifrolumab should only be used as adjunctive therapy to standard immunosuppressants in adults aged 18 to 70 with SLE. Future clinical trials exploring the use of anifrolumab in lupus nephritis and neuropsychiatric SLE are needed to expand clinical indication. Before using anifrolumab, healthcare providers should conduct a thorough history and physical to assess baseline clinical status. Patients should be vigilant in monitoring for signs of infections, particularly herpes zoster.
