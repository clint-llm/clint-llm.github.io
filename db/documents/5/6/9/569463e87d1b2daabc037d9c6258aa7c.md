Bell's palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion; more serious causes of facial palsy will need to be ruled out. The more serious causes are listed in the etiology section of this article. It is important to consider whether the lesion location is lower or upper motor neuron. Bilateral cortical innervation of the upper facial muscles will result in complete facial paralysis for lower motor neuron lesions in most cases. Therefore asking the patient to raise their eyebrows is very useful in assessing the functions of frontalis and orbicularis oculi. Lower motor neuron lesions include Bell's palsy and Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Upper motor neuron lesions causing facial nerve paralysis include cerebral ischaemic event, multiple sclerosis, intracranial hemorrhage, or neoplasia. An atypical presentation, recurrent or progressive symptoms, additional neurological findings, lack of spontaneous resolution, and/or history of head, neck, or cutaneous malignancy are risk factors necessitating further workup.
