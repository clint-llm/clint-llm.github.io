The clinical differential diagnosis of MAC includes morpheaform basal cell carcinoma, desmoplastic trichoepithelioma, metastatic adenocarcinoma, and syringoma.

**Morpheaform Basal Cell Carcinoma**

- Thin strands and nests of basaloid cells extending into the dermis

- Limited peripheral palisading

- Stroma is dense and sclerotic

- Perineural invasion can be seen

**Syringoma**histologic

- The superficial proliferation of cells with pale pink cytoplasm forming nests and tubules of uniform size embedded in a sclerotic stroma

- The nests of syringoma vary in size and shape and may assume a comma or tadpole shape

- Tubular areas show ductal differentiation with central lumina lined by the eosinophilic cuticle

- Horn cysts and milia can be noted

- Lacks deep infiltration and pleomorphism

- They can be difficult to distinguish from sclerosing BCC, desmoplastic trichoepithelioma, MAC on superficial biopsies, and metastatic carcinomas

**Metastatic Adenocarcinoma**

- Islands, clusters, or single files of large pleomorphic, atypical cells with or without ductal differentiation

- Pleomorphism and atypia are apparent on higher power

- Mitotic figures can be present

**Desmoplastic Trichoepithelioma**

- Histology on low power shows a dome-shaped papule with an infiltrative dermal basaloid proliferation, small tumor nests, cords, and fibrotic stroma

- Sweat ducts are not a part of the proliferation

- It tends not to invade the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue
