Implicit with the diagnosis of substance-induced mood disorder is the implication that the disorder should resolve spontaneously, following the cessation of the inciting irritant. However, the severity of a substance-induced affective episode may necessitate the application of medication. Clinical judgment, corroborated with a proper history and collateral information, will aid the clinician's decision whether to simply offer supportive care while observing the patient in a safe environment during the withdrawal period or to treat the active affective disorder. Because of the relative safety of most antidepressants, some studies suggest the empiric application of antidepressants in the setting of depressive symptomatology and co-occurring substance use.

The most essential feature of treatment should be the emphasis on abstinence from the inciting substance. The treatment modality will vary depending on the substance of preference of the patient.
