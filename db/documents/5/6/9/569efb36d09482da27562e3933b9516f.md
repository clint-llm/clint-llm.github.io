Consideration must be given to the event that led to the suspected injury. Dysrhythmias, cardiac ischemia, ischemic strokes, seizures, electrolyte abnormalities (most notably hypoglycemia), and toxic ingestions can cause a fall with CHI and mimic the altered mental status seen in CHI. Maintain high concern for concurrent orbital, maxillofacial, and skull trauma.
