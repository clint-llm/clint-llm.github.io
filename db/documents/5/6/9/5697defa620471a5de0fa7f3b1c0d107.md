Simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) may not be appropriate for some systemic causes of LSCD because stem cell harvesting may induce LSCD. History of trauma, infection, or surgery in the donor's eye may also predispose to inducing LSCD after harvesting. Contact lens wear has been known to induce LSCD, but contact lens-induced LSCD cases are usually not as severe as other causes. However, SLET could potentially cause symptomatic LSCD in the donor eyes of patients who wear contact lenses.

Absolute contraindications for SLET include any of the following in the recipient's eye:

- Dry ocular surface, e.g., keratinization of corneal or conjunctival epithelium or a positive Schirmer's defined as <10 mm with anesthesia)

- Blindness with no potential for vision restoration

- The disorganized anterior segment, e.g., extensive peripheral anterior synechiae, anterior staphyloma, or adherent leukoma

- Untreated adnexal pathology, e.g., lagophthalmos, dacryocystitis, trichiasis, entropion.
