Over the last 30 years, many studies have attempted to determine the prevalence of Tourette syndrome. The large variation in methodology has led to a reported prevalence between 3:1000 and 8:1000 children. Males are more commonly affected than females with a ratio of 3:1 to 4:1. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States reports that GTS is twice as common in Caucasian children as compared to Hispanic or African-American children, but at this time it is not clear whether differences in access to care bias this figure.
