Lab studies should be normal, but with severe disease, BNP may be elevated.  Genetic testing is available and diagnostic but is reserved for patients with significant family histories or those who exhibit clear symptoms. The American Heart Association is currently opposed to routine screening for genetic markers.

A chest x-ray may be normal but left ventricular hypertrophy may be seen.

EKG may show LVH.  It may also show arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation or non-sustained v-tach.  EKG can frequently be normal.

2D-echocardiography is the primary imaging modality to make the diagnosis of HCM. The echo has an 80% diagnostic accuracy for HOCM. There can be direct visualization and relatively accurate measurements of the septum and left ventricular wall sizes.  It will be able to show increased flow velocity along the left ventricular outflow tract. Color flow Doppler can show mitral valve regurgitation.  Reduced LV compliance can be seen in diastolic dysfunction. The key features of HOCM include the asymmetric septal wall thickness (more than 15 mm) and systolic anterior motion of the anterior mitral valve leaflet. The posterior septal wall is usually much thicker than the anterior septal wall. The narrowing of the LVOT is often obvious.

Cardiac MRI is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of LV wall properties and should be performed in patients suspected of having HOCM with a normal or inconclusive echocardiogram.

Cardiac catheterization is not required for diagnosis but may be performed to determine accurately the degree of outflow tract obstruction, LV anatomy, the degree of mitral valve regurgitation, and the patency of the coronary arteries.

Radionuclide imaging may reveal reversible defects in the absence of coronary artery disease.
