The differential diagnosis includes other sources of infectious bacterial diarrhea such as Salmonella, Shigella, Escherichia coli, Listeria, and Clostridium difficile. Viral gastroenteritis such as norovirus may also present similarly.Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Entamoeba histolytica may cause prolonged diarrhea in travelers and immunocompromised patients mimicking Campylobacter.

The abdominal pain from Campylobacter may mimic appendicitis and require advanced imaging such as ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI to differentiate. Inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, may also present with abdominal pain and bloody stools. Stool culture, diagnostic imaging, biopsy, and colonoscopy diagnose these chronic conditions.
