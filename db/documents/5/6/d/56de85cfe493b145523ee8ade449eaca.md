Interprofessional cooperation and education can positively benefit patients and improve outcomes. The more members of the healthcare team asking about e-cigarette use and educating patients, the better. Most interventions will occur in the primary care setting where physicians, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists will discuss smoking cessation with patients. Each team member needs to be educated regarding the risks and benefits of electronic nicotine delivery devices. When questioning patients about their social history, it will be necessary for all team members to ask specifically about e-cigarette use as patients may not consider e-cigarettes to be harmful or in the same category as traditional cigarette smoking and thus may not disclose their use. Due to the rising popularity of these devices in the pediatric population, it is crucial to ask and educate about e-cigarettes during well-child exams. Some adolescences who would not have smoked may try e-cigarettes, which correlate with higher levels of smoking later in life. Interventions with adolescents aimed at smoking have demonstrated effectiveness in decreasing rates of e-cigarette users who later convert to traditional smoking.

Only through a concerted effort by clinicians at all levels can the morbidity associated with smoking decrease. Patients require ongoing education that smoking is harmful to health, and a coordinated effort from all members of the interprofessional team can contribute to that goal. [Level 5]
