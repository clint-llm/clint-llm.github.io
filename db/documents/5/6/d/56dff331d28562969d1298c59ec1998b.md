As with any surgical procedure, pain, bleeding, damage to surrounding anatomic structures, and infection are a risk, albeit low compared to many surgeries in the hands of a skilled arthroscopist. Outside of the general complications associated with any surgical procedure, graft failure is of the greatest concern. While patients who undergo osteochondral allograft transplantation for traumatic or idiopathic injuries have a reported graft survival of 100%, cartilaginous defects caused by post-traumatic arthritis, osteonecrosis, or osteochondrosis have a lower rate of graft survival.
