**Presentation**

Patients with PMT can present with different symptoms related to the rate of the tachycardia or to the hemodynamic consequences of it.

Symptoms may include palpitations, chest pain, dizziness, syncope, or even worsening of heart failure symptoms. In many cases, however, patients are asymptomatic.

**Physical Examination**

The examination may be normal and only show tachycardia. In cases where the arrhythmia persists for prolonged times, hypotension or signs of heart failure may be evident.
