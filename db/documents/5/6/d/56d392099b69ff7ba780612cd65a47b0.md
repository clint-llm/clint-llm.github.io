The submandibular triangle is an important anatomic landmark located underneath the body of the mandible. The majority of the anatomic space bounded by the submandibular triangle consists of the submandibular gland. The submandibular gland is the second largest salivary gland in the body (the parotid gland is the largest). In addition to housing the submandibular gland, a vast array of nerves, arteries, veins, and lymphatics course within the boundaries of the submandibular triangle. The complexity of the anatomy within the submandibular triangle makes for important clinical implications when performing surgery in this region. This article will focus on the anatomy contained within the borders of the submandibular triangle as well as the clinical significance and implications of surgery in this area.
