Any patient presenting with MGS should receive an interprofessional team evaluation by an ophthalmologist, a neurologist, and a physician. A review by a vitreoretina specialist and neuro-ophthalmologist may be necessary. The patient most often presents to the primary clinician with ocular problems, and these professionals should be aware of the condition. Systemic anomalies like moyamoya disease or encephalocele can be associated with MGS; therefore, prompt referral to a neurologist is necessary. These patients can then be followed by their primary clinicians.

Compliance with treatment should be ensured. The nursing staff is the first in the department to come in contact with patients on follow-up. They can evaluate compliance with medication and lifestyle measures and report any issues to the primary care clinician. This collaborative and interprofessional approach to care can ensure optimal patient outcomes.
