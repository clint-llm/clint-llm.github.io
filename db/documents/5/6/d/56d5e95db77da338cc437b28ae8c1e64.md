In terms of addictions, the differential should include ruling out the root causes of the addiction. Potential root causes are as follows:

Bipolar disorder – more than half of patients with substance abuse disorder have bipolar disorder, and significant mood fluctuations can present in the patient.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) – common concurrence amongst alcohol abusers, PTSD should be screened for in all addicts. While the two are separate conditions with separate signs and symptoms, treating the root of PTSD can mitigate or eliminate the overlying addiction.

Since most cases of intoxication involve episodes of altered mental status, a helpful mnemonic for the emergency room physician is the following:

- A - alcohol

- E – encephalopathy (hypertensive, hepatic), electrolytes, endocrine, environmental

- I – insulin (hypoglycemia, HHNK, DKA)

- O – opiates, oxygen

- U – uremia

- T – trauma, toxins

- I – infection, increase ICP

- P – psychosis, poisoning, porphyria

- S – stroke, shock, seizure
