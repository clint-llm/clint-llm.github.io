The management of onychomycosis is interprofessional. While the fungal infection is not life-threatening, it has enormous morbidity. The key is patient education. The public should be educated about appropriate footwear when visiting community swimming pools, saunas, and health clubs. If the patient works in a wet environment like washing dishes, then they should be encouraged to wear gloves. The pharmacist should inform the patient that treatment is often required for a minimum of 12 months, and some patients may require prophylactic treatment to prevent recurrence. They should also monitor compliance, and educate patients about use and side effects. Dermatology and foot and nail care nurses are involved in screening, arranging follow up, and documenting progress and compliance for the team. For those who want a faster option, the patient should be referred to a dermatologist or a  surgeon for complete nail removal.

**Outcomes**

For patients who delay seeking care, nail deformity usually progresses and may lead to disfigurement and pain. Even though antifungal drugs are available, the treatment is often for months or years before one sees an obvious improvement. Several studies have shown that terbinafine is more effective than other antifungals. However, individuals who have yellow streaks along the lateral nail border tend to have poor responses to treatment. Overall, fungal infections of the toenails have a much poorer outcome compared to fingernail infections. Finally, despite treatment, there is a high rate of recurrence ranging from 5%-50%.
