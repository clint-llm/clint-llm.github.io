The presentation of patients with NF-1 is highly variable. Because the disorder affects many organs, it is best managed by an interprofessional team, including clinicians (including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) and specialty-trained nurses. Primary care physicians, geneticists, pediatric neurologists, ophthalmologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists (physical, occupational, and speech) work collectively as an interprofessional team toward health promotion and maintenance. All interprofessional team members must maintain open communication with the rest of the team so that care can be administered in a coordinated and cohesive fashion, leading to optimal patient outcomes.

A multidisciplinary approach is the cornerstone of management.
