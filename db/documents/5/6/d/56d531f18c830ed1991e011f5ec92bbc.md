Autoimmune pancreatitis can present with a diagnostic challenge because of nonspecific presentation with symptoms of abdominal pain and frequent episodes similar to acute pancreatitis. Patients can present to their primary care providers or in an emergency setting with these complaints. Diagnostic workup involvesÂ an interprofessional approach including gastroenterologists for possible endoscopic intervention, radiologists for imaging as well as rheumatologists for evaluation of other associated autoimmune conditions. The role of nursing is also vital as a member of the interprofessional group with monitoring vital signs and education of patients and their family members.

With a thorough evaluation and after ruling out differential diagnoses such as pancreatic malignancy, patients need continuous follow-up with their providers to assess response to immunosuppressant therapy. Care coordination in both inpatient and outpatient settings remains critical to enhance healthcare outcomes of the condition and to reduce associated morbidity and improve patient quality of life.
