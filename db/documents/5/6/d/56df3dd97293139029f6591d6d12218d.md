It is believed that rat bite fever is underdiagnosed and under-treated, chiefly because of the failure to consider the infection in the differential diagnosis. Untreated, the infection carries a mortality of more than 10%, and hence, health care providers should be aware of this illness to diagnose it and treat it earlier. People who are exposed to rodents must be cautioned about this illness and to take preventive measures from being bitten by them.
