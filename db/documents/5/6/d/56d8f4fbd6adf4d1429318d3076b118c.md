Cryoanalgesia can be utilized for numerous persistent and intractable painful conditions, particularly when mediated by a peripheral nerve that can be confidently identified as the causative location. Common targets include:

- iliohypogastric nerves

- ilioinguinal nerves (laparotomy, nerve entrapment, post-therapeutic herniorrhaphy pain)

- intercostal nerves (neuralgia mastectomy and thoracotomy pain, rib fractures)

- pudendal nerves (perianal, rectal pain)

- lateral femoral cutaneous nerves (meralgia paresthetica)

- sacral nerve roots S4-5 (coccydynia)

Cryoanalgesia has also been shown to be beneficial for managing temporomandibular joint pain, paroxysmal trigeminal neuralgia, phantom limb pain, neuroma, and idiopathic neuralgia pain.

There are multiple acute pain indications for cryoanalgesia, including intra-operative cryoneurolysis of ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric nerves for postherniorrhaphy pain

However, the use of cryoneurolysis for thoracotomy pain has fallen out of favor based on increased neuropathic pain at eight weeks postoperatively, though no difference was noted at six months.

Additionally, topical cryoanalgesia has been used in the treatment of painful cutaneous processes from intravenous access, joint aspiration, and neuropathic pain due to herpes zoster.
