This condition occurs when redundant and loose mesentery twist around an axis. In terms of a cecal volvulus, the terminal ileum and right colon are involved. When a volvulus involves the cecum alone, it is also called a cecal bascule. This occurs when a highly mobile cecum traverses from a caudad to cephalad direction.
