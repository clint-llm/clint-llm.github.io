Numerous potential complicating diagnoses can result from chest trauma, and some require more emergent interventions than others. As addressed earlier, issues that arise while conducting the “ABC” evaluation require an immediate response in real-time before continuing with the remaining assessments. Some pathologies indicate a “load and go” approach, in which case the focus should be rapid non-invasive intervention and timely transport to a definitive health care facility.

**Tension Pneumothorax**is the progressive accumulation of air within the thoracic cavity, creating positive pressure within the pleural space. This pressure exerts itself on the mediastinal and intrathoracic structures. The creation of a one-way valve allows air to enter the thoracic cavity, but not to exit. An increase in the volume of air leads to increased thoracic pressure, causing the ipsilateral lung to collapse and the contralateral lung to be compressed. The mediastinum shifts away from the lung so affected and venous return to the heart decreases. If not corrected, this can progress to obstructive shock and ultimately may lead to death.

Signs and symptoms that might suggest tension pneumothorax include hypoxia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, tracheal deviation away from the injured side; reduced breath sounds on the injured side, hyper-resonance, hyper-expansion, and reduced thoracic wall movements.

Following the diagnosis, management by the EMS provider engages in needle decompression of the tension pneumothorax. Insertion of a 14-gauge needle, typically in the second intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line of the affected side, provides an escape route for the build-up of air and pressure. Although the success rate for this procedure varies, as the cannula can become obstructed by blood or tissue. It may become lodged within the muscle, and serve as a temporizing measure in an otherwise crashing patient; this can provide a stop-gap measure before more definitive management employing the insertion of an intercostal catheter (i.e., pigtail catheter, chest tube thoracostomy) can be performed in the hospital.

**Open Pneumothorax**presents similar to and often precludes tension pneumothorax. It involves an open chest wound that communicates with the pleural space. Air rushes in through this “sucking” chest wound during inspiration but greatly limits the amount of air that can escape on expiration. Signs and symptoms are like that of a simple or tension pneumothorax. Interventions must take place to prevent rapid progression to more severe pathology. EMS providers can apply an occlusive dressing, consisting of a non-permeable cover that is sealed tightly on three out of four sides, which reduces air entry during inspiration and allows for more air to escape during expiration. Again, this is a temporary measure that buys the patient time until definitive hospital management becomes available.

**Flail Chest**occurs when adjacent ribs have two or more fractures, creating a portion of the rib cage that detaches from the rest of the chest wall. This detached segment depresses inward on inspiration (due to negative intrathoracic pressure) and is pushed outward on expiration (due to positive intrathoracic pressure).  This process is termed “paradoxical breathing,” since it is the opposite of normal chest wall motion. Blunt forces that are strong enough to cause multiple rib fractures often cause an underlying pulmonary contusion as well. But it typically does not manifest immediately and may only be detected subsequently, by radiographic studies. In the field, EMS providers can stabilize the "flail segment" by applying manual pressure to prevent hypoventilation on route to the hospital.

**Other diagnoses**that result from chest trauma can range from completely simple and benign to truly emergent and life-threatening conditions. EMS protocols have not yet developed specific temporary protocols for addressing some of the more severe pathologies (eg., pericardial tamponade, massive hemothorax, aortic rupture, diaphragmatic tear, esophageal injury). Hence, it is sufficient for EMS providers to stabilize the patient’s “ABCs” and then “load and go.”
