FED is not preventable, and in many cases, the cause is unknown. Patients should return for follow-up appointments to monitor disease progression with routine eye exams. Clinicians should work with their patients to determine when is the appropriate time for medical and surgical intervention. In early stages with corneal decompensation, medical treatment may suffice. Hypertonic saline drops may be used in the mornings to dehydrate the cornea. Some patients find that gently blowing warm air over their corneas with a hairdryer in the mornings is useful to reduce blurry vision. Patients should understand that their disease is progressive, and FED will eventually require surgical intervention.
