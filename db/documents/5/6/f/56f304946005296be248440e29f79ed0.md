The branching of the mental nerve may vary slightly. After exiting the mental foramen, it usually splits into three branches, but there may be more or fewer divisions in some individuals.Â More than one mental foramen may occur in around 1% of patients as a result of the mandibular canal bifurcation in the inferior-superior plane or medial-lateral plane

Some individuals present an anatomical variation known as the anterior loop of the mental nerve. Some authors describe it as the extension of the inferior alveolar nerve before leaving the canal, anterior to the mental nerve; others define it as the mental neurovascular bundle that loops back to leave the mental foramen
