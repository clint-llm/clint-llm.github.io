**Malignant Pleural Effusions**

An intrapleural catheter (IPC) is the treatment of choice for MPEs associated with respiratory failure. Lung cancer is the most common cause of MPEs, followed by breast cancer and lymphoma.

**Non Malignant Pleural Effusions**

There is growing literature supporting IPC for chronic non-malignant effusions associated with respiratory failure or dyspnea affecting the quality of life. The most common reason is CHF, followed by hepatic-hydrothorax. There have been few reported cases of chylothorax, of unknown or uncorrectable etiology, successfully treated with IPC.

**Post-Lung Transplantation and Chronic Pleural Infection**

There is someÂ success reported with IPCs in treating post-lung transplant chronic effusions and pleural infections. However, there is no current recommendation to use IPC for these patients. It should include the therapy of last resort.
