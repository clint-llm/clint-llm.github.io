A sinus of valsalva aneurysm (SOVA) is an abnormal dilatation of the aortic root located between the aortic valve annulus and the sinotubular junction. It occurs as a consequence of weakness of the elastic lamina at the junction of the aortic media and the annulus fibrosis. The function of the normal sinuses is to prevent occlusion of the coronary artery ostia during systole when the aortic valve opens. The normal sinus diameter is less than 4.0 cm for men and 3.6 cm for women. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysms can be either congenital or acquired. They are usually isolated, though rare case reports describe aneurysms involving two to three sinuses. Sinus of valsalva aneurysm rupture is a potentially fatal complication and should prompt an urgent referral to a cardiothoracic surgeon for consideration of repair. This activity describes the risk factors, evaluation, and management of sinus of valsalva aneurysms and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care delivery for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of sinus of valsalva aneurysms.
- Explain the presentation of sinus of valsalva aneurysms.
- Identify the treatment and management options for sinus of valsalva aneurysms.
- Explain a well-coordinated interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to patients affected by sinus of valsalva aneurysms.
