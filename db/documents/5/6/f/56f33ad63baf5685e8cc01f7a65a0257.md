The sternum is considered a highly vascular structure, receiving most of its arterial supply through perforating and sternal arterial branches located around the intercostal spaces.

The venous drainage of the xiphoid process follows a similar pattern and is collected back through the internal thoracic veins, which empty directly into the right and left brachiocephalic veins.
