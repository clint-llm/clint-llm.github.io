Attempts to explain the etiology of sex cord-stromal tumors resulted in two theories. The first one suggests the origin of these neoplasms from the genital ridge mesenchyme. The second theory suggests that these tumors originate from precursors within the mesonephric and coelomic epithelium. However, the exact pathophysiology has not been elucidated so far. Recent molecular genetic studies propose that these tumors have a somatic missense point mutation (C402G) in the FOXL2 gene, which was seen in 97% of adult GCT, 10 percent of juvenile GCT, and 21 percent of thecomas.

The high frequency of this mutation suggests that it may be specifically diagnostic for Adult GCT [with the only exception of well- or moderately differentiated Sertoli Leydig cell tumors of the ovary], and the absence of this mutation in juvenile GCT may be because it is an entirely different tumor. Alterations in various signal transduction pathways have also been found to be crucial in the pathogenesis of GCTs. Some of the major pathway alterations [which can be targeted in precision oncology] are:

- Adenyl cyclase/cAMP/protein kinase-A (PKA) pathway

- MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase- PI3K/AKT pathway

- Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors

- Estrogen receptors

- Nuclear factor-kB (NFkB)

- TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; CD253)
