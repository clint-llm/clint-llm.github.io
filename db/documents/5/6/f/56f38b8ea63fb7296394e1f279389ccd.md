The complication that is caused by any laryngeal stents include:

- Formation of granulation tissue

- Scar tissue formation

- Broken stent

- Stent associated infection

- Stent migration

- Dysphagia and aspiration

The complications from tracheal stents are unusual, but stent migration occurs in about 31% of cases in a study by Russ et al. after a 10-month follow-up. Metallic stent fracture, erosion of stent leading to massive hemoptysis can occur. The incidence of granulation tissue is noted to be 15Â to 20%. Metallic stents sometimes get incorporated into the mucosa and can be very difficult to remove.
