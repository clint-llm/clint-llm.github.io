Thallium-201 is an isotope of the element thallium, which has been accepted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a radiopharmaceutical in nuclear medicine scans.

**FDA Approved Indications**

Myocardial imaging: One of its principal uses is in myocardial imaging. It can help to differentiate between ischemic and infarcted myocardium by comparing the scans at rest and stress (exercise or pharmacological stress). Ischemic myocardium shows decreased uptake only at stress, whereas infarcted/scarred myocardium shows fixed defects present at rest as well as stress.

- Diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic coronary artery disease.

- Screening of non-specific results on the exercise EKG test.

- Determination of risk before non-cardiac surgery.

- Determination of risk after an event of myocardial infarction.

- Determination of risk before and after revascularization procedures.

In addition to evaluating myocardial perfusion, thallium-201 has an additional advantage over other nuclear scans in its property of redistribution, so it can also assess the viability of the myocardium, thus separating ischemic myocardium from scar tissue.

Parathyroid imaging: Thallium-201 has been used in parathyroid imaging in patients with hyperplasias and adenomas.

**Non-FDA Approved Indications**

Primary CNS lymphoma (PCNSL): Thallium-201 is useful in distinguishing toxoplasmosis from PCNSL in HIV patients. In current practice, HIV patients with intracranial masses are treated empirically for toxoplasmosis; this increases mortality and morbidity due to delay in diagnosis and treatment. Thallium-201 is collected in tumor cells but not normal or dead cells; thus, it helps diagnose PCNSL. There has been a proposal that the thallium-201 SPECT (single-photon emission computerized tomography) scan in conjunction with cerebrospinal fluid PCR for EBV (Epstein-Barr virus) be used to diagnose PCNSL to initiate empiric radiotherapy.

Pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma: Thallium-201 scintigraphy is useful to diagnose the Kaposi sarcoma of the lungs without mucocutaneous involvement, which is a challenging diagnosis. A positive thallium-201 scan is used in conjunction with a negative gallium scan to make the diagnosis.

Neoplasms: Thallium-201 is also very useful in diagnosing various tumors of the body, including pulmonary, thyroid, lymphomas, and breast.  Other uses include estimating the response of solid tumors like osteosarcoma to chemotherapy.

Olfacto-scintigraphy: Thallium-201 administered via nasal route can be additionally used to image and assess the integrity of the olfactory pathway, which can be useful in patients with reduced olfaction or following head trauma.

Thyroid imaging: In some studies of patients with toxic goiter, thallium-201 proved to be a useful diagnostic tool to view the normal surrounding thyroid cells, which was not possible with other imaging modalities like Tc-99m and I-123.
