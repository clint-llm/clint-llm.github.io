Information provided to patients about the disease and course of treatment should be understandable. Well-educated patients who want in-depth knowledge are provided with more sophisticated and detailed notes about the procedure. Every patient has the right to know about their disease. This helps to decrease the communication gap between clinicians and patients. Patient education also assists the patients in clearing their doubts and motivates them to tackle their problems. In this way, patients become optimistic and compliant with routine therapy and cooperate with clinicians. So, health education has always been a high priority. Briefing about the disease, signs and symptoms, treatment options, side effects, and complications enables the patients to make appropriate decisions and present early in the clinic. Preventive measures, diagnostic tests, and consent before invasive interventions come under patient education.
