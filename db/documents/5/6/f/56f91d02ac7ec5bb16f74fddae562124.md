The resultant pathology of increased extravascular fluid content in the lung remains common to all forms of pulmonary edema. However, the underlying mechanism leading to the edema arises from the disruption of various complex physiologic processes, maintaining a delicate balance of filtration of fluid and solute across the pulmonary capillary membrane. This imbalance can be from one or more of the following factors:

- Increase in intravascular hydrostatic pressure transmitted in a retrograde fashion to the pulmonary microvasculature

- Increase in interstitial hydrostatic pressure

- Endothelial injury and disruption of epithelial barriers

- Decrease in oncotic pressure due to underlying hepatic, renal, malnutrition, and other protein-losing states.

- Lymphatic insufficiency

- Increased negative interstitial pressure

The relationship between hydrostatic and oncotic forces in relation to net fluid filtration is best explained by Ernest Starling’s equation. The rate of fluid filtration is determined by the differences in the hydrostatic and oncotic pressures between the pulmonary capillaries and interstitial space.
