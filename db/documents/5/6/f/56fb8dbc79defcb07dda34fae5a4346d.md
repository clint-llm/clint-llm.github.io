The key to rickettsial infections is prevention. Prevention relies on avoidance of exposure to tick, lice, mite, and flea bites, particularly when residing or traveling to endemic areas. Currently, there is not a vaccine for the prevention of Rocky Mountain spotted fever or other rickettsial infections, and antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely recommended in the United States. Patients should be educated on carefulÂ inspection for insects after outdoor activities, the importance of wearing long-sleeved shirts, pants, socks, and closed-toe shoes, and the use of insect repellant to minimize the risk of rickettsial infection. They also should receive education regarding areas where Rickettsia species are endemic.
