Bell palsy is the commonest cause of unilateral facial paralysis. While benign, the condition does have moderate morbidity. The cause of Bell palsy remains unknown, and its treatment remains controversial. While steroids and/or antiviral medications are often prescribed, there are no randomized clinical trials to determine which is better or effective. The problem is compounded by the fact that the majority of cases resolve spontaneously. However, in individuals with long-standing facial paralysis accompanied by poor speech, incomplete eyelid closure or poor aesthetics, treatment needs to be addressed by an interprofessional team. Because the disorder affects different organ systems, a multidisciplinary team of clinicians has proven effective. The most important feature of treatment is to be patient-focused rather than symptom focus.

The availability of botulinum toxin has helped reduce the long-term burden of this disorder. Surgery is the last resort treatment and may be required in chronic cases. The facial muscles do remain viable for several years, and in these cases, complex reconstructions are available. However, rather than subject the patient to complex surgery with no guarantee of improvement, early recognition, and initiation of steroidal therapy is recommended.

**Outcomes**

Evidence-based medicine is lacking when it comes to treatment and outcomes for Bell palsy. The problem is made more difficult because many cases resolve spontaneously. The majority of outcomes have been from case reports or small case series. While recovery does occur in most patients, it often takes months or even years for full recovery. Because there are several types of treatments available besides medications, an interprofessional team should be involved in the management since not everyone responds to the same treatment.
