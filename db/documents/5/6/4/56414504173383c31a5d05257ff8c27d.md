Bupropion is an aminoketone that is classified as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. In overdose, seizures are frequently seen, including status epilepticus, but the exact mechanism is unclear. Cardiovascular toxicity may include conduction delays resulting in widened QRS and QT intervals, dysrhythmias, or cardiogenic shock. Notably, QRS prolongation is not related to the cardiac sodium channel and instead is related to myocardial gap junctions and disruption of intercellular communication.
