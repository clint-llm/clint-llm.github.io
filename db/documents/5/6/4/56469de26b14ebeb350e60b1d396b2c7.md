The epidemiology varies across developed and developing countries. The congenital varieties form a greater proportion in the developed countries with easy access to healthcare. The estimated prevalence of congenital ectopia lentis is 6.4/ 100,000 population.

In developing and countries with more limited resources, acquired LIG from advanced senile cataracts are the more prevalent subtype. The incidence of LIG is up to 2.4% at the time of the presentation of senile cataracts with a female preponderance.
