Major depressive disorder is a clinical diagnosis; it is mainly diagnosed by the clinical history given by the patient and mental status examination. The clinical interview must include medical history, family history, social history, and substance use history along with the symptomatology. Collateral information from a patient's family/friends is a very important part of psychiatric evaluation.

A complete physical examination, including neurological examination, should be performed. It is important to rule out any underlying medical/organic causes of a depressive disorder. A full medical history, along with the family medical and psychiatric history, should be assessed.Â Mental status examination plays an important role in the diagnosis and evaluation of MDD.
