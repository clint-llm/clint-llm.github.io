Patients treated in the prone position are at risk of cardiac arrest. Therefore, the bedside nurses, primary physicians, and the cardiac arrest team should be well prepared. The necessary equipment for CPR should be available inside or close to the patient's room. Defibrillation pads can be placed in the recommended positions on the prone patient and connected to the electrical rhythm monitor before cardiac arrest occurs.

The patient's room should be cleared of any materials that may obstruct the smooth flow of the CPR process. Cardiac arrest team members and healthcare staff involved in managing patients in prone positions should be trained to perform prone CPR.
