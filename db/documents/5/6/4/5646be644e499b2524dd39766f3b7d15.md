The IVL utilizes a one-time disposable monorail catheter with an internally mounted ultrasound core positioned around a 0.014″ guidewire. A balloon surrounds the central apparatus; this inflatable equipment is of constant length measuring 12 millimeters (mm) however comes in various diameters ranging between 2.5 and 4.0mm, these device configurations allow the catheter to cross widths from 0.043″ to 0.046″.

Also, the IVL system incorporates a portable regenerator to provide energy to supply two sets of radiopaque and traditional emitters, which are within the central and lateral boundaries of the balloon; these transmitters produce intermittent sonic pressure waves resulting in the delivery of mechanical energy to the target lesion. The acoustic energy results in the creation of micro-cracks within the calcified plaque with each transmission and consecutive impulses cause an increase in vessel compliance with preservation of underlying wall composition, allowing complete balloon opening at substantially reduced atmospheric pressures compared to more conventional techniques.
