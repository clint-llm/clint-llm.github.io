Ophthalmological surgeries are common in the elderly population, who carry a higher incidence of comorbidities. Thus, a thorough preoperative assessment should be conducted, including a history of the present illness, a physical exam, and an airway assessment. It is essential to review prior test results, especially those that provide information about the length of the ocular globe and the coagulation status of the patient (prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time). Likewise, a current list of medications, including analgesics and anticoagulants, should be noted.

Though rates of complications during ophthalmological procedures are low, it is the responsibility of the anesthesiologist to holistically approach the explanation of potential risks and take necessary measures to minimize them. There is no consensus on the management of patients receiving anticoagulation therapy for ophthalmological surgery. However, most physicians follow the American Society of Regional Anesthesia (ASRA) 2018 guidelines for managing anticoagulation or antithrombotic therapy in patients undergoing peripheral regional and neuraxial blocks.
