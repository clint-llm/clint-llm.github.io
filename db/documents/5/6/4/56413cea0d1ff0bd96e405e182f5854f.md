The origins of ANA testing were first described in 1948 when Hargraves and colleagues observed a specific cell from a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and termed it the "L.E. cell."

In 1975, HEp-2 cells became the standard cell substrate due to their increased sensitivity. And in 2010, the American College of Rheumatology published a study affirming that indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) staining with HEp-2 cells should be considered the gold standard for detecting ANAs. However, due to variability in technique, HEp-2 preparation, and antibody expression, HEp-2 IIF results may be difficult to standardize.

IIF patterns correlate to specific ANA subtypes, and pattern recognition is a valuable tool in ANA testing. Homogenous fluorescence pattern typically suggests antibodies directed at dsDNA, histones, or nucleosomes.

While IIF-ANA remains the primary initial testing method, other methods, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and immunoassays, offer confirmatory testing for specific ANAs. ELISA offers quantitative screening for specific ANAs and has proven to perform comparably to IIF, and commercial panels for antibodies to SSA/Ro, SSB/La, Sm, Scl-70, Jo-1, and centromeres are available.
