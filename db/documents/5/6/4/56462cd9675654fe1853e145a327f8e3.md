Pulmonary carcinoid tumors are uncommon neuroendocrine epithelial malignancies accounting for less than 1% of all lung cancers. They divide into two subcategories: typical carcinoids and atypical carcinoids. Typical carcinoids and atypical carcinoids are, respectively, low- and intermediate-grade neuroendocrine tumors. Approximately 80% of pulmonary carcinoids occur centrally, and 20% are peripheral. All bronchial carcinoids are malignant and have the potential to metastasize. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of lung carcinoids and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the histopathology of lung carcinoids.
- Review the presentation of lung carcinoid.
- Summarize the treatment options for lung carcinoid.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by lung carcinoid.
