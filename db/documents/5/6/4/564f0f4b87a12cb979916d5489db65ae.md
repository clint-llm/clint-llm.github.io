Vein grafts retrieved from patients with angiographic evidence of occlusive disease demonstrate histologic features of atherosclerosis. These lesions have been identified as early as six months after implantation. Thus, it appears that these late occlusions of vein bypass grafts are due to the development of a rapidly progressive and structurally distinct form of atherosclerosis, termed "accelerated atherosclerosis," to distinguish it from non-iatrogenic "spontaneous atherosclerosis."

Accelerated atherosclerosis is morphologically different from spontaneous atherosclerosis because its lesions appear diffuse, more concentric, and have greater cellularity with varying degrees of lipid accumulation and mononuclear cell infiltration. The syndrome of accelerated atherosclerosis shares many of the pathophysiological features of intimal hyperplasia; however, the macrophage is likely to be the prime mediator of this type of atherosclerosis. Also, the endothelium overlying accelerated atherosclerotic lesions expresses class II antigens, which are not observed in spontaneous atherosclerosis.****
