The first step in vascular smooth muscle contraction is the influx of calcium into the smooth muscle cell via voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels. Cytosolic calcium binding to calmodulin follows this action, resulting in the activation of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). The activated MLCK phosphorylates the myosin light chain resulting in the attachment of the myosin head with actin, ultimately causing smooth-muscle contraction and vasoconstriction. The vascular smooth muscle contraction causes an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and an increase in blood pressure.

Like the other dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, felodipine blocks the voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels and prevents calcium entry into the smooth muscle cell. Reduced cytosolic calcium decreases peripheral vascular resistance, resulting in vasodilation and a decrease in blood pressure. Felodipine selectively dilates arterioles and has no impact on venous vessels. In the in-vitro studies, research shows that felodipine has a higher selectivity than other commonly used dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers like amlodipine and nifedipine for vascular tissue in comparison to cardiac tissue. Also, the clinical trials of felodipine have not shown any negative inotropic effect.

Felodipine results in a dose-dependent decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Additionally, felodipine causes a reflex increase in heart rate (reflex tachycardia).

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Felodipine is almost completely absorbed after oral administration. However, the bioavailability is only about 20% because of the extensive first-pass metabolism of felodipine—the plasma concentration of felodipine increases when administered along with high fat or high carbohydrate diet. Additionally, grapefruit juice administration increases the plasma concentration of felodipine.

**Distribution:**Felodipine is highly protein-bound and has a high volume of distribution(about 10 L/kg). Felodipine administration with alcohol results in a significant increase in the absorption of felodipine. Peak plasma concentration(Cmax) increased by almost 150%, and time to peak plasma concentration(Tmax) decreased by one h after intake of alcohol in simulation. Concurrent administration of alcohol with felodipine should be generally avoided.

**Metabolism:**Felodipine is metabolized in the liver and weakly inhibits CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes.

**Excretion:**Approximately 70 % of felodipine is excreted as metabolites in the urine; biliary secretion is a minor route of eliminating felodipine, with 10 %  of the administered dose recovered in the feces.
