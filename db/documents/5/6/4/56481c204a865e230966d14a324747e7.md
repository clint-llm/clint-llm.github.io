The main processes leading to the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy are increased production of IgA1, defective galactosylation of IgA1, binding of antibodies against the galactose-deficient IgA1 with an accumulation of immune complexes in the mesangium, and activation of the mesangial cells. Patients with IgA nephropathy have excess deposits of galactose-deficient IgA1 in their serum and glomerular mesangium. The galactose-deficient immunoglobulin A1 has less galactose in the hinge region of the heavy chains and, subsequently, is recognized as a neo-antigen, triggering the formation of autoantibodies and circulating immune complexes that accumulate in the mesangial cells. This mesangial deposition causes the release of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic mediators and results in mesangial proliferation, extracellular matrix synthesis, and podocyte damage. These mesangial-induced mediators are also filtered in the urine and activate proximal tubular epithelial cells, causing tubulointerstitial scarring.
