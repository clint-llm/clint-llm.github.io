Treatment with specific antibiotics is required when evidence for a true Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infection is established or in critically sick patients with a Stenotrophomonas maltophilia growth until further data are available. Treatment recommendations mostly come from in vitro studies, retrospective studies, non-randomized clinical trials, and expert opinions.

The first-line treatment is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which has been the recommended empiric single agent against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia for many years.in vitro data suggesting bacteriostatic activity against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is recommended at high doses at 15 mg/kg or more of the trimethoprim component, as used for severe Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.

One recent study from Mexico showed an 80% resistance rate to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in a combination of environmental and clinical isolates from Mexico.

Alternatives treatments are the bacteriocidal fluoroquinolones, with up to 80-90% susceptibility rates, because of their specific biofilm active properties and their high concentration in the lungs.

For second-line treatments, minocycline and tigecycline have been reported to have good effectiveness against many isolates at around 80% to 100% susceptibility rate even for isolates resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.Stenotrophomonas maltophilia infections

Resistance to many of these antimicrobials and the co-existence of multiple resistances together are being reported at higher rates in the literature, which creates the need for new agents and regimens to be utilized.Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

Eravacycline, omadacycline, and delafloxacin have demonstrated good in-vitro activity as well for their respective infection indications.Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia in recent reports. Combinations of antimicrobials have been studied with good synergistic promising results, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole/ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime/levofloxacin, ticarcillin-clavulanate/trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ticarcillin-clavulanate/aztreonam, tigecycline/colistin, colistin/rifampicin, ceftazidime/minocycline, levofloxacin/erythromycin, and tigecycline/fosfomycin.

Since some isolates showed resistance to all known tested antimicrobials, new treatment approaches and modalities are currently being studied, such as aerosolized antimicrobials (colistin and levofloxacin), bacteriophage therapy, efflux pump inhibitors, quorum sensing interference (quorum quenching), antimicrobial peptides like the cathelicidin-derived ones, silver or selenium nanoparticles, cationic compounds, plant oils, green tea epigallocatechin-3-gallate, and using Bdellovivrio exovorus as a bacterial predator.

The typical duration of antimicrobial courses for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia pneumonia is usually 7 days, which can be extended to 10 to 14 days in immunosuppressed patients. Bacteremia cases, on the other hand, are generally treated for 14 days total.

Source control is essential in certain cases for successful treatment, such as central venous catheter removal, infected metal hardware retrieval, wounds debridement, conjunctival autografting, and collections drainage.
