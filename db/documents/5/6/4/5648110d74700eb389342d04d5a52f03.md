The clinical presentation of Meigs syndrome could mirror the clinical picture of a malignant ovarian tumor with pleural and abdominal metastases. If the tumor is deemed inoperable without evidence of the malignant nature of the tumor, a potential opportunity for cure could be missed. Hence health care professionals need to keep Meigs syndrome in the differential in any female with ascites and pleural effusion.

The pathophysiology of Meigs syndrome is still not well explained. Further studies on this topic may shed light on obtaining an earlier diagnosis of the condition. [Level 4]

Meigs syndrome requires the diagnostic and therapeutic efforts of an interdisciplinary and interprofessional healthcare team. This includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and APs), specialists (who may need to help eliminate other systemic diagnostic possibilities), and nurses, all working in a coordinated fashion and openly sharing information and documenting all observations, interventions, and concerns in the patient's medical record. This approach will ensure that the entire interprofessional team has the same data and can reach out to other members to manage the case. Nurses will help coordinate the various disciplines and assist in patient counseling. This interprofessional approach will derive optimal outcomes for patients with Meigs syndrome. [Level 5]
