Pierre Robin sequence (PRS) is a triad of micrognathia, posterior-inferior displacement of the tongue base (glossoptosis), and airway obstruction.

A sequence is a pattern of congenital anomalies that result from a single defect during development. In PRS, micrognathia is the single initiating event that occurs during development. It results in a cascade of secondary defects such as glossoptosis and cleft palate. The abnormal mandible displaces the tongue into the nasopharynx, thus preventing the fusion of palatal shelves. This gives rise to varying severity of cleft palate. In addition to cleft palate, glossoptosis also gives rise to airway obstruction and obstructive sleep apnea if severe.

In approximately 70% of cases of PRS, placing the neonate in a prone or lateral position relieves airway obstruction, but if the neonate desaturates, then a nasopharyngeal (NP) tube can be placed to bypass upper airway obstruction.

After initial stabilization of the patient, procedures such as tongue lip adhesion and mandibular distraction osteogenesis can correct glossoptosis, lengthen the mandible and relieve glossoptosis. Also, the above techniques may need to be performed in conservatively managed PRS who fail to achieve an adequate catch-up growth.

The above-listed procedures require anesthetic intervention in the form of general anesthesia. Anesthesiology-assisted sedation may be needed in patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT).
