**Operative Techniques for Palatoplasty**

Multiple surgical techniques for cleft palate repair have been described; this article will focus on the more frequently utilized procedures. Independent of the method selected, it is essential to thoroughly irrigate the nose, mouth, and pharynx with chlorhexidine or another antiseptic solution before beginning to operate. Additionally, infiltration of the palate with a local anesthetic containing epinephrine will help to decrease blood loss and improve intraoperative visualization.

**Von Langenbeck**

This is the primary surgical technique in such cases.

- Incisions are made along the cleft soft palate's medial margins, from the cleft's mid-portion proceeding posteriorly towards the uvula.

- Releasing incisions are made on the soft palate, posterior to the maxillary tuberosity, followed by careful blunt dissection in a plane between the superior constrictor muscle and the velar musculature.

- Dissection of the nasal mucosa from the palatal musculature is performed, followed by approximating the nasal mucosa with simple interrupted sutures.

- Approximation of both hemiuvulae using interrupted horizontal mattress sutures is then performed, taking care to close muscle to muscle and mucosa to mucosa.

- Incisions are made along the medial margins of the cleft hard palate, followed by releasing incisions along the hard palate's lateral margins, just medial to the alveolar ridge. To preserve perfusion to the palatal flaps, the releasing incisions should stop several millimeters short of the incisive foramen anteriorly; posteriorly, they stop prior to the greater palatine foramina. Bipedicled mucoperiosteal flaps are then dissected off the underlying hard palate bone (the anterior blood supply is provided by periosteal attachments; the posterior blood supply comes from the greater palatine arteries). Approximation of the mucoperiosteal flaps follows with either a horizontal mattress or simple interrupted sutures. In the event that the flaps are insufficiently mobile to coapt in the midline, fracture of the pterygoid hamuli may provide additional movement.

- Intravelar veloplasty may be performed as well (as described below). Although not described in the original technique, most cleft surgeons perform this procedure during the Von Langenbeck palatoplasty.

**Bardach ("Two-flap" palatoplasty)**

This technique represents a modification of the Von Langenbeck palatoplasty in which bilateral monopedicled mucoperiosteal flaps are elevated and closed in the midline.

- Incisions are made along the medial margins of the cleft soft palate at the junction between the nasal and oral mucosal surfaces. The incisions extend to the tip of the uvula, dividing it into nasal and oral portions. Incisions are then made along both sides of the hard palate cleft to create mucoperiosteal flaps.

- Releasing incisions similar to Von Langenbeck's are then created, but these proceed all the way to the margin of the cleft, creating monopedicled flaps based posteriorly on the greater palatine arteries.

- Dissection of the palatal flaps proceeds on the oral side first, in the subperiosteal plane. The greater palatine foramen is identified, preserving the neurovascular bundle. Releasing the neurovascular bundle from the foramen via osteotomy may help to increase the mobility of the flap, if necessary. The nasal mucoperiosteum is then dissected similarly.

- Dissection of the palatal muscles off the hard palate's posterior edge and from the periosteum on the nasal side is performed. Then, the muscles are repositioned medially and distally - a pivotal step to recreate the palatal muscle sling and lengthen the soft palate.

- Muscle repair is performed, starting distally at the uvula and proceeding anteriorly toward the hard palate's posterior edge. While the original technique advocates using vertical mattress sutures (including the oral mucosa and muscle), placing a horizontal mattress or simple interrupted sutures in the muscle are acceptable alternatives.

- Approximation of the palatal flaps along the hard palate follows.

- The areas with exposed bare bone lateral to the mucoperiosteal flaps are assessed. Bardach advocated placing loose sutures to reduce the area of bare bone exposure. Certain cases may benefit from placing hemostatic agents or fibrin on the site of exposed bare bone.

**Veau-Wardill-Kilner ("V to Y pushback")**

This technique represents a modification of the Bardach palatoplasty in which bilateral flaps are advanced posteromedially to close the palatal defect and lengthen the soft palate.

- Incisions are made as in the Von Langenbeck technique, except that the hard palate-releasing incisions do not end behind the medial alveolar ridge but instead angulate posteromedially to meet the anterior aspect of the cleft and avoid the incisive foramen. This design produces monopedicled mucoperiosteal flaps that can then be advanced posteromedially ("pushed back") during closure.

- While a true V to Y advancement is not performed during this procedure because secondary defects remain open rather than being closed in such as way as to push tissue into the primary defect, the overall effect is the advancement and elongation of the palate via V-shaped incisions. Unlike the Von Langenbeck repair, the Veau-Wardill-Kilner technique produces bilateral monopedicled flaps reliant solely on perfusion from the greater palatine arteries.

- Closure proceeds with simple interrupted or horizontal mattress sutures. The anterior palate repair consists of nasal mucosa closure exclusively. The nasal mucosa closure relies solely on one-layer, unilateral or bilateral, superiorly-based mucosal vomer flaps.

Because of the high incidence of postoperative fistula formation due to single-layer closure and midfacial growth disturbance, most surgeons have abandoned this technique.

**Furlow Double Opposing Z-Palatoplasty**

This technique is used for lengthening and closure of soft palate clefts, but it may be combined with any of the techniques mentioned above when the hard palate is involved as well.

- A z-plasty is marked such that its central segment corresponds to the palatal cleft, one limb runs along the posterior border of the hard palate, and the other limb runs parallel to the posterior border of the soft palate.

- The incisions are made, and flaps elevated such that the posteriorly-based flap (i.e., the one with the incision at the posterior border of the hard palate) contains muscle and oral mucosa, while the contralateral flap contains oral mucosa only.

- A second, deeper z-plasty is then marked such that its central segment corresponds to the palatal cleft, and its other limbs run opposite to those of the first, more superficial z-plasty (i.e., the side that had the incision at the posterior border of the hard palate now has an incision parallel to the posterior border of the soft palate).

- The incisions are made and flaps elevated, again ensuring that the posteriorly-based flap contains mucosa and muscle, while the anteriorly-based flap contains only nasal mucosa.

- The deep z-plasty flaps are then transposed, and the incisions are closed. The superficial z-plasty flaps are then transposed and closed as well, with the overall effect reorienting the tensor veli palatini sling into a more normal anatomical position and increasing the length of the soft palate, ideally improving velopharyngeal closure (see figures).

**Sommerlad Technique**

Sommerlad advocates using the operating microscope to perform this technique to provide better magnification and superior visualization. However, using a microscope in patients with limited mouth opening (e.g., Pierre Robin sequence patients) and operating in environments without surgical microscopes (e.g., on medical missions) has made surgeons comfortable performing this technique under loupe magnification (3.5x or greater).

- Incisions are made along the cleft soft palate's medial margin, usually placing the incision slightly more on the oral side of the junction between the nasal and oral mucosal surfaces. The incision is extended to the posterior hard palate. Releasing incisions similar to those of Von Langenbeck may be made as well.

- Dissection of posterior mucoperiosteal flaps is followed by using a dental periosteal elevator, passing it carefully behind the greater palatine vessels, and then distally to the posterior edge of the hard palate.

- Dissection of the oral mucosa investing the musculature of the velum follows.

- Then, dissection of the palatal shelves' nasal mucosa and careful approximation in the midline is performed. Once the nasal mucosa has been sutured, additional dissection proceeds laterally, following the plane between the nasal mucosa and the soft palate musculature.

- Dissection of the palatal muscles from the posterior edge of the palatal shelf and from the nasal mucosa is carried out, followed by division of the tensor veli palatini muscle medial to the hamulus.

- After adequately mobilizing the muscle, the tensor veli palatini sling is reconstructed using loop mattress sutures or interrupted sutures.

- Suture approximation of the oral layer completes the repair.

**Ancillary Procedures with Cleft Palate Repair**

**Intravelar Veloplasty**

This is the term applied to reapproximation of the disrupted palatal muscle sling in order to improve velopharyngeal function. It is usually carried out via incisions along the soft palate cleft margins, as described in the Sommerlad Technique section above. After the cleft margin incisions are made, careful dissection of the muscle from the nasal and oral mucosal layers proceeds. The muscles are then detached from the palatal shelf, realigned, and sutured transversely to form a sling.

**Vomer Flap**

This technique aims to obtain additional mucoperiosteal tissue from the vomer to reconstruct the nasal mucosal layer in patients with wide palatal clefts. The procedure involves a paramedian incision of the mucosa overlying the vomer followed by careful dissection in the subperiosteal plane. Once free, the flap is mobilized and sutured to the nasal mucosa layer on the cleft side. While the vomer flap's initial descriptions were based on a caudal or inferior blood supply, most of the currently used vomer flaps rely on a cephalic or superior blood supply.

**Pharyngeal Flap**

A wide flap (approximately 3 cm in width) can be dissected from the posterior pharyngeal wall down to the level of the cricoid cartilage, leaving the flap pedicled superiorly at the level of Passavant's ridge. Once dissection is complete, and hemostasis is obtained, the flap can be inset into the soft palate, improving anteroposterior closure and leaving lateral "ports" patent for breathing. While this technique is very effective for decreasing velopharyngeal insufficiency, it may worsen obstructive sleep apnea significantly.
