**Acute Ligamentous Instability**

- Trauma

- Indirect loading injury

**Acute Bony Instability**

- Fractures

**Chronic Instability**

- Repetitive microtrauma

- Post-traumatic sequela (distal radius fracture)

**Systemic Illness**

- Avascular necrosis of the scaphoid

- Rheumatoid arthritis

**Neurological**

- Usually through the development of neurogenic arthropathies, i.e., Charcot-like joints

- Syringomyelia

**Congenital Instability**

- Madelung deformity causes misalignment of the forearm (radius, ulna) and carpal bones, predisposing to progressive arthrosis and instability.
