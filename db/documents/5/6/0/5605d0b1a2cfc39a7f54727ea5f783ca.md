**Mechanism of Action**

Neomycin's mechanism of action is very similar to most aminoglycosides as it binds to the 30s ribosomal subunit interfering with bacterial protein synthesis. The initial steps needed for peptide synthesis are uninterrupted, but elongation fails to occur due to disruption of translational precision. This action thereby disrupts bacteria's translation process, leading to the medication's bactericidal effects.

The pathogenesis of hepatic coma is often due to underlying liver disease leading to elevated ammonia levels in the blood. At high levels, ammonia can cross the blood-brain barriers leading to many of the neurologic manifestations of hepatic coma. In addition, ammonia within the brain leads to increased levels of glutamine and lactate, resulting in neuronal edema.

Neomycin's bactericidal effects decrease ammonia-producing bacteria residing in the gastrointestinal(GI) tract, thereby decreasing the burden of ammonia on the patient.

Due to neomycin's poor GI absorption, it is an effective choice for perioperative bowel prep with the minimal systemic circulation. Neomycin is often combined with erythromycin a day before surgery to decrease bacterial load in the colon to reduce the possibility of surgical site infections. Metronidazole may be an option due to its better tolerability than erythromycin. These antibiotics are part of a regimen in conjunction with mechanical bowel prep and standard IV antibiotic prophylaxis.

There is some controversy about whether these methods of bowel preparation are effective and whether clinicians should use them. A multicentered, randomized, parallel, single-blinded trial conducted in Finland found that when compared to no bowel prep at all, there was no significant reduction in surgical site infections or morbidity when using mechanical and oral bowel preparation for elective colectomies.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Absorption: The lack of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is the basis of the main use of neomycin as an oral agent to suppress intestinal bacterial flora.

Distribution: As with other aminoglycosides, the quantity of absorbed neomycin transferred to the tissues increases cumulatively with each dose administered until a steady-state concentration is obtained. The kidney is the primary excretory path of the absorbed drug, and the highest concentration is found in the renal cortex. With cumulative dosings, progressive accumulation also occurs in the inner ear. The release of tissue-bound neomycin occurs slowly over several weeks after discontinued dosing.

Metabolism: There is limited information available on the metabolism of neomycin. It has limited systemic absorption following the drug administration, and metabolism is deemed to be negligible.

Excretion: Neomycin sulfate is excreted primarily through feces (97% of oral dose as unchanged drug).
