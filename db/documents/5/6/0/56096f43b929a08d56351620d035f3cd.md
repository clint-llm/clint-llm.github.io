LADA is determined by genetic factors. As in T1DM, the risk for acquiring LADA is highest in carriers of certain HLA haplotypes. The HLA genes code for the major histocompatibility antigens (MHC) which have important immunoregulatory functions, and therefore it is not surprising that LADA is caused by dysregulated immunity. However, the factors that precipitate autoimmunity have not been established.

Unlike T2DM, there is a paucity of studies investigating the role of environmental factors like lifestyle in LADA. The reasons for this are:

- The need for autoantibody measurement in every newly diagnosed adult diabetes patient to identify and classify patients as LADA

- The absence of comparable cohort groups

- Unavailability of lifestyle information antecedent to the diagnosis of LADA

- The inadequate sample size of LADA patients in the studies enhances the power of the study.

In the few studies in this regard, it is evident that LADA shares several lifestyle risk factors with T2DM, namely, excess body weight, greater waist-hip ratio, low birth weight, intake of two or more sweetened beverages daily, and heavy smoking. These risk factors are of greater significance in the subset of LADA with lower titers of autoantibodies and higher BMI. Although weaker, they hold even for those with higher antibody titers. Increased physical activity, moderate alcohol use, and the intake of fatty fish have a protective effect on the risk of LADA.
