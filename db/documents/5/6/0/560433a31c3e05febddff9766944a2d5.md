Septic emboli could affect multiple organs, and complications depend on the organ affected and the size of the embolus.

Septic cerebral emboli could result in **ischemic strokes**due to infarction of the ischemic area,**brain abscesses**causing variable neurological deficits based on the location affected, and the extent of the damage. Septic cerebral emboli are also a risk factor for thrombolysis-related**hemorrhagic transformation**.**mycotic aneurysms**are relatively rare, accounting for less than 10% of neurologic complications of infective endocarditis.

Mycotic aneurysms (infected arterial aneurysms): mycotic is a misnomer as they rarely result from fungus and are mostly of bacterial etiology. A mycotic aneurysm is a focal dilation of an infected arterial wall.

Complications of septic splenic emboli include **splenic abscess/splenic infarction**resulting in severe abdominal pain or hemorrhage that may warrant urgent surgical intervention.

Septic renal emboli can cause renal infarction.

Complications of septic pulmonary emboli vary based on the severity and the size of the damaged pulmonary parenchyma from asymptomatic lung nodules like lesions on pulmonary imaging to severe dyspnea and**hypoxemic respiratory failure. They could**result in long term**pulmonary cavitary**lesions.**Pneumothorax**is also described as a complication of a septic pulmonary embolism due to Methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection occurring 10 days after treatment.
