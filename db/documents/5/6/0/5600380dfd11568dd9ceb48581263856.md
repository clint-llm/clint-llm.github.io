Waterhouse Friderichsen syndrome is a rare condition that presents with nonspecific symptoms and requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team. In those patients with a risk factor for adrenal hemorrhage, clinicians should keep their mind broad and open, especially when the hypotension does not respond to vasopressor alone. The management involves interprofessional care that includes hospitalist, intensivist, endocrinologist, and pharmacist.

The patient monitoring is usually done by the ICU nurses who should be aware of the syndrome and its presentation. The pharmacist should ensure that the patient is on the appropriate antibiotics in cases associated with sepsis. Also, the pharmacist must ensure that the patient is receiving glucocorticoids, working with nursing and the clinician team on dosing and administration. Close communication between the interprofessional team is vital to improving patient outcomes. [Level 5]
