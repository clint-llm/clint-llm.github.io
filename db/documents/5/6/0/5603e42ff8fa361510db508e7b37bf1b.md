Physiologic variants of the corpus callosum include agenesis or hypoplasia. Agenesis of the corpus callosum is an uncommon brain malformation that either leads to a partial or total absence of the corpus callosum. Though rare, it is one of the more frequently occurring congenital malformations, affecting three to seven people per 1000 births.
