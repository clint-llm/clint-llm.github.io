Interpretation of PET/CT images must be performed by a board-certified radiologist or nuclear medicine physician with a continuing experience and education of no less than 150 studies in a period of 3 years.

A registered radiographer can acquire images, a registered or certified nuclear medicine technologist, or a registered radiation therapist with credentials to operate CT and radiopharmaceuticals.

Finally, a designated safety radiation officer (SRO) is required in all institutions certified to use radiopharmaceuticals for healthcare purposes. The SRO's responsibilities include ensuring adequate handling of radiopharmaceuticals (shipping, receiving, securing, and disposal), maintaining calibration instruments, and promoting radiation safety in the institution.
