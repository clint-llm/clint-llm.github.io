Paroxysmal SVT is usually managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare workers dedicated to cardiac arrhythmias. Since these arrhythmias cannot be prevented, the focus is on treatment. Besides the cardiologist, the role of the nurse and pharmacist is indispensable. The patient should be educated about this arrhythmia and the potential risk of sudden death if left untreated. For patients with SVT managed with medications, the pharmacist should assist the team by educating the patient on potential adverse effects, drug interactions and the need for close follow-up. The patient should also be educated on the option of radiofrequency ablation, which has a much higher success rate compared to medications.

**Outcomes**

For the most part, patients with paroxysmal SVT have a good outcome with treatment. However, a small number of patients with WPW do have a tiny risk of sudden death. In patients with SVT arising due to a structural defect in the heart, the prognosis depends on the severity of the defect, but in healthy people with no structural defects, the prognosis is excellent. Pregnant women who develop SVT do have a slightly higher risk of death if there is an unrepaired heart defect.
