As described above, aortic insufficiency may occur due to dysfunction linked to the aortic valve leaflets, aortic root, annulus, or ascending aorta. Typical etiologies responsible for acute AR include infective endocarditis, traumatic and non-traumatic rupture of the ascending aorta with aortic cusp prolapse, iatrogenic AR due to percutaneous aortic balloon valvuloplasty, prosthetic valve dysfunction, and perivalvular leak or dehiscence of a prosthetic valve.

The etiologies responsible for chronic AR may be extensive, they include rheumatic heart disease (the most common cause in the developing world), infective endocarditis, myxomatous valve degeneration, congenital valve abnormalities (most commonly a bicuspid aortic valve while unicuspid and quadricuspid have also been reported), senile valvular calcifications, age-related dilatation of the aorta, ectasia of the aortic annulus, aortic dissection, aortitis/aortic root dilatation secondary to syphilis or giant cell arteritis, trauma, systemic hypertension, drug-induced valvulopathy, Whipple disease, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Crohn disease.

Other rheumatologic processes involved are antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, relapsing polychondritis, Takayasu vasculitis, Marfan syndrome, Ehler-Danlos syndrome, and Behcet disease.

Correlations have also been made between AR and Turner Syndrome. In one study of 253 patients with Turner syndrome from 7 to 67 years of age, AR was trivial, mild, and moderate to severe in 55%, 30%, and nearly 15% of the study population, respectively.
