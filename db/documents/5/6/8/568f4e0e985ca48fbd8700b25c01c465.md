**Interpretation of Results**

Bone mineral density is the standard for measuring the diagnosis of osteoporosis and fracture risk assessment. The Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) uses clinical risk factors, excluding the measure of BMD, to identify those at risk for osteoporosis or fractures. The FRAX was implemented in 2008 by the World Health Organization and is used to calculate the chance of a fracture in a ten-year timeframe.

The clinical risk factors included in FRAX are age, sex, race, height, weight, body mass index, a history of fracture, parent's history of hip fracture, use of oral glucocorticoids, rheumatoid arthritis, and other secondary causes of osteoporosis, smoking, and alcohol use of three or more drinks daily. The geographic area is also considered in the calculation.

In the United States, the National Osteoporosis Foundation recommends using FRAX to calculate fracture risk for patients who have T-scores between −1.0 and −2.5 in the spine, femoral neck, or total hip region.

A licensed radiologist interprets the scans and a T-score is determined to evaluate the standard deviation in the mean from the reference population and patient's average bone mineral density. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines T-scores as:

- Greater than or equal to -1.0: normal

- Less than -1.0 to greater than -2.5: osteopenia

- Less than or equal to -2.5: osteoporosis

- Less than or equal to -2.5 plus fragility fracture: severe osteoporosis
