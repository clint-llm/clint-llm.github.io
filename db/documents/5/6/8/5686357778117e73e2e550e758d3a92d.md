Usually, in pregnancy, there is hyperplasia of pituitary lactotrophs, and prolactin levels increase. Prolactinomas increase in size during pregnancy, and in patients with known macroadenomas, one can consider surgery before pregnancy, or those on medical therapy should be monitored carefully with periodic visual field testing. Bromocriptine has the largest safety database in pregnancy and is the preferred drug during pregnancy.

Pituitary apoplexy is an endocrine emergency when there is spontaneous hemorrhage into the pituitary adenoma/prolactinoma and patients present with sudden onset headaches and vision changes. Any patient with known prolactinoma/pituitary adenoma presenting with the above symptoms would need an urgent MRI and neurosurgical/endocrine evaluation.
