Testicular seminoma is a germ cell tumor, which is very sensitive to radiation therapy. Radiation therapy planning is based on the results of a contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The optimal IMRT dose has been decreased to 20 to 25 Gy in CS I and to 30 to 36 Gy in CS IIs. Because of low pelvic relapse rates reported in stage I tumors (less than 5%), the indication for pelvic irradiation is no longer. This omission increases post-treatment fertility rates and diminished gastrointestinal toxicity. The optimal RT dose generally recommended is between 25 and 30 Gy in 15 to 20 fractions. Because left-sided primaries tend to relapse around the insertion of the left testicular vein the, left para-aortic region must be included in the irradiated volume. Radiation therapy planning is based on the results of a contrast-enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.
