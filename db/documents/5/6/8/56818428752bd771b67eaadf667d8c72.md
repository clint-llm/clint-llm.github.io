SSN injury is a diagnosis that requires a keen diagnostic acumen and an effective multidisciplinary team to effectively manage. Early identification and initiation of treatment are key to symptom improvement and return to the prior level of function. Efficient consultation to specialty providers, such as physical medicine & rehabilitation, sports medicine, and/or orthopedic surgery provides the best prognosis and outcome for the patient. Once diagnosed prompt referral to physical therapy to begin rehabilitation is also beneficial for patients to increase range of motion and strengthen the rotator cuff and surrounding musculature whether it is the definitive treatment or ends up ultimately being part of a pre- and post-operative rehabilitation protocol. Referrals should include a summary of the history of present illness, physical exam, a detailed social history (with close attention to occupations, hobbies, and sports with repetitive overhead motions), patientâ€™s goals of treatment, and treatments already trialed. This information sharing allows for a more complete view of the patient's problem and allows all team members access to important information necessary to effectively treat the patient and meet their goals.
