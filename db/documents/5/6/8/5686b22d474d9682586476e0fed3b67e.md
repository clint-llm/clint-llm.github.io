Patients who do not show signs of peritonitis can be managed non-operatively with manual disimpaction via the rectum or with endoscopically guided disimpaction,Â bowel regimen, and admission for close monitoring.

Management of constipation involves dietary changes such as increasing fiber, fruit, and fluid intake. Patients with fecal impaction or stercoral colitis should be educated regarding a proper diet and should also be given pharmacologic therapy to prevent constipation in the future. Osmotic and stimulant laxatives are considered first-line treatment for patients with constipation.
