The ANS is involved in several processes to maintain homeostasis. The symptoms and signs that are present due to a pathologic process involving the ANS depend on the area afflicted. For example, a tumor within the apex of the lung, known as a Pancoast tumor, can compress the sympatheticÂ ganglia and cause Horner syndrome, resulting in ptosis, miosis, and anhydrosis of the ipsilateral eye. Impairment of nerve fibers relaying autonomic signals, such as seen in diabetic autonomic neuropathy, can result in bowel dysmotility, resting tachycardia, orthostatic intolerance, constipation, fecal incontinence, and erectile dysfunction.
