The presenting symptoms are varied. The patients can present with decreased visual acuity (43%), strabismus (23%), leukocoria/xanthocoria (20%), pain (3%), heterochromia (1%), and nystagmus (1%).

Visual acuity can range from 20/20 to 20/50 in 12% of cases, 20/60 to 20/100 in 11%, 20/200 to counting fingers in 18%, and hand motions to no light perception in 58%.

Retinal findings include telangiectasia, fusiform aneurysms, and intraretinal exudation. There may beÂ sheathing of the vasculature.

Adult-onset Coats disease is characterized by systemic associations (usually hypertension), incidental detection, involvement of less than six clock hours of the retina, a benign natural course of the disease, and usually better visual outcomes compared to childhood-onset Coats disease.
