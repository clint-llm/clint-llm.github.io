**Influence of Empathy on the healthcare team and delivery**

A healthcare professional has to bring empathy to the table when they are dealing with a patient as it helps them to comprehend the emotional and the cognitive state of the patient involved. This connection can help healthcare professionals to build a therapeutic relationship with the patients that can eventually lead to better health outcomes. This influence is not only determined by the words chosen but also by facial expressions, body language, and vocalization. The emotional and cognitive connection is invaluable in the current day healthcare delivery to achieve the best patient-provider relationship.

As empathetic behavior by providers gets modulated by motivation, health care providers should also have empathicÂ support from their institutions to deliver the same high-quality care for the patients.
