The Achilles reflex can be elicited using reflex hammers. Modern-day reflex hammers are available in four styles: Taylor hammer, Queen Square hammer, Babinski hammer, and the Troemner hammer. However, no study has shown any hammer to be superior to the next; selection is based purely on preference and tradition of the institution. A practitioner holds a standard reflex hammer by the handle in a firm manner, typically with their dominant thumb and forefinger holding most of the weight with the flat part of the top toward the patient’s Achilles tendon area. Other, larger, and more advanced reflex hammers, like a pendulum hammer, can also be used to assess the Achilles reflex.
