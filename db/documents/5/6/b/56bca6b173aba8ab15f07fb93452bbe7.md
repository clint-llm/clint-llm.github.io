Patients with rheumatic diseases like Sjogren syndrome, mixed connective tissue diseases, mixed cryoglobulinemia, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have elevated RFs. They are also frequently found to be elevated in some non-rheumatic diseases, especially chronic infections like hepatitis C, tuberculosis, and subacute infective endocarditis. Sarcoidosis and malignancies like primary sclerosing cholangitis also have RF elevation. It is not certain how a subset of chronic infections and inflammatory diseases lead to the production of increased RF. One explanation is the chronic and persistent stimulation of the immune system by these disorders leading to a state of chronic inflammation. Successful treatment of the underlying disorder frequently leads to the disappearance of these autoantibodies. Hepatitis C could have a veryÂ high level of RFs (as high as 76%).

RFs can also interfere with other laboratory tests, including anticardiolipin antibodies, anti-HCV antibodies, antirubella antibodies, thyroid assay, and other tests for various cytokines.
