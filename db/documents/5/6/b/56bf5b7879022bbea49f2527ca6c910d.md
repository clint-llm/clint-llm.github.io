Plasmablastic lymphoma is a very aggressive lymphoma that is very difficult to diagnose and treat. It requires an interprofessional team with a medical oncologist, infectious disease physician, pharmacist, and oncology nurse for treatment in the form of chemotherapy. It should also be noted that palliative care should also be involved as early as possible to help patients transition their care, if needed, to the hospice setting due to a veryÂ high rate of death with this lymphoma. It should be a goal to provide patient-centered care with all the teams involved to enhance outcomes and patient safety.
