Although the history and physical exam are not the primary sources for the diagnosis of prerenal kidney failure, they do aid in identifying the underlying cause of prerenal AKI. An intricate history may divulge a cause for volume loss such as sepsis, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, or bleeding. Also, reviewing medications can help in identifying a reason for AKI. For hospitalized patients, reviewing flowsheets for vitals, intra-operative reports, use of contrast in imaging, and monitoring for sepsis can all assist in finding potentially reversible cause for AKI. Reversible insults can also be identified in hospitalized patients by investigating the day at which the rise in creatinine occurred and looking for suspected causes. It is also important to remember that conditions which cause low flow/edematous states such as heart failure and cirrhosis, should also be investigated as potential culprits for AKI.
