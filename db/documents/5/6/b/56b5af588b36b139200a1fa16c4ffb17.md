If pupils are not large enough to allow light to enter into the eye, this will result in an absent red reflex. Performing the examination in a darkened room and starting with the smallest diameter beam of light setting on the ophthalmoscope are two techniques that can be used to help in this condition.Â Topical medications to dilate the pupil, such as tropicamide, cyclopentolate hydrochloride, and phenylephrine, can also be used.

The validity of the red reflex examination has been the object of extensive study in the literature with varying results.
