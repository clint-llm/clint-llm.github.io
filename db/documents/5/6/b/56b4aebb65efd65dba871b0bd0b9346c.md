Apocrine glands can result in distinctive clinical pathology, dependent upon the location of the glands. Primary disorders of apocrine glands include apocrine bromhidrosis, which refers to excessive body odor arising from the secretions of the apocrine glands. This most commonly occurs in the axillae but may occur from secretions of the apocrine glands in the genitals or the plantar aspect of the feet. The second primary disorder of the apocrine glands, apocrine chromhidrosis, is a rare disorder in which the apocrine glands secrete colored apocrine sweat. This is generally found in the axillary and facial apocrine glands but can be seen in the areola apocrine glands. Two secondary disorders of the apocrine glands include Fox-Fordyce disease and hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa). In these disorders, apocrine glands are secondarily affected.

Apocrine glands in the mammary region can also transform to apocrine carcinoma, a rare form of female breast cancer with an incidence of 0.5% to 4%.

Finally, apocrine metaplasia can occur, in which non-apocrine cells transform to apocrine phenotype. This is most commonly seen in the breast as fibrocystic change and is a benign lesion of the breast, with no increased risk for breast cancer.
