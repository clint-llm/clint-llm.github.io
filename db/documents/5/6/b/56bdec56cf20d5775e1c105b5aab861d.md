Camper's fascia serves as a protector and an insulator to the deep, vital organs of the abdomen. The function of the fatty layer is to absorb impact and dissipate forces across a large surface area to reduce the amount of impact that is transmitted internally. The adipose tissue also acts as insulation to help maintain a constant temperature within the abdomen. Its thickness varies depending on one's body habitus.

As a part of the fascial layers of the abdomen, Camper's fascia serves a vital role by separating the skin from the muscles.
