A recent study found that decompressive hemicraniectomy in traumatic intracranial hypertension, even though having some minimal survival benefits, resulted in higher proportions of patients in vegetative states with higher disability compared to medical management.

ICP guided therapy encompasses the need for stringent optimization of ICP between 10 to 17 mm Hg for a favorable outcome in these subsets of patients.

However, to date, there is limited evidence to support the ICP guided therapy in improving the outcome in raised ICP.
