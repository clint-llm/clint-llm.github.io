The underlying etiology lies in the development of zonules during embryogenesis. The genetic mutations in the latent TGF ?-binding protein-2 (LTBP2) gene, ADAMTS17, FBN1 genes have also been implicated. The LTBP2 gene is present in the trabecular meshwork, ciliary processes, and lens capsule and has structural homology with fibrillin protein. This gene is responsible for elastic fiber assembly. ADAMTS17 and FBN1 genes are the primary genes implicated in Weill Marchesani syndrome.
