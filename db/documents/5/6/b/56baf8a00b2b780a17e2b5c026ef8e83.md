Neuraxial anesthesia is a beneficial anesthesia modality that has helped for a wide range of surgical procedures. It does come with risks of which healthcare providers need to be aware of. Patient selection is critical and should be driven by a careful history and physical examination. The indication for neuraxial anesthesia needs to match the surgical needs of the patient. After surgery, the post-op team needs to be aware of the procedure, and the patient needs to monitored by well-trained personnel.

The patient's hemodynamics requires monitoring in the immediate post-op period until the resolution of the anesthetic. Nurses and physicians from other fields managing the patient need to be aware of the nature of anesthesia that patient underwent.

Upon discharge home, the patient should be able to be contacted by personnel who performed the procedure, and the patient should receive a list of possible complications. The patient should be asked about headaches, backache, and checked for any neurological deficits post-procedure and return of bowel and bladder function. The patient should be reassured and evaluated regarding any complications that may have resulted. A visit to the anesthesia clinic and/or appropriate specialist is the recommendation in the event of any complications.
