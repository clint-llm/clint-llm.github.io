Adverse effects of daptomycin therapy include myopathy/rhabdomyolysis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and anaphylactic hypersensitivity reactions. Patients may also experience less severe adverse effects such as constipation, headache, insomnia, and skin rash.

Daptomycin is associated with an increased incidence of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. There have been cases reported in patients with and without acute renal failure. Therefore weekly monitoring of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels is recommended in patients receiving daptomycin therapy. More frequent monitoring is recommended in patients with renal impairment and/or those receiving concomitant HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). The clinicians should discontinue treatment in patients with signs and symptoms of myopathy in conjunction with an elevated CPK (greater than five times ULN or greater than 1000 units/L) and asymptomatic patients with a CPK elevation greater than ten times ULN (greater than 2000 units/L). The incidence of myopathy has been shown to increase with the administration of greater than the recommended dosage. Additionally, providers should consider temporarily discontinuing other agents associated with rhabdomyolysis (e.g., HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) during daptomycin therapy.

Daptomycin therapy is also associated with the development of eosinophilic pneumonia, which generally occurs 2 to 4 weeks after initiating therapy. Patients require monitoring for signs and symptoms of eosinophilic pneumonia, including new-onset or worsening fever and new infiltrate on chest imaging. Daptomycin therapy should immediately stop for patients who experience signs and symptoms of eosinophilic pneumonia, and they should receive appropriate treatment. It is important to note that the incidence of eosinophilic pneumonia may reoccur with re-exposure to daptomycin.

Rare cases of peripheral neuropathy have been observed in patients receiving daptomycin. Therefore, monitoring for new-onset or worsening neuropathy is recommended.

It is important to note that prolonged use of daptomycin can develop a superinfection such as Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis. The incidence of CDAD has been observed greater than two months after treatment with daptomycin.
