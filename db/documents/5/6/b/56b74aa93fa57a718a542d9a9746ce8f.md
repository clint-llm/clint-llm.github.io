**Muscle Energy Technique with the Patient in the Prone Position**

Physician position: Standing on the contralateral side of the dysfunction

Patient position: Lying prone

Technique:

- Place the cephalad hand on the posterior aspect of the patient's affected hip.

- Grasp the anterior portion of the thigh on the affected side, just proximal to the knee using the caudad hand.

- Extend the patient's hip until feeling the restrictive barrier.

- Continue to engage the restrictive barrier and instruct the patient to pull the anterior hip down towards the table for 3 to 5 seconds (isometric contraction).

- Instruct the patient to relax and move the hip further into extension until the restrictive barrier is again felt.

- Repeat the last two steps 3 to 5 times.

- After the last repetition, passively return the patient's leg to a neutral position.

- Reassess the somatic dysfunction.

**Muscle Energy Technique with the Patient in the Supine Position**

Physician position: Standing on the ipsilateral side of the dysfunction

Patient position: Lying supine with lower leg hanging off the end of the table

Technique:

- The patient flexes the contralateral hip and knee to hug the lower extremity to the chest.

- Using one hand to keep the contralateral leg flexed, the other hand will provide a downward force immediately proximal to the knee until reaching the restrictive barrier.

- Continue to engage the restrictive barrier and instruct the patient to bring the knee up toward the ceiling to achieve hip flexion for 3 to 5 seconds (isometric contraction).

- Instruct the patient to relax and move the hip further into extension by providing a downward force just proximal to the knee.

- Repeat the last two steps 3 to 5 times.

- After the last repetition, passively return the patient's leg to a neutral position.

- Reassess the somatic dysfunction.

Counterstrain:

Physician position: Standing on the ipsilateral side of the dysfunction

Patient position: Lying supine

- Identify the tender point within the iliopsoas muscle, which is often located just medial to the ASIS.

- Assess the pain level at the tender point. Keep a finger on the tender point for monitoring purposes.

- Passively bring both of the patient's hipsÂ into flexion and allow the lower legs to rest on the clinician's thigh, which is propped onto the treatment table.

- Cross the patient's ankles and allow the hips to rotate externally.

- Reassess the pain at the tenderpoint. Adjust the patient's position either with more hip flexion or external rotation to decrease the pain level by two-thirds.

- Hold the position for 90 seconds or until you feel the tender point softening beneath your finger.

- Passively return the patient to a neutral position.

- Reassess the tenderpoint.
