The majority of patients with an aortic arch aneurysm are asymptomatic or directly presents with life-threatening complications. Aneurysms are typically discovered incidentally on imaging ordered for other indications. Vague chest discomfort, neck, and jaw pain may occur with aneurysms involving the arch. A large-sized aneurysm can impinge upon the adjacent anatomical structures and exert a local mass effect including hoarseness, from left recurrent laryngeal nerve stretching; stridor, from tracheal or bronchial compression; cough, dyspnea, and recurrent pneumonitis, from lung compression; dysphagia, from oesophageal compression; and plethora and edema, from the compression of the superior vena cava.

The most serious consequence of TAA is aortic dissection or aortic rupture, which present as tearing, chest pain, and hypotension, respectively.

Other less frequent manifestations include systemic embolization as a result of atheroembolism and gastrointestinal hemorrhage secondary to the formation of an aortoesophageal fistula.
