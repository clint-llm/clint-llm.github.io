Since the etiology of CTK is uncertain, and reports exist of cases with no identifiable inciting factor, no definitive statements are possible about avoiding or decreasing the likelihood of developing CTK. However, the vast majority of cases are associated with excimer laser ablation and elective visual corrective surgery. Though these complications are rare, patients undergoing these surgeries should be made aware of the risks and potentially unfavorable outcomes associated with these procedures during the process of informed consent.
