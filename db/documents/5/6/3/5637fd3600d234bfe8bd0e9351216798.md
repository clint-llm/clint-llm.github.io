The complications of short stature are often more dramatic in women, preventing the individual from bearing and giving birth to a child. This can further aggravate the anguish in an already distressed individual. Other complications include the stunted growth of internal organs, causing a predilection to various diseases and conditions.

**Impact of short stature on psychology:**

Numerous studies have shown that stature helps determine the personality of a person. During the selection of partners for marriage, stature plays an important role. Tall statured individuals are mostly preferred. Despite this, short-statured individuals are always belittled by their peers and family, in schools, colleges, and in the workplace. They are often teased and bullied relentlessly, resulting in social isolation, and thus, are at high risk of having psychosocial distress, especially during their adolescence.
