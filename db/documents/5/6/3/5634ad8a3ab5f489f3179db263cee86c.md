The best way to approach malignant otitis externa is to follow the diagnostic criteria which have been described by Cohen and Friedman, and it included major (obligatory) and minor (occasional) criteria as follows:

**Major (Obligatory)**

- Pain, which is often out of proportion to physical examination

- Edema

- Exudate

- Granulations, which can be seen in the external auditory canal

- Microabscess (when operated)

- Positive bone scan technetium-99 (99Tc)

- Failure of local treatment often more than 1 week

**Minor (Occasional)**

- Diabetes

- Cranial nerve involvement

- Positive radiograph

- Debilitating condition

- Older age

All of the major criteria must be present to diagnose malignant otitis externa; minor criteria alone are not sufficient to make the diagnosis.

Cranial nerves examination should be done, as these are commonly affected.

- The facial (VII) nerve is most commonly affected

- The glossopharyngeal (IX) nerve

- The vagus (X) nerve

- The accessory (XI) nerve

- Rarely, the hypoglossal (XII) nerve

Mental state examination should be performed, and if the mental state is affected, this indicates intracranial complications.
