All major diving organizations require medical screening before a person may participate in SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) diving. The screening intervals vary depending on the country and the purpose of the diving (recreational versus commercial). In 2017, there were 67 SCUBA diving fatalities reported to the Diver’s Alert Network (DAN), and for the cases with cause reported, 15% were related to an underlying cardiac disease.
