# Definition/Introduction

Managed care refers to a healthcare insurance approach that integrates the financing of health care and the delivery of care and related services to keep the costs to the purchaser at a minimum while delivering what is appropriate for a given patient or population of patients.

Common to most definitions of managed care are several features or components such as:

- A limited network of providers (professionals such as physicians and organizations such as hospitals, imaging centers, pharmacies, and laboratories) who are each credentialed and contracted

- Utilization management

- Quality management

- Financial incentives for the patient to use network providers

- Some level of financial incentives or risk-sharing by the provider for the care provided

Managed care financial arrangements vary widely and occur along a continuum from retrospective fee for service payments at one end, all the way to prospective, full financial risk-type pre-payments for each member, so-called capitation, paid monthly, as a per member per month (PMPM) capitation rate.

The types of managed care insurance or benefit management approaches have evolved as well. Initially, managed care was synonymous with a health maintenance organization or HMO approach.

Over time, some less traditional HMOs emerged where the PCP does not serve as the gatekeeper, and the patient may self-referral to a specialist. However, for the service to be covered and paid for by the managed care plan, the patient is still limited to only receiving care and service from network providers. The utilization and quality management programs in HMOs collect a great deal of data related to the care and services authorized and provided by the PCP and other providers. This data is communicated to the PCP and other network providers regularly as the financial incentives revolve around compliance with the managed care plan’s utilization and quality programs’ targets. For the patients, the financial incentive to them is that they receive insurance coverage only for services that occur within the network.

Not all managed care occurs via an HMO type arrangement.

Finally, in this vein of patients wanting more choices available to them, a point of service (POS) managed care arrangement has emerged, which may appeal to more discretionary income patients. In a POS plan, the patient may use this managed care plan like a PPO and remain to limit their choices to only in-network providers and thus maximize their coverage. However, in a POS, the patient may choose to see a provider outside of the network, but to do so, it incurs more cost-sharing on the patient’s part. Thus, in a POS arrangement, the patient may practically see any provider they chose, either in-network or out-of-network. Still, if they stay within the PPO network, they pay the least, but they will share a higher portion of the care cost and pay more if they go outside the network.

# Issues of Concern

When discussing managed care, the overriding concern is the intermingling of the provider's finances with the amount and type of care they offer to the patient.

Another concern that emerges with managed care is the perception of lack of professional autonomy and the obligate burden or hassle factor that arises for the provider who must function in a more structured monitored environment and receive, analyze and act upon utilization and quality reports sent to them from the teams at the managed care plan.

As experience with managed care becomes established in the health care setting, a concern arises around the risk that patient access may be limited by providers gaming the system and cherry-picking or seeking to serve only patients in one’s practice that are likely to be healthier, more likely to need less care and service and thus who would make it easier to meet the utilization and quality targets.

This gaming or cherry-picking would then leave patients with chronic conditions or those with some level of medical complexity with less access to care because fewer providers would be available willing to see them in their practices. If this gaming occurs, those providers who are motivated to care for these patients with chronic conditions or with medical complexity would be at a financial disadvantage by merely doing the right thing and making themselves available to those most in need of healthcare. Recognizing this potential disincentive, managed care plans mitigate this potential by risk adjusting their measures and targets so that expected higher utilization that reflects appropriate care for a patient with a chronic condition is factored into the target setting. This risk adjustment provides accommodation to providers who take on the added responsibilities of caring for a more chronically affected patient population.

# Clinical Significance

Managed care was introduced with the idea to decrease the overspending on patient care and oversupply healthcare services.

Like any other industry, the health care industry has commercialized over the decades; thus, the cost-cutting has met with continued backlash. This has given rise to the managed competition, which offers the consumer full responsibility to choose the premium costs, overall health care coverage and adjust the care plan based on personal risk. This has helped create an incentive for the physicians to provide better care with controlled costs.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Nurses and clinical pharmacists are often the health professionals who work at the managed care plan and conduct the utilization and quality management functions. Nurses by way of training and clinical experience are often viewed as well suited to 1) collect the clinical information required for utilization and quality management activities, and 2) help providers interpret the clinical relevance and appropriateness of the information being shared back to the practice.

To help facilitate the resolution of some of the challenges associated with managed care and how it interacts with the providers delivering the care to the patients, the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy Professional Practice Committee determined nine concepts to strengthen the provider and pharmacist relationship. It will also improve patients' outcomes and mitigate the use of resources through utilization management criteria, keeping in mind patient safety with clinical decision-making through evidence-based review and providing transparent care to the patients without any roadblocks in the therapy and facilitating collaboration.
