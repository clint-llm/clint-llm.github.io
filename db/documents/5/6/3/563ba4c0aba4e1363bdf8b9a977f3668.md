Concurrent underlying dural tear with herniation of the brain elements egressing through the fracture site is the primary variable governing the development of LMC.

**Four essential prerequisites for the development of LMC include:**

- Skull fractures are sustained mostly below three years of age.

- There is an underlying dural tear.

- This leads to the interposition and continuum herniation of brain elements through the defect based on the ‘ball-valve’ mechanism, and

- There occurs progressive advancement of the fracture line.

**Phases described in the development of LMC include:**

- The first phase- includes skull fracture with an underlying dural tear.

- The second phase- includes healing of the fracture margins hindered by invagination and entrapment of arachnoids and governed by brain pulsation.

- The last phase- is characterized by bone diastasis alongside the leptomeningeal herniation.

**The progression of growing LMC has been described into three stages:**

- Stage 1- is from the time of ictus but before the onset of fracture enlargement.

- Stage 2- is the first two months of the beginning of fracture enlargement.

- Stage 3- is after two months of fracture enlargement.
