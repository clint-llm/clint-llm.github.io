In malaria, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine act as chemotherapeutic agents against erythrocytic forms of the Plasmodium parasites. Absorption of the drug increases the pH of the acidic food vacuoles of the parasite while it is inside the erythrocyte, which interferes with vesicle function and the development and asexual reproduction of the parasite.
