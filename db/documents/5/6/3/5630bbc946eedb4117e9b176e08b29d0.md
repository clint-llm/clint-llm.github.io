The measurement of accurate renal function is vital for the routine care of patients.

**Glomerular Filtration Rate**

The GFR in the measurement of volume filtered through the glomerular capillaries and into the Bowman’s capsule per unit of time.

GFR = [UrineX (mg/mL)] * urine flow (mL/min)/ [PlasmaX (mg/mL)], where X is a substance that is completely excreted.

**GFR approximation using Creatinine Clearance**

Creatinine is a breakdown product of dietary meat and creatine phosphate found in skeletal muscle. Its production in the body is dependent on muscle mass.

**Cockcroft-Gault formula: Estimated creatinine clearance rate (eCCR)**

Creatinine clearance can be estimated using serum creatinine levels. The Cockcroft-Gault (C-G) formula uses a patient’s weight (kg) and gender to predict CrCl (mg/dL).

eCCr = (140 – Age) x Mass (kg) x [0.85 if female] / 72 x [Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)]

**Formulas used in the prediction of GFR**

Formulas derived using variables that influence GFR can provide varying degrees of accuracy in estimating GFR. The widely used Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group (MDRD) employs four variables, including serum creatinine, age, ethnicity, and albumin levels.

Other formulas used for GFR calculations and their employed variables to estimate GFR include Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) formulas.

In current clinical practice, the use of creatinine derived from the KDIGO clinical practice guidelines recommend CKD-EPI formula for the estimation of GFR.
