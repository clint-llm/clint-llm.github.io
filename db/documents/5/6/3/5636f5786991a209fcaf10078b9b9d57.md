**A Word on Antimicrobial Stewardship**

In the United States, it has been reported that nearly half of the antibiotics prescribed were incorrect in some way, and almost one-third of antibiotics were deemed unnecessary in hospitalized patients.

Antibiotic therapy and accompanying stewardship require the effort of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes physicians (MDs and DOs), mid-level practitioners (NPs and PAs), pharmacists, and nursing staff. This includes only using these agents when clinically indicated, targeted therapy based on the susceptibility of the infectious organism, and monitoring of side effects and, where indicated,Â drug levels. Employing interprofessional strategies with open information sharing can improve therapeutic results with antibiotic therapy and minimize adverse events. [Level 5]
