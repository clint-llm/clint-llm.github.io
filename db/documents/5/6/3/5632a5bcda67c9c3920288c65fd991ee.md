Current issues of concern about dietary cholesterol include its well-known risk associated with the most common medical illnesses, and also concerns of constantly changing diet recommendations. The most important issue of concern regarding cholesterol intake is noncompliance within the general population. In spite of the well-documented correlation between high cholesterol diet and all-cause mortality from cardiovascular diseases through various studies for more than five decades, these diseases continue to be the prominent cause of morbidity and mortality. This fact clearly emphasizes the lack of adherence to the guidelines and the importance of the need for measures to improve not only awareness but also adherence to the food restrictions.  Historically it has been recommended to restrict overall fat intake, but the latest randomized control trials have emphasized modifying the quality of fat consumed and its food sources, not the overall fat intake. The recommended quality of fat intake is a diet that has low saturated fat, low trans fat, and rich in minimally processed fat. Foods that are rich in healthy fats, including nuts, avocados, seeds, and fish, should be encouraged.
