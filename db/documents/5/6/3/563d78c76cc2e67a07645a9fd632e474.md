HIV-2 is an enveloped retrovirus that causes infection in humans, similar to HIV-1. It is endemic to parts of West Africa, but globalization has led to worldwide spread. It is estimated that 1 to 2 million people live with HIV-2, and without treatment, infection invariably leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Given global interconnectedness and immigration from endemic regions, clinicians should become familiar with the differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection and maintain a high index of suspicion for HIV-2 in persons from high-risk regions. This activity outlines the epidemiology, evaluation, diagnostic testing, and treatment options for HIV-2 infection. It further reviews the role interprofessional teams play in improving outcomes for patients with HIV-2.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology/transmission dynamics of HIV-2.
- Identify the common pathophysiologic differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with HIV-2 and its distinguishing features.
- Summarize the main treatment strategies by interprofessional and identify key treatment differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2.
