The management of anal cancer requires an interprofessional discussion involving the physician subspecialties of radiology, pathology, radiation oncology, medical oncology, and surgical oncology to ensure proper diagnosis and staging as well as determine the optimal course of treatment. Also, the role of nurses, pharmacists, radiation therapists, physicists, and dosimetrists is crucial. Nurses help monitor patients during and after their treatment for pain, infection, and a variety of treatment-related complications. Pharmacists, including board-certified oncology pharmacists, dispense the recommended medications and chemotherapeutic agents in coordination with the oncology staff. Dosimetrists and physicists help the radiation oncologist develop a treatment plan delivered by the radiation therapist. Cancers of the lower GI tract require ample communication between all levels of health professionals working as an interprofessional team to improve outcomes and enhance patient safety.
