The primary survey is designed to assess and treat life-threatening injuries rapidly. The leading causes of death in trauma patients are airway obstruction, respiratory failure, hemorrhagic shock, and brain injury. Therefore, these are the areas targeted by the primary survey. Some injuries identified during a primary study include tension pneumothorax, open pneumothorax, airway obstruction, flail chest, massive internal or external hemorrhage, and cardiac tamponade. This activity reviews the steps, equipment, personnel, and techniques involved in performing the primary survey on trauma patients and also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for trauma patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the key systems evaluated in the primary survey of trauma patients.
- Explain how to perform the primary survey on trauma patients.
- Outline the steps involved in assessing airway patency, effective breathing, appropriate circulation, neurological dysfunction, and any other possible wounds. 
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for trauma patients undergoing the primary survey.
