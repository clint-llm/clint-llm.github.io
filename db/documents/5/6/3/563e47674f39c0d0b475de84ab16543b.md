Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures are largely a diagnosis of exclusion. Any paroxysmal event may simulate a seizure or PNES such as syncope, arrhythmia, and other spells. Movement disorders or sleep disorders may be in the differential diagnosis. Once otherÂ paroxysmal events are excluded, the distinction between epileptic seizures and PNES may remain a challenge. The differential diagnosis for PNES includes:

- Absence seizures

- Complex partial seizures

- Vertigo

- Syncope
