The initial mainstay of treatment is antibiotics to eradicate bacterial overgrowth and repletion of any nutritional deficiencies. Metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, amoxicillin-clavulanate, neomycin, and rifaximin are antibiotics used in the treatment, with rifaximin being the most investigated.

Approximately 45 percent of patients will have recurrent SIBO following completion of antibiotic therapy, with recurrence rates higher in older adults, post-appendectomy, and chronic use of proton pump inhibitors.

An elemental diet can be used in cases where patients cannot tolerate antibiotics or fail to respond to antibiotic treatment (after two times). Limited observational studies suggest remission induction of SIBO symptoms, but poor palatability and high cost limit their use. In an observational study, 80% of patients attained remission (normalization of breath tests and resolution of symptoms) within two weeks.

Treating the underlying cause will help in the prevention of recurrent symptoms. Antibiotic prophylaxis (5-10 days every two weeks or monthly) should be reserved for patients with>4 episodes in a year. Antibiotics are generally rotated over two to three months. SIBO-associated colitis and ileitis usually should resolve with SIBO treatment. If severe symptoms persist, they should be evaluated for IBD. If symptoms are not improved following two courses of treatment, the clinician should consider alternative diagnoses.

Probiotics, low fermentable oligo, di, and monosaccharide (FODMAP) diet, and statins have no apparent role in the management of SIBO.
