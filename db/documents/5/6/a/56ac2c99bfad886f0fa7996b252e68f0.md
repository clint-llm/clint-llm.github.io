The visual prognosis of toxic and nutritional optic neuropathy is variable and is dependent on the cause and severity of the initial optic nerve insult. One systematic review found that in patients with B12 deficiency optic neuropathy, there was improved visual acuity after oral B12 supplementation in greater than 50% of patients with the diagnosis. However, a small percentage of patients progressed to blindness.

Methanol-induced toxic optic neuropathy shows resolution of visual disturbances in two to three weeks after intoxication in most patients. However, around a third or more of patients develop permanent visual defects.
