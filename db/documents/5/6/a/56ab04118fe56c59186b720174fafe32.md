Varicose veins arising from chronic venous disease is a highly prevalent disease that contributes to significant pain, debility, and quality of life reduction. Many patients will suffer from this disease and not seek treatment due to a lack of awareness. Educating the interprofessional team in the classification of chronic venous disease and indications for treatment can help motivate referrals for patients to seek treatment with a specialist, who can provide a plethora of options including endovascular ablation, which is a minimally invasive, same-dayÂ procedure that has been proven to deliver consistent results with minimal complications. It is important to be aware that this is a chronic disease, and the procedure is by no means a cure. However, the physiologic and psychological benefits to the patient cannot be understated.
