The exact pathophysiology of anetoderma is not certain. In all types of anetoderma, there is a decrease in elastic tissue hypothesized to be from a decrease in the production of elastin, an increase in elastin degradation through an increase in elastolytic enzymes, a decrease in elastolytic enzyme inhibitors, or increased elastin phagocytosis. In penicillamine drug-induced anetoderma, aldol cross-linking is inhibited, which does not allow elastic fibers to develop normally. It has been hypothesized in anetoderma of prematurity that tissue hypoxia secondary to adhesive medical devices causes degradation of elastin by producing an increase in the expression of matrix metalloproteinases.
