**Paranasal Sinuses**

The ethmoidal and maxillary paranasal sinuses are very small in size but present at birth, while the sphenoid and frontal are both absent. The frontal sinus begins to form as early as 2-years old, but are nonidentifiable by radiology until around 6-years old.

**Dural Venous Sinuses**

The dural venous sinuses are present in a rudimentary form during infancy. They develop their adult shape in the months following birth. The primitive venous sinuses are plexiform and can quickly change due to the rapid growth of the cerebrum.
