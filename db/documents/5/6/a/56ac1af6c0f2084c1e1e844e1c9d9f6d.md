Medication dose adjustments according to the severity of toxic reactions may be necessary.

The standard dose is 960 mg twice daily and could be reduced to 720 mg twice daily if toxicity occurs for the first time. Further dose reduction is required if toxicity recurs for the second time and with high-grade toxicity, with recommendations to reduce the dose to 480 mg twice daily and doses less than that are therapeutically inactive.
