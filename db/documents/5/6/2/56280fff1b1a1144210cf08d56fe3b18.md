The carpal tunnel is a defined space with a bony canal containing nine tendons (flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicis longus) and the median nerve. The carpal bones border the dorsal surface, and the volar surface is the transverse carpal ligament (flexor retinaculum). Sensory branches of the median nerve supply innervation to the first three and a half fingers.

- Prolonged compression can cause nerve injury through demyelination.

- Injury to the nerve through persistent scarring of the outer layer (mesoneurium) leads to fibrosis.

- Abnormalities in synovial tissue increase the canal's volume and cause pressure over the median nerve.

- Inflammation results from increased expression of prostaglandin E2 and vascular endothelial growth factor.
