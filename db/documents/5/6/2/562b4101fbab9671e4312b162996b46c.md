Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is a rare primary cutaneous lymphoma that mimics panniculitis and is composed of cytotoxic alpha-beta T-cells. Distinction from the more aggressive primary cutaneous gamma delta T-cell lymphoma was made in the 2008 revision of the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. Autoimmune diseases occur in approximately 20 percent of cases, and lupus erythematosus panniculitis (LEP) is usually on the differential diagnosis due to its similar clinical and histologic features. This activity reviews how to properly evaluate for subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma and further steps that should be taken when this disease is present. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presenting features of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. 
- Describe the evaluation of subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. 
- Explain how to manage subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. 
- Summarize the critical role of the interprofessional team in the detection, evaluation, and management of patients with subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma.
