Standard microsurgical and endovascular equipment is required for this procedure. This procedure can be safely performed in the endovascular suite with proper anesthesia support. It is important to have a surgical headlight, together with the appropriate orbital surgical instruments which allow proper orbital exposure (Sewell retractors, ribbon retractors) and long bayonet forceps and bipolar cautery forceps to allow easy access to any bleeders deep within the orbit. Neurosurgical cottonoids are useful to separate the fat from the vessels. Muscle hooks are useful to lift the SOV gently while ligation bands or sutures are applied. As the surgeon will be operating with limited mobility because of the radiology machinery, a good assistant is very useful. As these procedures are performed infrequently, we give a list of the necessary surgical instruments to the interventional radiology department.
