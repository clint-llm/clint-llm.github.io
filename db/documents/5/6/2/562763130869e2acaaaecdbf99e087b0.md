Ureteroscopy is best performed by an experienced team. Proper ureteroscopy takes time for patient positioning, instruments and accessories to be used.  The radiology tech and surgeon should communicate clearly about the use of live or static images as well as how to move the fields and which terms to use.  The initial strategy and plan should be discussed with staff immediately before starting the procedure so all personnel involved understanding what is being done. Close cooperation between the surgical assistants, nursing staff, and surgeon ensures better outcomes and more efficient, safer ureteroscopies.
