A well-functioning long arm splint requires care when obtaining the appropriateÂ supplies. The practitioner can choose between plaster and fiberglass for splinting material. The benefit of plaster as a splint medium is that it conforms more precisely to the patient's anatomy; however, it lacks fatigue strength compared to fiberglass. On the other hand, fiberglass is more durable with higher fatigue resistance; however, it is more difficult to mold and does not mold to a patient's anatomy as closely. Also, fiberglass application often requires the tighter application of a compressive dressing which can cause discomfort to patients if it is not loosened. Of note, fiberglass provides a more consistent appearance on X-ray than plaster, making fractures potentially easier to visualize.
