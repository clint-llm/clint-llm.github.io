The gene SLC39A4 on chromosome 8q24.3 codes for the zinc-ligand binding protein ZIP 4, zinc or iron-regulated transporter-like protein. It is a histidine-rich transmembrane protein that works as a zinc uptake protein to transport zinc ions from the cell exterior or lumen into the cytoplasm, where they are available for other proteins. Therefore, the autosomal recessive mutation in this particular gene results in defective zinc absorption, and consequently, the affected individuals manifest signs of zinc deficiency. Another mutation has been reported in mothers in SLC30A2 gene on chromosome 1p36.11 and results in decreased secretion of zinc into breast milk.
