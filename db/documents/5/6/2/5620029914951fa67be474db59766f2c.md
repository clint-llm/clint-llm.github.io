A pulmonary rehabilitation program is a multi-disciplinary team-based intervention. It involves the input of various professionals who work towards a common goal, and studies have shown that working as a team helps improve outcomes.

The initial assessment and plan take into account the input of a provider from a clinical standpoint. An exercise physiologist working with a physical therapist helps plan the exercise program. Respiratory therapists help with patients’ underlying lung disease and breathing techniques to provide symptom relief.

Psychiatrists and psychologists' assessment before, during, and after is important as depression, anxiety and mental health issues associated with chronic diseases need to be addressed concurrently. Social workers help with addressing issues at home and social hindrances in achieving the ultimate goal of delivering high-quality care. No intervention is successful without a proper follow-up, appropriate medication reconciliation, and education which is imparted by a nursing team.

Many of the professionals in the team are not locked in their roles. Working in a team, they can identify and often fill in the roles of other team members. In a system with so many moving parts, communication is the key. Roadblocks in each step or intervention have to be discussed with other members of the team as it helps in problem-solving and customizing it to patients' needs. Periodic meetings are beneficial to discuss the progress and modifications needed.
