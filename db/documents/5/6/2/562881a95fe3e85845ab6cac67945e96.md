SON has numerous well recognized predisposing factors that can be categorized into direct causes, including sickle cell disease, myeloproliferative disorders, and Gaucher's disease, and indirect causes such as alcohol, obesity, and corticosteroid use. Alcohol abuse and steroid usage are seen in over 90% of cases of SON.

This theory has been extended to several risk factors like Gaucher's disease (glycogen storage disease), dysbaric disorders, and some myeloproliferative disorders.
