Bancroftian filariasis, accounting for 90% of the lymphatic filariasis cases, is one of the most common etiology of acquired lymphedema. It is the second leading infectious cause of disability worldwide after leprosy.

In filariasis, there is chronic inflammation of the lymphatics, leading to fibrosis, which eventually leads to lymphedema. While the legs are involved in most cases, the lymphedema can also involve the genitals, arms, and breasts.
