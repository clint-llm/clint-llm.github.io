In the United States, approximately 800,000 individuals per year experience a stroke. Of these, about 85% are ischemic. Among all ischemic infarctions, 20% affected the posterior circulation. The most common posterior circulation stroke is lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg), which arises as a result of occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery or more commonly the vertebral artery. Central vertigo is the most predominant symptom.Â Men tend to experience cerebrovascular disease more frequently than women, at a rate of about 2:1. Multiple sclerosis, on the other hand, affects three times as many women as men.

Additional causes of vertigo include multiple sclerosis, which has an incidence of approximately 10 to 80 cases per 100,000 individuals in the United States per year.

Migraine occurs in 12% of the adult population (6% men and 18% women). Vertigo as a presentation of migraine is not uncommon, yet the actual incidence is unknown due to differences among physicians in their diagnosis. It is probably more commonly diagnosed in ENT practice versus internal medicine practice. These patients usually present with recurrent vertigo lasting for a few hours without any other ENT symptoms nor focal neurological signs or symptoms. Neuroimaging studies are generally normal. The diagnosis is often made when other causes of vertigo were ruled out.
