The diagnosis and management of facet joint arthritis is managed by an interprofessional team that includes an emergency department physician, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, orthopedic surgeon, physical therapist and a pain specialist. There are many treatments for the disorder but conservative treatment should be the first step.

Physical therapy includes education of proper posture and restoration ofÂ correct body mechanics. Positions such as excessive extension or extension with rotation should be avoided. Strengthening of deep neck flexors and abdominal muscles can help to balance the overactivated extensors of neck and back. Most patients will benefit from NSAIDs.

Other therapies include spinal manipulation, joint injections, and nerve blocks. Overall, most patients do obtain short term relief from symptoms but if the lifestyle is not altered, recurrence of symptoms is common.
