Buspirone is an anxiolytic drug. Originally, the drug was developed as an antipsychotic but was found ineffective for psychosis, but it had useful anxiolytic features. Buspirone has recently come into favor, primarily due to its decreased side-effect profile compared to other anxiolytic treatments. Buspirone is primarily used to treat generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). It is an FDA-approved medicine for managing anxiety disorders or the short-term relief of anxiety symptoms. Off-labeled buspirone is used for the augmentation of unipolar depression. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of buspirone, pertinent for interprofessional team members for treating patients where buspirone is indicated.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of buspirone.
- Outline the indications for initiating buspirone.
- Summarize the contraindications associated with initiating buspirone.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the use of buspirone and improve outcomes in disorders where indicated.
