This activity reviews the clinical presentation, etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, differential diagnosis, treatment and management, prognosis, and complications of PRES. This article also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and treating PRES promptly to improve patient safety, quality of care, and outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the symptoms and risk factors of PRES to initiate prompt evaluation and treatment.
- Summarize potential emergent conditions that emulate PRES, and outline the evaluation of such diseases to improve patient outcomes.
- Outline a few treatment considerations for people with PRES.
- Explain the importance of education and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the care, safety, and outcomes of patients with PRES.
