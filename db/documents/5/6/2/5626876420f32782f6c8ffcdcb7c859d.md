According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 422 million people with DM globally. As the prevalence of LADA in a population of T2 DM is between 4 and 12 percent depending on the population, between 17 to 50 million will have LADA. This number is likely to grow exponentially in the coming years.

The primary care practitioner (PCP) is very likely to encounter patients with LADA frequently and should be equipped with the knowledge and understanding to recognize and manage this condition promptly.

The endocrinologist sees difficult and complex patients and coordinates care with the PCP, ophthalmologist, podiatrist, and geneticist.

Laboratory medicine advises on the appropriateness of tests, performs biochemical and serological tests, and communicates them to the treating physician on time.

Bariatric surgeons must have a high index of suspicion for LADA in the obese with diabetes and counsel them regarding the less than optimal glycemic control post-surgery.

A coordinated effort by all the above health care providers is needed to achieve good glycemic control, prevent or delay complications, and substantially reduce morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. [Level 3]
