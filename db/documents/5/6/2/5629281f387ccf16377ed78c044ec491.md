The diagnosis of BWS is established based on clinical criteria and may be confirmed by molecular/cytogenetic testing. However, given the heterogeneous presentation of this disorder, no consensus exists, and most experts agree that these criteria should not replace clinical judgment on a case-by-case basis. In the same line, negative diagnostic testing cannot rule out BWS.

**Clinical Diagnosis**

There are several published diagnosis criteria for BWS.

**Major Findings**

- Abdominal wall defect: omphalocele or umbilical hernia

- Macroglossia

- Neonatal macrosomia (birth weight more than 90 percentile)

- Postnatal overgrowth (height/length more than 90 percentile)

- Embryonal tumors (Wilms tumor, hepatoblastoma, adrenal tumors, neuroblastoma)

- Outer ear malformations (anterior ear creases, posterior helical pits)

- Visceromegaly

- Cytomegaly of the adrenal fetal cortex

- Hemihypertrophy

- Anomalies of the kidney and ureter (e.g., medullary dysplasia, nephrocalcinosis, medullary sponge kidney, and nephromegaly)

- Positive family history of BWS

- Cleft palate

**Minor Findings**

- Polyhydramnios

- Enlarged placenta, placental mesenchymal dysplasia

- Thickened umbilical cord

- Prematurity

- Neonatal hypoglycemia

- Nevus flammeus at the glabella

- Distinctive facies

- Cardiomegaly, cardiac anomalies, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

- Diastasis recti

- Polydactyly

- Supernumerary nipples

- Advanced bone age

Novel diagnostic criteria consider the predictive value of each BWS feature. Brioude et al. (2018) proposed a clinical scoring system based on cardinal features (macroglossia, omphalocele, lateralized overgrowth, bilateral Wilms tumor, hyperinsulinism, adrenal cytomegaly or placental mesenchymal dysplasia) and suggestive features (birth weight greater than two standard deviations above the mean, facial nevus simplex, polyhydramnios or placentomegaly, ear creases or pits, transient hypoglycemia, embryonal tumors, nephromegaly or hepatomegaly, and umbilical hernia or diastasis recti). The scoring consist of adding 2 points for each cardinal feature present, and 1 point for each suggestive feature. A total score of 4 or more would confirm a diagnosis of BWS even without the need for testing. A score of 2 or 3 would warrant genetic testing. Finally, a score of less than two would not meet the criteria for testing.

**Molecular Diagnosis**

As previously stated, given the wide variety of molecular aberrations that are behind the etiology of BWS, as well as the mosaicism affecting different tissues in the same individual, the molecular diagnosis of this condition requires a multistep approach, and a negative test cannot exclude the diagnosis. Testing is usually performed on DNA derived from blood-leukocytes; however, samples from buccal swabs, skin fibroblasts, or mesenchymal-derived cells from surgical resections and/or excisions of hyperplastic tissues, could be used to improve the detection. Different testing approaches have been recommended. The most widely used tests are the following:

- Methylation analysis: consider first-line testing since methylation alteration could be detected in most cases of BWS with known molecular etiology. Further studies such as copy number variant (CNV) testing might be needed to determine the exact molecular mechanism.

- Sequencing analysis, or gene-targeted sequencing: test to be considered if methylation analysis is negative. Useful in the detection of pathogenic variants of genes in the 11p.15 region, specially CDKN1C mutations.

- Chromosomal microarray, SNP array, or microsatellite analysis: could detect microdeletions, microduplications, or length of paternal uniparental disomy region of chromosome 11.

- Karyotype or FISH: could detect chromosomal defects associated with BWS such as duplication, inversion, or translocation of 11p15.5.

**Prenatal Diagnosis**

If there is a positive family history of BWS or the presence of prenatal features, genetic counseling is warranted, and testing could be offered. Methylation analysis and CDKN1C sequencing are the preferred diagnostic tests in these situations. Regardless of any positive or negative result, postnatal testing is needed for confirmation.
