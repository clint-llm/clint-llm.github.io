Phthiriasis palpebrarum, also called phthiriasis ciliaris or ciliary phthiriasis, is an ectoparasitosis of the eyelashes because of an infestation with Phthirus pubis, also known as pubic louse or crab louse. Phthirus pubis is primarily transmitted through sexual intercourse or interactions between an infested parent and their child. Indirect transmission through clothes or towels contaminated with nits is less common and whether or not it is a plausible mode of transmission is a subject of debate. This activity describes the risk factors, evaluation, and management of phthiriasis palpebrarum and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care delivery for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain when phthiriasis palpebrarum should be suspected.
- Describe how to evaluate for phthiriasis palpebrarum.
- Outline the treatment of phthiriasis palpebrarum.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of phthiriasis palpebrarum and optimize outcomes.
