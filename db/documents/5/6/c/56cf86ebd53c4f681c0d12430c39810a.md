For patients with the suspected peripheral arterial disease on history and physical exam, noninvasive imaging (ABI with PPG, toe pressureÂ with PVR) is a reasonable next step for further evaluation before the contrast-enhanced scan or more invasive treatment. Continuous-wave Doppler is a quick, facile bedside adjunct to assess blood flow within a vessel.
