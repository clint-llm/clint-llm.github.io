Three different glands within the eyelid are implicated in the pathogenesis of hordeolum when they become infected by S. aureus. Infection of Zeis and Moll glands (ciliary glands) causes pain and swelling at the base of the eyelash with localized abscess formation. Termed external hordeolum, these produce the typical appearance of a stye with a localized pustule of the eyelid margin. The meibomian glands are modified sebaceous glands that are found in the tarsal plate of the eyelids. They produce an oily layer on the surface of the eye that helps to maintain proper lubrication of the eye. When a meibomian gland becomes acutely infected, it results in an internal hordeolum. Due to its deeper position within the eyelid, internal hordeola have a less defined appearance than external hordeolum.

Chalazia occur secondary to mechanical obstruction and dysfunction of the meibomian gland with subsequent stasis and blockage of the release of sebum. This condition tends to be subacute to chronic and presents with a painless nodule within the eyelid or at the lid margin.
