Colorectal malignancies are considered the third most common cancer for both male and female individuals. Moreover, they are the second most common cause of malignancy-related mortalities in the United States. Rectal microsurgery is an emerging technique that offers an oncologic cure without compromising bowel function. As the repertoire of rectal surgery expands, a good overall understanding of new procedures and platforms is needed to ensure optimal patient selection. This activity reviews the indications, techniques, platforms, and complications of rectal microsurgery and the role of the interprofessional team in the workup and postoperative care of these patients.
