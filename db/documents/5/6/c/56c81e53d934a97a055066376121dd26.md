Chronic inflammatory conditions predispose the biliary tract epithelium to modify under stress and undergo transformation that give rise to the cancer of the biliary tract. The most established chronic inflammatory condition associated with biliary tract cancer is primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), which is associated with chronic inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis. Besides primary sclerosing cholangitis, other conditions that carries a high risk for the development of cholangiocarcinoma by causing chronic inflammation and cholestasis are colonization with liver flukes such as Clonorchis sinensis (endemic in southern China, Hong Kong, and Korea) or Opisthorchis viverrini (endemic in north-eastern Thailand, western Malaysia, and Laos), hepatolithiasis, chronic infection withand some congenital biliary tract malformations (e.g. caroli’s disease, choledochal cysts) are also associated with the risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma.
