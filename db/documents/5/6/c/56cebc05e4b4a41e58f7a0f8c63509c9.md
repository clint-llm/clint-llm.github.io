The main differential diagnosis of PS is other craniosynostosis syndromes. These include:

- Apert syndrome

- Crouzon syndrome

- Muenke syndrome

- Saethre-Chotzen syndrome

- Jackson-Weiss syndrome

- Antley-Bixler syndrome

PS is closely related to Apert syndrome, but they are genetically distinct, and Apert does not have the cloverleaf skull or proptosis seen in PS. Crouzon syndrome lacks the extremity anomalies seen in PS. Phenotypic features of PS may overlap with Muenke syndrome, which is caused by a specific FGFR3 mutation. Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and Jackson-Weiss syndrome are the other differential diagnosis of PS since broad toes may be a common feature.

Antley-Bixler syndrome is a less common craniosynostosis syndrome, with some findings overlapping with PS type II. Antley-Bixler syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition associated with craniosynostosis (but not cloverleaf skull), radiohumeral synostosis (but not complete elbow ankylosis), femoral bowing, and various visceral anomalies. However, the visceral anomalies seen in the Antley-Bixler syndrome are usually genital.
