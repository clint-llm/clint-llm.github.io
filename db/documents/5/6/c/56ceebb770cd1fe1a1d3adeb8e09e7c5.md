The list of fascia and musculoskeletal systems diseases is extensive (i.e., frozen shoulder, Dupuytren contracture, hernias, compartment syndrome).

These pathologies are due to several etiologies:

- increased fascia stiffness caused by increased inflammation from overuse or trauma

- systemic disease

- genetic disorders

- a fascial defect or disruption in the fascia

- the tension produced within a body compartment

**Adhesive Capsulitis**

Patients with adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder) have restricted and painful movements at the shoulder joint. The pain is described as constant and severe, leading to decreased passive and active range of motion. Many etiologies have been described, including rotator cuff tears, biceps tendinopathy, and shoulder trauma.

**Dupuytren Contracture**

Dupuytren contracture is a progressive condition caused by the shortening and thickening of the fibrous tissue of the palmar fascia. This disease tends to affect men older than 40 years, those of Northern European descent, and individuals who smoke, drink alcohol, or have diabetes. Patients typically present with a small, pitted nodule (or multiple nodules) on the palm, which slowly progresses to finger contracture. The disease is caused by increased production of type III collagen by fibroblasts and myofibroblasts within the fascia. Patients typically have difficulty with daily tasks such as hair combing, face washing, and putting their hands in their pockets.

The disease regresses approximately 10 percent of patients without treatment or surgical intervention. Steroid injections into the nodule(s) have been shown to reduce the need for surgery. Surgical intervention should occur when the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint contractures exceed 40 degrees or when proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint contracture exceeds 20 degrees. Percutaneous needle aponeurotomy performed in-office may be an effective alternative to surgery in some cases.

**Hernias**

Hernias are a common condition caused by a defect or disruption in the fascia. This increased laxity within the fascial compartment leads to herniation of contents through the fascia. Hernias are classified based on where they occur throughout the body.

- Inguinal hernias

- Indirect

- Most common
- Passes through the inguinal canal
- Incomplete obliteration of the processus vaginalis during fetal development
- Lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels


- Direct

- An acquired condition caused by the weakening of the transversalis fascia
- Medial to the inferior epigastric vessels
- Passes through Hesselbach triangle
- Lateral to rectus abdominis muscle


- Femoral

- More common in females
- Intraabdominal contents herniate through the femoral ring into the femoral canal
- Inferior to the inguinal ligament, medial to the femoral vein, and lateral to the pubic tubercle

- Umbilical hernias

- Congenital umbilical hernia

- Failed spontaneous closure of the umbilical ring
- Protrusion through the umbilical orifice


- Acquired umbilical hernia

- Caused by persistently elevated intra-abdominal pressure
- Located adjacent to the umbilical orifice

- Incisional hernias

- Herniation of intraabdominal contents through weakened fascia caused by a previous surgery

**Compartment Syndrome**

Compartment syndrome is a common orthopedic and surgical emergency that involves increasing pressures within a compartment leading to local ischemia. The fascia surrounding a compartment provides tension that compresses the nearby structures. In trauma or other clinical scenarios, swelling within a compartment can occur, leading to increased intraluminal pressures. These pressures grow steadily and eventually become higher than the surrounding vasculature, reducing perfusion. The reduced perfusion leads to surrounding hypoxia, ultimately leading to the death of the muscles and nerves. An emergent fasciotomy is necessary to correct compartment syndrome to release the built-up pressure.

**Plantar Fasciopathy**

The origin of the plantar fascia occurs at the posteromedial calcaneal tuberosity, with its insertion occurring at each metatarsal head to form the longitudinal arch of the foot. Plantar fasciopathy is an overuse disorder resulting in degenerative changes at the calcaneal attachment. Histologic inspection of samples taken from patients undergoing plantar fascia release surgery shows myxoid degeneration with fragmentation and degeneration of the plantar fascia. Collectively, these findings support the premise that this condition is a degenerative fasciosis without inflammation, not fasciitis. Therefore, plantar fasciopathy is a more accurate descriptor of the condition. Risk factors for developing plantar fasciopathy include excessive running, obesity, and occupations associated with long periods of standing.

**Genetic Disorders**

Two specific genetic disorders associated with increased laxity of fascia include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome. Ehlers-Danlos is a group of connective tissue disorders characterized by defective collagen synthesis with symptoms including hyperextensible skin, tissue fragility, and joint hypermobility. Marfan syndrome is a connective tissue disorder of autosomal dominant inheritance that affects elastin and microfibrils in connective tissue throughout the body. These patients typically have tall stature with long extremities, joint hypermobility, subluxation of the eye lens, and are prone to cardiovascular disorders such as mitral valve prolapse, aortic aneurysm, and dissection.

Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis) is a well-known genetic disorder associated with increased rigidity of fascia. Systemic sclerosis is a disease of abnormal connective tissue growth, which leads to diffuse thickening and hardening of the skin and inner organs. Limited systemic sclerosis is associated with symptoms of CREST syndrome, including calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia.
