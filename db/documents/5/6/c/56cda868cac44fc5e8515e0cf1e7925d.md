Persistent truncus arteriosus (TA) is a rare, congenital, cyanotic heart defect characterized by a ventricular septal defect (VSD), a single truncal valve, and a common ventricular outflow tract (OT). Systemic venous blood and pulmonary venous blood mix at the VSD level, and the resulting desaturated blood is ejected into the single OT. Because the pulmonary arteries arise directly from the truncus, the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) will determine the pulmonary blood flow, which is usually torrential. This activity reviews the presentation, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of truncus arteriosus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with congenital heart disorders.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of truncus arteriosus.
- Recall the presentation of an infant with truncus arteriosus.
- List the treatment and management options available for truncus arteriosus.
- Employ interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in infants diagnosed with truncus arteriosus.
