- I-131 scan is an important imaging tool to aid the diagnosis and treatment of multiple thyroid disorders. Particularly pre-therapy and post-therapy scan in differentiated thyroid cancer patients allows surveillance of the disease and guide the clinician for the treatment plan.

- It is important for the surgeon to remove all thyroid tissue for thyroid cancer as leaving even a little bit of tissue will render the iodine treatment ineffective as it will all be taken up by the remnant thyroid tissue.
