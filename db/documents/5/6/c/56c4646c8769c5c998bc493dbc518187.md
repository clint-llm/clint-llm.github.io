Lymphangiomas are benign lesions that are difficult to diagnose and manage. These lesions are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pediatrician, surgeon, dermatologist, and the primary care provider. While the treatment of choice is surgical excision, this is not always possible. Recurrence rates in excess of 30% have been reported. In addition, surgery can be associated with complications like lymphatic leaks, fistula formation and chronicÂ wounds. These patients need a wound care nurse as the healing time is often many weeks or months. Parents should be educated about the treatment options because not all are effective or consistently effective.
