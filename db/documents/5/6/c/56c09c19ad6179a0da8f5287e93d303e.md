**Spinal Cord Injury**

Primary spinal cord injury occurs due to local spine deformation, such as direct compression. Secondary spinal cord injury occurs following primary injury and involves cascades of biochemical and cellular processes, including electrolyte disturbances, free radical damage, edema, ischemia, and inflammation.

**Developmental Anomalies**

Open neural tube defects occur when there is a failure of the neural tube to close. If the neural tube fails to close at the cranial end, the fetus may develop anencephaly. If the failure is at the caudal end, the fetus may have myelomeningocele or open spina bifida. Craniorachischisis can also occur if the entire neural tube remains open. Closed neural tube defects are skin-covered spinal cord developmental anomalies, such as occult spina bifida. Folic acid supplements may lower the risk of some neural tube defects. However, severe folate deficiency in mouse models has not been shown to lead to neural tube defects unless a genetic predisposition exists. Suggestions are that folate can overcome a genetic predisposition for adverse effects, potentially leading to neural tube defects.
