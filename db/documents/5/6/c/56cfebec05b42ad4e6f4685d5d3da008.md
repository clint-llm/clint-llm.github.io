The differential diagnosis of abdominal cramping accompanied by nausea and vomiting is overwhelmingly broad. It demands a finely detailed history to further tease out an etiology as well as directed treatments. In addition to infectious and neurologic causes of said symptoms, it is important to remember potential chemical causes responsible for clinical pictures featuring abdominal cramping, nausea, and vomiting.
