In terms of physical locations, areas experiencing the four seasons seem the most affected as fluctuations in light are more common. The condition is more prevalent in young adults, especially among females. The disparity in population seems to center around young adults with peak hormone production.

Individuals with a history of other mild cases of depression are more likely to contract SAD. A history of depression makes one’s body an easy target for hormonal imbalances and fluctuations. Therefore, any changes in the hormonal concentration of a particular hormone result in a vicious cycle of other hormonal imbalances leading to hormonal depressions.

Furthermore, the elderly can also suffer from SAD. The elderly tend to exhibit similar signs and symptoms resulting from reduced physical activity and exercise. However, changes in circadian rhythms and hormonal concentration seem to have little to no effect on SAD prevalence among the elderly.

Countries at higher altitudes experience SAD more than those at lower altitudes. Sweden experiences a significant SAD prevalence, commonly termed “winter depression.”
