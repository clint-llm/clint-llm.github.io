Most patients are asymptomatic and are usually identified on routine laboratory results. History should evaluate the condition that may have precipitated the thrombocytosis or complications of thrombocytosis:

- Prior trauma or surgery

- History of splenectomy or hemolysis

- Findings suggesting infection or inflammation

- History of bleeding (e.g., menorrhagia, gastrointestinal) or iron deficiency

- History of arterial or venous thrombosis

- Medications

- Smoking and alcohol consumption

- Prior diagnosis of a chronic hematologic disorder

- Unexplained fever, sweats, weight loss, fatigue, or other systemic complaints suggesting malignancy

No distinguishing features of secondary thrombocytosis (reactive thrombocytosis) are found on physical examination but should look for

- Cutaneous or mucosal bleeding/bruising

- Lymphadenopathy

- Hepatosplenomegaly

- Signs of arterial or venous thrombosis
