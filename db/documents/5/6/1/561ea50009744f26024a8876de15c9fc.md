In healthy individuals, the vocal folds are usually abducted during inspiration. This is followed by slight adduction during expiration, allowing air movement to and out of the lungs.

In inducible laryngeal obstruction or PVFM, there is brief inappropriate adduction of the vocal folds during inspiration. This may manifest with audible inspiratory sounds. This phenomenon is exacerbated during exercise. Supraglottic obstruction can also happen. The term ILO is more inclusive of supraglottic structures than older definitions that are limited to the vocal fold or glottic structures. The exact cause and underlying mechanisms of EILO are not well described. Several hypotheses attempt to describe the pathophysiology. Airway size, as well as a history of congenital laryngomalacia, were thought to be associated with EILO.
