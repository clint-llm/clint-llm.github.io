**Investigations**

**Radiographs**- It is important to obtain plain radiographs as part of the initial workup to rule out associated fractures and frank osseous defects such as bony Bankart, Hill-Sachs, glenoid fractures, coracoid fractures, and greater tuberosity fractures.

- Anteroposterior view (AP view)

- True AP view

- Axillary view

- Scapular Y view

- Acromial outlet view

Special views

- West point axillary view- Bony Bankart's lesion

- Stryker's notch view – Hill-Sachs lesion

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**

MRI with or without contrast is the gold standard investigation for soft tissue injuries such as glenoid labrum and capsuloligamentous injury. It also helps in planning the management of shoulder instability. MRI findings will be hemorrhagic effusion and capsulolabral elevation from the anterior and inferior glenoid rim in an acute Bankart injury. MRI in the abduction and External rotation has improved sensitivity (94%) and specificity (82%) for detecting Bankart lesions than the traditional neutral position. Presence of associated lesions such as Perthe's lesion, Anterior Labral Periosteal Sleeve Avulsion (ALPSA), Gleno-Labral Articular Disruption (GLAD), and Superior Labral tear from Anterior to Posterior (SLAP), and Humeral avulsion of Glenohumeral Ligament (HAGL) can be diagnosed on MRI.

**MR-arthrogram**is more specific and sensitive than MRI for detecting labral tears. The specificity and sensitivity are 96% and 93 %, respectively.

**Non- Contrast Computed Tomography (NCCT) with 3D reconstruction -**This investigation is very useful in quantifying the glenoid bone loss, the orientation of the articular surface, humeral bone loss, and the glenoid version.

Following are the indications for NCCT with 3D reconstruction

- Mid-range instability on clinical examination.

- Glenoid bone loss suspicion on the radiograph.

- Large Hill-Sachs.

- A very large number of shoulder dislocations.

- Identification of "On Track" and "Off Track" Hill-Sachs lesion.

Measurements of glenoid and humeral bone loss on 3D reconstruction

- GT = 83% (D – d)

- HSI = HS + BB

On Track = HSI < GT

Off Track = HSI > GT

**Abbreviations**

- GT - glenoid track.

- D – Diameter of inferior glenoid.

- d- Width of anterior glenoid bone loss.

- HSI- Hill-Sachs Interval.

- HS- width of Hill-Sachs lesion.

- BB- Width of Bone Bridge (distance of the lateral edge of Hill-Sachs from the medial edge of rotator cuff insertion).
