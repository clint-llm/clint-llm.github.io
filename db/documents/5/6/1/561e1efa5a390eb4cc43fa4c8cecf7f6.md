# Introduction

Dorsal nerve roots carry sensory neural signals to the central nervous system (CNS) from the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Anatomically, a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) emerges from the dorsal root of the spinal nerves. They carry sensory messages from various receptors (i.e., pain and temperature) at the periphery towards the central nervous system for a response. The role of DRG in chronic pain has been well established. The earliest technique of anesthetic infiltration of DRG was reported in 1949.

Over the last decade, the DRG is now recognized as a viable option for neuromodulation therapy; electrical stimulation of primary sensory neuron somata is also considered a viable option in treating chronic pain.

# Structure and Function

**Structure**

The DRG participates in sensory transduction and modulation, including pain transmission.

The axons of these neurons are bundled into roots/nerves that contain a mix of fibers with varied excitability, including low-threshold mechanosensory fibers, higher-threshold Aβ nociceptors, and Aδ fibers. Aβ, Aδ, and C fibers carry peripheral sensation information to their respective soma in the DRG. Myelinated Aδ fibers have a relatively high velocity to carry acute nociceptive details (temperature, mechanical, and chemical-induced) to the DRG. Unmyelinated C fibers have a smaller diameter and slower conduction velocity. They also carry nociceptive input to the DRG but contribute to the more diffuse and more profound secondary pain after an injury. In addition, DRGs have a large population of glial cells; each DRG has approximately eightfold more glia than neurons.

DRG neurons are pseudounipolar; a single axon projects from the cell body and bifurcates at the T-junction. The peripheral portion of the axon extends to receptor endings in the periphery and is responsible for afferent signaling. The central part of the axon extends into the central nervous system (CNS). It shows considerable axonal arborizations into the spinal cord, terminating in synapses at ipsilateral or contralateral wide dynamic range neurons, inhibitory interneuron networks, and other targets in the dorsal horn.

The 31 right and left spinal nerve pairs in humans form from afferent sensory dorsal axons (the dorsal root) and motor ventral efferent axons (the ventral root). The DRG is consistently positioned under the vertebral pedicle at the thoracic and lumbar levels. The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in asymptomatic subjects identifies the DRG in the foramen in 92% of L1, 98% of L2, 100% of L3, and L4, and 95% of L5, with the remainder of DRGs located in intraspinal or extraforaminal (lateral) regions.

**Function**

The role of peripheral sensory neurons is to conduct action potentials from peripheral sensory neurons to central terminals for transmission to the central nervous system. Action potentials are characterized by ionic currents across excitatory membranes. Sodium depolarization is followed by potassium repolarization and an increase in intracellular calcium, a second messenger for development, excitability, neurotransmitter release, gene expression, and cell death.

DRG neurons have specialized membrane properties and are separated from each other within ganglia. Each is encased in a layer of satellite glial cells with supporting functions. Almost all her DRG neurons undergo subthreshold excitation during the activation of other cell bodies. This is sometimes referred to as DRG "cross-depolarization" (or "cross-excitation"). Up to 90% of her DRG neurons depolarize when stimulation is applied to the axons of neighboring DRG neurons that share the same ganglion.

# Embryology

Along with the rest of the nervous system, the embryological onset of dorsal root ganglia occurs when the neural tube has formed, and neural crest cells arise at the margins of the neural tube. Neural crest cells differentiate into the peripheral nervous system components, the dorsal root ganglia. These neural crest cells migrate to various locations and differentiate into different cell types within the embryo. DRG cells develop at about four weeks post-conception from the neural crest migration and migrate ventrally immediately after.

During the seventh to eighth weeks, early bipolar neurons begin to appear. At about 11 weeks, unipolar neurons with a single broad process and well-developed organelles start to form. The onset of reflex responsiveness from the skin of the upper limb correlates with the appearance of (pseudo) unipolar neurons.

# Blood Supply and Lymphatics

**Arterial Supply**

The blood supply to the DRG is via two interconnected superficial and deep arterial plexuses. These plexuses arise from arteries descending from the radicular branches of the segmental arteries.

**Venous Supply**

Peri-ganglionic venous plexuses drain predominantly from the dorsal side of DRG into intervertebral veins.

# Nerves

DRG neurons are pseudo-unipolar neurons with a single axon that bifurcates into two separate branches, resulting in a distal and proximal process.

Dorsal root neurons make up the spinal nerves when conjoined with ventral root neurons.

# Physiologic Variants

Understanding the physiologic DRG variants in humans has been limited though there are several proposed rat models to explain phenomena. Variants in the voltage-gated ion channels: SCN9A, Na(v)1.7, and Troy are common sites of current DRG investigation in rats. Some variants considerably influenced the excitability of DRG neurons. For instance, the Na(v)1.7 variant 1739V was identified in some patients with autonomic dysfunction and neuropathic pain to impair slow inactivation within dorsal root ganglion neurons hyperexcitable.

# Surgical Considerations

The treatment of chronic pain has undergone many progressions since the introduction of the gate control theory. New treatment targets are continually identified, of which one is the dorsal root ganglion, a relatively novel neural target.

Several current methods exist to reduce neuropathic pain directed at the DRG. These include:

- Ablation or modulation of the DRG using continuous thermal radiofrequency

- Pulsed radiofrequency

- Electrical DRG neurostimulator technologies

- Modification of DRG cellular function using viral vectors and gene silencing

- Dorsal root ganglionectomy

Of these techniques, DRG radiofrequency ablation is the most common therapeutic choice in favor of its non-surgical, minimally invasive approach. It is also beneficial because it can target not easily accessible areas such as the low back and foot.

Studies have shown ganglionectomy, an irreversible neurosurgical technique, to be less effective in long-term pain reduction than radiofrequency and other neuromodulation techniques. While it can help treat dermatomal segmental pain, it can produce pain in other unwanted areas.

# Clinical Significance

**Role of DRG in Neuropathic Pain**

DRGs are involved in developing and maintaining neuropathic pain.

The functional consequence of these changes is the sensitization and hyperexcitability of DRG neurons, leading to neuropathic pain.

Normal DRG neurons generate sinusoidal oscillation patterns through voltage-sensitive mechanisms, which increase in frequency after nerve injury. When these oscillations reach a threshold, action potentials are generated. Upregulation of transmembrane sodium ion channels and increased sodium ion transport is thought to play a significant role in the increased oscillations and, thus, the ectopic discharge associated with chronic neuropathic pain.

Spontaneous action potentials are generated in the DRG after peripheral nerve injury and damage to the DRG. However, it does not occur in lesions proximal to the DRG.

**DRG as a Target in Neuromodulation of Pain**

DRG stimulation is a clinically effective intervention. First reported in 2013, DRG stimulation was an effective treatment for chronic, intractable trunk and extremity pain, reducing pain in an average of 70% of subjects in a 4-week feasibility study and reducing drug use.

Multiple reports have suggested stimulation of DRG is likely an ideal treatment for pain in areas such as the foot and the groin.

In a landmark randomized controlled trial of DRG stimulation vs. conventional SCS (the ACCURATE study), outcomes with DRG stimulation were statistically superior to those with SCS after three months of treatment, and pain relief and superiority were sustained through 12 months. Additionally, this trial demonstrated that DRG stimulation, compared with traditional tonic dorsal column SCS, provides greater specificity of stimulation for painful areas, less stimulation intensity with postural variation, and the ability to deliver paresthesia-free analgesia in some subjects.

Outcomes with DRG stimulation are often compared with those with spinal cord stimulation (SCS), a treatment modality that has rightly earned a place in advanced treatment when conservative medical management has failed.
