Instructors should conduct a complete orientation to the simulation environment at the start of each simulation session.

For learners who will participate in simulation as part of a larger training program (e.g., medical school, nursing school, medical residency), an initial orientation should ideally take place at the beginning of the program to lay the foundation for the many simulation sessions that will follow. Some educators may choose to record a video or provide reading materials to standardize the orientation process. However, these strategies should not replace a live prebriefing, as learners must receive an opportunity to voice their concerns and ask clarifying questions about the simulation experience.
