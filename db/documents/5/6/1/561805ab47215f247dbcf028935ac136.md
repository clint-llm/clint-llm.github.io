Adrenoleukodystrophy is a peroxisome disease that affects neonates ( N-ALD) or children and adult (X-ALD) with multiple organs involvement ( commonly; the central nervous system and the adrenal glands).

- Neonatal ALD inheritance is in an autosomal recessive pattern while X-ALD follows X linked recessive (male predominance)

- Clinical presentation of patients with ALD is variable, with neurological (hypotonia, weakness, developmental regression, cognitive disabilities, severe disabilities) and adrenal insufficiency (hypotension, fatigue, hypoglycemia) been the most common clinical manifestations.

- Diagnosis of ALD requires a detailed history and physical examination, measuring VLCFA levels, brain MRI, and specific genetic testing.

- Treatment for ALD with corticosteroid replacement therapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HCT) is limited for selected cases. No effective treatment exists for the majority of cases, and management is usually supportive.

- The prognosis of ALD is unfavorable and carries a high rate of mortality and severe disabilities.

- Clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate potential gene therapy for ALD.
