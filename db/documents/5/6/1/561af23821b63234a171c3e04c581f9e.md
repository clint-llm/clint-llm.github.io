Bacterial colonization of the bladder and ureter epithelium by S. saprophyticusÂ occurs via several different types of adhesins. These include hemagglutinins with autolytic and adhesive properties, as well as surface-associated lipase that forms fimbria-like surface appendages, helping the bacteria to maintain tight adherence to these surfaces.

It is suspected that the high survivability of S. saprophyticus inside the urinary tract is in part due to the adhesins anchored within the cell wall, allowing the organism to effectively adhere and colonize the uroepithelium, together with urease, which contributes to the persistent growth of the infection.

Some strains of S. saprophyticus have the ability to create biofilms, increasing their virulence, especially in patients with catheters. Once biofilms have been produced, antibiotic resistance is exacerbated. In these cases, S. Saprophyticus may be resistant to vancomycin and only effectively treated via linezolid.
