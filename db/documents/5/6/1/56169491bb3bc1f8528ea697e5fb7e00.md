Differential diagnosis of age-related infertility includes true sterility as well as other causes of infertility. It is recommended that female patients have their male counterparts tested via semen analysis as part of the infertility workup. Infertility can be attributed to a myriad of causes. These include a combination of many things, including environmental factors, male factor infertility determined by semen analysis, sexual dysfunction, genetic abnormalities, as well as ovulatory dysfunction, structural abnormalities, and unexplained infertility.
