Among the three ANCA-associated vasculitides, GPA is the most common. The annual worldwide incidence of GPA is estimated to be 10-20 cases per one million based upon the geographical location. A higher incidence is noted in the colder regions. The incidence in the United States is 3 per one million population. The incidence rate is noted to be higher in adults than in the pediatric age group. It has a peak incidence at 64Â to 75 years of age, and recent studies have shown no sex predilection.
