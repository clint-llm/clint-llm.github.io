Ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a wide complex tachycardia, defined as three or more consecutive beats at a rate of more than 100 per minute, arising from the ventricle.

On the basis of QRS morphology, VT is divided into monomorphic and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Monomorphic VT is characterized by a single, stable QRS morphology with no beat-to-beat variation, while polymorphic VT has beat-to-beat variation in QRS shape and multiple QRS morphologies.

Ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of ventricular tachycardia, and 5Â to 10% of patients with acute coronary syndrome are found to have ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular tachycardia in acute coronary syndrome is usually polymorphic, while monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is a sign of a myocardial scar.

Ventricular tachycardia is a major contributor to sudden cardiac death in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Ventricular tachycardia in cardiomyopathy is usually monomorphic due to scar-related reentry, and its degeneration into ventricular fibrillation may result in cardiac arrest or even sudden cardiac death.
