Although common in children and adults who have structural heart disease, SANRT is considered an uncommon tachyarrhythmia with very rare symptomatic presentations. In an electrophysiologic study on patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia incidence of SANRT was found to be within 2% to 17%. The exact prevalence of SANRT is difficult to determine both in the United States andÂ globally as patients with this arrhythmia do not usually have symptoms and therefore do not present for electrophysiology study. Also, since SANRT is very similar to sinus tachycardia on the electrocardiogram, it is underdiagnosed.
