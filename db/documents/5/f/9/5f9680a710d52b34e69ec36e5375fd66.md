The thoracic spine from T2 to T10 has increased stiffness due to intervertebral disks, coronal plane articulation of the facet joints, and articulation with the ribs, which in turn articulate with the sternum. The inherent kyphosis in the thoracic spine also concentrates the axial load on the anterior column improving rigidity. Therefore, fractures are generally less common. However, it is increasingly worrisome when they do occur since the mid-thoracic spine is a known vascular watershed area. During surgical exposure, extensive dissection and periosteal stripping should be avoided around the mid-thoracic region since even minor vascular insults can lead to cord ischemia.

The artery of Adamkiewicz is the only significant arterial supply feeding the anterior spinal artery along the lower thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spinal cord. This vessel is clinically relevant, as injury to this vital artery can occur during various procedures, most notably descending/thoracoabdominal aortic repairs. Injury to this artery can cause consequential neurologic damage manifesting as anterior spinal cord syndrome.
