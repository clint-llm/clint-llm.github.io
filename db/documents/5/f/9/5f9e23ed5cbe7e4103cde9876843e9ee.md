Radiation is a useful tool in the treatment of various cancers by damaging DNA and preventing cells from completing mitosis. Radiotherapy indiscriminately damages cells, whether they are malignant or normal, but has the most profound effects on rapidly dividing cells. As tumor cells may divide at a greater rate than non-tumor cells, they are preferentially affected; however, non-tumor cells with rapid turnover are at risk. The normal osteoclast/osteoblast activity of bone healing is undoubtedly affected and is one proposed cause of ORN. Squamous cells divide frequently and are therefore very radiosensitive, leading to the radiation-induced mucositis and dermatitis frequently observed. As there is a more robust and redundant blood supply to the skin and mucus membranes than bone and cartilage, the former tends to heal with time, while the latter may have a protracted or arrested healing course. Radiotherapy can additionally cause progressive endarteritis (damaging large- and medium-caliber vessels), as well as hindering the capillary regrowth present in normal healing. This subsequent reduction of tissue perfusion in areas exposed to radiation leads to the protracted open wounds of ORN.
