When possible, before initiating intubation and mechanical ventilation, the caregivers should make every effort to obtain the patient's wishes. Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) and DNR orders should be considered. Mechanical ventilation is a complex process and requires teamwork and interprofessional coordination. When possible, alert the receiving facility to be prepared to continue ventilation and ensure a smooth transition of care. EMTs should coordinate their activities with the rest of the interprofessional healthcare team and consult with clinicians if necessary. Interprofessional care coordination and open communication will help drive improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
