In hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, inherited mutations of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes responsible for the correction of DNA mismatches, such as base substitution mismatch and insertion-deletion mismatch, play a crucial role.

The identified distinct MMR genes include the following:

- hMLH1 on chromosome 3p22

- hMSH2 and hMSH6 on chromosome 2p16

- hPMS1 on chromosome 2q32 and hPMS2 on chromosome 7p22

- hMSH3 on chromosome 5q14.1

- EXO1 on chromosome 1q43.

Mutation of hMLH1, hMSH2, and hMSH6 genes account for almost 75-80% of HNPCC, while genes responsible for the remaining 20Â to 25% are still unknown.
