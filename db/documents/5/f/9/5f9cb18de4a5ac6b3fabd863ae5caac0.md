**Prevention**

Prophylactic ureteral stents/catheters can be placed prior to surgery to assist in intraoperative identification of ureters. This is often performed in surgeries that occur in close proximity to the ureter, such as gynecologic, rectosigmoid, and aortoiliac surgeries and particularly important if the operative field is scarred from previous dissection. It is debated whether stents actually prevent ureteral injury. In one review of 5729 colectomies, there was no difference seen for those who did versus did not undergo prophylactic ureteral stent placement.

**Treatment**

Several important principles are necessary for successful ureteral repair. It is important to debride all devitalized tissue. There must be sufficient ureteral mobilization to permit a tension-free anastomosis. It is important to preserve the ureteral adventitia and vasculature to ensure adequate ureteral blood supply. The ureteral ends should be spatulated. A water-tight, tension-free, mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis should be created over a ureteral stent using absorbable suture.

The choice of repair depends on the site of ureteral injury and timing of identification. If the injury is grade I-III, consider placing a ureteral stent and allowing the ureter to heal over the stent. If the injury is to the upper or middle ureter, consider direct ureteroureterostomy (UU) or transureteroureterostomy (TUU). If the injury is to the lower ureter, consider ureteral reimplantation (ureteroneocystostomy), psoas hitch, or boari flap.

**Surgical Repair**

UU is primary anastomosis of the injured ureter. This repair is most appropriate for short ureteral defects and is the preferred repair for the abdominal ureter when a tension-free anastomosis can be created.

TUU involves anastomosing the injured ureter to the contralateral ureter in an end-to-end fashion. The ureter is brought through a window in the colonic mesentery, cephalad to the inferior mesenteric artery. This method is useful when a psoas hitch or a Boari flap cannot be performed. It is very useful if there is extensive damage to the proximal ureter or the bladder is small or radiated.

Ureteral reimplantation (ureteroneocystostomy) involves reimplanting the ureter directly to the bladder and is useful for pelvic ureteral injuries. Psoas hitch and/or Boari flap are sometimes required to aid in reimplantation. A psoas hitch is a maneuver in which the bladder dome is pulled cephalad and sutured to the ipsilateral psoas tendon. The ureter is then reimplanted into the dome of the bladder. This may be required if there is injury to the distal ureter, and the distance is too far to create tension-free reimplantation of the ureter into the bladder. A Boari flap is a maneuver in which a flap of bladder is rotated cephalad and tubularized, and the ureter is reimplanted into the tubularized flap. Again, this is useful if there is injury to the distal ureter, creating too great of a distance between the viable ureter and the bladder.

Ureteropyelostomy is a procedure in which the ureter is anastomosed to the renal pelvis.

Ureterocalycostomy is a procedure in which the lower pole of the kidney is amputated to expose the infundibulum, and the ureter is anastomosed to the infundibulum.

Ileal ureter is a procedure in which a segment of ileum is used as ureter replacement. This is useful when there is a long segment of ureter that is destroyed.

**Immediate Diagnosis**

If ureteral perforation occurs during endoscopy, it can usually be managed with the placement of a ureteral stent for 4 to 6 weeks. If there is an intra-operative crush injury or ureteral contusion that is immediately identified, such as clamping the ureter, suturing the ureter, stapling the ureter, or applying a clip to the ureter, it can be managed based on the extent of injury. If it appears the injury is minimal, and the ureter is viable, place a ureteral stent. If the injury is large or the ureter does not appear viable, the section of injury can be debrided, and ureter primarily repaired over a stent. If a partial laceration is identified, it can be debrided and primarily repaired over a stent.

A major pelvic ureteral injury is managed with distal ureter ligation and reimplantation into the bladder. This may require psoas hitch and/or Boari flap. Generally, psoas hitch combined with a Boari flap is necessary if the length of injury is greater than 15 centimeters. Major abdominal ureteral injury can be repaired with UU, TUU, or ureteral reimplantation with/without psoas hitch or Boari flap.

If the patient is unstable and has a significant ureteral injury, he/she may not be stable enough to undergo formal repair. If this is the case, ligate the ureter with a non-absorbable suture just above the injury and place a percutaneous nephrostomy tube.

**Delayed Diagnosis**

When a ureteral injury diagnosis is delayed, a ureteral stricture often develops. Experts suggest that postoperatively discovered ureteral injuries should be immediately repaired when detected within 72 hours. Injuries that are identified after three days should be drained with a ureteral stent, percutaneous nephrostomy tube, or both, and definitive repair should be delayed until six weeks after injury.  If a urinoma is present, a drain should be placed. Complete imaging of the ureteral defect should be obtained. If possible, obtain an RPG and APG to identify the location and extent of the injury. A pelvic ureteral injury should be repaired with ureteral reimplantation with/without psoas hitch and/or Boari flap. Abdominal ureter injury can be repaired by UU, TUU, or ureteral reimplantation. UPJ injury can be repaired with ureteropyelostomy or ureterocalycostomy. These repairs can be performed with an open surgical approach, laparoscopically or robotically.
