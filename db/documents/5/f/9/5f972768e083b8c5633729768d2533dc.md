Glomerulonephritis may either lead to acute kidney injury (AKI) or may progress gradually to chronic renal failure. AKI is sometimes the initial presentation in rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with crescent formation. Similarly, vasculitis and Goodpasture syndrome represent other conditions where AKI is associated with glomerulonephritis. Most cases, however, would show progression into chronic glomerulonephritis and eventually lead to CKD and ESRD, requiring dialysis.

The following is a list of complications that providers should be mindful of:

- Pulmonary edema

- Hypertension

- Generalized anasarca

- Hypoalbuminemia

- Hypertensive retinopathy

- Hypertensive encephalopathy

- Rapidly progressiveÂ glomerulonephritis

- Chronic renal failure

- Nephrotic syndrome
