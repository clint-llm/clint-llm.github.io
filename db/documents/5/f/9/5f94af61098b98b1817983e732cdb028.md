Restless leg syndrome, or Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common chronic movement disorder in which patients have an irresistible urge to move their legs. The non-painful but strong perceived need to move their legs when their legs are at rest is relieved with leg motion. There is a diurnal pattern wherein symptoms worsen at night, and sleep disturbance is often a problem. There is an association with involuntary jerking movements of the legs during sleep, known as periodic leg movements of sleep. In the United States, there are more than three million cases per year. This activity reviews how to properly evaluate for restless leg syndrome and further steps that should be taken when presenting features are present. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe when restless leg syndrome should be considered on differential diagnosis.
- Review the evaluation of restless leg syndrome.
- Outline the management strategies for restless leg syndrome.
- Explain the importance of care coordination among interprofessional team members in the management of patients with restless leg syndrome for better outcomes.
