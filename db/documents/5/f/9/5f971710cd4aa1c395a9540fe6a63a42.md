There will often be a history of immunosuppression, which may be iatrogenic or medical in nature. The clinical presentation of cutaneous malakoplakia is variable, with lesions that can appear as tender ulcerations, nodules, papules, and plaques or as fungating masses with perianal and genital skin being commonly involved. However, other organ systems can be involved and can present as masses on the thorax, abdominal wall, head, neck, and extremities. It is important to keep malakoplakia on the differential diagnosis in individuals with a history of immunosuppression as well as recurrent infections.
