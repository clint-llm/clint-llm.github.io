The diagnosis of omphalocele postnatally is evident on physical examination upon the identification of an anterior midline abdominal mass at the site of the umbilical cord insertion covered by a membrane. The omphalocele can be small with only a few loops of intestines protruding through the defect, large containing several abdominal organs, or giant when the defect is greater than or equal to 5 centimeters with the liver partly protruding. Restrictive lung disease is common in these infants, and thus it is vital to stage the repair.
