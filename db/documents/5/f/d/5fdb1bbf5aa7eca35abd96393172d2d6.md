Hernias may lead to incarcerated bowel or strangulated bowel if the contents can no longer be reduced through the defect resulting in decreased blood supply to the bowel. If the strangulation is not corrected immediately, the bowel contents may become necrotic, and the patient can become septic. Nonreducible or symptomatic hernias must be surgically corrected promptly so that necrosis of the contents may be avoided. Patients with prune belly syndrome must undergo multiple surgical procedures to help the patient improve respiratory effort, digestion, and proper function of the urogenital tract.
