The greater petrosal nerve is a mixed nerve carrying parasympathetic, taste, and sensory fibers. The parasympathetic fibers synapse at the pterygopalatine ganglion, as discussed inÂ more detail above. Parasympathetic fibers exit the pterygopalatine ganglion via:

- The greater palatine nerve that innervates the bony hard palate of the mouth

- The lesser palatine that innervates the uvula, tonsils and soft palate

- The nasal palatine and posterior nasal branches that innervate the nasal mucous membranes

- The pharyngeal branch that innervates the glands and mucosa of the nasopharynx

These fibers also carry postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the deep petrosal nerve. In addition to the vidian nerve, the pterygopalatine ganglion receives two to three branches, the pterygoid branches, from the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve.

The greater petrosal also carries taste afferents from the soft palate and sensory afferents from the dura mater, internal carotid artery, and the pterygopalatine ganglion to the geniculate ganglion.
