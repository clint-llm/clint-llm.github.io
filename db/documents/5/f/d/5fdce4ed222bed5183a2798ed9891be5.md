CMT needs to be differentiated from conditions that manifest with predominant distal weakness, wasting, and deformities of the foot and have a progressive course.

Infantile spinal muscular atrophy with respiratory distress type 1 (SMARD1) due to mutations in IGHMBP2 is a close differential diagnosis since motor nerve conduction velocities are very low in this condition. However, these patients have normal sensory nerve action potentials.

Other differential diagnoses include acquired neuropathies due to diabetes mellitus, nutritional deficiencies, vasculitis, and heavy metal intoxication and inherited conditions wherein neuropathy is a part of a complex multisystem disorder such as autosomal-recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS), Friedreich’s ataxia, metachromatic leucodystrophy, syndrome of neurogenic weakness, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa (NARP), Refsum’s disease, etc.
