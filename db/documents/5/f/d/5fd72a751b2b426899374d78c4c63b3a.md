Histologically diabetic retinopathy presents with microangiopathy associated with vascular changes like focal capillary closure, dilatation of venules, hyalinization of arterioles, and capillary changes like basement membrane thickening, pericyte degeneration, and focal outpouchings (microaneurysms). Capillary closure leads to cotton wool spots and ischemic areas, leading to the development of IRMA (intraretinal microvascular abnormalities) and neovascularization, followed by fibrosis and contracture of the retina.

In diabetic retinopathy, the uptake of glutamate by Müller cells decreases, leading to glutamate toxicity.
