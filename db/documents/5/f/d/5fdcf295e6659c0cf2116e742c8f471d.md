VAD facilitators have the added responsibility of choosing appropriate video clips. The actual professional title of the debriefer is not as important as attention to general high-quality debriefing skills. One study has suggested that participants prefer faculty-led VAD to peer-led VAD. Indeed, they indicated that they trusted the knowledge and feedback skills more.

There is no consensus on VAD elements or best practices.
