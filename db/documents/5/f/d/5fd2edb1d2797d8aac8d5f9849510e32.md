Enterococci have developed a variety of mechanisms of resistance to several antibiotics like aminoglycosides, B-lactams, tetracyclines, quinolones, and vancomycin (glycopeptide). Intrinsically, they have penicillin-binding proteins with low-affinity to beta-lactams, can produce beta-lactamases, and have decreased cellular permeability to several. Specifically, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus resistance is due to the changes in the formation of peptidoglycan that makes up the bacterial cell wall. Normally, vancomycin binds to the D-Ala-D-Ala terminus of the protein precursors to peptidoglycan. Resistance develops as this terminus is changed to D-Ala-D-lactate so that vancomycin binds with less affinity. This is coded by genotypes identified alphabetically as VanA to VanG. Of these, the plasmid-based VanA and VanB genotypes are by far the most common, followed distantly in prevalence by the chromosomal phenotypes VanD and VanC respectively. VRE has slightly different resistance formation with Aminoglycosides, all except for Streptomycin, the formation of resistance is mainly due to inactivating enzyme 2"-phosphotransferase-6′-acetyltransferase. Streptomycin resistance on the other is through the production of streptomycin adenyltransferase.
