Successful management of zygomatic arch and ZMC fractures requires coordination between the surgical team (otolaryngology, plastic surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery), ophthalmology, anesthesiology, trauma surgery, and perioperative nursing, operating as a cohesive, interprofessional team. A careful preoperative evaluation is paramount. It is essential to identify and document concomitant injuries to ensure that the most pressing issues get addressed first â€” any ocular injury requires attention before fracture management. Comorbidities require consideration when deciding on operative versus conservative management. Postoperatively, the specialty trained nursing staff should carefully monitor visual acuity and extraocular movements. The patient should understand that paresthesia of the infraorbital nerve and trismus are not uncommon and may persist. The surgical team and nursing staff should caution the patient to abstain from heavy lifting and strenuous activity for at least two weeks after surgery. This interprofessional team approach is the best means by which to attain positive patient outcomes with minimal adverse events. [Level 5]
