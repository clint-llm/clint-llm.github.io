Meconium aspiration usually affects term and post-term newborn babies that are born with amniotic fluid stained with meconium (fetal stool). It occurs in less than 10% of infants born with meconium-stained amniotic fluid. It is an important cause of respiratory distress in a newborn and should be identified and managed early. The medical provider should rule out other conditions, such as neonatal infections. Parents should be educated that management requires admission to the neonatal intensive care unit and is mainly supportive. Most infants recover well with early diagnosis and management.
