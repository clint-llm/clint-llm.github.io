Osteocyte resides within the lacunae located between the lamellae of the matrix. Each lacuna consists of one osteocyte. Osteocytes are flat, almond-shaped in the structure; they have a depth of about 7 micrometers and length of about 15 micrometers. The cell body diameter ranges from 5 to 20 micrometers and may obtain 40Â to 60 processes per cell within a cellular distance of 20 to 30 micrometers. A mature osteocyte holds a single nucleus, which has a membrane and one or two nucleoli. The nucleus usually exists toward the vascular side of the surface. These cells exhibit a predominantly reduced Golgi complex and rough endoplasmic reticulum. These specialized structures also exhibit a more condensed nuclear chromatin. Osteocytes compose an extensive connecting syncytial network with small dendritic, or cytoplasmic, processes taking place in canaliculi. Osteocytes have expanded longevity and are long-living by nature.
