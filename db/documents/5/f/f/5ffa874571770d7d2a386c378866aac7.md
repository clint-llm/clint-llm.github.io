AÂ Stye may be encountered by the emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, internist or the primary care provider. Most styes can be managed conservatively by these healthcare professionals, but if there is any doubt about the diagnosis, the patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist. Styes do respond rapidly to warm compresses and erythromycin ointment. However, the patient must be seen again within 48 to 72 hours to ensure that healing is taking place.

The outcomes for most patients with a stye are excellent.
