The JCC technique does not require fogging (which is important in assessing hyperopia) of the eye to achieve a proper result.

Placing the circle of least confusion on the retina first requires fogging, which is the addition of plus powers, and then defogging, which is subtracting plus powers till the best acuity is achieved (See image of fogging). It is important to note that the fog must be removed before assessing with JCC, which can be used to find the astigmatic correction or refine the power and axis of the astigmatic correction.

Excessive defogging results in the circle of least confusion being moved behind the retina. This can be managed in a young patient who has enough accommodative ability to pull it back onto the retina; however, the same can not be said for those with reduced accommodative abilities or older patients.

Before the JCC can be used, the circle of least confusion should be on the outer limiting membrane of the retina, while the whole interval of Sturm lies within the eye.

The findings of the autorefractor or previous refraction can be used as the starting point in the JCC examination.

In the case of no prior astigmatic correction, the JCC can be used to detect astigmatism; however, the presence of astigmatism can be overlooked due to the optical effect of the JCC. This can be illustrated when considering the principle of vector addition by putting together cylindrical lenses at arbitrary axes.
