The muscles of the abdomen, in conjunction with the muscles of the back, provide posture and stability, helping the spine remain erect and adjust the position of the body. In the anterior aspect of the abdomen, the most superficial muscle is the external oblique muscle. Located deep to the external oblique is the internal oblique muscle, which is much thinner. The transversus abdominis muscle is the deepest, and the fibers run transversely. All of these muscles contribute to the linea alba at the midline. On either side of the midline, the rectus abdominis muscles are the vertical muscles that are divided by the linea alba. The pyramidalis is a muscle at the base of the pubic bone that also attaches to the linea alba.

The muscles of the abdomen and back attach to the pelvis and work together with the muscles of the pelvis. Some pelvic muscles such as psoas major and iliacus help flex the trunk and thigh.Â The inferior aspect of the pelvic cavity is called the pelvic diaphragm.
