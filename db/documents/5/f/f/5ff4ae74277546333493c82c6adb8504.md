Systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia have multiple ocular and systemic manifestations. Hence, the management of patients with these diseases needs a multi-disciplinary team. The management starts with patient education. The primary health care providers should make a sincere effort to describe the natural history and the ability of these diseases to affect the body's multiple systems and the consequences of poor systemic control. The ophthalmic and diabetes nurses play a key role in patient education. The ophthalmologists should emphasize the need for regular follow up with multiple specialty doctors and vice versa. The pharmacists can counsel the patients on the need for regular medications and the importance of lifestyle modifications.
