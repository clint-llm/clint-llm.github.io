Pelvic venous insufficiency is due to the incompetency of the internal iliac vein, the ovarian vein, or both. It is often the underlying cause of pelvic congestion syndrome. Nearly 10% of women suffer from ovarian varices. Of this 10%, about 60% have pelvic congestion syndrome.

The exact etiology of pelvic congestion syndrome is unclear. It is most likely dependent on multiple factors. The congestion of the pelvic veins can be due to hormones, insufficiency of the valve, and venous obstruction. The release of pain-inducing substances due to increased dilatation of the veins along with stasis is a likely cause of the pain in PCS.
