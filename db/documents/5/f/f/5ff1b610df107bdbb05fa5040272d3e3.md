Direct damage to the superior colliculus has been tested in rhesus monkeys as well as rats and has resulted in clinical manifestations. Researchers found that the monkeys with damage to the superior colliculus to have visual deficits as well as impairments in gaze shifts. Rats with collicular damage displayed a lack of orienting reflex and no distraction when presented with visual or auditory stimuli when compared with normal or rats with visual cortex lesions. In humans, damage to the connection with the prefrontal cortex has shown to be associated with effects to attention. Lesions interrupting inhibitory inputs from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to the superior colliculus caused increased distractibility in one patient.

Tectal glioma, a rare low-grade tumor, is a condition of particular concern. It affects the superior and inferior colliculi as well as the cerebral aqueduct, resulting in increased intracranial pressure and long-term morbidities. It primarily affects a pediatric population with symptoms, including chronic headaches, visual deficits, and neurological impairment. Treatment traditionally involves shunting of the cerebrospinal fluid, and radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or possible surgery if the tumor continues to enlarge.
