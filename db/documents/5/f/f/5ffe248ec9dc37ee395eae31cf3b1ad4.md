Thyroid nodules are evaluated according to the American Thyroid Association Guidelines

Sonographic features of both follicular adenoma and follicular carcinoma are similar and careful examination can help distinguish the two entities. An extensive lesion size, hypoechogenicity, mixed or solid echotexture, absence of sonographic halo, micro/rim calcifications favor the malignant counterpart.

In thyroid nodules >1 cm (in any diameter) it is recommended to measure serum thyrotropin (TSH) during the initial evaluation. If the TSH is low a I thyroid scan should be performed, if TSH is normal or elevated the radionuclide scan is not recommended. Radionuclide scanning can be evaluated together with US findings, FNA reports and clinical information.

Serum Tg levels should not be measured in the initial workup of a thyroid nodule because has a low specificity rate in the general evaluation but should be monitored in selected cases (i.e. after total thyroidectomy). Laboratory screening for calcitonin is neither recommended nor inappropriate: serum calcitonin can be evaluated for screening purposes because it may detect incidentally C-cell hyperplasia or medullary thyroid cancer at an earlier stage, improving overall survival.

CT scan and MRI have a limited role in the initial evaluation f solitary thyroid nodule.

FNA is performed to provide a cytological examination of the nodule, and it remains the mainstay for assessing these lesions, although it may not provide a diagnosis in all cases.
