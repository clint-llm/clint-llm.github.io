For the treatment of dyspareunia, a multimodal treatment approach is advantageous to address all the aspects of pain (physical, emotional, and behavioral). It should involve a team consisting of the gynecologist, pain management expert, physical therapist, sexual therapist, and mental health professionals with a specialization in chronic pain.

Medical treatment options available for dyspareunia include oral tricyclic antidepressants, oral or topical hormonal replacement, oral NSAIDs, botox injections, cognitive behavioral therapy, and other brain-based therapies. Treatment of dyspareunia depends on the etiology of the patient's complaint. Dyspareunia due to post-menopausal vaginal atrophy can have treatment with systemic and topical hormone replacement therapy, selective estrogen receptor modulator therapy, and the use of vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone.

Pelvic floor physical therapy can serve as an adjuvant treatment option in most cases of dyspareunia. It relaxes the pelvic floor muscles and re-educates the pain receptors.
