The diagnosis and management of NSIP is complex and usually requires a team approach that consists of a pathologist, thoracic surgeon, pulmonologist, radiologist, nurse practitioner and an internist. Once the diagnosis is made, the usually treatment for mild disease is observation. Moderate to severe disease usually requires steroids and other potent immunosuppresive agents. These patients need life long follow up as the disease course is marked by relapses and remissions. The prognosis for mild disease is good but for severe disease the life expectancy is significantly reduced. (Level V)
