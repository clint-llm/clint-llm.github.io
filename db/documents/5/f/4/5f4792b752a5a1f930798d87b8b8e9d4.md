The most common condition in children younger than one year of age is metatarsus adductus. It is seen between 0.1% to 1% of births, and more frequent in girls compared to boys.

Between the ages of 1 and 4 years, the most common condition causing in-toeing is internal tibial torsion. There is no gender predilection or attributable cause.

Increased femoral anteversion is the third common cause of in-toeing in children. This can present during infancy but typically is notably after the age of 3, with an average age of diagnosis between 3 and 6 years of age. This condition is twice as common in females.
