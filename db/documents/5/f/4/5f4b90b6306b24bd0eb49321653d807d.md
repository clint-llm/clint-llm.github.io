The embryological formation of the intermediate mesoderm derived urogenital system begins as two separate, yet interwoven processes:

A. Development of the urinary system from the nephrogenic cord.

B. Development of the reproductive system from the gonadal ridge.

The interplay between multiple genes and hormones is essential for both systems to develop properly. As such, a mutation or misstep in any portion of the cascade of events can cause a double, absent, or malformed structure. Knowledge of urogenital embryology is paramount for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of a myriad of conditions.
