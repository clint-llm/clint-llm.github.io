**Excision of the Primary Tumor**

- The same general complications of any surgery including infection, bleeding, risks from receiving general anesthesia. The most common complication after penectomy is meatal stenosis.

**Lymph Node Dissection**

- Inguinal lymph node dissection (ILND) is a very morbid procedure and is the reason for the reluctance to advocate automatic inguinal lymphadenectomy. Early complications include wound infections, flap necrosis, phlebitis, seroma, pulmonary embolism, lymphedema of the scrotum and lower limbs.

**RT**

- Complications are more frequent as the size of the tumor treated increases. Urethral strictures, urethral fistulas, penile necrosis, and penile pain have been reported as possible complications from this therapy.
