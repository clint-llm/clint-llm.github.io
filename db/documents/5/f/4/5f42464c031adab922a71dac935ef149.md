The autonomic nervous system primarily innervates the thyroid gland. The vagus nerve provides the main parasympathetic fibers, while sympathetic fibers originate from the inferior, middle, and superior ganglia of the sympathetic trunk. These nerves do not play a role in the control of hormonal production or secretion but mostly influence vasculature.
