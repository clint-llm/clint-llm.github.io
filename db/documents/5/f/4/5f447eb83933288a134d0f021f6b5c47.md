Given the wide range in appearance of the breast from patient to patient, it’s crucial in breast imaging interpretation to understand breast anatomy and pathophysiology. The human breasts develop under the influence of hormones on ectodermal cells. Female breast stroma primarily consisting of fat, fibroglandular stroma, ducts, and lobules. With the onset of puberty, ductal and stromal growth is dependent on the proliferative effects of estrogen. Thus in the male breast, the antagonistic effects androgens demonstrated on ductal and stromal growth result in a predominantly fatty breast. The volume of fibroglandular tissue varies tremendously from patient to patient and throughout an individual's life.  In pregnancy, lobular tissue within the breast parenchyma reaches functional maturity with ductal proliferation and adipose tissue decrease.

Breast fibroglandular tissue demonstrates variable FDG uptake and is often secondary to hormonal influences on breast vascularity, thus changing significantly throughout life, often becoming minimal in the post-menopausal state. FDG uptake is typically mild in normal breast tissue and marked in the lactating breast. The abundant lymphatic system of the breast begins within the mammary ducts. Deep lymphatic channels, including the subareolar plexus, primarily drain to axillary and internal mammary lymph nodes, which are the two most important nodal sites to evaluate nodal radiotracer uptake on PET scans.
