Whether decompressing the stomach, providing enteral access for nutrition and medications in a patient unable to tolerate them orally, or ruling out an upper GI source of bleeding in the setting of massive hematochezia; nasogastric tubes are part of the standard of care for many routine health issues. Physicians should be readily able to place nasogastric tubes if indicated, and nursing staff should be able to manage them effectively. Given the potential for major complications to occur, particularly if medications or tube feeds are given intrapulmonary, with inappropriate nasogastric tube placement, the entire healthcare team must know the indications, contraindications, possible complications, and appropriate work-up to confirm placement.
