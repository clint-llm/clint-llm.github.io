Myasthenia Gravis is a neuromuscular disorder affecting muscarinic, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It is a disease characterized by weakness and fatigability of the skeletal muscles. Managing a patient with this disorder is challenging, particularly in the perioperative setting. This activity reviews the anesthetic management of this disease and highlights the role the interprofessional team plays in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of myasthenia gravis.
- Review the clinical classification and risk factors associated with worsening clinical outcomes.
- Summerize the pre-operative evaluation of myasthenia gravis.
- Explain the anesthetic management of myasthenia gravis by an interprofessional team.
