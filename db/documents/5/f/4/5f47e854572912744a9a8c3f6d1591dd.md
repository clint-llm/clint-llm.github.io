The management of malignant pleural effusion is with an interprofessional team that includes an oncologist, radiologist, pathologist, palliative care nurses, hospice, thoracic surgeon and a pain specialist. Most of these patients have less than 12 months to live and aggressive measures are unwarranted. The use of sclerotherapy can be used to manage most MPE and surgery should be avoided. A palliative care and hospice nursing team should be involved in the care of these patients; the aim is to make the patient comfortable and pain-free.
