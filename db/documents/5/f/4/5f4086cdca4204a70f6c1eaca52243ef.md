Abnormal development or damage to the fetal or infant's brain causes cerebral palsy. The brain insult/injury causing CP is non-progressive ("static") and can occur in the prenatal, perinatal, or postnatal periods. The etiology in an individual patient is often multifactorial.

**Prenatal Causes**

- Congenital brain malformations

- Intrauterine infections

- Intrauterine stroke

- Chromosomal abnormalities

**Perinatal Causes**

- Hypoxic-ischemic insults

- Central nervous system (CNS) infections

- Stroke

- Kernicterus

**Postnatal Causes**

- Accidental and non-accidental trauma

- CNS infections

- Stroke

- Anoxic insults

Prematurity is a significant risk factor for cerebral palsy. Complications of prematurity that can cause cerebral palsy include

- Periventricular leukomalacia

- Intraventricular hemorrhage

- Periventricular infarcts.

Other risk factors associated with cerebral palsy are multiple gestation, intrauterine growth restriction, maternal substance abuse, preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, abnormal placental pathology, meconium aspiration, perinatal hypoglycemia, and genetic susceptibility.
