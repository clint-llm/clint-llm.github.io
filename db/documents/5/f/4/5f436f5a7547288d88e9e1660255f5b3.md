Bone marrow biopsy from patients with inherited bone marrow failure syndromes who have aplastic anemia will be markedly hypocellular. Fat and fibrotic stroma fill up the remaining marrow space (see image). Any residual hematopoietic cells are predominantly lymphocytes. There may be dysplastic features such as hyponucleated small megakaryocytes, multinucleated red cells, or hypolobulated or hypogranular myeloid cells, none of which are malignant. Some inherited bone marrow failure syndromes affect only one lineage (other lines are well-represented and functional).
