Many factors make interpreting the literature of posterior instability challenging, including the low incidence of this clinical entity, variability in patient characteristics, surgical techniques, implants, and rehabilitation protocols, and the limited number of high-quality studies. Literature shows open surgical techniques have been reported to improve outcomes with success rates between 80% to 95%.

Initial reports of arthroscopic management of posterior instability were not as encouraging as those treated for anterior instability. However, recent literature has shown success rates of around 90% for those with posterior instability after sporting injuries.

In the largest patient cohort to date, Bradley et al. reported on 200 shoulders in 183 athletes prospectively treated with arthroscopic capsulolabral repair for posterior shoulder instability.

Arner et al. published a case series on 56 American football players who underwent arthroscopic posterior capsulolabral repair for posterior shoulder instability. At a mean follow-up of 44.7 months, the authors found a 93% return to sport, with 79% returning at the same level. Significant improvements were also seen onÂ the ASES score and subjective scores of stability, ROM strength, pain, and function. The failure rate in this study was 3.5%.

In 2015, DeLong et al. published a systematic review of the literature on arthroscopic and open posterior shoulder stabilization dating from 1946 to 2014.
