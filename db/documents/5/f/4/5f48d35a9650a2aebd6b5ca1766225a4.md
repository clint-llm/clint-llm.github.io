The diagnosis of Whipple disease is made by a biopsy of the intestine and identification of the organism. Current diagnostic criteria require positive results for PAS-positive foamy macrophages in the small bowel biopsy. If it is negative, the diagnosis can also be made by showing positive results in for two of the following:

- PAS staining showing foamy macrophages in a biopsy specimen of involved tissues

- PCR Detection of T. whippelii or detection of the specific 16S rRNA of the bacterium

- Immunohistochemical staining with T. whippelii antibodies

It is important to know that T. whippelii quickly becomes negative after the initiation of therapy, which may lead to false negatives since many patients receive antibiotics before undergoing extensive diagnostic testing for this condition. Other lab findings include anemia in 90% of cases and results from chronic disease, iron deficiency, and folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. Neutrophilia is present in one-third of patients. Mild lymphocytopenia is common. Eosinophilia and thrombocytopenia rarely occur. Hypoalbuminemia is prevalent, whereas serum globulin levels are normal. The prothrombin time is prolonged. Steatorrhea occurs in 93% of cases.
