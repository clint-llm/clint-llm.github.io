Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are among the most common rheumatic diseases. These chronic progressive inflammatory diseases lead to a reduction in physical fitness and increase in joint degeneration.

Both RA and AS can be similarly characterized by the presenting symptoms, radiographic characteristics, and serological testing.  However, RA and AS have widely different characteristics with respect to each one's pathophysiology and underlying genetic parameters.
