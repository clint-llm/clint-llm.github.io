Although the genetic abnormality remains throughout the lifespan of an affected individual, the mean age of presentation of attacks is the first or second decade of life, usually the late childhood or teenage years.

Though it is termed as periodic, it can be misleading as attacks don't occur at a regular interval, rather they occur suddenly and are episodic. The most consistent triggering factors are rest following strenuous exercise and consumption of dietsÂ rich in carbohydrates.

Patients usually present with attacks of generalized severe muscle weakness, with proximal muscle involvement more marked than distal and a profound decrease in serum potassium level (serum potassium less than 2.5 mmol/L).

The frequency of attacks of weakness is very variable and infrequent. Some patients might get attack only once in a lifetime, while others may get it several times a week.

Neurological examination of the patient during attack shows generalized muscle weakness, usually proximal muscle involvement more than distal and when incomplete legs are more often involved than arms. Hyporeflexia or areflexia is typical. Neurological examination findings are usually normal between attacks. Myotonia is uncommon, unlike in hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, where myotonic is a common finding.

Some individuals may experience a milder form of muscle weakness between attacks that fluctuates and improves with mild exercise.

In a case series of 71 diagnosed patients of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, patients without mutations, compared to patients with mutations, were found to have disease presentation at old age, absence of diet as a precipitating factor, and muscle biopsy showed no vacuolar myopathy.
