In children with an AP window, a chest X-ray will show cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings. Electrocardiogram will demonstrate tachycardia and increased right and left-sided voltages. The diagnosis of an AP window is made by echocardiography after suspicion of a large left to right shunt. Because the connection is usually without significant restriction, color Doppler echocardiography will not detect a high-velocity color jet. When the suspicion is high, the 2D images are usually sufficient to measure the AP window communication. If echocardiogram imaging is insufficient, a CT scan can potentially delineate the AP connection.

Echocardiography should completely evaluate the remaining cardiac structures, including evaluating other cardiac diseases such as tetralogy of Fallot, interruption of the aortic arch, and care should be taken to identify the coronary arteries. Unless the diagnosis is made late or cannot be made with less invasive means, cardiac catheterization adds little to the diagnostic management. When the diagnosis is made after infancy or even into adult life, especially if cyanosis is noted, catheterization could be utilized to evaluate the pulmonary vascular resistance as Eisenmenger syndrome can develop. If there is pulmonary vascular disease, reactivity testing should be performed during catheterization to determine the advisability of closure.
