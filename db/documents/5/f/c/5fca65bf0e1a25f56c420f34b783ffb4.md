The indication for the procedure, potential complications, and alternative to treatment should be explained to the patient and an informed consent form signed. The patient should be placed in the sitting position if possible. Some sort of protective sheet should be placed on the patientâ€™s chest in case they have an episode of emesis during the procedure. The nasogastric tube should be connected to the suction tubing and the suction tubing connected to a suction bucket before placement of the tube to minimize the risk of spillage of gastric contents. All supplies should be close at hand to minimize unnecessary movement during the procedure.
