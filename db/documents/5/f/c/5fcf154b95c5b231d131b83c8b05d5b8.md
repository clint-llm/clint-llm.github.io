The exact pathophysiology of coronary artery ectasia is unknown. CAE is an anatomical variantÂ or a clinical constellation of coronary artery disease because it may present with myocardial ischemia or coronary syndrome. The mechanism of luminal dilation in some atherosclerotic vessels is ambiguous; atherosclerosis typically causes narrowing of the vessel lumen. Due to the arterial remodeling, there is an expansion of the medial and external elastic membrane of the blood vessel. This proposed methodology of arterial remodeling may be operative in the case of coronary artery ectasia. Intravascular ultrasound reveals that arterial remodeling can be bidirectional depending upon expansion or contraction of the external elastic membrane. Coronary artery ectasia appears to be exaggerated expansive remodeling of the external elastic membrane resulting in luminal expansion.

Enzymatic degradation of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) and other lytic enzymes and thinning of the tunica media associated with severe chronic inflammation is considered the principal pathogenesis of the expansive remodeling.
