Vitamin E toxicity occurs due to excessive vitamin supplementation, not due to diet alone. Vitamin E can interact with many different medications. One of the more serious complications of vitamin E toxicity is increased bleeding risk, especially in patients already on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy.

Bleeding episodes can occur anywhere in the body, and serious life-threatening hemorrhagic strokes have been reported. Other complications include gastrointestinal manifestations, weakness, fatigue, and emotional lability. The treatment for vitamin E toxicityÂ includes discontinuation of vitamin E supplementation and consideration of vitamin K therapy if serious bleeding occurs. To prevent vitamin E toxicity, supplementation of vitamin E should be kept to a lower dosage.
