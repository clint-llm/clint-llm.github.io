Bouveret syndrome is a very rare cause of gastric outlet obstruction. Both the diagnosis and management are complex, and the disorder carries high morbidity and mortality. These patients are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an emergency department physician, a general surgeon, a radiologist, a gastroenterologist, and specialty nurses. The best method of managing these patients still has not been determined, but the patients need close monitoring in an ICU setting. Wound infections, fistula formation, and multiorgan failure have all been reported. The nurse must ensure that the patients have DVT prophylaxis as many patients remain bedridden for a prolonged time.
