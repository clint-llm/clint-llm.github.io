Cancer-related cachexia can be broken down into three categories:

- Metabolic derangement

- Anorexia

- Alimentary tract dysfunction

The causes of cachexia can be related to disease, treatment, or emotional distress. Nausea, early satiety, and dysgeusia are factors in anorexia.

**Cytokines**

Mediators of cachexia associated with cancer include tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukins (IL) 1 and 6, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and leukemia inhibitory factor, and interferon (INF)-gamma. These produced by tumor cells and host immune cells. These are procachectic factors, as they lead to anorexia, weight loss, protein, and fat breakdown, an acute-phase protein response, falls in insulin level, insulin resistance, rise in levels of cortisol and glucagon, fever, anemia, and elevated energy expenditure.

Host immune cells, including macrophages, T-helper-one cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, produce procachectic cytokines.

Many tumors cause an elevated adrenergic state that results in an increased rate of energy expenditure. Skeletal muscle is the primary site of lean body mass depletion as part of a persistent inflammatory response. Tumors only produce proteolysis-inducing (PIF) factors. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and PIF induce cachexia by activating nuclear factor kappa B transcription factor found in muscles. This is secondary to increased protein turnover without equivalent protein synthesis.

The JAK/STAT3 pathway is strongly activated by the IL-6 family ligands. STAT3 activation by IL-6 is necessary for muscle wasting. Inhibition STAT3 pharmacologically using STAT3 or JAK inhibitors reduce muscle atrophy. This indicates that STAT3 is a primary mediator of muscle wasting when there is high IL-6 family signaling.

Anorexia and weight loss in cancer patients do not correlate with serum levels of circulating  IL-1, IL-6, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. There may be a central mechanism of action producing cachexia. Cytokines postulated to be involved in cachexia include TNF-alpha, IFN-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and others.

Serotonin and dysfunction of neuropeptidergic circuits may be involved. Elevated plasma-free tryptophan was observed in patients with cancer and anorexia. This elevates tryptophan levels in the cerebrospinal fluid resulting in increased synthesis of serotonin. High levels of serotonin contribute to cancer anorexia.

**Insulin and Ghrelin**

Insulin and leptin levels are proportional to body fat content. Central nervous system (CNS) concentrations are proportional to plasma levels. Insulin secretion increases as weight increases. This occurs at the basal state and in response to meals. Leptin is more involved in CNS control of energy homeostasis than insulin. Leptin deficiency causes obesity with hyperphagia. This persists despite high insulin levels.

Ghrelin function is a peptide produced by ghrelin cells in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and acts in the CNS. Ghrelin is secreted when the stomach is empty. The secretion stops when the stomach is stretched. Ghrelin acts centrally to increase hunger, gastric acid, secretion, and gastrointestinal motility. The same brain cells have receptors for ghrelin and leptin, with opposing effects.****

**Alimentary Tract Dysfunction**

Cancer patients often have abnormalities in their taste and smell. Oral intake may be impaired by tumors of the mouth, neck, esophagus, stomach. Obstruction can occur to tumors of the pancreas, liver, and peritoneum. Intestinal obstruction is common. Enzymatic insufficiency secondary to pancreatic insufficiency may contribute to malabsorption. Lymphoma of the intestine or mesentery can result in issues.

Slowing of peristalsis and delayed gastric emptying contributes to early satiety. Chemotherapy commonly causes nausea, vomiting, mucositis, and abnormal perception of taste. Stomatitis, alterations in taste and smell, and xerostomia often occur secondary to radiotherapy to the head and neck. Abdominal radiation therapy can cause nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and malabsorption.

**Biochemical and Metabolic Derangement**

Neoplastic cells have high levels of glucose utilization and production of lactic acid, the Warburg effect. Hexokinase is the first step of the glycolytic pathway, and overexpressed in tumor cells contributes to this process. Tumor glycolysis and host gluconeogenesis may be a significant cause of cancer cachexia.

Recently, an extensive re-examination of Warburg effects shows that unlike the majority of cells, numerous cancer cell lines obtain a significant portion of their energy from aerobic glycolysis. Many malignant cells secrete hydrogen peroxide, oxygen-free radicals drive mitophagy, aerobic glycolysis, and autophagy.
