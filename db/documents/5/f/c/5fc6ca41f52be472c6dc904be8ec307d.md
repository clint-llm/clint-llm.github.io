The histologic findings in subvalvular aortic stenosis are similar to the tunnel like and fibromuscular ridge lesions. Irregularly oriented dense collagen fibers and thin, short elastic fibers in ample amounts are observed. Vascularity is usually absent. Sparse fibroblasts with elongated nuclei and smooth muscle cells are observed as well.
