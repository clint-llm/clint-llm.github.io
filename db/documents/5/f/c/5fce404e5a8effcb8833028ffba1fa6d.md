The definition of a seizure is an abnormal, hypersynchronous discharge of cortical neurons, and epilepsy is defined as a propensity to have seizures.

- Two unprovoked seizures more than 24 hours apart

- One unprovoked seizure but with a high recurrence risk (60% and over)

- A diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome

The terminology and classification of epilepsy have undergone significant change in recent years with the revised International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification of epilepsies in 2017, replacing the 1989 classification.

The classification now operates on a three-tier system with etiological factors considered in tandem throughout (e.g., structural, genetic, infectious, metabolic, immune, and unknown). The first step is defining the seizure type (focal, generalized, unknown). The second step is diagnosing the epilepsy type (focal, generalized, combined generalized and focal, and unknown), and the final step is whether a diagnosis of epilepsy syndrome can be madeÂ (conditions with recognizable features such as seizure type, imaging, and electroencephalography (EEG) features). This activity will focus on idiopathic (genetic) generalized epilepsy (IGE), one of the most well-recognized subgroups of generalized epilepsies. Idiopathic generalized epilepsy specifically refers to the epilepsy syndromes such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), and generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
