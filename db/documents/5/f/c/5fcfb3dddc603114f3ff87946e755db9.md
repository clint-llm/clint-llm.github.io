- Pancreatic necrosis or abscess: Necrosis of the pancreatic and peri-pancreatic tissue. Presents in patients with acute pancreatitis with sepsis-like physiology who fail to recover with conservative management.

- Pancreatic Pseudoaneurysm: can also be seen as a complication of pancreatitis caused by erosion of the arteries, leading to a rapid increase in the cystâ€™s size, a sudden drop in hemoglobin, and upper GI bleeding.

- Pancreatic cystic neoplasm: Appears as a multiloculated cyst with thick walls and elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels in the cystic fluid. Clinical features include loss of weight and appetite.

- Other differential diagnoses include extra-pancreatic pathologies such as peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, bowel obstruction, ovarian tumor/cysts, acute myocardial infarction, or pneumonia.
