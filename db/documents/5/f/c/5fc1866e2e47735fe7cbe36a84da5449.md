The differential diagnosis for the location of intestinal perforation can be narrowed down based on several factors. A thorough history and physical taking can help to diagnosis acute and chronic onsets of disease and likely location of the perforation. Importantly, being able to narrow down the likely location of the perforation along the intestinal tract helps to narrow down the intervention.

Upper GI perforation (stomach and duodenum) is most commonly caused by peptic ulcer disease with severe epigastric or back pain, with acute onset. Sometimes there are chronic symptoms leading up to the perforation event, such as dyspepsia, bloating, nausea, and early satiety.

Colonic perforation should be considered with a history of left lower quadrant or history of diverticulitis also usually with decreased stool output. Malignancy is a consideration also, especially with lack of endoscopy screening history. Imaging typically shows free air located near the area of perforation with possible abscess formation present due to the leakage of stool into the peritoneal cavity.
