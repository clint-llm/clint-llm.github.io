The intact, healthy endocardium is typically resistant to bacterial seeding. Overall, the development of infectious endocarditis requires prodromal endocardial injury followed by a period of bacteremia. The preliminary endocardial disruption may emerge secondary to turbulent flow around diseased valves or from the direct mechanical trauma caused by catheter or electrode insertion. In the setting of intravenous drug use, repetitive valvular barrage by co-injected particulate matter generates the necessary injury.

Subsequent bacteremia then allows for colonization of the vegetation. The necessary bacteremia can stem from an established, distant source of infection or emerge transiently secondary to intermittent hematogenous inoculation of oral flora from dental/gingival manipulation. Although the minimum bacterial burden remains unknown, experimental models have precipitated cases of infectious endocarditis with slow 1 mL infusions of 106 colony-forming units of bacteria.S. aureus proteins (clumping factors A, B, and serine-aspartate repeat protein) have been found to independently mediate platelet aggregation. In theory, expanding the originally sterile platelet-fibrin deposits protects pathogens from the hostâ€™s immune response and allows the vegetation to grow.
