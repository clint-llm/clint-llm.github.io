Laboratory tests are rarely helpful in the diagnosis of a double aortic arch but may aid in the diagnosis of additional conditions that may be present such as genetic testing for underlying conditions and full blood count to assist in the diagnosis of respiratory infections. Imaging remains the mainstay of investigation. Echocardiography is the first test of choice, can evaluate the nature of the aortic arch and its branches and can identify other intra-cardiac anomalies that may also be present.

Electrocardiographic studies are normal unless intra-cardiac structural anomalies are co-existent.

Plain chest roentgenogram can reveal loss of aortic knob, lateral/posterior indentation of the trachea, while barium swallow can show indentation of the esophagus. These do not rate as essential diagnostic studies.

Advanced imaging using computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging has become the diagnostic procedure of choice, permitting clear delineation of the aortic arches, its location and branching pattern, arch dominance, adjacent tissue, and extend of tracheal/oesophageal compression. It also holds value in pre-operative planning. It typically takes place after echocardiography.

Bronchoscopy usually occurs pre-operatively to evaluate airway anatomy and to rule out other airway causes for respiratory symptoms. It may also help to confirm and grade the severity of airway compression. It is seldom useful postoperatively to determine the efficacy of decompression.
