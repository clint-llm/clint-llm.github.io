The majority of the venous blood drained into the dural venous sinuses come from a variety of tributaries found within the cranium. Structures which act as tributaries to the venous sinus flow include the following:

- Cerebral and cerebellar veins which cross the subdural space to drain into the superior sagittal vein, hence, the name “bridging veins”

- Emissary veins that progress through the skull allowing communication between intracranial and extracranial contents

- Diploic veins which drain blood between the inner and outer layer flat bones of the skull (diploe)

- Meningeal veins collect blood from the meninges

- Arachnoid granulations for CSF returning to the venous circulation
