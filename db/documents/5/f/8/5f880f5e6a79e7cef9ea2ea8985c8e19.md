The sinoatrial nodal artery is a branch of the main coronary arteries, or its derivatives, which supplies blood to the pacemaker of the heart, the sinoatrial node. It can also supply blood to the crista terminalis and the free walls of both the left and right atrium. It most commonly originates from the right coronary artery (68% of patients) and less commonly from the left coronary artery and left circumflex artery (24.7% of patients).
