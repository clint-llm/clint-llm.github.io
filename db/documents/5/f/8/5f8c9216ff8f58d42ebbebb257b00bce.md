Treatment consists of the following antihelminthic medications:

Albendazole: Given on an empty stomach, a 400-mg, one-time dose followed by a repeat dose in 2 weeks

OR

Mebendazole: A 100-mg, one-time dose followed by a repeat dose in two weeks

OR

Pyrantel Pamoate: Available over the counter in the United States; Dose of 11 mg/kg up to a maximum 1 gm given 2 weeks apart

Other medications that have been used to treat enterobiasis are ivermectin and piperazine, although the latter has lower efficacy and higher toxicity.

Enterobiasis can cause recurrent reinfection, so treating the entire household, whether symptomatic or not is recommended to prevent a recurrence.

Treatment of Enterobius infection in pregnancy should be reserved for patients who have significant symptoms. In pregnant patients, pyrantel pamoate is preferred over other medications.

Young pinworms tend to be resistant to treatment and hence two doses of medication, two weeks apart are recommended. At the same time, all members of the infected child must be treated. If a large number of children are infected in a class, everyone should be treated twice at 2-week intervals. Follow up is vital to ensure that a cure has been obtained.
