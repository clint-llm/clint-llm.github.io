The dentistry field is progressing towards a more conservative approach when treating dental caries. Newer diagnostic technology can detect initial stages of demineralization, allowing non-invasive intervention as early as possible to prevent further damage; this has invaluable repercussions on the oral health of the individual and broader community. However, more traditional methods, such as fiber optic transillumination, should not be disregarded since sufficient evidence supports its high specificity and sensitivity in caries diagnosis.
