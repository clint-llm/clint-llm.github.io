Hyperthyroidism may manifest as weight loss despite an increased appetite, palpitation, nervousness, tremors, dyspnea, fatigability, diarrhea or increased GI motility, muscle weakness, heat intolerance, and diaphoresis. The signs and symptoms of thyroid hormone exposure to peripheral tissues reflect a hypermetabolic state. A patient with hyperthyroidism classically presents with signs and symptoms that reflect this state of increased metabolic activity. Common symptoms that a patient may report include unintentional weight loss despite unchanged oral intake, palpitations, diarrhea or increased frequency of bowel movements, heat intolerance, diaphoresis, and/or menstrual irregularities.

Physical examination of the thyroid may or may not reveal an enlarged thyroid (goiter). The thyroid may be diffusely enlarged, or one or more nodules may be palpated. The thyroid may be painless to palpation or extremelyÂ tender to even light palpation.
