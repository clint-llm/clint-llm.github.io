Philadelphia orthopedic surgeon John Rhea Barton first described a Barton fracture. It is a fracture of the distal radius which extends through the dorsal aspect of the articular surface with associated dislocation of the radiocarpal joint; however, since there is no disruption of the radiocarpal ligaments, the articular surface of the fractured distal radius remains in contact with the proximal carpal row. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of barton's fracture and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Barton fracture. 
- Review the evaluation of a patient with a suspected Barton fracture. 
- Outline the treatment and management options available for Barton's fracture. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with Barton fractures.
