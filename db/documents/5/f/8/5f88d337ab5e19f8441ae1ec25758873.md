A comprehensive psychiatric assessment is warranted after the completion of a history and physical exam. Since this disorder is rarely self-reported, these individuals are often mandated by the courts to seek evaluation and treatment. The evaluator needs to be non-judgmental and make attempts to ask open-ended questions to gather as much information as possible. It is important to note that it is not unusual for more than paraphilia to be present in an individual. Often a history of premature ejaculation is noted.
