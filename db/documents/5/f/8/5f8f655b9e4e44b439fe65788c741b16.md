Hypoglycemia is uncommonly seen in adults without diabetes mellitus. However, all patients should undergo evaluation and management who develop symptoms and/or signs of hypoglycemia (Whipple's triad), evidence of low blood glucose (55 mg/dL), and resolution of symptoms and/or signs after an increase in blood glucose level. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of non-diabetic hypoglycemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of non-diabetic hypoglycemia.
- Review the pathophysiology of non-diabetic hypoglycemia.
- Outline the evaluation and management of non-diabetic hypoglycemia.
- Summarize the interprofessional team management of educating the patient with regards to non-diabetic hypoglycemia.
