Afatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is a widely used medication for non-small cell lung carcinoma. Afatinib is a targeted therapy that irreversibly inhibits the ErbB family of tyrosine kinases. It is the first-line FDA-approved indication to treat locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that harbors nonresistant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, and the second-line treatment of advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Afatinib is also under investigation as monotherapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer who had progressed despite trastuzumab treatment. This activity educates health care providers on the indications, mechanism of action, adverse reactions, and toxicity. It also reviews the necessity of enhancing health care outcomes by improving the interprofessional approach to managing the drug.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of afatinib.
- Describe the possible adverse effects of afatinib.
- Summarize the appropriate monitoring for patients using afatinib. 
- Review interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance afatinib use and improve outcomes.
