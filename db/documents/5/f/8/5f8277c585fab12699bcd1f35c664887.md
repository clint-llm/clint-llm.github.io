Two principal conditions can lead to orthostatic hypotension: intravascular volume depletion and abnormal autonomic reflexes. Multiple disorders can cause an abnormal autonomic response, but about a third of patients with OH have no identifiable cause.

- Acute-Nonneurogenic: dehydration, medications, adrenal insufficiency, infection, myocardial infarction

- Chronic-Neurogenic: (Central) brain steam lesions, Parkinson disease, Lewy body dementia; (Peripheral) pure autonomic failure, diabetic neuropathy

Predisposing factors: Dehydration, deconditioning, malnutrition and aging. Medications associated with OH are antihypertensives, diuretics, vasodilators, antipsychotics, ethanol, opiates, and antidepressants.
