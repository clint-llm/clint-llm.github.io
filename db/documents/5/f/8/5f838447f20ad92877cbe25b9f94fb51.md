Carpal instability requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team, including family clinicians, orthopedic wrist specialists, nurses, and physical therapists.

Carpal instability can be easily missed, especially in the early stages, before radiographic changes occur. This type of injury must be considered in any patient with wrist pain following a fall onto an outstretched or extended hand. A thorough physical examination and obtaining the appropriate radiographs can assist providers in their medical decision-making. If there is clinical suspicion of carpal ligament injury, advanced imaging and a possible referral to a hand specialist should be considered. Acute treatment of these injuries can prevent the patient from experiencing chronic wrist pain and corresponding potential debility. Also, the role of a physical therapist after the surgical or conservative management of such injuries is paramount to optimal recovery.

All interprofessional team members must exercise open communication with other care team members if they note any issues or changes in the patient's status and must keep accurate and updated records of all interventions and interactions with the patient so that everyone involved in the case can access the same information. This interprofessional approach will yield the best possible patient results. [Level 5]
