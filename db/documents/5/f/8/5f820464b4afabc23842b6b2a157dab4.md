Upadacitinib is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, mainly the CYP3A4 enzyme, and eliminated in the feces, urine, and metabolites with a drug half-life of 8 to 14 hours (hrs).

Upadacitinib was also found to be teratogenic in animal studies, although no studies during pregnancy in humans have been reported. Its use in pregnancy is not recommended. Contraception use is advised during treatment and four weeks post-treatment with upadacitinib. Upadacitinib was also present in breast milk during animal studies, and females are advised not to breastfeed while receiving therapy.

Recent updates in upadacitinib use include an increased rate of all-cause mortality and sudden cardiovascular-associated mortality from concomitant use with another JAK inhibitor agent versus Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) inhibitors in subjects with RA.
