Hypersensitivity reactions are most commonly encountered in the context of immunology. Suture hypersensitivity refers to the clinical entities resulting from an exaggerated immunologic response triggered by the presence of a suture material, which serves as an external antigen. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of suture hypersensitivity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of suture hypersensitivity.
- Describe the physical examination findings of suture hypersensitivity.
- Review the management options available for suture hypersensitivity.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination and improve outcomes for patients affected with suture hypersensitivity.
