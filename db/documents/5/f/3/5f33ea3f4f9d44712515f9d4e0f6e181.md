In addition to the classic portions of the history of present illness, important details to elicit during history taking include:

- Time of delivery or abortion

- Surgical or vaginal delivery

- Prior surgical and medical history history

- Gestational age at the time of the delivery or abortion

- Complications of the pregnancy, including gestational diabetes, intrapartum infections, premature or prolonged rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, or preeclampsia/eclampsia

- Complications of the delivery, including prolonged labor, need for operative vaginal delivery, unplanned cesarean section, and postpartum hemorrhage

- GBS status

- Presence of foul-smelling lochia or excessive vaginal bleeding

Physical examination should include:

- Evaluation of the surgical incision (if present)

- Examination of the skin for crepitance, bullae, erythema, induration or drainage

- Palpation of the abdomen and the uterine fundus

- Sterile speculum and bimanual examination

In endometritis, fever is often the first sign, with uterine tenderness, bleeding, and foul-smelling lochia as additional signs. Patients presenting with signs of severe systemic illness, shock, and/or abdominal pain out of proportion to examination findings should raise suspicion for infection with GAS, which can cause endometritis associated with toxic shock syndrome as well as necrotizing fasciitis.

Fever is common in septic abortion but may not be present.Clostridium species or toxin-producing strains of Escherichia coli.

Superficial incisional site infections typically present with erythema, warmth, and pain at the site; purulent drainage may also be present.

Deep incisional infections may show minimal external examination findings, in fact, pain out of proportion to examination is a hallmark of necrotizing fasciitis. Unlike superficial site infections, deep incisional infections are more likely to be associated with fever and hemodynamic compromise.

Septic pelvic thrombophlebitis (SPT) should be suspected in patients with persistent pain, leukocytosis, and fever despite adequate antibiotic therapy for the above conditions for more than 3Â to 5 days.
