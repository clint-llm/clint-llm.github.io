Infection with Campylobacter is typically self-limiting and mild. The focus of interventions in healthy patients are hydration and electrolyte repletion. Hydration may be oral or parenteral depending on the severity of illness and degree of dehydration. Avoid anti-motility agents as they can impede the resolution of the infection.

Campylobacter infections are best treated with macrolide antibiotics.Campylobacter strains in Canada previously showed an 8.6% resistance to tetracyclines in 1981; this has increased to 56% in more recent studies.
