- Craniosynostosis is a premature fusion of one or more sutures and is a common condition (1 per 2000 to 1 per 2500) that can categorize into syndromic and non-syndromic types.

- The most common non-syndromic craniosynostosis is by premature fusion of the sagittal suture.

- In syndromic cases, the most commonly affected genes are FGF receptor genes.

- Early surgical management between 6 to 12 months is the treatment of choice in syndromic craniosynostosis.

- Positional plagiocephaly does not require surgical therapy.

- The degree of developmental delay is dependent on the kind of craniosynostosis. Children with sagittal synostosis have a lower risk of learning disabilities compared to those with metopic, uni-coronal, or lambdoid synostosis.

- With early identification of developmental gaps and placement in support programs, a negative academic and cognitive outcome for these children could be reduced if not prevented.

- An interprofessional approach to care is essential in the management of patients.
