The phrenic nerve originates at the C3 through C5 nerve roots, which exits the spinal canal at the neck root and descends caudally, parallel to the pericardial sac to provide the motor innervation to the diaphragm. The phrenic nerve must be identified in cervical and thoracic surgical dissection to preserve the neuromuscular pathways. Superior to the clavicle, the phrenic nerve can be located in the posterior triangle of the neck, superficial to the anterior scalene. In the mediastinum, the phrenic nerves can be identified with lateral retraction of the lungs to reveal the pericardial sac where the phrenic nerves pass anteriorly to the root of the lung. The phrenic nerves are located on the lateral aspects with accompanying pericardiophrenic arteries and superior phrenic veins.

Lesions to either the left or right phrenic nerve will cause relative elevation of the ipsilateral dome of the diaphragm, ultimately paralyzing it from contraction and depression during inspiration. The right phrenic nerve is at risk of being severed with vena cava clamping as the phrenic nerve enters the caval diaphragmatic opening with the inferior vena cava at T8.
