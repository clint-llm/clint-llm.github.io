A thorough history and physical is paramount to an accurate diagnosis. The account will vary slightly depending on the affected venous drainage basin: axillary, penile, or anterior chest wall. The historyÂ will, however, involve aspects consistent with Virchow's triad of stasis, hypercoagulability, and vessel wall damage. Patients will complain of a sudden onset of mild discomfort with a palpable cord in the affected area. Penile lesions may involve a history of excessive sexual activity, trauma, or abstinence.
