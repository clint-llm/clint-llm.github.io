**Vestibular Schwannoma**

Also known as acoustic neuromas, benign tumors of the Schwann cells arise from the vestibular portion of the CN 8. These growths most commonly appear at the cerebellopontine angle, the region between the cerebellum and the pons. Patients with vestibular schwannoma commonly experience progressive ipsilateral hearing loss and tinnitus as the tumor grows and compresses the cochlear portion of the CN VIII. Imbalance or rarely vertigo also accompanies hearing loss due to the damaged vestibular portion of the CN VIII. Patients will also experience nystagmus when the cerebellar flocculus becomes compressed. If untreated, large tumors may further involve other structures such as the CN VII or CN V. Due to their proximity to the CN VIII, facial nerve damage may lead to facial paralysis. CN V lesion may result in numbness and tingling sensation on the face.

**Oscillopsia**

Damage of the vestibulo-ocular reflex leads to oscillopsia. The incoordination between the vestibular and ocular systems prevents the information about head and body movements from reaching the oculomotor centers. As a result, the patient has difficulty fixating on a target point while the head turns. Bilateral loss of vestibular function leads the patient to believe that the world is moving with head movements. Vertigo, dizziness, and imbalance are common symptoms of oscillopsia.

**Wallenberg Syndrome**

Because the PICA innervates multiple organs such as the inferior cerebellar peduncle, vestibular nuclei, spinal tract and nucleus of CN V, and posterior cerebellum, its occlusion results in various symptoms. Vertigo, loss of balance, and vomiting may result due to its involvement with the vestibular nuclei. A patient with the syndrome also presents ipsilateral cerebellar signs due to its involvement with the inferior cerebellar peduncle and cerebellum. Ipsilateral ataxia can also present. Patients with the syndrome tend to fall to the ipsilateral side. Loss of ipsilateral facial pain sensation can also occur due to its association with the spinal tract and nucleus of CN V.
