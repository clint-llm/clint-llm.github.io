Healthcare professionals caring for patients receiving commercial CAR-T products must complete product-specific Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) training.

Every CAR-T center has institutional guidelines to evaluate the patients for related toxicities, depending on whether the CAR-T product was infused in an inpatient or outpatient setting. Generally, in an outpatient setting, patients are evaluated once daily for both CRS and ICANS-related features for at least 14 days and up to 30 days post-infusion. If the CAR-T therapy is administered inpatient, vitals are typically assessed every 4 hours; the ICE score is at least once a day, with a daily comprehensive physical exam and blood work including complete blood count (CBC) and complete metabolic panel (CMP).

If a patient is admitted with an AE such as CRS, vital signs are checked more frequently, ideally every 2-4 hours, immune effector cell-associated encephalopathy (ICE) score is evaluated at least once a day and up to every 8 hours, and blood work including CBC, CMP, and other relevant tests are done once to twice daily.

Most centers alert neurology service for a neurological evaluation of the patient before the CAR-T administration. However, in case of a suspected or confirmed ICANS-related toxicity, a neurological exam is performed at least 4-6 hourly or more frequently if a decline in the neurological status is noted.
