Left ventricular outflow tract obstruction is a group of variable diseases. It may be congenital or acquired over time. It may occur in isolation or concomitantly with other congenital heart diseases. The uncorrected disease leads to a chronic increase in afterload, left ventricular hypertrophy, and ultimately LV dilatation and failure. It involves all age groups, so knowledge of the disease is essential for pediatricians and adult practitioners.Â All patients with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction are at high risk for developing infective endocarditis, and prophylaxis should be instituted.
