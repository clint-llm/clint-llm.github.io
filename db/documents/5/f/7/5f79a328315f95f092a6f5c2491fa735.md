The various etiological factors that can disrupt the normal corneal epithelial healing process can be broadly classified into the following categories.

**Defective Epithelial Adhesion**

Proposed Mechanisms

- Defective adherence of epithelial cells to the basement membrane

- Deficient or abnormal basement membrane

- Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) overproduction

- Disruption of migration of regenerating epithelial cells

Associated conditions - Recurrent corneal erosions, epithelial basement membrane dystrophies, band-shaped keratopathy, bullous keratopathy, Salzmann nodular degeneration

**Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency**

- Proposed mechanism- Deficient regeneration of disrupted epithelium

- Associated conditions- Limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), chemical injury, trauma

**Inflammation**

Proposed Mechanisms

- Overactivity of inflammatory markers

- Excess production of chemotactic factors, growth factors, proteases

- Proliferation and migration of regenerating epithelial cells

- Stromal remodeling and even melting

Associated conditions- Autoimmune diseases, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, rosacea, Sjogren syndrome, peripheral ulcerative keratitis, Mooren ulcer, Steven-Johnson syndrome, graft versus host disease

**Neurotrophic**

- Proposed mechanism- Disruption of corneal innervation

- Associated conditions- Diabetes mellitus, herpetic keratitis, anesthetic abuse, severe dry eye, post-traumatic nerve damage

**Surface Trauma**

- Proposed mechanism- Epithelial cell loss exceeds the regeneration capacity of epithelial stem cells due to recurrent mechanical insult to the ocular surface.

- Associated conditions- Entropion, ectropion, lagophthalmos, trachoma, severe dry eye, corneal injury due to chemical or thermal burns

**Hereditary**

- Proposed mechanisms- Hereditary deficient limbal stem cells, abnormal basement membrane

- Associated conditions- Aniridia, epithelial and basement membrane dystrophies
