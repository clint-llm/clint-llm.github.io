The agency for toxic substances and disease registry (ATSDR) provides the following patient education information. The general public has low exposure levels to iodine. Food (iodized salt) is the primary source of exposure.  The general public is rarely exposed to radioactive iodine unless they have specific tests or treatment of thyroid disease. Iodine is both potentially beneficial and harmful. The thyroid requires iodine to produce thyroid hormones. Conversely, exposure to unnecessarily high levels of iodine can result in damage to the thyroid.
