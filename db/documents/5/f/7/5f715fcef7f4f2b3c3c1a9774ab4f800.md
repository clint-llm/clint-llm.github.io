Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare progressive and often underdiagnosed immune-mediated disorder of the central nervous system characterized by progressive rigidity and triggered painful spasms of predominantly axial and proximal limb muscles. The condition has an insidious onset with gradual worsening over time and, if left untreated, can lead to permanent disability and mortality. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients with SPS and emphasizes the importance of the interprofessional approach to managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of stiff person syndrome (SPS).
- Describe the clinical presentation and diagnostic criteria of stiff person syndrome (SPS).
- Summarize the management options for stiff person syndrome (SPS).
- Outline the importance of early recognition of patients with stiff person syndrome (SPS) and an interprofessional approach to improve outcomes.
