ACE inhibitors, including quinapril, are contraindicated in pregnancyÂ since they counteract the RAAS, which is essential for fetal renal development.

Quinapril is also contraindicated in patients presenting with hyperkalemia, history, or current angioedema (regardless of the ACE inhibitor used), bilateral renal artery stenosis, acute kidney injury leading to renal failure with prior ACE inhibitor use, and aliskiren use within the last 36 hours.
