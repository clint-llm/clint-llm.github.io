Patient education about urinary tract infections and personal hygiene may be of some help. Suggestions include:

- Washing hands before wiping after urination

- Using adult or baby wipes instead of toilet paper for cleaning after urination

- Voiding soon after sexual activity

- Avoiding baths

- Use only a clean, fresh, soft washcloth (soft cotton or microfiber) to wash the vaginal area

- Use a liquid soap with minimal potentially toxic or potentially irritating ingredients. Baby shampoo has been recommended as hair and the vaginal area both prefer the same pH.

- Cleaning the vaginal area first when in the shower to avoid potential contamination if cleaned later
