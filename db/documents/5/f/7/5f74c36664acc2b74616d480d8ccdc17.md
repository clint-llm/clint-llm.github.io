Jarisch Herxheimer reaction (JHR) is a common occurrence among the subgroup of patients undergoing antibiotic treatment for spirochetal infections. The clinician should maintain a high index of suspicion of JHR and effectively differentiate all other similar conditions such as drug allergy, sepsis, and viral infections. All members of theÂ interprofessional team should be aware and trained appropriately to recognize the symptoms of JHR and act accordingly. The management of serious patients mandates proper communication and coordination among multiple specialties. While JHR is usually transient, benign, and self-limiting, every case must be addressed cautiously as there is the potential for severe and even fatal complications.
