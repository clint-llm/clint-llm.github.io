Although rare, the most serious complication of acute hepatitis is progression to acute liver failure (ALF) which is characterized by 2-3 times increase in serum transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, coagulopathy, and rapid onset of hepatic encephalopathy in patients without any prior liver disease

In the US and much of Europe, acute liver failure is most often secondary to acetaminophen hepatotoxicity or idiosyncratic drug reactions contributing approximately 40Â to 50% of ALF cases. In low-resource countries, viral infections are the most common cause of ALF

The specific etiology of acute liver failure is also an essential predictor for spontaneous recovery. Approximately 75% of patients spontaneously recover from acetaminophen (paracetamol) induced failure, but only about 40% spontaneously recover from other causes

Patients with acute liver failure should be considered for liver transplant and should be promptly transferred to transplant centers. There are several prognostic screening tools for ALF and the assessment for emergent liver transplantation. Two of the most common risk scores used to assess for transplant evaluation are the **King's College Criteria**and the**Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) Score**
