**Diabetic Insipidus**

The medication recommended in the acute and chronic setting of central DI is desmopressin.

**SIADH Secretion**

Fluid restriction is the primary treatment for SIADH secretion. Fluids should be reduced to 500 to 800 ml/day. Correction should be aimed to reach serum sodium of 130 mEq/L. If hyponatremia persists, the patient should receive salt tablets and furosemide 20 mg twice a day. Isotonic fluids will not correct the deficit; therefore, 3% hypertonic (513 mOsm/kg) should be given for severe hypernatremia. A bolus of 100 ml is given in 3 hours, and repeat bolus can be given as needed based on the serum electrolytes. In TBI, hypertonic saline will also help to reduce intracranial pressure. Correction should not be more than 8 mEq/L over 24 hours or 0.5 to 1 mEq/L per hour to prevent osmotic demyelination syndrome. For persistent hyponatremia, oral tolvaptan or intravenous conivaptan, which are vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists, are given.
