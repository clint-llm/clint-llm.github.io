Complications due to cardiac tumors are mechanical.

Embolization causing strokes is a frequent complication that can present as stroke, and later while doing stroke workup, can find the cardiac mass.

Valvular disease, such as obstruction or insufficiency, is common when the mass is adjacent to the leaflets. Syncope can occur when there is a blood flow obstructionÂ due to the mass, causing hypoperfusion to the brain and the coronaries, also predisposing to tachyarrhythmias.

The presence of masses next to the conduction system in the epicardium and myocardium can generate electrical abnormalities as atrioventricular block, complete heart block, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Pericardial involvement and pericardial effusion can cause a hemodynamic disturbance with hypotension, shortness of breath, and even cardiac tamponade.
