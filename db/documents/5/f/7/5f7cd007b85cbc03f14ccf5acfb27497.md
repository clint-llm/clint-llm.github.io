A few tips can optimize the successful performance and clinical and aesthetic results of an elliptical excision:

- To incise straight lines running tangential the circular or oval lesion and required margins, rather than rounding all lines. This will result in more acute angles at the ends of the wound, with less chance of standing cones.

- When performing the incision, rest both hands on the patient and stretch the skin in three directions, using the hand holding the scalpel as one "point" and using two fingers on the other hand as the other two points.

- Start the incision with the tip of the blade at the end of the defect, then use the rounded belly of the blade for the remainder of the excision. Try to maintain an even plane of cutting, using as few passes of the blade as possible.

- Use only as much undermining as necessary. Often, no undermining is needed at all, or just enough to allow proper placement of buried vertical mattress stitches. More undermining creates more "dead space" in which hematomas may collect.

- When bandaging linear incisions, make sure to run tape strips perpendicular to the incision line, thus minimizing tension across the incision line.
