Contraindications to treatment with 5-FU include patients with a documented deficiency of the enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). This enzyme is responsible for degrading over 80% of 5-FU to biologically inactive metabolites, and deficiency can result in life-threatening toxicity.

Breastfeeding is also a contraindication to systemic 5-FU treatment. However, some studies suggest that intermittent therapy can be performed safely. The topical use of 5-FU on the breast is not a contraindication with breastfeeding, but steps are necessary to avoid direct contact between the treated skin and the infant’s skin.

5-FU has been shown to interact with many other pharmaceutical agents. Therefore, drug interactions should be checked before beginning treatment with 5-FU.
