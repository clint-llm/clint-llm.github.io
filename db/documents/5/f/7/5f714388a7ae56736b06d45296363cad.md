Pre-excitation is a term that refers to the premature activation of the ventricles. Previously used when referring to Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW), pre-excitation has been expanded to include any rhythm with antegrade ventricular or retrograde atrial activation via an accessory pathway. These pathways may be partially or completely separate from the normal conduction system. The Lown-Ganong-Levine (LGL) pattern was described in 1952 by Bernard Lown, William Francis Ganong, and Samual Levine and is theorized to involve an accessory pathway that partially or completely bypasses the atrioventricular (AV) node resulting in the direct activation of the bundle of His by the sinoatrial (SA) node.Â Lown-Ganong-Levine (LGL) syndrome is an outdated clinical diagnosis with no known unique underlying anatomic correlate.
