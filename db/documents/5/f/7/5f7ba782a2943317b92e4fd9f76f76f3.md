A general rule-of-thumb when thinking about the risks of chemexfoliation is that the deeper the peel correlates with increased therapeutic effects but also more significant risks.

Complications for chemical peeling can be classified into immediate (minutes to hours) or delayed (days to weeks):

- Immediate complications include skin edema, burning, and itching sensations, and blistering. Complications requiring emergent management include anaphylactic reactions, inadvertent ocular mucosal splashes, and cardiac arrhythmia with phenol application. Hence, liver and kidney function testing is encouraged before phenol peeling to reduce the chance of toxicity.

- Delayed complications include bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. Chemoprophylaxis can be a consideration with medium and deep peels. Scarring can occur as well, the risk factors for which are skin "picking," recent isotretinoin use, exposure to therapeutic radiation, history of keloid formation, and aggressive peeling in thin-skinned regions such as the neck. Prolonged erythema, acne, and milia eruptions are potential risks, but these tend to be self-limited. Patients with Fitzpatrick skin types IV to VI, estrogen use, pregnancy, or excessive sun exposure may be more prone to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.
