It is believed that a multifactorial process leads to the formation of saccular aneurysms. Hemodynamic stress on the internal elastic lamina causes breakdown over time. This is coupled with vibrations from turbulent blood flow, causing structural fatigue. There is also evidence that T-cell and macrophage-mediated inflammation causes histologic changes within the vascular wall contributing to aneurysmal formation and growth. The process is expedited and amplified in patients with certain risk factors as described previously. Conversely, fusiform aneurysms are predominantly caused by atherosclerosis and mycotic aneurysms from septic emboli present in infectious endocarditis.
