Deformities of the fifth toe are often congenital and include deformities such as an overlapping fifth toe or a congenital curly toe. Many of these deformities are asymptomatic, while some can result in discomfort and limitations on shoewear. Overlapping fifth toes and congenital curly toes do not appear to have an increased prevalence based on gender, and the condition is commonly a bilateral finding; for example, 13.8% was estimated to be the prevalence of bunionette deformity, and 61.2% of people had a positive family history. This activity reviews the deformities involving the fifth toe and the anatomy relevant to diagnosis and treatment and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy relevant to deformities of the fifth toe. 
- Describe the common deformities encountered in the fifth toe. 
- Outline the appropriate treatment options for common deformities of the fifth toe. 
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional collaboration in the diagnosis and treatment of fifth toe deformities.
