Pericytes are fundamental cells for the health, formation, and function of blood vessels. The latter was discovered in the 19th century by Rouget, but Zimmerman renamed them pericytes by Zimmermann. Depending on their location, they take on different roles and importance; in the brain and retina, they become fundamental to build the blood-retinal barrier and the blood-brain barrier. In the kidneys, they influence the functionality of the glomeruli for filtration; in the liver vessels, they are essential for the remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Recent evidence demonstrates their role in vessel immune response and phagocytic activity. The blood vessel must always be considered different, depending on the anatomical area and the demand of the tissue for the same blood vessel.
