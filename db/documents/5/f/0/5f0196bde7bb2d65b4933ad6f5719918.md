In the simplest sense, ablative laser skin resurfacing describes the process of removing the epidermal and superficial dermal layers of the skin to reduce cutaneous signs of photoaging. Other indications for ablative laser skin resurfacing include scarring, actinic keratoses, seborrheic keratoses, and facial wrinkles. This activity outlines and describes ablative laser options and their current uses in skin resurfacing. The differences between fractional and non-fractional lasers are highlighted, with consideration given to appropriate patient selection.
