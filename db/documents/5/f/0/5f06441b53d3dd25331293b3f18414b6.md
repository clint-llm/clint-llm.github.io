Intranasal corticosteroids are generally safe in the treatment of nasal polyps and rarely cause side effects. Occasional adverse reactions reported include epistaxis and nasal mucosa ulceration. Although more effective, oral steroids have a higher incidence of systemic side effects. They must be given cautiously to patients suffering from diabetes mellitus and hypertension, as these might trigger uncontrolled blood glucose levels and hypertensive crises in vulnerable individuals. Gastric ulcers, osteoporosis, and psychiatric conditions are relative contraindications for their use. They should also be avoided in patients with known tuberculosis as they might reactivate the disease.
