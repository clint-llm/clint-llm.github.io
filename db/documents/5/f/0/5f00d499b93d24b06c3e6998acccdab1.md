Robust data and literature suggest that the internal mammary artery (IMA) undergoes minimal atherosclerotic changes and has excellent long term outcomes and patient survival compared to superior vena cava graft (SVG). Its survival and patency rates are much better as compared to venous and even other arterial grafts. Hence the IMA graft is considered to be the first choice conduit and the gold standard for coronary artery bypass graft.
