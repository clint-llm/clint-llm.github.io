Several pathological criteria are present for diagnosing pulmonary hypoplasia, but there is no particular gold standard. The most commonly used measure is the lung weight to body weight ratio (LW: BW). The typical ratio is 0.012 for more than 28 weeks of gestation and 0.015 for younger fetuses. The pitfall of the criteria is that it is affected by pulmonary congestion or pulmonary edema.

The second method for detecting hypoplasia is the radial alveolar count, which was initially proposed by Emery and Mithal. The radial alveolar count (RAC) is defined as the number of alveoli crossing a line drawn from a respiratory bronchioleÂ center to the nearest and definitive connective tissue septum. Askenazi and Perlman did a modification with the counting of the alveolar septae instead of the alveoli. They suggested that radial alveolar count (RAC) <75 % of the mean or LW: BW of less than or equal to 0.012 to be used for diagnosing pulmonary hypoplasia.
