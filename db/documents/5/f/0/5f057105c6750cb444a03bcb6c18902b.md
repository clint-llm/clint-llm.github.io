Following treatment, patients can expect to have regular follow-ups. Patients must understand that they must report any new symptoms that may arise between appointments. Patients may also need psychological support to deal with their illness, and these resources should be provided to help them manage any feelings ofÂ anger, resentment, guilt, anxiety, and fear.
