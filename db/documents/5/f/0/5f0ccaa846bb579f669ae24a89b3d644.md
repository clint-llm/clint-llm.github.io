Acne conglobata (AC) is a rare but severe form of nodulocystic acne. It usually presents with tender, disfiguring, double or triple interconnecting comedones, cysts, inflammatory nodules, and deep burrowing abscesses on the face, shoulders, back, chest, upper arms, buttocks, and thighs. The comedones often occur in groups of three, and the cysts often contain purulent, foul-smelling material that is discharged on the skin surface. It is a chronic inflammatory disease that inevitably leads to scar formation and disfigurement. Acne conglobata may occur following the sudden worsening of pustular acne, or the disorder may occur gradually following the recrudescence of acne that has been quiet for many years.[2][3][4] This activity reviews the evaluation and management of acne conglobata and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how acne conglobata differs from acne fulminans.
- Explain the etiology of acne conglobata.
- Outline the treatment of choice for acne conglobata.
- Identify strategies that interprofessional team members can utilize to improve evaluation, management, and counseling for patients with acne conglobata.
