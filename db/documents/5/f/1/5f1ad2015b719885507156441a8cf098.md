Sudden pressure change in the esophagus and underlying bleeding tendency has been proposed as a mechanism of spontaneous intramural hematoma of the esophagus. Secondary IHE of the esophagus is thought to occur as a result of an acute injury that is similar in mechanism to Mallory-Weiss tear and Boerhaave syndrome; although, IHE represents an intermediate stage. The proposed initiating cause for the development of this condition is the sudden bleeding between the mucosa and muscularis propria of the esophageal wall, at times involving a long segment of the esophagus. This progressive submucosal dissection due to bleeding leads to symptoms varying from severe pain to signs of obstruction of the esophageal lumen. Breach of the mucosa, which confines the hematoma, can occur at a later stage, and this then presents as hematemesis. Patients on anticoagulants therapy are at a higher risk factor in developing IHE.
