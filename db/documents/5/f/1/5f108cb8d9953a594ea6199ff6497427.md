A pneumothorax, also known as a collapsed lung, occurs when air (either from the lung or outside) collects in the space between the lung and the chest wall. The focus of this article is the specific cause of a collapsed lung, called iatrogenic or caused accidentally during surgery or a procedure. Symptoms of a collapsed are a sharp or stabbing chest pain and/or trouble breathing. People with small amounts of air may not have any symptoms at all. This condition can be an emergency and require immediate treatment. Treatment involves extracting the air trapped between the lung and the chest wall by either a needle, scalpel and finger, or chest tube. Regardless, a chest tube is inserted and stays in place until the lung expands to its normal size. Some individuals with severe cases may require surgery. After being treated for a collapsed lung with a tube, chances of having a recurrence is low but possible. Patients should avoid scuba diving and flying in a plane for at least 72 hours.
