The basilar artery is a vital vessel contributing to the posterior cerebral circulation. It is formed at the junction of the pons and medulla by the convergence of the dual vertebral arteries. The vertebral arteries join the basilar artery to form the vertebrobasilar system, which supplies blood to the posterior portion of the circle of Willis. Its crucial purpose is to serve the cerebellum, brainstem, thalamus, occipital, and medial temporal lobes of the brain with oxygen-rich blood. With an average diameter of 3 to 4 millimeters, it furnishes 20 paramedian and circumflex perforating arteries thus providing a robust collateral network to the pons and midbrain. Throughout its course, the basilar artery distributes the median, paramedian, short, and long circumferential branches. It is located on the ventral surface of the neuronal "bridge" also known as the pons (Latin for "bridge") that connects the forebrain to the cerebellum.
