**Differences Between Cone Beam Computed Tomography Scanners (CBCT) and Medical Computed Tomography Scanners (CT)**

- Cone beam computed tomography scanners are less expensive than CT scanners. They cost approximately 3 to 5 times less.

- Cone beam computed tomography scanner equipment is smaller and lighter.

- Cone beam computed tomography scanners have a better spatial resolution (smaller pixels).

- The room does not have to be in a particular temperature (cold) for cone beam computed tomography scanners. They can be installed in a dental office.

- Cone beam computed tomography scanners do not need electrical requirements like CT scanners.

- No floor strengthening is required for cone beam computed tomography scanners.

- Cone beam computed tomography scanners are easy to operate.

**Patient Positioning**

Depending on the cone beam computed tomography machine, patients may stand, sit, or lie on a table. In-office 2D imaging usually involves sitting or standing. For 3D cone beam imaging, minimizing patient movement is instrumental in obtaining high-quality images and reducing picture blur and motion. Dentists should consider this when choosing the appropriate patient positioning for cone beam computed tomography imaging.

In most cases, CBCT is taken while the patient is sitting or standing. However, some devices may require the patient to lie supine for imaging. Nowadays, most devices can take both panoramic radiographs and CBCTs.

**Exposure Dose**

Voxels in dental cone beam computed tomography imaging are rectangular cuboids with sides varying in length from 0.08 to 0.4 mm. The field of view (FOV) width can range between 4 to 20 cm, and its height can range from 3 to 20 cm. The tube voltage can be set between 60 and 120 kV, and the current can range from 1 to 10 mA. The duration of each imaging session can vary between 5 to 40 seconds.

The exposure dose amount during dental cone beam computed tomography imaging can significantly differ based on the imaging conditions. The effective dose from a single imaging session can range between 10 to 1000 μSv. The exposure dose primarily depends on the lateral area of the FOV, which is the product of its height and width. Therefore, selecting the smallest FOV that fulfills the imaging objective is crucial to reduce the exposure dose. It is essential to exercise caution when dealing with large-diameter FOVs, as the exposure dose can be higher than that of CT under low-dose conditions.

The FOV should be adjustable to select an optimal FOV to meet the imaging objective. A small FOV can be set to visualize a few teeth, and a much larger FOV can be chosen when imaging the entire head.

In principle, dental cone beam computed tomography voxel values can be unstable because the diameter of the FOV is generally smaller than that of the patient's head. As a result, a complete set of image data cannot be acquired, making it impossible to calculate mathematically correct CT values for image reconstruction. Additionally, while the effective doses for conventional intraoral, panoramic, and cephalometric radiography range from 1-8 µSv, the exposure dose from dental cone beam computed tomography can exceed this amount by more than ten times, even under low-dose conditions. Therefore, it is essential to exercise caution when using dental cone beam computed tomography imaging.

**Scanning Time**

The scanning time in cone beam computed tomography goes from 5 to 40 seconds. The exposure times are less because of the pulsing of the X-ray beam, ranging from 1 second up to 40 seconds. The times differ between scanners from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the model.

**Procedure**

The healthcare provider must conduct a thorough interview and document the patient's medical history. If the lesions appear restricted to teeth, jaw, or other dental hard tissues, intraoral or panoramic radiography should be done to obtain the necessary information for an accurate diagnosis. If the knowledge gained from the radiography is insufficient to diagnose the problem and the patient does not require urgent irreversible surgery like tooth extraction, palliative treatment should be given while monitoring the patient's condition.

Dental cone beam computed tomography should not be performed at this stage unless the results would change the treatment plan. However, if vague symptoms persist or irreversible treatments are necessary, dental cone beam computed tomography may be appropriate to provide safe and dependable care with 3D anatomic information. Neglecting to perform dental cone beam computed tomography when required would harm the patient, even if there's a risk of radiation exposure.

Other imaging techniques, like medical-grade CT or MRI, should be used to diagnose soft tissue pathology instead of dental cone beam computed tomography. The smallest possible FOV should be chosen during imaging to minimize radiation exposure.

A dental radiologist may be consulted to increase the diagnostic accuracy when imaging a large area and when a lesion suspected to be a tumor is found with small-field imaging.

**Cone Beam Computed Tomography General Recommendations**

- 2D radiography or plain radiography is the imaging modality of choice. However, cone beam computed tomography should be considered when the diagnosis cannot be adequately made with 2D imaging. When utilizing cone beam computed tomography, it is vital to use established criteria to select an appropriate field of view (FOV).

- Conducting a comprehensive clinical assessment is crucial before utilizing cone beam computed tomography or any other radiation-based examination. Cone beam computed tomography, in particular, is associated with a higher dose of X-rays, and therefore, it is essential to exercise caution while determining the appropriate FOV to scan. When a small or medium FOV is sufficient for the intended purpose, it is advisable to avoid using a large FOV.

- Imaging with cone beam computed tomography before implant surgery is more useful than post-implant imaging.

- The effective doses for dentoalveolar cone beam computed tomography range from 11 to 674 μSv. The effective doses for craniofacial cone beam computed tomography range from 30 to 1,073 μSv.

- Cone beam computed tomography is appropriate in cases where a tooth is impacted, infected, or missing, and 2D radiography fails to detect the underlying pathology. Cone beam computed tomography can be used for pre-implant planning, preoperative evaluation, and postsurgical assessment in various oral-surgical, periodontal, endodontic, restorative, and prosthodontic scenarios.

- To reduce radiation exposure in children and adolescents, it is crucial to utilize dose-sparing techniques that follow the ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) principle. This principle involves minimizing radiation exposure to the lowest possible level while achieving the intended diagnostic result. Using such techniques can significantly reduce the effective doses of radiation, thereby minimizing the potential long-term health risks associated with excessive radiation exposure.
