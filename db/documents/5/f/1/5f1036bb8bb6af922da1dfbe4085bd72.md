Breast ultrasound has developed into a practical solution for the evaluation of breast disease. Although mammography remains the gold standard for breast cancer screening, it presents certain imaging limitations with dense breast parenchyma. Due to this reason, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been expanding their role as part of supplementary breast screening procedures.

The sensitivity for breast cancer detection using both mammography and ultrasound increases to 97.3%, with the false positive rate of ultrasound measured as 2.4%.
