Euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA, EDKA) is a clinical syndrome occurring both in type 1 (T1DM) and type 2 (T2DM) diabetes mellitus characterized by euglycemia (blood glucose less than 250 mg/dL) in the presence of severe metabolic acidosis (arterial pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L) and ketonemia. DKA is one of the most severe and life-threatening complications of diabetes mellitus and can be seen in a variety of conditions. However, the incidence of EDKA has grown with the introduction of sodium-glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.
