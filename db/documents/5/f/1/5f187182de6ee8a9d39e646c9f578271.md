Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists (also known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, incretin mimetics, or GLP-1 analogs) represent a class of medications used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus and, in some cases, obesity. Examples of drugs in this class include exenatide, lixisenatide, liraglutide, albiglutide, dulaglutide, and semaglutide. According to the American Diabetes Association, metformin remains the preferred first-line therapy for treating type 2 diabetes. However, the addition of a GLP-1 analog should be considered in patients with a contraindication or intolerance to metformin, in patients with a hemoglobin A1c greater than 1.5% over target, or in patients who do not reach their target A1c in three months, particularly in patients with atherosclerosis, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease.

Structurally, there are two broad categories of these agents; human GLP-1 backbone agents and exendin-4 backbone agents.

Human GLP-1 backbone:

- Dulaglutide

- Albiglutide

- Liraglutide

- Semaglutide

Exendin-4 backbone:

- Exenatide (two formulations)

- Lixisenatide

Tirzepatide isÂ a GIP analog that activates both the GLP-1 and GIP receptors.

Because of safety concerns, research on another agent, taspoglutide, has been halted in phase III trials.
