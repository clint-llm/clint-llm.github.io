Clinically, there are no distinct signs or symptoms of sufficient sensitivity that can accurately diagnose aortic rupture. Thus, aortic rupture may be difficult to detect and is often unnoticed as patients lack specific diagnostic symptoms. Instead, those who present to the emergency department following motor vehicle accidents or other high-impact events should be approached with a high suspicion for an aortic injury. Patients may have nonspecific complaints such as chest pain, sudden onset interscapular pain, dyspnea, or dysphagia. On physical exam chest wall trauma (seat belt or steering wheel lacerations, rib fractures, or flail chest), a left subclavicular hematoma, or a new onset murmur with auscultation may suggest aortic damage or rupture. Pseudo-coarctation presenting with upper extremity hypertension and hypotension in the lower extremities in addition to absent femoral pulses is another physical exam finding that increases suspicion for aortic rupture.

Most cases of aortic rupture occur with other associated injuries that may distract from or complicate diagnosis due to their severity. Associated injuries include closed head injury, multiple rib fractures, flail chest, pulmonary contusion, myocardial contusion, blunt diaphragmatic rupture, splenic or liver damage, small bowel injury, intraabdominal hemorrhage, spinal cord injuries, fractures (pelvic, femoral, tibial), upper extremity injury, and maxillofacial injury.
