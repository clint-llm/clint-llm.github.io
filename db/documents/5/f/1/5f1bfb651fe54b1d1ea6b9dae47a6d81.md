Bradykinin is a molecule that plays a crucial role in inflammation. Â In this review, we will discuss the cellular basis of bradykinin production, function, pathophysiology, and clinical significance. Bradykinin can act as a vasoactive substance along with histamine in inflammation and swelling as it is a potent vasodilator. Bradykinin also plays a significant role in the pathophysiology of C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency and in the clinical application of considering whether to use angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin two receptor blockers.
