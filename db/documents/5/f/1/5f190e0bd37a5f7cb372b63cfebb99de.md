The etiology of trigger finger is multifactorial. There are some associations with specific comorbid diseases in adult patients with trigger finger, for example, diabetes, amyloidosis, carpal tunnel syndrome, gout, thyroid disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Traumatic forces result in hypertrophy and narrowing of the tendon and its sheath, leading to the tendon being unable to slide smoothly within its sheath. This results in catching and locking.

In children, the etiology appears to be developmental, with a mismatch in the size of the flexor tendon of the thumb and its tendon sheath. The fibroblast proliferation results in a discrepancy in the size of the tendon and the A1 pulley sheath. Although the majority of the cases are idiopathic at this age, it is more commonly associated with congenital metabolic (e.g., Hurler syndrome) and inflammatory conditions (e.g., juvenile rheumatoid arthritis).
