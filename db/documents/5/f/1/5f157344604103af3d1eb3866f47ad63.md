Patients diagnosed with the peripheral vascular disease require a reasoned approach to account for age, risk factors, disease severity, and functional status. Management is divided into two broad categories aimed at decreasing cardiovascular events and improving symptoms. Persons with PAD are at increased risk of coronary artery disease mortality (relative risk = 6.6), cardiovascular mortality (relative risk = 5.9), and all-cause mortality (relative risk = 3.1).

**Cardiovascular Risk Factor Modification**

Aggressive risk factors modification is essential to lowering cardiovascular risk. Smoking cessation reduces the risk of PAD progression, cardiovascular events including myocardial infarction and stroke, and critical limb ischemia.

**Exercise Therapy**

Randomized trials have shown supervised exercise therapy programs to have significant improvement in claudication symptoms. A meta-analysis of 27 studies found exercise significantly improved pain-free walking distance by 269 feet and total walking distance by nearly 400 feet.

**Pharmacotherapy**

Pharmacological therapy for intermittent claudication (IC) management can be offered to patients who have not benefited from exercise therapy and risk factor modification.

Daily aspirin is recommended for overall cardiovascular care. No consensus has been reached on the most effective dose.

**Revascularization**

Patients who have debilitating symptoms unresponsive to risk factor modification and exercise and pharmacological therapy may be candidates for endovascular, surgical, or combined endovascular and surgical intervention. Indications for intervention include individuals with incapacitating claudication interfering with daily activity and limb salvage in patients with critical limb ischemia manifested by ischemic pain at rest, ulceration, and gangrene. The decision on surgical versus percutaneous intervention is dependent on many factors, including the patient's functional status and surgical risk, skills of the operator, anatomic location and extent of disease, presence of multifocal vascular lesions, and patient preference.
