When inspired oxygen is collected in the alveolar sac, perfusion occurs through the capillary network surrounding the alveoli. This perfused oxygen is transported by the red blood cell to the surrounding tissues. As blood is traveling through the capillary bed, oxygen is released from the RBC to the respective tissue site. Concurrently, the tissue releases CO2 through metabolic processes into the red blood cell, delivering it to the lungs.

**Normal Respiration**

- Vol CO2 = 200 mL/min and Vol O2 = 250 mL/min, resulting in 0.8 respiratory ratio

In the presence of macronutrients, oxygen is required for the breakdown of carbohydrates, fat, and protein. Carbohydrates (C6H12O6 + 6O2) have a 6 carbon chain and metabolize via glycolysis to form 2 pyruvate substrates, releasing CO2 as a by-product when converting to acetyl CoA. CO2 is also a by-product in the Krebs cycle when 2 carbon acetyl CoA reacts with a 4 carbon citrate, making a total of 3 CO2 in each metabolizing cascade. If the starting molecule is a fatty acid, which contains 12, 18, 20, or 22 carbon molecules, it goes through the process of B - oxidation to form acetyl Co-A which does not generate carbon dioxide. Therefore, when using fat over carbohydrates as a form of fuel, less CO2 is generated for every oxygen consumed.
