Lateral epicondylitis, also commonly referred to as tennis elbow, describes an overuse injury that occurs secondary to an eccentric overload of the common extensor tendon at the origin of the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB) tendon. Tennis elbow primarily results from the repetitive strain caused by activities that involve loaded and repeated gripping and/or wrist extension. It is common in individuals who play tennis, squash, badminton, or any activity involving repetitive wrist extension, radial deviation, and/or forearm supination. This activity will review the most common causes of lateral epicondylitis and the best treatment approach according to current evidence. This activity will highlight the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and treating lateral epicondylitis.

**Objectives:**
- Review the steps for diagnosis of lateral epicondylitis. 
- Identify other injuries that should be considered in a patient with tennis elbow. 
- SUmmarize the management options in lateral epicondylitis cases.
- Explain how the facilitation of interprofessional team education and discussion can optimize the effective detection of lateral epicondylitis and inform the need for subsequent evaluations.
