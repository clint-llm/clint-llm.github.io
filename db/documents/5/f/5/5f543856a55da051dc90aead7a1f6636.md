Computer Provider Order Entry (CPOE) has revolutionized the way physicians and other providers direct patient care in multiple settings. CPOE has both benefits and disadvantages. CPOE has been shown to reduce the number of medication errors in hospitalized patients. CPOE, however, has notÂ been shown to reduce mortality significantly. It is associated with increased time for completion of some physician workflow.

Other advantages of CPOE include point-of-care clinical decision support and enhanced patient safety through built-in medication interaction checks.
