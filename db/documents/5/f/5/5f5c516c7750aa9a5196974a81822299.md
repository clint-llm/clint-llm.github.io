The focus of replantation of any part of the upper extremity is maximizing functional outcome rather than simple survival of the amputated part. Functional outcomes are dependent on anatomical characteristics of the injury as well as patient-specific factors. Anatomical considerations include the level of amputation and the degree injury to the arterial intima and other soft tissue structures. Other considerations must be given to patient factors such as age, occupation, and cultural significance attributed to the hands. This activity reviews the technique, indications, contraindications, complications of digit replantation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with digital amputations.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for digital replantation
- Review the complications of digit replantation.
- Summarize the contraindications of digit replantation.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients undergoing digit replantation.
