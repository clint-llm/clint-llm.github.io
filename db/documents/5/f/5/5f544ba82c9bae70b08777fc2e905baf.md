Clobazam, in general, has a structural resemblance to typical BZD. The unique structural difference is that clobazam has nitrogen atoms at the 1st and 5th positions of the diazepine ring (instead of the usual 1st and 4th positions of typical BZD).

Due to this structural difference, clobazam is a partial agonist to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptors (compared to typical BZD, which are full agonists. It has a lower affinity for GABA-A (alpha1-beta2g2) receptor (BZ-1), thus leading to fewer sedative side effects. It also has a selective agonist for GABA-A (alpha2-beta3g2), thus exhibiting increased anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties.
