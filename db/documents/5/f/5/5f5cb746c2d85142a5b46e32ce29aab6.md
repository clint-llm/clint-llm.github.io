Primary PC are always classed as stage III and IV. Thus, high-grade adenocarcinomas that develop from the mesothelium of the peritoneal cavity are the extrauterine adenocarcinomas of Mullerian epithelial origin and are staged like ovarian carcinomas.

STAGE III is the confinement of the tumor within the peritoneal cavity and has further subdivisions as follows:

IIIA: Cancer is found in pelvic organs and lymph nodes within the abdominal cavity.

IIIB: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis, and the tumor size in the peritoneum is 2 cm or less. Also, lymph nodes outside the peritoneum will be involved.

IIIC: Cancer involves the peritoneum outside the pelvis, and the tumor size in the peritoneum is greater than 2 cm. It also has spread to lymph nodes outside the peritoneum.

In stage IV, cancer has metastasized to other organs of the body. It is further subdivided as:

IVA: Malignant pleural effusions develop

IVB: Cancer has spread to organs and tissues outside the peritoneal cavity, such as the liver, lungs, or groin lymph nodes

Secondary PC was described by Gilly et al. and is classed as follows:

- 0: no macroscopic disease

- I: Malignant lesion of size < 5mm localized to one part of the abdomen.

- II: Lesion is < 5mm but diffuses to the whole abdomen.

- III: Malignant granulations are >5mm but <2cm

- IV: Large malignant cakes > 2cm
