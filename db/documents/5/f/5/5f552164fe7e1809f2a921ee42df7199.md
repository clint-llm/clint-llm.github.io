For standard olfactory training, the patients sniff twice daily (preferably once in the morning before breakfast and once in the evening before going to bed) for at least 20 to 30 seconds on each of the four scents separately. It is imperative that patients constantly sniff for 20 to 30 seconds on each odor without a break.

The odors for training are presented in sniff bottles or jars. Typically, patients undergo olfactory training for at least 24 weeks. For patients with post-infectious olfactory dysfunction, olfactory training over the course of one year yielded better results than training for 16 weeks.

Olfactory training over several months is challenging for both the patients and the health care provider. The effects may be less dramatic than expected, and it takes a high degree of discipline to follow the standard protocol of olfactory training.
