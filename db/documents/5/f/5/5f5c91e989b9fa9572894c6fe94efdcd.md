Juvenile open-angle glaucoma and adult-onset primary open-angle glaucoma have similar findings. A significant number of individuals with juvenile open-angle glaucoma are asymptomatic. Symptoms that may present include an enlarged eye, blurred vision, eye pain, decreased visual acuity, tearing, blinking, and glare. A family history of glaucoma should be taken in addition to other histories to rule out secondary glaucoma.
