Nickel carbonyl is the cause of acute toxicity seen in occupational exposures. Often described as a colorless to yellow volatile liquid, it can have a musty or sooty odor, which is difficult to detectÂ at dangerous concentrations.

Nickel carbonyl finds significant applications in industrial settings as a catalyst in carbonylation reactions involving plastic, petroleum, or steel plating.

Nickel is a well-known culprit for contact dermatitis and is found in various everyday items such as household products, clothing, cosmetics, medical equipment, and jewelry. When sweat interacts with nickel-containing items, soluble nickel salts are released and can be absorbed by the skin, leading to a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Once sensitized, the hypersensitivity to nickel can persist indefinitely.
