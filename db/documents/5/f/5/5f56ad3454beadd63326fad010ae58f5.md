Boerhaave’s syndrome is also known as spontaneous esophageal rupture or effort rupture of the esophagus.  Although vomiting is thought to be the most common cause, other causes include weightlifting, defecation, epileptic seizures, abdominal trauma, compressed air injury, and childbirth, all of which can increase the pressure in the esophagus and cause a barogenic esophageal rupture.  Most cases occur in patients with a normal underlying esophagus, although the presence of esophagitis or ulcers has also been found in a subset of individuals.

Two common risk factors include alcoholism and excessive indulgence in food.
