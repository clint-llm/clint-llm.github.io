To properly evaluate hammertoes, it is beneficial to retrieve diagnostic imaging.

**Radiograph**

The anterior-posterior, oblique, and lateral plain film radiographs are helpful in the evaluation of hammertoe deformities and should be taken with the patient being weight-bearing. It may be used to assess contractures, seeing into the medullary canal of the proximal phalanx is associated with hammertoe deformities, and this sign is called the "gun barrel." Imaging makes it further possible to evaluate the relative metatarsal lengths, identifying hallux valgus as well as metatarsus adductus by examining the overall forefoot alignment. This is particularly helpful during a pre-operative assessment. To determine the length of the hammertoe pre-operatively, a transverse line may be drawn on the radiograph from the tips of the distal phalanges of the adjacent digits on either side; a long toe would overlap this line.

**Magnetic Resonance I****maging**

Magnetic resonance imaging series may be helpful in the event that there is a suspicion for a plantar plate rupture. This kind of advanced diagnostic imaging may further help detect soft tissue or osseous pathologies such as avascular necrosis of the metatarsal head, with the second metatarsal being the most commonly affected, or defects of the cartilage. If the patient has a medical history with comorbidities such as diabetes, distal peripheral neuropathy, or peripheral vascular disease, noninvasive arterial studies may be warranted to assure healing assessment.
