The prevalence of congenital causes, also known as Long QT syndrome (LQTS), is difficult to estimate but may be expected in 1 in 2,500 to 1 in 10,000 individuals. It is more common in females and usually presents with cardiac events in childhood, adolescence, or early adulthood. There are, however, case reports of it manifesting in the fifth decade of life. Family history is positive for Long QT syndrome in 40%, and for sudden cardiac death in 30% of patients. Acquired causes are relatively more common than congenital causes. Some studies report the prevalence of QT prolongation to be as many as 30% of patients in the intensive care unit.
