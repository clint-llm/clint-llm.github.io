Anatomical variations commonly arise from but are not limited to, differing divisions of the popliteal artery. In some people, the anterior tibial artery and the posterior tibial artery originate at a higher point than the distal border of the popliteus muscle. Further anatomical variations include the trifurcation of the anterior tibial, posterior tibial and peroneal arteries, the origin of the peroneal artery from the anterior tibial artery, and the absence of the posterior tibial artery.
