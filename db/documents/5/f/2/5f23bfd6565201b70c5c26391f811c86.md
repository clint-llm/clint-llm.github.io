**Characteristic Signs of Aging in the Upper Face**

- Vertical glabellar lines: caused by the action of the transverse head of the corrugator supercilii muscle (CSM)

- Oblique glabellar lines: caused by the action of the brow depressors, including the oblique head of CSM, depressor supercilii muscle, and medial orbicularis oculi muscle (OOM)

- Transverse dorsal skin lines: caused by the action of the procerus muscle

- Lateral eyebrow ptosis: caused by gravity, galeal fat pad descent, instability of the superficial temporal fascia, and the actions of the CSM (transverse head) and the OOM (lateral portion)

- Pseudo-excess upper eyelid skin (lid hooding): a result of brow ptosis, particularly evident laterally. When the upper eyelid skin overhangs the lash line, it is often referred to as "pseudo-blepharoptosis."

- Transverse forehead skin lines: caused by the action of the frontalis muscle, the sole brow elevator

**Structures Requiring Release During Endoscopic Brow Lift**

- Zone of adhesion: A 6-mm-wide zone medial to the superior temporal fusion line of the skull where periosteum and galea are fixed to the bone

- Conjoint tendon: The fusion of the galea aponeurotica, superficial and deep temporal fascia, and periosteum (pericranium) within the anterior temporal region at the inferior end of the zone of adhesion. The conjoint tendon functions like a cutaneous retaining ligament

- Arcus marginalis: The fusion of the galea aponeurotica and frontal periosteum at the supraorbital rim, which functions to anchor the brow and acts as the peripheral attachment of the orbital septum

**Anatomic Structures at Risk**

- Supraorbital nerve: The trunk exits the superior orbit above the medial limbus and forms branches, providing innervation to the frontoparietal skin (deep branch) and upper eyelid (superficial branch). This nerve usually exits the skull through a notch but may traverse a foramen instead in 25 to 33% of patients and may exit through a notch on one side and a foramen on the other.

- Supratrochlear nerve: Located approximately 1 cm medially to the supra­orbital nerve or 1.7 cm laterally to the midline, the supratrochlear nerve innervates the skin of the midline glabella, the medial upper eyelid, and a portion of the conjunctiva.

- Temporal branch of the facial nerve (CN VII): The temporal, or frontal, branch provides motor innervation to the musculature of the brow and the superior portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle. As the temporal branch courses superiorly to the zygomatic arch, it runs within or along the undersurface of the temporoparietal fascia. The anticipated path of the temporal branch can be estimated by Pitanguy's line, drawn from a point 5 mm inferior to the tragus to a point 15 mm superior to the lateral taper of the ipsilateral brow.

- Sentinel vein: This perforating vein in the zygomaticotemporal venous system is located approximately 1 cm lateral to the frontozygomatic suture line and predictably falls within 2 mm of the temporal branch of the facial nerve.

- Hair follicles: Alopecia is avoidable with incisions placed parallel to hair follicle orientation, tension-free closure of incision lines, and limited cauterization to the undersurface of hair-bearing areas.
