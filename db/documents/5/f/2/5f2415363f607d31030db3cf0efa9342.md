A central retinal vein occlusion requires an extensive laboratory workup to determine the cause. All patients diagnosed with a central retinal vein occlusion should get the following tests and labs:

- Blood pressure

- Erythrocyte sedimentation rate

- Complete blood count

- Random blood glucose

- Random total and HDL cholesterol

- Plasma protein electrophoresis (dysproteinemias in association with multiple myeloma)

- Urea, electrolytes, and creatinine (a renal disease in association with hypertension)

- Thyroid function tests (associated with dyslipidemia)

- EKG (left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to hypertension)

The following tests are indicated in patients either under the age of 50, with bilateral retinal vein occlusion and a history of previous thrombosis or a family history of thrombosis:

- Chest x-ray (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis)

- C-reactive protein

- Thrombophilia screen (thrombin time, prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, antithrombin functional assay, protein C, protein S, activated protein C resistance, factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin G20210A mutation; anticardiolipin antibody, lupus anticoagulant)

- Autoantibodies (rheumatoid factor, anti-nuclear antibody, anti-DNA antibody)

- Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme

- Fasting plasma homocysteine level

- Treponemal serology

- Carotid duplex imaging (exclude ocular ischemic syndrome)
