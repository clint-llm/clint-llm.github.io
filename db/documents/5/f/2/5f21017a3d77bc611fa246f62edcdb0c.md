TheÂ GTT only establishes the presence of glucose intolerance. It is used in patients with borderline fasting and postprandial glucose to support or rule out the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Some use it in unexplained hypertriglyceridemia, neuropathy, impotence, diabetes-like renal diseases, and retinopathy.

Reactive or postprandial hypoglycemia causes blood glucose to decrease two to five hours after a diet with high carbohydrate content. Early and late postprandial hypoglycemia occurs 2 to 3 hours and 3 to 5 hours after a meal, respectively.
