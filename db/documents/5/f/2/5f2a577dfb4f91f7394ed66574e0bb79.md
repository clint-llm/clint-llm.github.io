The adult spine is normally curved slightly with cervical lordosis, thoracic kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis. This curvature originates during embryogenesis and further develops during childhood. Thoracic kyphosis and sacral curvature are formed during fetal development, known as the “fetal position.” Cervical curvature develops when babies begin to support the weight of their heads. Lumbar lordosis develops when children begin to stand and support their body weight. This curvature may become exaggerated or abnormal due to various pathological processes.

Kyphosis: Humpback/hunchback. Increased anterior curvature (flexion) of the thoracic spine. Secondary to osteoporosis and poor posture and often seen in the elderly.

Lordosis: Swayback. Increased lumbar posterior curvature (extension). Secondary to anterior trunk muscle weakness which is more common in late pregnancy and obesity.

Scoliosis: Abnormal lateral deviation and curvature of the spine. Secondary to the absence of part of a vertebra or vertebral muscle weakness and may include abnormal rotation of one vertebra. Results in neural compression and disc herniation. The classic patient is a teenage girl – may be genetic, secondary to trauma, or idiopathic.

Kyphoscoliosis is a mixture of kyphosis and scoliosis.
