Primary hyperparathyroidism is a relatively common endocrine disorder that can cause hypercalcemia with significant renal and skeletal complications over time, although most patients identified in recent decades have relatively mild degrees of serum calcium elevations. Once known for the aphorism as a disease of "stones, bones, groans, and moans," as suggested by Fuller Albright, it is now usually asymptomatic when initially diagnosed.

Historically, the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism was made by the radiological findings of osteitis fibrosa cystica (brown tumors on long bones, evidence of subperiosteal bone resorption, "salt and pepper" radiographic erosions of the skull bones, and tapering of the distal portions of the finger bones and clavicles). While radiological evidence of hyperparathyroid bone disease is now rare at <2% of cases, bone densitometry can detect skeletal abnormalities well before they become clinically apparent.

Primary hyperparathyroidism involves the excess production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) by one or more of the four pea-sized parathyroid glands normally located peripherally along the margins on the posterior aspect of the thyroid gland. Surgery remains the definitive, curative treatment but observation alone or medical therapy is appropriate for selected patients.
