Conservative management is the recommendation for patients with isolated eyelid myokymia. Rest, decrease or elimination of risk factors, such as alcohol drinking, smoking, and caffeine intake are effective ways to manage eyelid myokymia. In case of persistent myokymia for more than three months, more interventions may be necessary. Botulinum toxin injections are first-line treatment and have a high rate of success.

Depending upon the extent of the fasciculations, between 5 and 20 units of botulinum toxin are administered. Other treatments for chronic eyelid myokymia have been suggested, such as tonic water, calcium, folic acid, phosphorus, potassium, and multi-vitamins.Â However, no objective evidence exists to support these treatments.
