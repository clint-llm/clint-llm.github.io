The diagnosis of lactational mastitis is based on history and clinical findings. If there is concern that the patient may have a breast abscess, a breast ultrasound can be obtained. If an abscess is present, hypoechoic areas of purulent material will be seen. For patients with a severe infection that is unresponsive to initial antibiotic therapy, a culture of breast milk can be useful to guide appropriate antibiotic selection. However, this is not routinely needed. Similarly, if there is a concern for bacteremia in a patient with severe mastitis, blood cultures should be obtained. However, these are not a part of the routine workup.

Periductal mastitis is primarily a clinical diagnosis. If nipple drainage is present, gram stain and culture should be sent to identify any associated organisms. If there is an associated mass and concern for malignancy, ultrasound or mammography should be obtained.

Because the clinical features of IGM overlap with those of breast cancer, a biopsy must be done to make this diagnosis. Core needle biopsy or excisional biopsy are both viable options. Because of the proposed association between hyperprolactinemia and IGM, a prolactin level may be sent. Ultrasound and mammography are not adequate to distinguish IGM from breast malignancy.
