Biofeedback is a technique used to improve the ability to modify involuntary processes consciously. It is frequently used for symptom management in chronic illness and as part of physical therapy for patients with motor dysfunction. The general strategy to biofeedback starts with utilizing non-invasive equipment to take measurements of a chosen physical parameter. The measured parameter is then either displayed directly or transformed into a visual, auditory, or tactile feedback signal. The patient will then practice controlling the feedback signal by consciously adjusting the physical parameter. Because the technique provides another form of feedback in addition to the body’s intrinsic sensory nervous system, it is sometimes called augmented feedback or extrinsic feedback.

Biofeedback divides into two major groups, biomechanical and physiologic, based on the parameter of interest. Biomechanical techniques measure body activity and movement using simple inertial sensors or more complex video motion sensors

Aside from neuromuscular retraining, the most common use for biofeedback is to help with chronic symptom management due to anxiety, pain, and urinary and fecal incontinence. These techniques focus on managing the overactive sympathetic response and coordinating muscle activity in gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts.

Biofeedback techniques are generally regarded as safe and free of side effects. For this reason, they are incorporated into treatment plans despite lacking strong evidence to support their benefits.
