The main complication of amblyopia is an irreversible, lifelong decrease in vision. These visualÂ functional abnormalities include reductions in visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, vernier acuity, spatial distortion, abnormal spatial interactions, and impaired contour detection. Patients with amblyopia will have binocular abnormalities such as impaired stereoscopic acuity and abnormal binocular summation. The monocular vision deficits are usually specific to only the amblyopic eye. However, subclinical deficits of the non-amblyopic eye have also been demonstrated.

People with amblyopia have difficulty seeing three-dimensional images hidden in stereoscopic displays such as autostereograms. Perception of depth, however, from monocular cues such as size, perspective, and motion parallax in the non-amblyopic eye typically remains normal.

Learning may also be impaired in children with amblyopia. Children with amblyopia read and answer multiple-choice questions slower than children that do not have amblyopia.
