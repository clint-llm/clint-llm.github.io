Encephalocele is usually a congenital type of neural tube defect, where a sac containing brain/meninges/cerebrospinal fluid forms outside the skull due to a bone defect. On occasions, acquired encephaloceles may result from trauma, tumors, or iatrogenic injury. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of encephalocele and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of an encephalocele.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of an encephalocele.
- Outline the management options available for an encephalocele.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients with encephalocele and improve outcomes.
