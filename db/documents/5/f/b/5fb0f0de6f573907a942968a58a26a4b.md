The prognosis of patients with PNES is not clear. With correct identification of spells and diagnosis of PNES, treatment of any psychiatric co-morbidities and counseling may decrease the frequency of spells. Cognitive-behavioral therapy-informed psychotherapy does seem to be efficacious. Patient acceptance of the diagnosis of PNES is thought to improve outcomes.
