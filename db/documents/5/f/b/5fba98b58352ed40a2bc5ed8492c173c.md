**Gamete Approximation:**Gamete approximation occurs via anatomical movements of the oocyte and sperm toward the ampulla of the fallopian tube.  Additionally, approximation requires chemotactic events where the oocyte and surrounding cumulus cells release chemical attractants into the local environment to which only capacitated sperms can respond. The secondary oocyte, itself, and the cumulus cells release progesterone and other nonpeptide signaling molecules. As mentioned, only spermatozoa that have undergone capacitation events are guided by chemoattractants released by the ovum environment. Capacitation is a set of physiological and biochemical changes (see details in the Biochemical Section) that initiate after moving through the cervical mucus and finalize in the fallopian tube. Capacitation renders the sperm capable of fertilizing an oocyte by modifying the head and tail of the sperm.  After capacitation and before the approach to the oocyte, the sperm must also undergo an acrosomal reaction. The acrosomal reaction only occurs in capacitated sperm and is a set of changes to the acrosome, which is a Golgi-derived organelle located between the cell membrane and nuclear envelope.  Generally, the acrosomal vesicle fuses with the plasma membrane to exocytose substances, mainly enzymes that facilitate fertilization by degrading the oocyte's corona radiata, zona pellucida, and vitelline membrane.

**Oocyte Contact and Fusion of Gametes:**The cumulus oophorus is a layer of loosely packed follicle cells connected by hyaluronic acid**.**As the sperm approaches the oocyte, the cells of the cumulus oophorus and corona radiata surrounding the oocyte are moved by the liberation of hyaluronidase from the acrosomal cap of the sperm to enzymatically dissolve the hyaluronic acid and expose the zona pellucida.  As a second barrier, the zona pellucida is a thick striated membrane made up of three glycoproteins, ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3, that are synthesized by the oocyte.

Upon the entrance of the single sperm, a series of cellular events termed cortical reaction transpires to generate an impermeable zona pellucida and prevents polyspermy. Cortical granules are released and secrete serine proteases, peroxidases, and glycosaminoglycans to cut protein connections to remove receptors, harden the vitelline envelope, and attract water into the perivitelline space. This generates a gap to form the hyaline layer.

A key signaling event resulting from the binding of a sperm to its ZP receptor in the zona pellucida is an increase in the level of cytosolic Ca within the egg. Increased calcium is needed to direct the cortical reaction and also to complete fertilization.

**Fertilization:**The process of fertilization gives rise to five critical cellular events:

- The completion of meiosis II within the female gamete is directed by calcium-induced activation of the anaphase-promoting complex.

- There will be a restoration of a diploid number of chromosomes in the zygote.

- The determination of chromosomal sex is now complete.

- The sperm entry point may localized polarity to the determination of early axis formation.

- Finally, there is an initiation of the cleavage of the zygote.

**Mitotic Cleavage of the Blastomeres:**Early cleavage events are synchronous and driven by maternal RNA and protein instruction until the eight-celled stage is complete. Upon the production of eight blastomeres, the cells show increased adherence via tight junctions and are totipotent with functional apparatus, which displays cell autonomy. The rapid rate of blastomeric division initiates via changes in the cell cycle, specifically the upregulation of cyclins. In IVF studies, the length and timing of the cell cycle have been shown to be one of the most important determinants in conceptus survivability.****

**Morula Formation:**Dynamic cellular processes, such as filopodia formation and cytoskeleton-mediated cell-to-cell interactions, intervene to allow cell compaction and blastocoel formation. Compaction is driven by E-cadherins and Ca2+-driven signal transduction to instruct cell boundaries to disappear. Cell boundaries then progressively disappear until the embryo is fully compacted. Finally, at the late compaction stage, the cell boundaries reappear, the number of blastomeres increases, and the cavitation begins.  At the same time that cell boundaries are reappearing, the differential orientation of cleavage planes, cell polarity, and physical forces interact and cooperate to position blastomeres either internally or externally, thereby influencing their cellular fate. Cells of the outer cell mass upregulate Na+ transporters, actively pumping Na+ into the interior space of the morula. Via osmosis, water actively follows the increased Na+ gradient, thus creating the sizeable fluid-filled cavity called the blastocoel**.  **

**Blastocyst Formation:**One of the first key developmental patterning processes in the morula to blastocyst transition is to determine what becomes inner cell mass vs. trophectoderm.  Studies in mice indicate that the upregulation of the transcription factors such as Oct 4, FGF, Nanog define pluripotent stem cells of the ICM, with trophectoderm cells upregulating Cdx-2 Eomes and Tead 4.

**Apposition of the Blastocyst:**Literature indicates that chemokines are involved in the apposition of the blastocyst to the correct location within the uterine lining for implantation.  The interleukin family of signaling factors, along with leptin, IGF, and DKK-1, have all been implicated in early implantation events.
