The prevalence of corneal arcus varies with ethnicity. Individuals of African and Southeast Asian descent have a higher prevalence of arcus than those of white descent. Depending on the population studied, the prevalence of corneal arcus ranges from 20% to 35%; however, regardless of ethnic background, the incidence of corneal arcus increases with age. Some research has indicated that the prevalence of corneal arcus is nearly 100 percent in individuals over the age of 80. Traditionally men have had a higher incidence and prevalence of corneal arcus then women, and men, also have larger arcus. The presence of corneal arcus is usually clinically insignificant; however, the presence of corneal arcus is men under the age of 40 has been associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease. Historically it was thought that the presence of arcus was a predictor of cardiovascular disease regardless of age; however, current data has disputed this historical inaccuracy.
