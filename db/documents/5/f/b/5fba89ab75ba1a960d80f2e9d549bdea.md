The patient must understand the variable nature of the presentation of this disease. Any febrile or systemic illness leading to new symptoms of shortness of breath on exertion or while lying flat, palpitations, undue fatiguability, or fainting episodes warrants further evaluation by an expert.

There is usually a delay in diagnosis, as the diagnosis is made after excluding other diseases and running a set of investigations. The diagnosis and patient care require a multidisciplinary team, including a cardiologist, cardiac imaging expert, cardiac interventionist (in case of mechanical support), heart failure specialist, and cardiac rehabilitation expert.

A consistent rehabilitation program is needed when recovering from acute myocarditis. The patient should be aware of the possibility of recovery or failure to recover heart function once the acute illness has settled. Some may require lifelong medications for heart dysfunction after the acute insult.
