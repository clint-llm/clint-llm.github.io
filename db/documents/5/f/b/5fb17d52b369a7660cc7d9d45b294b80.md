Three main phenotypes have been described

**DMD**

Presents in early childhood, delayed motor milestones, most noticeably independent walking and standing from the floor. Consistent with parents' complaints, as well asÂ gait disturbances (toe walking and flat feet). The main affected area is proximal, leading to difficulty climbing stairs, jumping, running.

Cardiomyopathy presents in one-third of individuals by adolescence, turning 100% prevalent in all children at age 18.

Some children may present a deficit in executive functioning

The most common cause of death is respiratory failure or cardiomyopathy.

**BMD**

BMD shows late-onset muscle weakness, sometimes developing symptoms after age 30.

Heart failure due to cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of lethality.

**DMD-Associated DCM**

Rapidly progressive course, related to ventricular arrhythmias, with no skeletal muscle involvement. Affected females exhibit a mild form around age 40.
