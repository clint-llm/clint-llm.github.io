Dysarthria is a neuromotor disorder that results from abnormalities in speed, strength, accuracy, range, tone, or duration required for speech control.

Speech is a complex neuromuscular phenomenon achieved through the smooth coordination of 5 subsystems: respiration, phonation, resonance, articulation, and prosody.
