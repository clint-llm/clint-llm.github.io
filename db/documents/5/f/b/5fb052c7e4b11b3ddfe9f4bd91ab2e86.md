Liposuction, formally known as suction-assisted lipectomy, represents one of the most commonly performed aesthetic surgical procedures worldwide. Primarily a body contouring procedure, liposuction utilizes vacuum suction to remove subcutaneous adipose tissue in certain anatomical areas. Of note, liposuction should not be portrayed as a weight loss procedure. Since the inception of liposuction in the early 1980s, liposuction has undergone a series of technological and procedural advancements (e.g., lasers, ultrasound), some of which will be discussed herein.
