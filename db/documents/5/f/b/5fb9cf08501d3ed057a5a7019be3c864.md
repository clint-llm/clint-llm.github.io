Sciatic nerve blockade is indicated whenever analgesia or anesthesia of the lower extremity is appropriate. This can range from surgical or nonsurgical procedures to acute or chronic pain relief therapies. Depending on the exact location of the lower extremity coverage required, a sciatic nerve block may need to be combined with blockade of nerves originating from the lumbar plexus to achieve the desired result.
