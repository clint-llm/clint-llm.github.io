The renal system develops through a series of successive phases: the pronephros, mesonephros, and metanephros. The most immature form of the kidney is the pronephros, whereas the most well-developed phase is metanephros, which will persist as the kidney after birth. The metanephros forms at the level of the first sacral vertebra (S1) and the bifurcation of the aorta. Following induction of the metanephric mesenchyme, the inferior segment of the nephric duct will migrate inferiorly and eventually connect with the bladder via the ureters. In the fetus, the ureters transfer urine from the kidneys to the bladder, which then excretes it into the amniotic sac. With the growth of the fetus, the torso expands, and the kidneys migrate upwards and rotate, which also results in an increased length of the ureters.

During its ascent, the kidney gets supplied by several transitory vessels, all originating from the aorta. The definitive renal arteries arise from the lumbar region of the aorta during the ascent while the transitory vessels normally disappear.
