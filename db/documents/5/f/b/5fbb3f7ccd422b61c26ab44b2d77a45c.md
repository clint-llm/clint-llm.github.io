Cervical polyps are benign growths, usually protruding from the surface of the cervical canal. They commonly occur during the reproductive years, especially after the age of 20.

The cervical polyps may vary in size, shape, and origin. They can present as single or multiple, tear-shaped or lobular, cherry-red, or greyish-white in color, depending on the vascularity of the lesion. The size of the cervical polyp is typically less than three cm in diameter; however, as mentioned earlier, they can vary in size and can be large enough to fill the vagina or be present at the introitus. Anatomically, a cervical polyp is connected to the surface by a pedicle, which is usually long and thin but may, as well, present as short and broad-based.

Although cervical polyps are commonly benign, malignant polyps can present in 0.2Â to 1.5% of the cases. Malignant polyps are more likely to be seen in postmenopausal patients.

Cervical polyps are categorized depending on their origin; ectocervical and endocervical polyps.

- The endocervical polyps are the most common type; they usually occur in premenopausal women. They typically arise from the cervical glands in the endocervix.

- The ectocervical polyps are more common in postmenopausal women and arise from the outer surface layer cells of the cervix within the ectocervix.
