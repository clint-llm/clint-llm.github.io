The neurological exam in trauma patients is often initially performed by the trauma team with subsequent consultation with the neurologist or neurosurgeon as indicated. However, these patients are usually monitored by the neurotrauma nurse with serial GCS. The prognosis of neurotrauma patients depends on the severity of traumatic brain injury, the presence of a neurological deficit at admission, comorbidity, age, and the need for immediate surgery. The prognosis is good for patients with mild traumatic brain injury (GCS 13-15), but the recovery can be prolonged. Patients with severe traumatic brain injury (GCS <9) usually have a guarded prognosis, and many are left with residual neuropsychiatric deficiencies. Evaluation and care for these patients will achieve the best results if an interprofessional team of nurses, clinicians, specialists, and therapists utilize open communication channels and accurate patient record-keeping to provide care.
