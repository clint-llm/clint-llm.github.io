Swan neck deformity is characterized by proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint hyperextension and the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint flexion. There is also reciprocal flexion noted of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. This is a result of an imbalance of the extensor mechanism of the digit. The imbalance could be due to a significant laceration or stretching of the extrinsic tendon forces on the distal phalanx or from tightness and pulling of the extensor mechanism, both intrinsic and extrinsic, at the PIP joint. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of swan neck deformity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of swan neck deformity.
- Review the causes of swan neck deformity.
- Summarize the treatment options for swan neck deformity.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by swan neck deformity.
