The flexor retinaculum can entrap and compress the median nerve causing the condition of carpal tunnel.

Compression of the flexor retinaculum and, therefore, the median nerve may reproduce the patient's symptoms. A classic physical exam maneuver used to diagnose carpal tunnel is the Tinel test. The Tinel test is performed by repeatedly tapping on the flexor retinaculum and seeing if it reproduces the patient's symptoms. Treatments to consider include wrist splinting, work-related ergonomic modification, NSAIDs, steroid injections, and surgical management.
