Higher ILE doses have correlated with hypertriglyceridemia, acute pancreatitis, lipid embolus, extracorporeal circulation machine circuit obstruction, acute kidney injury, cardiac arrest, acute lung injury, and increased susceptibility to infections. Both higher infusion rates and higher total dose administered to increase the likelihood of these events.

Fat overload syndrome is another well-known complication of ILE; initial reports of this condition appeared in the setting of parenteral nutrition. Characteristic symptoms include sudden elevation of triglyceride levels, fever, liver dysfunction, splenomegaly, pancreatitis, coagulopathy, and hemolysis. These symptoms improve as lipemia resolves.

In a severe case of ILE toxicity, clinicians observed somnolence and metabolic acidosis with elevated lactic acid levels after administration of 66 mL/kg, which is well above the recommended threshold.
