The primary care provider including the general obstetrics and gynecology physician can treat most cases of urinary incontinence with behavioral techniques or pharmacologic agents. However, referral to a urogynecologist and or urologist may be necessary particularly when surgical intervention is necessary with mixed incontinence. Indications for referral may include:

- Uncertain diagnosis

- Unsuccessful medical therapy

- Patients with “heavy” stress urinary incontinence (multiple pads per day)

- Symptomatic pelvic organ prolapse

- Voiding dysfunction (elevated post-void residual)

- Underlying neurologic condition

- Prior failed surgery

- Hematuria without infection

- Recurrent urinary tract infections

- Surgical intervention considered when a patient is not satisfied even when the urge component of mixed incontinence cured

The treatment of mixed urinary incontinence should always begin with the least invasive management to see if symptoms are tolerable or minimized by the patient. Behavioral methods include:

- Dietary changes (no coffee, tea, soda, chocolates, or methylxanthines)

- Bladder retraining (timed voiding)

- Kegel exercises

- Biofeedback

- Electrostimulation

- Collagen injections

- Pessaries (multiple types and sizes  to fit the patient properly so the pessary does not fall out or cause difficulty with voiding)

Pharmacologic agents may help improve voiding dysfunction with urge incontinence. Medications include:

- Oxybutynin

- Ca channel blockers

- Tricyclic antidepressants

- Alpha-adrenergics

- Estrogen

When mixed urinary incontinence includes significant prolapse with stress urinary incontinence and pelvic pressure symptoms, surgical treatment provides the best overall cure. The current goals of surgery include:

- Restore and/or reinforce the pubourethral ligaments at the mid-urethra level

- Restore and/or reinforce the suburethral vaginal hammock at the mid-urethra

- Reinforce the paraurethral connective tissue

Surgical treatment includes both abdominal and vaginal procedures with similar cure rates:

- Abdominal: Marshall Marchetti Krantz (MMK), Burch, paravaginal repair, laparoscopic procedures

- Vaginal: Modified Pereyra procedure (MPP), Stamey, RAZ, sling procedures (TVT) (TVT-O)

Always attempt conservative treatment first with behavioral techniques or medications even if surgery is planned for mixed incontinence. The patient may be satisfied with improved incontinence if it avoids any surgical procedure, particularly if the patient is high risk.
