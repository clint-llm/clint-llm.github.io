Definitive testing: Culture of the organism from a sterile body site establishes the diagnosis of GBS infection.

Meningitis in early-onset disease is clinically indistinguishable from bacteremia without a focus, and up to 30% of neonates with meningitis have negative blood cultures. Thus, a lumbar puncture is necessary to determine the presence or absence of meningeal involvement, even in a patient with a focal site of GBS infection.

Rapid antigen detection methods are not appropriate substitutes for cultures from blood or other normally sterile body fluid specimens. Repeating antigen tests during therapy is not recommended. A limited study of real-time PCR to detect DNA in the blood of eight neonates with culture-proven GBS sepsis showed corresponding positive results. However, further prospective studies are necessary to evaluate sensitivity and specificity.
