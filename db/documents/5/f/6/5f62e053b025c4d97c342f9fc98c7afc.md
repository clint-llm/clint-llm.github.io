Most of the cases of OIS have ipsilateral stenosis of the ICA, which results in the reduction of central retinal artery perfusion pressure by 50%.

The variability of ocular manifestations with stenosis of the carotid artery depends on the health of the collateral circulation that exists in between the ICA and the external carotid artery. The healthy collateral system protects the eye from manifesting OIS even with those having total occlusion, whereas cases with poor collaterals and stenosis <50% may develop OIS.

This finding can be explained by the “Steal Phenomenon” that occurs in the absence of poor collaterals the ophthalmic artery acts as a shunt vessel in the circle of Willis between the ECA and the distal unobstructed part of ICA thus shunting blood flow away. This phenomenon has been supported by the fact that there is retrograde flow noted in Doppler flowmetry in some patients with OIS.

The leading cause of mortality in these patients is cardiovascular disease (approximately 66%), which is followed by a stroke. Therefore as soon as the diagnosis of OIS is made, the patient should be systemically evaluated by the cardiologist in conjunction with a vascular surgeon.
