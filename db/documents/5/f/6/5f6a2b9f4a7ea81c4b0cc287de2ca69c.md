**Pearls**

- Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury can occur from any vascular interruption of blood flow, including results of trauma, either directly from a laceration or tearing forces or indirectly through crushing or pressure-related injury. It may also result from surgical procedures, cold or heat-related injuries, thrombotic, embolic, or inflammatory occlusions.

- The release of chemotactic factors from the injured vascular walls is responsible for the initial inflammatory response in an Ischemia-Reperfusion injury.

- Correction of blood flow may create an additional chemotactic response, with additive effects that may cause a second interruption of flow to already sensitized tissues as well as introducing a second inflammatory response to downrange organs, furthering injury.

- Hyperbaric oxygen reduces ischemia-reperfusionÂ effects by interrupting leukocyte adhesion on the vascular walls, thereby diminishing inflammatory effects while inducing free radical scavengers to block further tissue damage. All the while, hyperbaric oxygen supports metabolic function through high concentration oxygen diffusion.
