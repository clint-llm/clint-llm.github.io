There are myriad causes of bursitis of which the clinician must be knowledgeable. The most common etiology is prolonged pressure, whereby the bursa is stressed between a hard surface and bony prominence. Examples of prolonged pressure causing bursitis include students who frequently rest their elbows on their desk and people who work on their knees without adequate padding. Likewise, repetitive motions can also irritate the bursa and resultÂ in bursitis. The second most common cause of bursitis is trauma when direct pressure is applied to the bursa. Often the patient will not be able to recall the inciting incident as it may have seemed benign at the time.

Traumatic bursitis puts the patient at risk for septic bursitis, which is most often caused by direct penetration of the bursa through the skin. Septic bursitis can also be provoked through the hematogenous spread; however, due to the relatively poor blood supply to the bursa, this is rare. Staphylococcus aureus causes the majority of septic bursitis. Another important cause of bursitis is autoimmune conditions and systemic inflammatory conditions, as well as arthropathies, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, spondyloarthropathy, and gout. Lastly, bursitis can be idiopathic in origin, and septic bursitis, in particular, can be induced by invasive procedures.
