Most concussion patients recover quickly and fully. During recovery, patients need to understand that they may experience a range of symptoms. Some symptoms may appear right away, while others may go unnoticed for hours or even days following the injury, and they may not realize you have problems until they resume their usual activities again. They should be counseled that if they do not return to normal within a week to seek care with a clinician experienced in treating brain injuries. They should not return to sports and recreational activities before consulting with a clinician. Repeat concussions before full recovery of the brain can be very dangerous can increase the chance for long-term problems.

Concussion education should also focus on prevention, such as wearing safety belts and safety seats for children, using helmets for biking, motorcycle riding, skating, etc. The elderly should take extra measures to prevent falls at home.
