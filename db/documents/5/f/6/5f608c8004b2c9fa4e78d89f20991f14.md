The ventricular system develops from a single cavity, i.e., hollow of the neural tube. The neural tube is formed around the fourth week of gestation. Shortly after that, the spinal neurocele closes, and this separates the amniotic cavity from the neural cavity.

Three dilatations are formed from cephalic to caudal end namely prosencephalon (forebrain), mesencephalon (midbrain), and rhombencephalon (hindbrain). Prosencephalon develops into telencephalon (cerebral hemisphere) and diencephalon. Rhombencephalon develops into the metencephalon (pons and cerebellum) and myelencephalon (medulla oblongata). These developing vesicles contain respective vesicles within them as follows:

- The telencephalic cavity becomes lateral ventricles

- The diencephalic cavity becomes the third ventricle

- The narrowed mesencephalic cavity develops into the cerebral aqueduct

- the rhombencephalic cavity becomes the fourth ventricle

During early development, ventricles proliferate and assume adult size. After that, the brain tissue begins to grow in caudal to cephalic direction than the ventricles, and this differential growth gives rise to adult ventricular shape.
