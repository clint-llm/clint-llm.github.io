The uterus is a pelvic organ that will nurture the developing fetus. Approximately 4 weeks after conception, the uterus will increase about 1 cm in size every week. Between 4.5 to 5 weeks of gestation, a gestational sac or intrauterine fluid collection will form. The next remarkable finding occurs between 5 to 6 weeks with the development of the yolk sac. This structure may remain present until 10 weeks. A fetal pole with cardiac activity can be detected between 5.5 to 6 weeks. After this period, the embryo further develops with more discernable organs and anatomical features. When using ultrasound to visualize anatomy, pelvic landmarks include the bladder, uterine wall, vaginal stripe, and rectum. The bladder is typically anterior and inferior to the uterus. The bladder wall will be circular with an anechoic (black) fluid-filled center. The bladder will range in size based on the amount of urine being retained. The uterus will have a thick muscular isoechoic (gray) wall with an anechoic (black) center where an intrauterine pregnancy at varying stages can be identified. Differentiating the bladder from the uterus can be done easily by looking at the thickness of the wall. The uterine wall is significantly thicker than the bladder wall. The vaginal stripe is posterior to the bladder. The rectum will be the most posterior circular structure, on pelvic ultrasound, with either an anechoic (black) or isoechoic (gray) center on the exam.
