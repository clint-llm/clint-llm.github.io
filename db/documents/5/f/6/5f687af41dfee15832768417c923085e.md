The diagnosis of otitis media should always begin with a physical exam and the use of an otoscope, ideally a pneumatic otoscope.

**Laboratory Studies**

Laboratory evaluation is rarely necessary. A full sepsis workup in infants younger than 12 weeks with fever and no obvious source other than associated acute otitis media may be necessary. Laboratory studies may be needed to confirm or exclude possible related systemic or congenital diseases.

**Imaging Studies**

Imaging studies are not indicated unless intra-temporal or intracranial complications are a concern.

- When an otitis media complication is suspected, computed tomography of the temporal bones may identify mastoiditis, epidural abscess, sigmoid sinus thrombophlebitis, meningitis, brain abscess, subdural abscess, ossicular disease, and cholesteatoma.

- Magnetic resonance imaging may identify fluid collections, especially in the middle ear collections.

**Tympanocentesis**

Tympanocentesis may be used to determine the presence of middle ear fluid, followed by culture to identify pathogens.

Tympanocentesis can improve diagnostic accuracy and guide treatment decisions but is reserved for extreme or refractory cases.

**Other Tests**

Tympanometry and acoustic reflectometry may also be used to evaluate for middle ear effusion.
