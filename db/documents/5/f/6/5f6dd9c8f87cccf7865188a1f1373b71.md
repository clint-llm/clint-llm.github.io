The mural thrombus may be symptomatic or may be diagnosed as an incidental finding. Symptoms are mainly related to the localization of the thrombus. It can be incidentally detected lying in walls of the aorta in an asymptomatic patient. Its embolization to the brain induces cerebrovascular events, causes mesenteric ischemia in the gut, and causes renal infarction, coronary ischemia in the heart, pulmonary infarction, among others. Its presence in the distal part of the vessel can induce ischemia, which can result in limb loss.
