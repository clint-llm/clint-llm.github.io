Under scanning electron microscopy, mast cells are again characterized by the abundance of cytoplasmic granules, which may also be described as secondary lysosomes. These granules are surrounded by a lipid membrane.  Under the proper conditions, deep invaginations of the cell membrane can be noted. When degranulating, the cell form channels with its plasma membrane, allowing granules deep within the cell to be exposed to the extracellular environment.

The cell has many small, finger-like pseudopods projecting out of the cell membrane. The centrally located nucleus is round with densely packed peripheral chromatin.

The type of cell determines granule ultrastructure.

- **Intact Cells**have granules with little discernible structure.

- **Spreading Cells**have a majority of granules composed of fine particulate matter. These granules also have lamellae in circular "scroll-like" patterns interspersed among the particulate matter.
