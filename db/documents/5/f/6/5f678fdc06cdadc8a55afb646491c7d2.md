LS is considered to be an autoimmune condition; however, its etiology remains unclear. Given its association with other autoimmune diseases such as alopecia areata, vitiligo, autoimmune thyroiditis, and pernicious anemia, its etiology is probably multifactorial. Further etiologic factors have been implicated such as genetic susceptibility, infectious agents such as spirochetes, sex hormone, and the Koebner phenomenon. Furthermore, recent data demonstrated a high prevalence of lichen sclerosis associated with morphea.
