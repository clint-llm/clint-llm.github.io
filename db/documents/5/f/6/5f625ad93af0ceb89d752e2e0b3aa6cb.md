In the evaluation of osteoradionecrosis, providers must consider wide differential diagnoses.

- Providers should consider a potential recurrence of the original malignancy or a radiation-induced secondary tumor.

- Osteomyelitis is a concomitant condition that must be treated with antibiotics.

- Bisphosphonate related osteonecrosis of the jaw must also be excluded, as osteonecrosis of the jaw is a well-known complication of the medication's use. A careful medical history will help to rule out this diagnosis.
