An avulsion is a rare type of dental trauma, emphasizing the need for professionals to regularly review the treatment protocols to increase a successful outcome. Keeping in mind that the treatment aims to maintain the tooth and bone until complete facial growth is achieved. The need for early replantation and the appropriate storage medium is less recognized by patients, parents, and medical professionals. It is necessary for primary care providers, nurse practitioners, and the general dentist to educate the public regarding the prognosis and success of replantation, how early treatment is essential, and that the preferred storage medium is a balanced salt solution or milk.
