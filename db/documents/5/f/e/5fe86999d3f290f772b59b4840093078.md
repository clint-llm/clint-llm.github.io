The main aim of treatment is to reduce IOP to prevent progressive corneal opacification and glaucomatous optic atrophy and thereby preserve existing vision.

**Medical Treatment**

- Medical therapy can be instituted with topical beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, or prostaglandin analogs.

**Surgical Treatment**

- Goniotomy: In this procedure, openings are created in the trabecular meshwork, thus reducing resistance to outflow.

- Trabeculotomy: The trabecular meshwork is incised by cannulating Schlemm's canal with a probe.

- Trabeculectomy: A section of the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal is removed underneath a partial thickness scleral flap, thus creating a fistula draining aqueous to the subconjunctival space.

- Combined trabeculotomy and trabeculectomy: Involves removal of a block of sclera after performing trabeculectomy

- Glaucoma drainage implants

- Cyclodestructive procedures

In the postoperative period, the surgeon should correct any refractive errors and also manage amblyopia. Lifelong monitoring of IOP is indicated in these patients.
