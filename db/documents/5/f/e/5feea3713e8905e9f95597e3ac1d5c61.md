The medial pectoral nerve innervates the lower part of the pectoralis major and the pectoralis minor muscle, which contributes to the thoraco-brachial motion. The pectoralis major is a fan-shaped muscle located across the upper chest from the shoulder to the sternum and is the most superficial muscle in the pectoral region. The pectoralis minor muscle lies beneath the pectoralis major muscle and inserts superolaterally into the coracoid process of the anterior scapula and anteromedially into the third, fourth, and fifth ribs.
