Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can predict the vulnerability of carotid plaque for rupture. F, C, N, and O  commonly use in PET imaging. F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET can detect and predict the vulnerability of carotid plaque for the rapture. FDG accumulates in the inflammatory lesions and therefore is a key to determine atherosclerotic plaques. SPECT can evaluate the content of atherosclerotic plaques such as oxidized LDL and apoptotic bodies.

O-PET is the gold standard to visualize the penumbra. In a PET scan, areas with loss of blood flow, ischemic penumbra, and infarction demonstrate abnormal glucose and oxygen metabolism. Perfusion SPECT is also a consideration in the management of acute stroke. The decreased vascular reserve can be evaluated in SPECT using an acetazolamide challenge, which can predict the development of ischemic lesions in patients undergoing endarterectomy.

Although SPECT is also valuable for evaluating cerebral blood flow, PET is widely available and is cost-benefit compared to SPECT, and this modality is more common to use in the acute setting.
