Antipsychotic side effects subdivide into five categories.

**Extrapyramidal**

- Tardive dyskinesia: though symptoms are irreversible, vitamin E has been shown to prevent further deterioration

- Parkinsonism: bradykinesia, tremors, and rigidity can occur a week after administration - can be managed via a reduction in dose or the use of an antimuscarinic such as oral benztropine

- Akathisia: can occur after a month of antipsychotic use and treated using propranolol and benzodiazepines

- Acute dystonia: managed via a parenteral muscarinic such as benztropine administered intravenously or intramuscularly

**Anticholinergic**

- Dry mouth; urinary retention; blurred vision; glaucoma; constipation

**Anti-adrenergic**

- Sexual dysfunction; tachycardia; postural hypotension

**Antihistaminic**

- Weight gain, sedation; All patients should be advised to increase their physical activity and monitor their dietary intake.

**Idiosyncratic**

- Altered glucose tolerance, skin photosensitivity, cholestatic jaundice, hypersensitivity reactions, yellow pigmentation of the skin, neuroleptic malignant syndrome; The neuroleptic malignant syndrome may be fatal and is characterized by increasing rigidity, pyrexia, and fluctuating consciousness - the patient should receive immediate medical care.

Recent efficacy studies such as Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) and European First-Episode Schizophrenia Trials (EUFEST) found no significant difference between the first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol and newer second-generation antipsychotics such as olanzapine and risperidone.
