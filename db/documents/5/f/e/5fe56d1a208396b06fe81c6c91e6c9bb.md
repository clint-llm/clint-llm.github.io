The most common cause of polyhydramnios is idiopathic. However, this remains a diagnosis of exclusion after other potential causes have been ruled out. A fetal swallowing defect is the most common fetal cause for polyhydramnios due to the inability of amniotic fluid absorption. Other fetal causes include intrapartum infections (i.e., TORCH infections), chromosomal abnormalities, urogenital disorders, and neuromuscular disorders.

Twin-twin transfusion syndrome is a rare but serious cause of polyhydramnios in the recipient twin in monochorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies.
