Several intra-operative adjuncts may be utilized. High-definition ultrasound may be used to correlate with preoperative localization studies just prior to surgery. Along with FNA, ultrasound can be used to investigate hypoechoic structures seen intraoperatively.

Frozen section analysis is commonly used to confirm that the specimen removed is, in fact, parathyroid tissue. While a frozen section of a single gland cannot delineate an adenoma from multi-gland hyperplasia, the sensitivity of distinguishing parathyroid from the non-parathyroid tissue is greater than 99%.

A rapid PTH assay is utilized intraoperatively to confirm the removal of the hyperfunctioning tissue. As the half-life of PTH is 2 to 4 minutes, the commonly used Miami criterion states that the level of PTH should fall by 50% 10 minutes after gland removal. PTH is drawn preoperatively, immediately after gland resection (to capture a possible “spike” from manipulation of parathyroid tissue), and then at 5 and 10 minutes post-resection.
