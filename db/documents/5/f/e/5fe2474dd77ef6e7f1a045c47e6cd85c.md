Vasovagal syncope is the most common form of syncope in adults. More than 85% of syncopal events in people younger than 40 years are attributable to vasovagal syncope. Even in geriatric patients, more than 50% of syncopal episodes are due to vasovagal syncope. Vasovagal syncope requires an intact and functioning autonomic nervous system, and therefore, its incidence is low in populations with autonomic nervous system dysfunction, such as patients with Parkinson disease. The lifetime incidence of an episode of vasovagal syncope is more than 33%.
