A patient's renal function is an important factor in choosing a urinary diversion technique. The ileal conduit is ideal for elderly patients and those with impaired renal function because the bowel segment is short, and there is minimal contact time with urine.

There are important patient factors that preclude patients from being offered an orthotopic or continent diversion, and these patients should then receive a urinary conduit. These include urethral strictures, a history of inflammatory bowel disease, and pelvic radiation.

Relative contraindications to ileal conduit surgery include impaired cognition, which may make learning how to manage a stoma and learn to wake at set times during sleep to empty the bag difficult. Any deficits in manual dexterity are also a relative contraindication, again making the management of the ileal conduit challenging.
