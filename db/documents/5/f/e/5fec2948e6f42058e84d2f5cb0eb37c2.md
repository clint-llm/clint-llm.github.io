A body mass index of ≥30 (>27 in those of Asian descent) kilograms per square meter constitutes the definition of obesity.

Obesity once again came into focus during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, when patients with obesity were found to have an increased need for mechanical ventilation and higher mortality.

It is well known that obesity is associated with a shortened life span and increased incidence of obstructive sleep apnea, osteoarthritis, gout, polycystic ovarian syndrome, metabolic syndrome, prediabetes, hypertension, stroke, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, heart failure, and cancers of the colon, breast, endometrium, and gallbladder.
