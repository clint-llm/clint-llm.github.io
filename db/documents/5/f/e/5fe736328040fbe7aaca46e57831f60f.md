Superior pulmonary sulcus tumors, also called Pancoast tumors, arise from the apical pleuropulmonary groove located superior to the first rib. When these tumors involve the surrounding structures such as the brachial plexus, cervical paravertebral sympathetic nervous system, and stellate ganglion, they cause a group of signs and symptoms that are collectively called Pancoast syndrome. This is characterized by ipsilateral shoulder and arm pain, paresthesias, paresis and atrophy of the thenar muscles of the hand, and Horner's syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis). This activity reviews Pancoast syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in recognition and management of patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the differential diagnosis of Pancoast syndrome.
- Describe how to counsel a patient with Pancoast syndrome.
- Explain the pathophysiology of Pancoast syndrome.
- Summarizee the role of collaboration amongst interprofessional team members to improve care coordination and minimize oversight, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment and better outcomes for patients with Pancoast syndrome.
