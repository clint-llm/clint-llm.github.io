Adjuvant radiation therapy of bone lesions is used as a palliative measure. The goal of radiation therapy is to damage the DNA of the cancer cells and halt their multiplication by causing double-strand breaks. Free radical generation destroys the neoplastic cells by apoptosis. Indications for radiation therapy are the treatment of post-fracture pain, intramedullary disease, or signal cord compression by large osteolytic lesions.

In a retrospective analysis, it was observed that one-third of the patients required radiation therapy during the course of their disease, mainly for neurological complications, pain control, prevention, or treatment of fractures. Radiation therapy improved pain in more than 80% of the patients.
