EMZL has a relatively good prognosis with median survival greater than 10 years. However, some patients with high-risk disease are more likely to progress. MALT-IPI is a prognostic score that may be able to identify high-risk patients.

The independent prognostic factors were identified:

- Age > 70 years

- Stage III or IV disease

- Serum lactate dehydrogenase greater than the upper limit of normal

The patients are divided into three risk groups depending on the number of prognostic factors.

- Low risk – zero risk factors

- Intermediate risk – one risk factor

- High risk – two or more risk factors

The prognosis of the patients depends on what group they fall into, and the 5 -year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are as follows.

- Low risk – PFS 76%, OS 99%

- Intermediate risk – PFS 63%, OS 93%

- High risk – PFS 33%, OS 64%

Also, the prognosis depends on the histological transformation to a high-grade lymphoma, where patients had lower five-year survival rates.
