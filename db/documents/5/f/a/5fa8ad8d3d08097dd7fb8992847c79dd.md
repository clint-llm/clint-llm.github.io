By definition, they would require a nerve root or its fibers in the cyst's wall or cavity.

The cystic lesion under histopathological examination has fibrotic changes, and fibro-collagenous and membraneous connective tissue is the most common finding. Hemorrhage may occur and, as a result, invite an inflammatory process, and macrophages and hemosiderin deposits can be seen. An extensive inflammatory component is rarely observed.

The cysts may be uni-loculated or multi-loculated.
