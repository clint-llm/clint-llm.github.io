There are many causes of non-diabetic hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can be broadly divided into two main groups:

- Insulin-mediated (hyperinsulinism)

- Independent of insulin

Insulin-mediated (hyperinsulinism): The endogenous cause of hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulinism in a non-diabetic adult is secondary to Insulinoma and islet cell hyperplasia (nesidioblastosis).

Independent of insulin: Insulin independent hypoglycemia includes alcohol, visceral failure (liver/renal failure), critical illness, primary adrenal failure, anterior pituitary failure, severe sepsis, cerebral malaria, anorexia nervosa, glycogen storage disease, post-bariatric surgery, mesenchymal tumors with elevated IGF-2 levels, autoimmune hypoglycemia secondary to anti-insulin or anti-insulin receptor antibodies and drugs. Hypoglycemia caused by drugs is very common**.**Many drugs other than anti-hyperglycemic medications and alcohol have been reported. Common medications include quinolones, anti-malarial, glucagon, lithium, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists, non-selective B-blockers, etc.).

In children, hypoglycemia is mainly secondary to IEM. It includes glycogen storage disease, fatty acid oxidation defect, ketogenesis defects, and gluconeogenesis disorders. Galactosaemia and hereditary fructose intolerance are rare genetic disorders associated with the body’s impaired ability to metabolize galactose and fructose, respectively.
