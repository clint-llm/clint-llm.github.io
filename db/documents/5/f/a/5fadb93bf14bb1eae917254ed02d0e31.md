Treatment is symptomatic and aimed to reduce triggers (rubbing, change in temperature, dryness, etc) that may cause mast cell release. Oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids are generally used to alleviate symptoms. Phototherapy has also been used to relieve pruritus. Cytoreductive and surgical therapy is reserved for systemic cases. Epinephrine should be used for any cases showing symptoms of anaphylaxis.
