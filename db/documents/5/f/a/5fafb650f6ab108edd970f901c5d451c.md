Consistent or perfect (correct) use of condoms provides effective contraception. With the correct use of condoms within the first year of use, pregnancy rates are two in every 100 women. This is a 98% success rate. This compares to intrauterine devices ( greater than 99% success rate) and the withdrawal method (96% success rate). The correct use of condoms consists of using condoms during and throughout every sexual intercourse. With typical use of condoms (i.e., failure to use condoms during every sexual encounter or not using correctly), pregnancy rates can climb all the way up to 18 in every 100 women within the first year of condom use.

Condoms also serve a primary role in the prevention of certain sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Condoms are most effective at preventing STDs that spread from the male urethral orifice, such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas, hepatitis B, and HIV. Condoms also assist in preventing STDs transmitted via the skin and mucosal membranes, such as herpes simplex virus, syphilis, Haemophilus ducreyi, and human papillomavirus. Condoms only effectively prevent STDs by providing a physical barrier, so prevention only occurs from what is being covered by the actual condom.
