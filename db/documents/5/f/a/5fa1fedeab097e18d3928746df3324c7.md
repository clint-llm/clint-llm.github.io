Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by poor oxygenation and non-compliant or "stiff" lungs. The disorder is associated with capillary endothelial injury and diffuse alveolar damage. Once ARDS develops, patients usually have varying degrees of pulmonary artery vasoconstriction and may develop pulmonary hypertension. ARDS carries a high mortality, and few effective therapeutic modalities exist to ameliorate this deadly condition. This activity reviews the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of acute respiratory distress syndrome and highlights the importance of coordinated interprofessional teamwork in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
- Outline a patient presentation consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
- Identify the parameters and associated values in the NIH-NHLBI ARDS Clinical Network Mechanical Ventilation Protocol.
- Explain the critical role of well-coordinated, interprofessional teamwork when caring for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.
