The pathophysiology of Lhermitte's sign that is associated with the radiographical demyelinating lesions and electrodiagnostic abnormalities on nerve conduction is thought to be related to the demyelination of the dorsal columns of the cervical spine. Other reasons include compressive myelopathy with reported lesions in the dorsal columns of the caudal medulla. It is also thought to transiently activate neuropathic pain pathways, with a more recent theory being that it implicates glutamatergic signaling and microglial cell activation in the CNS.

Lhermitte's sign is thought to result from ectopic firing and hyperexcitability of demyelinated sensory neurons (in cervical regions of the spinal cord), also affecting ascending spinothalamic nociceptive signal transduction and impaired function of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. Other proposed molecular mechanisms include downstream activated microglia that enhance pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, activation of proteins like bradykinin with B1 and B2 receptors, upregulation of Wnt signaling, CREB phosphorylation, and other transcription factors in the CNS that augment hyperexcitability and pain.
