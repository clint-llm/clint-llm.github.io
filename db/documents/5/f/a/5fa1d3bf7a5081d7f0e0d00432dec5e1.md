Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS) was primarily a suggestion of the Center for Health Services Research and Policy at the University of Colorado in 1994.

OASIS is mandatory for all HHAs (or skilled care programs) with Medicare or Medicare managed insurance. Functional health, physical improvement, and adverse events serve as outcome measures.
