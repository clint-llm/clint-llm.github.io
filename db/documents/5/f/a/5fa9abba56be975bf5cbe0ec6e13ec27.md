The majority of patients with LHB pathology can be managed nonoperatively. Consideration for referral should be in the setting of persistent pain/symptoms despite 6 to 8 weeks of nonoperative management. Referral for the appropriate physical therapy program focused on correcting any existing muscular imbalances about the shoulder girdle, including scapular dyskinesia.

A subtle caveat in clinical management is the young athlete or manual laborer presenting with symptoms primarily secondary to LHBT instability. A brief trial of nonoperative management is reasonable in this situation, but early referral to an orthopedic surgeon should be considered in this setting.

Overall, referral principles include:

- Persistent/worsening symptoms despite PT/NSAIDs/activity modification/injections

- Diagnostic imaging confirming evidence of tendon subluxation and/or dislocation

- In the setting of either post-operative “Popeye” deformity, failed biceps tenodesis techniques, or spontaneous rupture, referral to a surgeon with experience in correcting the deformity should be considered
