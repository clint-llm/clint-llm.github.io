The goal of treatment for patients with bipolar disorder is a full functional recovery (a return to pre-illness baseline functioning). This goal can best be achieved by integrating psychiatric and medical healthcare using an interprofessional team approach to manage BD and comorbid psychiatric and medical conditions.

Ideally, a consistent long-term alliance will form between the patient, their family, and healthcare team members to provide pharmacotherapy management, psychoeducation, ongoing monitoring, and psychosocial support.

An interprofessional approach is a mainstay in treating patients with bipolar disorder. An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to patient care can help achieve the best possible outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
