Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 serotonin-receptor antagonist used for its antiemetic properties. It is one of the four FDA-approved 5-HT3 serotonin-receptor antagonists used to combat nausea and vomiting, including granisetron, dolasetron, and the second-generation drug, palonosetron.

Ondansetron acts both centrally and peripherally to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting. Central effects are mediated by the antagonism of 5HT-3 serotonin receptors in the area postrema. The area postrema, located on the fourth ventricle floor, contains the "chemoreceptor trigger zone." This zone senses neurotransmitters like serotonin, toxins, and other signals and plays a role in mediating the sensation of nausea and subsequent vomiting. Ondansetron also has effects peripherally by acting on the vagus nerve. It works on the 5-HT3 receptors that can be found at the vagus nerve terminals. The vagus nerve can sense nausea and vomiting triggers within the GI tract, such as stomach irritants. It forms synapses within the nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem, another region important in vomiting. The peripheral actions of ondansetron are thought to be the predominant mechanism for its antiemetic effects.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Ondansetron undergoes rapid absorption from the GI tract, and the peak plasma concentration (Tmax) is approximately 1.5 hours after an 8 mg single oral dose. The absolute bioavailability of ondansetron after oral administration is approximately 60%(50%-70%). The lower bioavailability is attributed to first-pass metabolism. The systemic bioavailability of ondansetron increases nonlinearly with increasing doses from 8 mg, 16 mg, 32 mg, and 64 mg because of saturation of the first-pass metabolism. The bioavailability of ondansetron is significantly higher in patients with cancer (85% to 87%) than in healthy individuals (50%-70%), possibly due to alterations in metabolism.

**Distribution**: Ondansetron and its metabolites are extensively distributed in tissues. The apparent volume of distribution(Vd) at a steady state is approximately 1.8 L/kg. Ondansetron crosses the blood-brain barrier to a lower extent, with the CSF concentration only about 10%-15% of the plasma concentration in human volunteers. Adenosine binding cassette subfamily 1(ABCB1) is a drug efflux transporter known to transport ondansetron across the blood-brain barrier, thus limiting its accumulation in the CNS. In a patient with decreased activity of ABCB1, the concentration of ondansetron in the brain increases and improves efficacy.

**Metabolism:**The liver is the primary site of metabolism. The primary mechanism of metabolism is oxidation. 8-hydroxy ondansetron represents the major metabolite (40%), followed by 7-hydroxy ondansetron (< 20%) and 6-hydroxy ondansetron (<5%). Minor metabolism also occurs via N-demethylation to yield N-demethyl ondansetron. The active metabolite of ondansetron is  8-hydroxy ondansetron which is rapidly metabolized to glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in the liver, resulting in low blood concentrations and, thus, a very small contribution to ondansetron's antiemetic activity. Cytochrome P-450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, are involved in the metabolism of ondansetron. In humans, CYP1A1/2 plays the most crucial role, while CYP2D6 plays a minor role in the metabolism of ondansetron. The role of CYP3A4 is important at higher concentrations of ondansetron.

**Excretion:**Hepatic metabolism accounts for nearly 95% of ondansetron clearance, and less than 5% is excreted unchanged in the urine. The clearance and elimination half-life of ondansetron vary according to age. The elimination half-life after an 8 mg oral or intravenous dose is approximately 3-4 h in adults, but on average, it is 5.5 hours in the elderly. Clearance ranges from 0.381 L/h/kg to 0.262 L/h/kg, depending on age. In adults, clearance is 0.351 5L/h/kg. The clearance per body weight is higher in younger children. However, the clearance is decreased in infants due to the underdeveloped cytochrome P450 enzyme system.
