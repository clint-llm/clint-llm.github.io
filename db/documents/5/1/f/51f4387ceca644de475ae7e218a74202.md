Patisiran is a well-tolerated medicine and has demonstrated long-term safety and efficacy.

**Carcinogenesis**

In animal studies, patisiran was negative for carcinogenicity when administered intravenously in TgRasH2 type of mice for 26 weeks at dosages of 0.5, 2, or 6 mg per kg every two weeks.

**Mutagenesis**

Patisiran-LC was not genotoxic in vitro (bacterial mutagenicity assay and human peripheral blood lymphocytes chromosomal aberration assay) and in vivo (mouse bone marrow micronucleus) assays.

**Impairment of Fertility**

The administration of patisiran-LC (0, 0.03, 0.1, or 0.3 mg/kg) or pharmacologically active and rodent-specific surrogate (0.1 mg/kg) to male rats via intravenous route every two weeks before and throughout mating to untreated females resulted in no any adverse effects on the fertility.

The administration of patisiran-LC (0, 0.15, 0.50, or 1.5 mg/kg) or pharmacologically active and rodent-specific surrogate (1.5 mg/kg) to female rates via intravenous route every week for two weeks before and continuing throughout the organogenesis produced no adverse effects on the reproduction or development of the embryo and fetus.

Intravenous administration of patisiran-LC (0, 0.3, 1, or 2 mg/kg) to adult monkeys every three weeks for 39 weeks produced no adverse effects on male reproductive organs or sperm morphology or count.
