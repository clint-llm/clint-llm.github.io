The inciting event for neovascular glaucoma is retinal ischemia.

VEGF can cause mitosis and migration of vascular endothelial cells and leukocyte adhesion at the endothelial cells.  These events can lead to a breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier.

This fibrovascular membrane has proliferated myofibroblasts. This membrane can cover the surface of the iris and angle of the anterior chamber, causing an obstruction to the flow of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork. This is known as the secondary open-angle stage of NVG. Over a period of time, this fibrovascular membrane contracts to cause secondary angle-closure glaucoma.  This is known as the secondary closed-angle stage of NVG.  Both the secondary open-angle and angle-closure stages are associated with raised IOP.

Ischemia of the retina and optic nerve head results in deleterious effects on the vision of the eyes with NVG. Ocular perfusion pressure is defined as the difference between arterial Blood pressure (BP) and intraocular pressure (IOP).
