Regional analgesic techniques are indicated whenever possible for the management of postoperative pain. Several regional techniques are also used to treat various cancer and non-cancer chronic pain conditions. Regional techniques form an integral part of a number of enhanced recovery protocols and aid in minimizing the requirements of opioids to control postoperative pain. Adequate management of acute pain is essential to prevent transition to chronic pain.
