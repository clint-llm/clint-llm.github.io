Management of photosensitivity involves sun protection and treatment of the underlying disorder. Mainly, photosensitivity reactions are prevented by careful protection from sun exposure and avoidance of exposure to artificial sources of UVR. Use of websites and smartphone apps that indicate local ultraviolet levels are helpful to understand when protection is most essential. There is more ultraviolet radiation in the tropics compared to temperate areas, in the Southern hemisphere compared to the Northern, during summer compared to winter, at high altitude compared to sea level, and in the middle of the day compared to the extremes of the day.

Protection involves:

- Avoiding exposure to direct sunlight

- Staying indoors and away from windows, and seeking shade when outdoors

- Dressing up in covering clothing and wearing a wide-brimmed hat when outdoors. Some clothing is labeled with ultraviolet protection factor (UPF). Best protection from clothing is obtained from thick, tightly woven, dry and dark colored polyester, denim or wool

- Broad-spectrum sunscreen SPF 50 or higher, covering all exposed skin. Sunscreen should protect from UVB and UVA and be water resistant. It should be applied generously and reapplied every two hours while outdoors

- Tanning products containing dihydroxyacetone provide modest photoprotection against UVA and to a lesser extent against UVB.

SPF is sun protection factor, defined as the dose of solar radiation needed to induce just perceptible erythema (minimal erythema dose, MED) on skin treated with 2 mg/cm sunscreen divided by the MED on untreated skin. SPF primarily describes protection from UVB, as it reflects protection from the erythema action spectrum.

The primary photodermatosis polymorphic light eruption may be paradoxically effectively treated by graduated, and cautious, exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
