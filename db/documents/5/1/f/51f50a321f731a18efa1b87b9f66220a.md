There is no individual test that establishes the diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The diagnosis is based on classic clinical manifestations, radiographic findings, and immunological findings.

**Aspergillus skin test:**

- Aspergillus skin test (AST) is the investigation most commonly used for diagnosing sensitization to A. fumigatus.

- It reveals immediate cutaneous hypersensitivity to A. fumigatus.

- A positive Type I Hypersensitivity reaction is typical of ABPA and represents the presence of A. fumigatus-specific IgE antibodies.

- Intradermal skin tests are more sensitive than the skin prick test for the diagnosis of Aspergillus sensitization.

**Blood Abnormalities:**

- Elevated total serum IgE (usually over 1000 IU/mL)

- Elevated specific serum IgE to A. fumigatus (Af)

- Presence of serum precipitins (by gel diffusion) or raised specific serum IgG to A. fumigatus

- Peripheral blood eosinophilia (often absent, especially if the patient is on oral or inhaled corticosteroids)

**Radiological manifestations of ABPA**:

- Chest X-ray has 50% sensitivity for the diagnosis of ABPA. It can show parenchymal infiltrate and bronchiectasis changes mostly in the upper lobes; however, all lobes may exhibit involvement.

- HRCT Chest is the investigation of choice to detect bronchiectasis distribution and other abnormalities that are undetectable on a chest X-ray, such as centrilobular nodules and tree-in-bud appearance.

- Patients of ABPA with no abnormalities on HRCT chest are labeled as serologic ABPA (ABPA-S).

- Patients with central bronchiectasis on HRCT are labeled as ABPA Central Bronchiectasis (ABPA-CB).

The following shadows may present radiologically:

- “Finger in glove” opacity: suggestive of mucoid impaction in dilated bronchi.

- “Tramline shadows”: suggestive of parallel linear shadows extending from the hilum in bronchial distribution and reflecting longitudinal views of inflamed, edematous bronchi

- “Toothpaste shadows”: representing mucoid impaction of the bronchi

- “Ring shadows”: reflecting dilated bronchi with inflamed bronchial walls

**Revised radiologic classification of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis based on findings on a high-resolution computed tomography of the chest.**

- ABPA-S (Serological ABPA): Fulfills the diagnostic criteria of ABPA with an absence of any radiological finding of ABPA on HRCT of the thorax.

- ABPA-B (Bronchiectasis ABPA): Satisfies the diagnostic requirements of ABPA along with the presence of bronchiectasis.

- ABPA-HAM (ABPA- High attenuation mucus): ABPA, along with the presence of high attenuation mucus on HRCT of the thorax.

- ABPA-CPF (ABPA-Chronic pleuropulmonary fibrosis): Fulfills the diagnostic criteria of ABPA with at least two radiological features suggestive of fibrosis (including fibrocavitary lesions, pulmonary fibrosis, pleural thickening) without the presence of mucoid impaction (or HAM).

**Pulmonary function tests**:

- Aids in measuring lung function impairment severity and monitoring improvement of lung function on follow up.

- Obstructive ventilatory defect: Stages I, III, IV, and often, V and may not correlate with the duration of ABPA or asthma.

- Patients with Stage V disease typically also have a restrictive ventilatory defect and a reduced DLCO.

**Bronchoscopy:**Mucoid impaction may be evident, and bronchial brushings may reveal mucus that contains aggregates of eosinophils, fungal hyphae, and eosinophil-derived Charcot–Leyden crystals. The finding of hyphae-filled mucus plugs is considered pathognomonic for ABPA. BAL fluid analysis from patients with ABPA: moderate eosinophilia (especially in steroid-naive patients) and increased levels of Aspergillus-specific IgE and IgA, but not IgG.

**Sputum cultures for A. fumigatus:**It is not diagnostic, but if it reveals an organism, then it helps in drug susceptibility test.

The following criteria are used for the diagnosis and typing of ABPA.

**1) Rosenberg-Patterson criteria:** It has eight major and three minor criteria.

- **Major criteria**1. Asthma2. Presence of transient pulmonary infiltrates (fleeting shadows)3. Immediate cutaneous reactivity toAf (A. fumigatus)4. Elevated total serum IgE5. Precipitating antibodies against Af6. Peripheral blood eosinophilia7. Elevated serum IgE and IgG to Af8. Central/proximal bronchiectasis with normal tapering of distal bronchi

- **Minor criteria**1. Expectoration of golden brownish sputum plugs2. Positive sputum culture forAspergillus species3. Late (Arthus-type) skin reactivity to Af

**2) Criteria proposed by ISHAM working group :
**

- **Predisposing conditions**1. Bronchial asthma2. Cystic fibrosis

- **Obligatory criteria (both should be present)**1. Type I - positiveAspergillus skin test (immediate cutaneous hypersensitivity to Aspergillus antigen) or elevated IgE levels against Af2. Elevated total IgE levels (greater than 1000 IU/mL)

- **Other criteria (at least two of three)**1. Presence of precipitating or IgG antibodies againstAf in serum2. Radiographic pulmonary opacities consistent with ABPA3. Total eosinophil count over 500 cells/microliter in steroid naïve patients(If the patient meets all the other criteria, an IgE value less than 1000 IU/mL may be acceptable)

Cystic Fibrosis Foundation has revised the criteria for the diagnosis of ABPA in patients with cystic fibrosis. ABPA is diagnosed and should be treated if the following are present:

1. Deterioration of cough, wheeze, sputum, or deterioration in pulmonary functions

2. Total serum IgE level more than 1000 IU/ml or greater than twofold from baseline

3. Aspergillus precipitins or increased Aspergillus specific IgG or IgE

4. New infiltrates on chest radiograph or CT scan

If patients have new radiographic findings, symptoms, or an increase in baseline IgE to more than 500 IU/ml, even then treatment of ABPA should be given to cystic fibrosis patients.
