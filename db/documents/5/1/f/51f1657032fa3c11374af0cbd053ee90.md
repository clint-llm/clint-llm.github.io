Prognosis largely depends upon the extent of the disease and its complications. Benign cystic teratomas generally have an excellent prognosis after surgical management with some risk of recurrence in 2Â to 10 years. On the contrary cystic teratomas with malignant transformation have variable outcomes depending upon the stage, growth pattern, and vascular invasion of the tumor.
