Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of essential tremors, dystonia, Parkinson disease, and treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disease (OCD).

Since the nascent stages of its discovery, DBS technology has increasingly gained application and use. The initial implementationÂ of DBS was for the treatment of essential tremor (ET) and the tremor of Parkinson disease (PD).

In 1999, the first psychiatric indication for DBS was published.
