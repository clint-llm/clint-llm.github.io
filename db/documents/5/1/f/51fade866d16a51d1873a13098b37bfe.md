There are no absolute definitive contraindications for cardiac catheterization procedures. Most of the contraindications are relative depending on the indication for the procedure and the associated comorbidities of the patient. When the risk of complications is expected to be more than what is considered acceptable for the procedure, alternative modes of imaging and assessment can be used to answer the clinical question. Experienced operators will modify the technique of the procedure in a way as to get the best possible outcomes for the patient with the least amount of risk. Before planning for this procedure, the clinician should clearly understand the clinical question that needs to be answered.
