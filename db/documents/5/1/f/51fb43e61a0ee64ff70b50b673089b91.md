Spider veins are the result of abnormalities in the horizontal vascular plexus of capillary loops in the skin and can have arterial or venous origins.

The exact pathophysiology of spider veins remains unknown. Some theories have suggested that spider veins arise from varicose veins and are secondary to a similar mechanism of valvular incompetence in chronic venous disease. Interestingly, one study found that only 22.9% of patients with spider veins had evidence of venous incompetence.

Another theory by Goldman suggested that telangiectasias are the result of local anoxia, which causes inflammation of the endothelium and vascular neogenesis.
