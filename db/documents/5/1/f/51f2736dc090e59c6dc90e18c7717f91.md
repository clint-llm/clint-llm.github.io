Prevention occurs both at the individual and community levels. Diligent hand hygiene with soap and water for 20 seconds is recommended in infected individuals to help prevent the spread of infection to their family members and colleagues because some of the viruses, e.g., norovirus, is relatively resistant to alcohol-based hand sanitizers. For disease outbreaks, especially in the cases of norovirus infection occurring in health care and long-term care facilities, standard enteric precaution measures involves careful handwashing, and the use of barriers, such as wearing gloves, is advocated. Environmental cleaning with the removal of visible material, followed by 1000 ppm to 5000 ppm chlorine bleach solution cleaning, is also recommended. Generally, sick individuals are advised to be excluded from work for 48 to 72 hours post-illness**.**In cases of an outbreak of contamination of an identified water or food source, public health measures should be directed at the identified sources.
