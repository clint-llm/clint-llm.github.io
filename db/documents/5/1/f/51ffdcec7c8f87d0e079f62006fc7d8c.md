Treatment depends on the severity and symptoms of HO or the risk that patient may have of developing HO. The orthopedic surgeon often will determine the type of HO prophylaxis the patient obtains. Early-grade cases that are asymptomatic may be observed. Advanced HO may require surgical resection followed by prophylactic modalities, such as medical therapy and radiation therapy (RT), to help minimize the high risk for re-development of HO. When a patient does not have a history of HO, the decision to offer prophylactic treatment is often weighed with patient-related, clinical, and surgical risk factors against the potential risks of preventative treatment.

**Medical Therapy**

The main medical therapy used for HO prophylaxis is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). While indomethacin is the most commonly used NSAID, other NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, have been effective with the added benefit of ease of administration and low cost. The recommended dose of indomethacin is 75 to 100 mg/day for 7 to 14 days postoperatively, with care for gastrointestinal side effects such as gastritis and ulcer formation
