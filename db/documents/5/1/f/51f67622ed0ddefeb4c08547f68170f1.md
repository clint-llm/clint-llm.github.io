In a single-center retrospective study conducted on 101 patients with renal infarction by Kwon et al. from 2005 to 2013, 41 (39%) patients developed acute kidney injury, and 27 out of 80 patients (33.8%) progressed to chronic kidney disease. In multivariate analysis, the risk factors for acute kidney injury in this study were hypertension and the presence of bilateral renal infarction.

The incidence of acute kidney injury positively correlated with infarct size, the levels of AST, ALT, CRP, and LDH, the degree of proteinuria and hematuria, and WBC count in this study.

In another study by Yang et al, diabetes mellitus (p = 0.005), CRP (p = 0.001), and leukocytosis (p = 0.007) showed a significant relationship with acute kidney injury (P = 0.005).

The progression to chronic kidney disease from acute kidney injury correlated with the magnitude of the infarction.
