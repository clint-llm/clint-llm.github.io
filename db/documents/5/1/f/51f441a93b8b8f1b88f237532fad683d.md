Intravenous fluids are commonly administered during resuscitation. Broadly, intravenous fluids can fall into two separate categories: crystalloids and colloids. In most clinical settings, crystalloids are the choice of fluid for many indications for fluid resuscitation, maintenance, or as a solvent for medication delivery.

The 2018 sepsis guidelines from the Surviving Sepsis Campaign have suggested the initiation of treatment with crystalloid fluids. However, they do not make recommendations regarding which fluid should is the best choice. According to their recommendations, fluids should be aggressively administered at a rate of 30 ml/kg in the first hour in a setting of hypotension or a lactate concentration greater than 4 mmol/L.

Established guidelines for crystalloid fluid under various clinical conditions are not yet extant. The SMART and SMART-SURG trials demonstrated a decreased rate of AKI but not overall survival among critically ill patients who received Ringer's lactate, a balanced, lactate-buffered crystalloid over normal saline.
