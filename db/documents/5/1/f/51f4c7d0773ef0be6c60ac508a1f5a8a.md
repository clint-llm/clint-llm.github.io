A thorough history and physical is required to determine the etiology of lower eyelid ectropion. It is very important to understand if the patient had prior surgery, for example,Â lower eyelid blepharoplasty, or trauma or cancer excision and repair of the lower eyelid and/or cheek area. A proper history will help guide the clinician as to the etiologic factors and what to look for on examination. The patient should also be asked about any symptoms related to dry eye, eye rubbing, or instability of the eyelids. A full ophthalmic examination is necessary to properly assess the bilateral eyelids as well as the ocular surface and cornea to evaluation for any complications related to the ectropion.
