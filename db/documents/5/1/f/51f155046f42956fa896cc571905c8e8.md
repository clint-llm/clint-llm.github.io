It sometimes is helpful to consider the different etiologies of pain. Visceral pain usually presents with a vague distribution pattern meaning that the patient is unlikely to localize the pain to a specific spot. When asking patients to point with one finger where they feel the pain, they will often move their hand around a larger area. Common descriptors of visceral pain are dull, deep, pressure, and squeezing. Visceral pain also refers to other locations as a result of the nerves coursing through somatic nerve fibers as they reach the spinal cord. Ischemic heart pain, for example, may refer to the left or right shoulder, jaw, or left arm. Symptoms like nausea and vomiting may also be a sign of visceral pain. Diaphragmatic irritation may refer to the shouldersÂ as well.
