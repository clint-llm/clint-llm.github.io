Cluster headaches are the most common of the primary headache type known as trigeminal autonomic cephalgia. They are fairly rare, plaguing 0.1% of the population, making studying the disease process difficult at best. They are considered one of if not the most severe types of headaches, and so, despite their rarity, recognition and treatment are vital. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of cluster headaches, including recognizing other forms of headache. Also, it assesses the approved abortive treatments and prophylactic management and distinguishes them from common treatments with poor supporting evidence. The activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with cluster headaches.

**Objectives:**
- Review the specific diagnostic criteria of a cluster headache, including the staging.
- Describe abortive treatments for cluster headaches, including lifestyle changes, medication choices, and supplemental treatments.
- Identify prophylactic therapy options for cluster headaches and distinguish these from popular medications with limited therapeutic evidence.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of cluster headaches.
