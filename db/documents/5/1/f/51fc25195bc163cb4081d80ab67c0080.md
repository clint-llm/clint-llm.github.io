The elbow's ranges of motion (ROM) are flexion, extension, pronation, and supination. In healthy individuals, flexion lies between 130 to 154 degrees, extension from -6 to 11 degrees, pronation from 75 to 85 degrees, and supination from 80 to 104 degrees.

The bony anatomy of the elbow joint requires a brief description to lay the framework for the collateral ligaments of the elbow. Three bony structures create multiple articulations within the elbow complex. The three bony structures include the distal humerus, proximal radius, and proximal ulna. The distal humerus contains two main structures, the trochlea, and the capitellum. The medial epicondyle of the humerus provides a site of connection for ligamentous and muscular structures.

The proximal ulna also has two articulations, the greater and lesser sigmoid notches. The trochlea and greater sigmoid notch have 180 degrees of articular contact during the elbow range of motion (ROM). The lesser sigmoid notch articulates with the radius at the proximal radioulnar joint. The radial head and capitellum form the raidiocapitellar joint. The radial head allows for pronation and supination of the elbow.

The MCL has three ligamentous portions: the anterior bundle (AMCL), the posterior bundle, and the transverse ligament (Cooper ligament). The AMCL and posterior bundle originate from the medial epicondyle of the distal humerus, on the posterior side of the elbow; this creates ligamentous tension with elbow flexion. The insertion site of the AMCL is the sublime tubercle on the coronoid process of the ulna, and the posterior bundle inserts on at the medial olecranon of the ulna.

The transverse ligament originates from the olecranon process inserts on the sublime tubercle of the ulna.

The MCL also functions as a restraint in posteromedial rotatory instability, specifically the AMCL. Further evaluating the MCL and the specifics of valgus stress, the MCL provides one-third of the valgus restraint in extension, and one half in 90 degrees of elbow flexion. The MCL coincides with the flexor and pronator forearm musculature in dynamic stability.

The LCL contains four ligamentous portions: the lateral ulnar collateral ligament (LUCL), radial collateral ligament (RCL), annular ligament, and accessory collateral ligament. The LUCL and RCL originate from the inferior surface of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus. These two ligaments provide consistent tension through elbow ROM. The LUCL inserts at the proximal ulna and the RCL attached to the annular ligament. The annular ligament wraps around the radial head and attaches to the anterior snd posterior margins of the lesser sigmoid notch of the proximal ulna. The RCL and annular ligaments provide stabilization for the radial head.

The accessory collateral ligament runs from the medial portion of the supinator crest (on the proximal ulna) and attaches to the inferior portion of the annular ligament.
