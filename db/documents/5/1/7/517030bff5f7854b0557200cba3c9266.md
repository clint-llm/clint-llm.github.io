The diagnosis of an acoustic neuroma is made with a contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a computed tomogram scan. Contrast is essential; otherwise, the non-enhanced scan can miss small tumors. If hearing impairment is present, audiometric tests are needed. Auditory brainstem evoked response is not used frequently to screen for acoustic tumors as it can miss small malignancies.

The widening of the porus acusticus due to an intracanalicular component causes a trumpeted internal acoustic meatus sign. Tumor growth into the extrameatal space produces the characteristic “ice-cream cone appearance.”

Most acoustic neuromas are hypo to isointense on T1 weighted images and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images. There is usually avid contrast enhancement.

Fast spin-echo MRI may be useful as a screening test given its low cost and noninvasiveness.
