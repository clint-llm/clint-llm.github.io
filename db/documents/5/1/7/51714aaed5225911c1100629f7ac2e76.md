The following immediate life-threatening complications during an attack of muscle weakness can occur:

- Cardiac arrhythmias due to hypokalemia

- Respiratory insufficiency due to respiratory muscle paralysis

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis does not involve heart, and cardiac arrhythmias are uncommon but have been reported during attacks of muscle weakness.

**Long-lasting Muscle Weakness**

Many patients can have muscle weakness during the interictal period (i.e., between paralytic attacks), but its frequency and the risk for long-lasting weakness are unknown.

**Myopathy**

Most patients develop progressive proximal myopathy; however, the frequency is unknown. It usually manifests after age 50, is less fluctuating, and less sensitive to medications, which suggest there is muscle degeneration, a fixed myopathy.

**Complication Related to Therapy**

Nephrolithiasis is a well-known side effect due to acetazolamide therapy. A report showed an occurrence of renal stones in up to 15% of patients taking acetazolamide for the long term. The treatment of acetazolamide induced renal stones is the removal of stone without stopping acetazolamide therapy.
