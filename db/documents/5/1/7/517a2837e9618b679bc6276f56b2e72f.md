HIV prophylaxis is divided into two categories: post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PEP is the administration of antiretroviral therapy to an HIV-negative person who may expose to HIV. Exposure can be occupational (oPEP) or non-occupational (nPEP), with non-occupational exposure being related to sexual or intravenous (IV) drug exposures. PrEP is the use of antiretroviral drugs in a high-risk, HIV-negative patient, to prevent future HIV infections. This activity reviews the evaluation of HIV prophylaxis and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients on the options available.
