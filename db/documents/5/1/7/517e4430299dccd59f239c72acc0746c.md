Activity restrictions depend on the degree of residual hemodynamic abnormality. Avoid participation in strenuous activities and competitive sports.

Competitive sports and games and strenuous exercises should not be permitted in the following situations:

- Clinically significant left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (peak echo pressure gradient greater than 50 mm Hg)

- Marked left ventricular hypertrophy

- Clinically significant ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmia

- More than mild aortic regurgitation
