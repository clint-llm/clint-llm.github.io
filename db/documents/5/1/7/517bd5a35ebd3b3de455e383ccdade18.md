A common side effect of cardiovascular blockers is bradycardia, decreasing heart rate and strength of contraction due to its negative chronotropic and inotropic effect. It also decreases cardiac output; therefore, it decreases exercise capacity. Blocking beta receptors on the SA and AV node always carries a risk of heart block. It correlates less frequently with exacerbation of peripheral diseases such as the Raynaud phenomenon, bronchoconstriction, and hypoglycemiaÂ than non-selective beta-blockers.

Other commonly encountered side effects include nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Hypoglycemia is a dangerous side effect that happens in people with diabetes mellitus using beta-blockers. The drug blocks the typical signs of hypoglycemia, such as tachycardia; therefore, it delays the body's normal response to hypoglycemia, which may lead to fear of complications.
