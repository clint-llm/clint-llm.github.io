The organ systems involved are the hematologic system, gastrointestinal (GI) system, and hepatobiliary system. The hematologic system contributes through the formation of bilirubin from biliverdin. Biliverdin forms from the oxidation of heme in old RBCs in the reticuloendothelial system. The GI system is responsible for regulating the alkaline secretions of bile, secreting CCK which causes contraction of the gallbladder, active absorption of bile salts in the terminal ileum, excretion of cholesterol, and excretion of bilirubin in the form of stercobilin. Stercobilin forms by the action of the colonic bacterial flora which converts urobilinogen into stercobilin. Â The hepatobiliary system is responsible for the formation, secretion, and storage of bile.
