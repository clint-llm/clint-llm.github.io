Classification for nomenclature purposes has been established by Williams et al. with the collaboration of the Childrenâ€™s Spine Study Group and the Growing Spine Study Group. This classification system has been seen with interobserver and intraobserver reliability.

**The C-EOS**

**Patient age
**

**Etiology
**

- Congenital/Structural (C)

- Neuromuscular (M)

- Syndromic (S)

- Idiopathic (I)

**Coronal Cobb angle
**

- Less than 20 degrees (1)

- 20 to 50 degrees (2)

- 51 to 90 degrees (3)

- Greater than 90 degrees (4)

**Maximum kyphosis
**

- Less than 20 degrees (-)

- 20 to 50 degrees (N)

- Greater than 50 degrees (+)

**Progression modifier
**

- Less than 10 degrees per year (P0)

- 10 to 20 degrees per year (P1)

- Greater than 20 degrees per year (P2)

For example, a 7-year-old patient with congenital scoliosis with a 23-degree coronal curve having 57 degrees of kyphosis with 15 degrees of progression would be labeled a 7C2+P1.
