Arrhythmia entails a broad spectrum of disorders of heart rate and rhythm abnormalities. Arrhythmia is broadly categorized into bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmia based on the heart rate. They are further divided according to the origin, means of transmission, and syndromes associated with it. Patients with an arrhythmia may exhibit a broad spectrum of clinical presentation from being entirely asymptomatic to sudden cardiac arrest. Arrhythmias can be paroxysmal, leading to difficulty in estimating true prevalence. This activity outlines the evaluation and the treatment of various arrhythmias and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the broad categories of arrhythmias
- Outline the typical presentation of various arrhythmias.
- Identify the typical electrocardiographic features and treatment options for arrhythmias.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for further electrophysiological testing and management option with defibrillators and pacemakers.
