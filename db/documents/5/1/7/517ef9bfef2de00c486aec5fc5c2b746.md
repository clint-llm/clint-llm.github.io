Treatment of palatal malignancies often requires multimodal therapy depending on the specific histology, stage and extent of disease, and patient tolerance of treatment. Wide local excision with negative margins is the treatment of choice for the majority of malignant palatal lesions.

Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) is often used after initial surgical resection for high-grade tumors, positive or close margins, cervical metastasis, perineural invasion, and recurrent disease.

Radiotherapy alone is ineffective for malignant salivary gland tumors due to its radio-resistance and frequent bony invasion.
