Ear complaints are a relatively common complaint in primary care.

Overall, primary causes tend to be more common. Men tend to have a primary cause, while women tend to have a secondary cause.Streptococcus pneumoniae caused most cases of AOM. In 2000 and 2010, PCV-7 and PCV-13 vaccines were released to provide immunity against Streptococcus pneumoniae. After their release, the percent of outpatient visits for AOM decreased from 9.5% to 5.5% from 2012 to 2014. Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae took over as the most common cause of AOM.Haemophilus influenzae Type B, but not yet for the non-typable strain (unencapsulated).

While primary causes tend to be more common, two studies stated that secondary causes account for nearly 50% of cases of otalgia.
