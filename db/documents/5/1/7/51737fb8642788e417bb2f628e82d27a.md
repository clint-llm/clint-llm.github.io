Cell phone use while driving causes an estimated 1.6 million car crashes annually. About 1 in 4 crashes are related to texting while driving. Drivers should always obey the speed limit, avoid driving under the influence, and should not be distracted while driving. Pedestrians should always be aware of the traffic around them. It should not be assumed a car will see them or give the pedestrian the right of way.

It is important to set patients’ expectations. Patients may need extended rehabilitation and physical therapy, especially with pelvic fractures. They should be educated on the possibility of chronic pain and should receive information on pain management options, as well as options for the possible depression and anxiety that may follow. Patients with suprapubic or indwelling catheters should receive catheter training. The possibility of sexual dysfunction should be addressed with appropriate referrals to gynecologists or urology.
