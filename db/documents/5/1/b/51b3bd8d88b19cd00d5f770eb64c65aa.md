Pulmonary infarction (PI) is usually a complication of another primary disease state, most commonly a pulmonary embolism (PE). The broad differential diagnosis associated with PI is important, as associated signs and symptoms have limited specificity and PI may be the first indication of significant underlying pathology. This activity reviews how to properly evaluate for pulmonary infarction and further steps that should be taken when pulmonary infarction is present. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the characteristic presentation of pulmonary infarction. 
- Describe the typical evaluation findings in a patient with a pulmonary infarction. 
- Summarize the management options for a patient with a pulmonary infarction. 
- Explain why careful planning and discussion amongst interprofessional team members involved in the management of patients with pulmonary infarction will improve outcomes.
