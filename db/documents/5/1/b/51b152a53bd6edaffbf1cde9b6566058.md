Assessment of developmental delays often requires the work of a team with experts in general and specific areas.  This should start with primary care providers followed by pediatric subspecialists such as neurologists, child and adolescent psychiatrists, developmental and behavioral pediatricians, and other pediatric subspecialists as indicated. Besides, the skills from other disciplines may be necessary, for example, psychology, genetics, speech and language pathology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, nutritionists, etc. The United States Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF) offers specific recommendations for speech and language delays and autism but does not explicitly cover other developmental delays. Clinicians, particularly primary care providers, must have a sound understanding of developmental milestones and patterns, as well as up-to-date knowledge about screening tests and their strengths & limitations, to ensure proper screening for a referral if the clinical suspicion of developmental screening is high.

During each well-child encounter, a PCP should encourage parents to express their concerns about their child's behavior or developmental milestones.ASQ-3), and the Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status (PEDS) are commonly used parent-report tools for use during well-child encounters. Hamilton et al. 2016, cited by Vitrikas, reported the sensitivity and specificity of PEDS questionnaires for all ages 75% and 74%, respectively. Although the sensitivity and specificity for ASQ-3 vary among different age groups; however, overall sensitivity is 85%, and specificity is 86%.

**Laboratory Workup**

Laboratory evaluations of children with developmental delays should be done judiciously.  There should be careful attention to resource utilization and the risk-benefit analysis for each test.  Since most causes of developmental delay are idiopathic, it is rare to obtain significant or pathognomonic findings in laboratory testing.  Therefore, aside from routine healthcare assessments, testing should only be completed if there is a specific indication.

**Blood:**Routine complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, and lead screening are appropriate for most children, along with a lipid panel. If indicated, additional testing may include a metabolic chemistry panel(CMP), iron,  calcium, phosphate, creatinine kinase (CK) enzyme. Additionally, uric acid level, thyroid function tests, lactic acid, very-long-chain fatty acids (VLFA), transferrin, lead, copper, ceruloplasmin level, ammonia, and acylcarnitine levels.

**Urine:**A routine urinalysis is appropriate but additional studies may be added to include organic acids, amino acids, oligosaccharides, sialic acids, glycosaminoglycans, urea, urine purine, and pyrimidines, etc.

**Cerebrospinal fluid**(**CSF**): CSF analysis is rarely appropriate for developmental assessment delay.  If there is a specific indication for a lumbar puncture, it can be considered.  The particular indication will largely determine appropriate assessments of the spinal fluid, which may include glucose, lactic acid, glycine, pyruvate, etc.

Other tests need to be done to rule out **TORCH**(Toxoplasma, Others (HBV, HIV), Rubella, CMV, and Herpesvirus) infections.

**Genetic:**In general, genetic testing is not indicated for developmental delay unless there is a specific indication or evidence of a discrete syndrome.  If further genetic testing is indicated, this should begin with a chromosomal microarray (CMA). Since the most commonly known genetic cause of intellectual delay is Fragile X, FraX screening may be appropriate. As per Moeschler et al., CMA is required for Fragile X syndrome. The detection of significant copy number variants and approximated diagnostic yield of microarray tests are 15-20% and 12%, respectively. If further genetic testing is indicated, referral to a geneticist is indicated. Consideration of a whole exome scan (WES) or whole-genome scan will determine the clinical syndromes being considered.

**Additional Assessments**

**Magnetic resonance imaging****(MRI)**brain — In the absence of discrete family history, specific injury, or focal neurological finding, MRI is rarely indicated in the routine assessment of children with developmental delay.  This is because children under the age of 7 or 8 will have difficulty being still, and so movement artifacts will make interpretation of the scans difficult to impossible. Examinations can be completed using anesthesia, but, in most cases, the risk of anesthesia outweighs the potential benefit of the MRI scan. MRI is used to evaluate for microcephaly, macrocephaly, seizures, abnormal neurologic signs and symptoms, and hydrocephalus. One prospective and observational study compared the MRI findings of eighty-one (n=81) pediatric patients. Among them, 68% of cases showed abnormal MRI findings compared to 32%  normal MRI results. The abnormal 68% MRI results demonstrated by traumatic/ neurovascular diseases (31%), congenital & developmental (17%), neoplastic (2.5%), metabolic & degenerative (10%), and non-specific (7.5%).

**Electroencephalography****(EEG)**— In the absence of discrete family history, specific injury, or focal neurological findings, EEG studies are rarely indicated in the routine assessment of children with developmental delay.  EEG may be useful if there is a clear history of regression and/or directly observed seizure activity.

To summarize, children with developmental delays are usually identified as a result of parental concern, school/daycare observation, or during the course of routine care in primary care settings. When there is information from parents and/or teachers, the primary care provider should take it seriously and carefully assess the developmental delay and its possible causes.
