NSAID-induced gastritis is a widespread occurrence encountered by a vast spectrum of medical specialties. Data supports the underutilization of strategies to prevent NSAID induced gastritis in those at risk for gastrointestinal complications of NSAID therapy (Level IV).  One retrospective observational cohort study revealed that among new NSAID users, 86.6% of patients with one risk factor for upper gastrointestinal ulcers and 81.2% with two risk factors did not receive appropriate prophylaxis.

Women who present for medical management of first-trimester miscarriage must be made aware misoprostol does not hold FDA approval for this particular use. Increased healthcare costs may be a result of delayed medical management of elective abortion as women contemplate the cost and unease with the “off-label” status. Any delay in abortion increases the risk of complications, emergency department presentations, and the need for surgical evacuation.

When using misoprostol for any indication, an interprofessional team approach between physicians and/or mid-level providers (PAs, NPs), pharmacy, and nursing is the optimal care strategy. This strategy is particularly true in the obstetric realm, where FDA approval is lacking, and the patient can benefit from pharmacist input along with nurses who have specialized obstetric training.
