Aside from a thorough history and physical, the workup will likely require imaging and laboratory tests. For a bleed in the skull, a prompt non-contrast CT scan is necessary within six hours of onset for the best outcomes.

For bleeding in the chest, diagnosis is aided using a chest X-ray, ultrasound, or CT scan depending on the available resources (and the patient's clinical stability). Hemodynamically unstable patients should not be moved to a diagnostic area for evaluation. Bedside procedures such as chest X-ray and/or ultrasound can help make a diagnosis of a significant hemothorax without moving the patient to a more uncontrolled area such as is often required for advanced imaging like CT scan.  A fluid analysis will definitively diagnose the presence of blood from other forms of fluid. Treatment includes placement of a chest tube for drainage and possible surgical exploration if there is greater than 1500 mL output initially or greater than 200 mL per hour after initial placement.

Especially in the setting of shock secondary to abdominal bleeding, the use of a CT scan, and the focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST Scan) are indicated.

Evaluation of bleeding from an anatomic orifice often relies on endoscopy of the area of concern, which may include, but not limited to, bronchoscopy, cystoscopy, colonoscopy, or esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).
