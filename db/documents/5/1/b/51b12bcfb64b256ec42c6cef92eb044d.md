Overdose of methadone can cause severe respiratory depression and can lead to demise. Signs of overdose include extreme lethargy, somnolence, stupor, coma, miosis, bradycardia, hypotension, respiratory sedation, and cardiac arrest. The patient's oxygenation and ventilation should have close monitoring in case of overdose. The patient is treated with naloxone if an overdose is suspected.
