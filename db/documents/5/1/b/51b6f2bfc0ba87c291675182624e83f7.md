On the bedside examination, each component of language should be tested including assessments of verbal fluency, ability to name objects, repeating simple phrases, comprehension of simple and complex commands, reading, and writing. When testing comprehension, it is advisable to start with simple commands such as "close your eyes" or "open your mouth." Then, administer more complex commands, "show me two fingers on your left hand" and commands that require crossing the midline such as "touch your right ear with your left hand." The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination is a widely used test to evaluate patients with language deficits. Formal neuropsychiatric testing may be necessary to determine the type and degree of the language deficit. Neuroimaging (CT, MRI, fMRI, PET, or SPECT) may be required to localized and diagnose the etiology of the aphasia.

Wernicke's aphasia must be distinguished from Alzheimer Dementia. In both cases, patients may have trouble answering basic orientation questions. In Wernicke's aphasia, the key deficit is comprehension, whereas, with dementia, the problem is with memory. Alzheimer disease tends to be subacute in onset and progressive in nature as opposed to Wernicke's aphasia which is sudden in onset due to ischemic stroke. Neuroimaging of the brain can be helpful in distinguishing between the two conditions.
