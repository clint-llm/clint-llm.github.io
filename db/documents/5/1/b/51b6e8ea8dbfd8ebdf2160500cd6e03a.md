**Ischemic priapism**is the most common form of priapism. It is a disease process initiated by smooth muscle relaxation of the tissues and arteries in the corpora cavernosa. When detumescence is delayed due to an inability to reverse the arterial relaxation and smooth muscle paralysis that initiated the erection, ischemic priapism can occur.

Priapism does not generally cause engorgement of the glans penis and corpus spongiosum because these structures have a separate venous drainage system. This alternate drainage route is the basis for surgical cavernosum to spongiosum shunt treatment for ischemic priapism.

Nitric oxide is a critical component of normal erectile function. Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil, block the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP), resulting in enhanced and prolonged intracavernosal smooth muscle relaxation. This prolonged relaxation normally would result in increased blood flow and a rigid erection. A defect in the regulation of nitric oxide inside the corpora cavernosa has been proposed as the mechanism of priapism in some patients, especially in those with sickle cell disease.

Underlying causes of priapism include neurotransmitter excess, blockage of venous drainage from corpora (mechanical obstruction from sickle cell disease, parenteral lipids, leukemia, etc.), dysfunction or paralysis of normal detumescence or prolonged relaxation of cavernosal smooth muscle due to overdose or heightened sensitivity to vasoactive medications.

While priapism is usually defined as an erection that lasts 4 hours or longer, physiological changes and microscopic tissue damage inside the penis typically do not start until about 6 hours after onset.

Early treatment and detumescence generally do not result in long-term erection problems. If the priapism lasts longer than 24 hours, permanent damage begins, and up to 90% of such men cannot have normal sexual intercourse afterward.

Recurrent priapism, also called "stuttering priapism," is usually ischemic and quite uncommon. It tends to be associated with sickle cell disease and, rarely, cannabis use.

**Non-ischemic priapism**is much less common and typically presents after a trauma or injury where a fistula forms between the cavernosal artery and the corpora. The trauma may be blunt or penetrating and is often delivered directly to the penis or perineum. The priapism will develop within 72 hours after the injury but some cases this may take up to several weeks to develop.

**Priapism in Sickle Cell Disease**

Priapism is a relatively common complication of sickle cell disease in affected males. Most studies put the overall prevalence among men with sickle cell disease at between 35% and 45%.

In general, patients with sickle cell disease who develop priapism tend to have more severe disease, with more episodes of chest pain, CVA events, and increased hemolysis rates. The hemolysis releases arginine and free hemoglobin, which both reduce available nitric oxide. Cyclic GMP and nitric oxide are typically low in sickle cell patients, which would be expected to interfere with erections and reduce priapism risk. It is theorized that the corporal smooth muscle may become hypersensitive to nitric oxide and cyclic GMP at levels that do not activate phosphodiesterase resulting in prolonged erections.

More than 95% of the priapism cases in sickle cell disease are ischemic.

**Stuttering priapism**(recurrent ischemic priapism) is relatively common in sickle cell patients. The typical duration is anywhere from a few minutes to three hours and generally tends to be painful but self-limiting.

Normal erections end when phosphodiesterases, such as PDE type 5, inactivate cyclic GMP through hydrolysis, leading to smooth muscle contraction. This erection reversal process appears to be defective in many sickle cell patients.

Sickle cell priapisms often happen at night during REM sleep and upon waking. Nocturnal erections are typically very androgen-dependent, partly explaining the benefit of anti-androgen therapy in some patients with recurrent priapism.

**Nocturnal painful erections**is the name of a rare disorder in which patients are woken up from REM sleep due to painful, abnormal erections.

Initial treatment is usually baclofen or possibly pregabalin.
