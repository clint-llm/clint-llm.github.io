Pityriasis versicolor is benign and noncontagious since the causative fungal pathogen is commensal of normal skin. Oral and topical antifungal agents are effective; however, disease recurrence is common and may have an impact on a patient's quality of life. Therefore, preventive measures should be taken. Also, patients must be reminded that pigmentary changes may take weeks to months to clear, even if the fungus is eradicated.
