A metaanalysis published in 2010 from a cohort of pediatric patients reported that the median risk of sequelae post-discharge was 19.9%. In this study, the most common organism isolated was H. influenzae, followed by S. pneumoniae. The most common sequelae were hearing loss (6%), followed by behavioral (2.6%) and cognitive difficulties (2.2%), motor deficit (2.3%), seizure disorder (1.6%) and visual impairment (0.9%).

Other complications include:

- Increased intracranial pressure from cerebral edema caused by increased intracellular fluid in the brain. Several factors are involved in the development of cerebral edema: increased in blood-brain barrier permeability, cytotoxicity from cytokines, immune cells, and bacteria.

- Hydrocephalus

- Cerebrovascular complications

- Focal neurologic deficits
