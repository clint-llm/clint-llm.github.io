Currently, loperamide remains available over the counter in pharmacies with restricted access but without a prescription. Patients should be explained on maximum daily dosing when dispensing loperamide for any labeled or off-label indications. Monitor the clinical status of patients and loperamide efficacy by monitoring numbers of loose stools after each dose.Â When used in high doses, monitor ECG, signs/symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression.
