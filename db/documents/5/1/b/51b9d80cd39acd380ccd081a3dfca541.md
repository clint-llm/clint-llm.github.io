**Vitritis:**can be due to inflammation or infection.

- The patient usually has redness and pain in the eye.

- Slit-lamp examination shows signs of ocular inflammation, including keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cells, and flare, posterior synechia, complicated cataract, and anterior vitreous cells.

- The fundus may show area of retinitis or choroiditis or vascultiis.

- Low reflective dot or cobweb-like vitreous echoes may be noted on ocular ultrasound. In severe cases, thick, highly reflective membranes may also be seen.

- Other signs of inflammation like Tenon's space widening, thickening of ocular coats, choroidal detachment, exudative RD, optic disc elevation, may be present on B scan.

- It is seen in panuveitis, endophthalmitis, retino-choroiditis.

**Primary intraocular lymphoma**: This may masquerade as chronic vitreous hemorrhage.

**Asteroid hyalosis:**It****mimics VH on ultrasound. It appears as multiple discrete, mobile, highly reflective echoes. An echolucent gap is seen between echoes and posterior globe wall. Patients usually do not have any complaints.

**Retinal Detachment (RD):**It****may mimic blood lined PVD (posterior vitreous detachment) on B scan. RD is uniformly high reflective, of even thickness, and has restricted after movements. Blood lined PVD may show moderate to high reflectivity, is of uneven thickness, and is usually highly mobile.
