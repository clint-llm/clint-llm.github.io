The exact etiology and pathogenesis of PACNS are unknown, but infectious agents such as varicella zoster virus (VZV) have been postulated as one of the triggers. Other proposed causes include the following:

- Bacterial triggers including Mycoplasma, Rickettsia, Treponema

- Viral infections including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus, among others

- Connective tissue disorders and systemic vasculitides including Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Churg-Strauss syndrome, Behcet syndrome, Sjogren syndrome among others.

There is also a notable association between PACNS and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The amyloid deposition has been identified as a possible trigger for PACNS in animal models.
