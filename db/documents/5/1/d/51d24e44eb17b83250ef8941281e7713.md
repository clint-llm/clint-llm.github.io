Obesity, hypertension, and cigarette smoking remain the leading potentially modifiable risk factors involved in the pathogenesis.

Chronic kidney disease, renal transplantation, hemodialysis, acquired cystic kidney disease, a history of previous renal cell carcinoma, and co-existing diabetes mellitus have been recognized as potential risk factors associated with an increase in incidence in renal cell carcinoma in population-based studies.

Studies exploring the effects of moderate alcohol consumption, physical activity, and socioeconomic status on the incidence have led to conflicting outcomes, and it is generally agreed that the effect of these interventions on the etiopathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma needs to be explored further.

While most of the cases of clear cell carcinoma are sporadic, 2Â to 3% of the cases are related to genetic alterations in the von Hippel landau gene, chromatin remodeling genes/epigenetic regulators (Polybromo 1, BRCA protein 1, and SET D1), and genetic alterations in pathways that disrupt signal transduction involving the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
