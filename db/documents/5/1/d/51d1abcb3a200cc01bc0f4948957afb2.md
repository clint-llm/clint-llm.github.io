The auricle contains both intrinsic muscles and extrinsic muscle attachments.

There are a surprising number of intrinsic ear muscles, given the human ear’s limited movement compared to other mammals’. Intrinsic ear muscles serve no role in humans and are listed helicis major and minor, tragicus, antitragicus, transverse and oblique muscles.

Extrinsic ear muscles include the superior auricular (**auricularis superior)**, anterior auricular (**auricularis anterior)**, and posterior auricular (**auricularis posterior)**muscles, located as their name indicates about the pinna. They pull the ear upward, forward, and backward, respectively. The superior and anterior auricular muscles are both fan-shaped and originate in the epicranial aponeurosis (galea aponeurotica). The superior auricular muscle is the largest of the three extrinsic ones and inserts into a tendon attached to the auricle superiorly. The anterior auricular muscle is the smallest of the group; its fibers are slight and easily overlooked.  It inserts into the anterior helix. The posterior auricular muscle is comprised of 2-3 fascicles originating from the mastoid (temporal bone) and inserting into the posteroinferior part of the concha.
