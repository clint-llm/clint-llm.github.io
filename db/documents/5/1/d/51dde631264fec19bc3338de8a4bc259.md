Among women with molar pregnancy, the risk factors for developing GTN include:

- Complete mole with signs of trophoblastic proliferation (uterine size greater than gestational age, serum human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] levels more than 100,000 mIU/mL)

- Ovarian theca lutein cysts greater than 6 cm in diameter

- Age greater than 35 to 40 years.

Some institutions offer prophylactic chemotherapy for high-risk women with complete moles. Evidence shows that this may decrease the incidence of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. All patients with GTD should have a chest x-ray to evaluate for pulmonary metastasis.
