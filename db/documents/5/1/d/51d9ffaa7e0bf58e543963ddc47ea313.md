The upper extremity nerves originate from the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is composed of roots, trunks, divisions, cords, and ultimately the five named branches. Spinal nerve roots C5 to T1 contribute to the brachial plexus. The terminal branches of the brachial plexus include the musculocutaneous, axillary, median, radial, and ulnar nerves. These named branches provide innervation to the upper limb.

The lower extremity innervation originates from the lumbar plexus and the sacral plexus, which is formed by spinal nerve roots T12 to S3.
