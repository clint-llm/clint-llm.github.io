LBBB may be encountered in clinical practice by the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, emergency department physician and the internist. While LBBB by itself may be a normal occurrence, it is important to refer these patients to a cardiologist to determine that there is no underlying cardiac pathology.

In otherwise healthy individuals, LBBB does not confer any specific or additional risk.  Mortality hazard ratio (HR) for LBBB is only 1.3 of normal. However, in patients with new onset, LBBB mortality HR is greater than 10-times normal.

The cardiology nurse should educate the patient on the significance of LBBB. In the US, patients with LBBB are not allowed to pilot an aircraft or other heavy equipment.
