Clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, and NPS) who prescribe HCTZ should be aware of its side effects. While the drug is relatively safe, the patient's electrolyte status has to be monitored regularly. Even though hydrochlorothiazide has been the most widely used thiazide drug for hypertension, more recent evidence indicates that it may not be as effective as some of the other thiazide diuretics. Recent clinical studies indicate that both indapamide and chlorthalidone may be more effective at lowering blood pressure and reducing cardiovascular events, independent of their ability to lower blood pressure. The onus is now on clinicians to change their old hydrochlorothiazide prescribing habits and focus more on evidence-based treatment.

Given the above, HCTZ therapy requires the efforts of an entire interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians, specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists, all working collaboratively and engaging in open communication regarding patient monitoring and changes in patient status. This approach will drive improved patient outcomes while mitigating any potential adverse events. [Level 5]
