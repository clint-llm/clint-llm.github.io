Agenesis of the corpus callosum can present as an isolated condition or associated with other cerebral abnormalities. Several factors have correlations with the etiology of agenesis of the corpus callosum

- Maternal alcohol use during pregnancy

- Maternal phenylketonuria

- Chiari II malformation

- Genetic factors: Agenesis of the corpus callosum often correlates with several aneuploidy and non-aneuploidy syndromes. Chromosomal abnormalities are present in 20% of ACC, especially trisomies 18 and 13.

- Syndromes that include agenesis of the corpus callosum as an associated feature:

- Autosomal-dominant - e.g., Apert syndrome and basal cell nevus syndrome
- Autosomal-recessive - e.g., Joubert syndrome and Lyon syndrome
- X-linked - e.g., Aicardi syndrome and X-linked aqueductal stenosis or hydrocephalus


- Chromosomal rearrangements - e.g. trisomies, del(4)(p16), del(6)(q23), dup(8)(p21p23), dup(11)(q23qter)
- Mutations in disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) gene located at 1q42.1 has been recently described to be associated with agenesis of the corpus callosum
