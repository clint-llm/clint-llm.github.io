**Simple Cyst**

Asymptomatic simple cysts do not require intervention other than regular follow up with imaging studies and expectant management. Follow-up with Ultrasounds could be done at 3 to 12 months intervals, and if the cysts are stable, there is no need for further follow-up.

simple cysts have even been reported to resolve spontaneously on the follow-up period without a needed intervention.

Symptomatic patients or cysts that are increasing in size should raise concern that the lesion could be neoplastic. Several therapeutic approaches including needle aspiration with or without injection of sclerosing agents such as (tetracycline, ethanol, or ethanolamine), internal drainage with wide unroofing, and varying degrees of liver resection. The laparoscopic approach is the current standard of care, but studies have shown recurrence rates varying from 4% to 41% on follow-up after laparoscopic surgery.

**Polycystic Liver Disease**

Management is focused on decompressing the liver volume. There are no recent guidelines to manage PCLD alone. However, there are medical and/or surgical approaches that include:

**A. Medical Therapy**

- Somatostatin receptor antagonist: Octreotide is a somatostatin receptor antagonist that has a positive effect on patients with PCLD.

- mTOR inhibitor: mTOR is found to be inappropriately activated in patients with PCLD and thought to be responsible for its proliferation. Sirolimus shows to halt the proliferation and synthesis response of unregulated polycystic cells.

- Estrogen receptor antagonists: The current belief is that estrogen plays a role in cyst growth, and as a result, the disease tends to affect women more than men. However, there have been no clinical trials performed besides anecdotal reports.

- Vasopressin-2-receptor antagonists: studies show that activation of vasopressin receptor leads to increased cAMP production, which leads to the proliferation of cysts. Studies have shown that using tolvaptan blocks. This receptor can lead to a decrease in the rate of cyst development and growth. However, these studies did not analyze tolvaptan’s effect on liver cysts. Even so, there have been several case studies that suggest that tolvaptan may reduce liver volume and improve patients' symptoms.

**B. Surgical Therapy**

- Percutaneous Cyst Aspiration followed by Sclerotherapy: can be diagnostic and/or therapeutic. It is done through aspiration of a cyst under sonographic guidance followed by injection of a sclerosing agent that destructs the lining epithelial, preventing fluid accumulation. It is mainly indicated for patients with a large symptomatic liver cyst (>5 cm).

- Laparoscopic Cyst Fenestration: It involves aspiration and deroofing of the cyst in a single procedure. The main advantage of the procedure that multiple cysts can be treated at the same time. Usually done when there are a few large dominant cysts in the anterior segments of the right lobe or the left lateral segments of the hepatic lobes.

- Segmental Hepatic Resection: it is considered in patients with massive liver cysts but has enough remnant liver parenchymal tissue. The procedure is usually only for patients with massive hepatomegaly with severe symptoms, and when liver transplantation is unwarranted.

- Transplantation: Patients with PCLD typically have low MELD score due to normal liver function tests. However, it is rarely indicated in the case of impaired liver function and where resection is not considered to be a feasible option due to diffuse cystic lesions.

**Neoplastic Cysts**

BCA is considered a premalignant lesion. The tumors grew to a large size and required surgical intervention in most reports. Although imaging findings may be suggestive, they often overlapped and nonspecific. There are no published guidelines on appropriate therapy of BCAs and BCACs due to the limited number of reported cases. Fluid aspiration routinely to decompress the cystic lesion is not recommended because of limited sensitivity and the risk of malignant dissemination.

Complete radical surgical resection with a wide(>2cm) surgical margin is the management of choice given the risk of malignant transformation and recurrence. Enucleation of BCAs is appropriate management only in those cases where complete surgical resection is not possible. BCAC has a good prognosis compared to other hepatic malignancies, as it exhibits less aggressive clinical behavior with slow growth and less frequent metastases.

Serum CA 19-9 can be monitored at regularly spaced intervals has been suggested for post-surgical tumor resolution.
