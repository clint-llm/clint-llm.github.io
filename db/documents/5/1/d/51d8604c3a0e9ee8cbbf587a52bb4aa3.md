Parapneumonic effusions can progress to empyema if not treated appropriately from time of symptom onset. There is often a delay in the diagnosis of pleural effusion. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion of empyema in patients with pneumonia, persistent fever, and elevated inflammatory markers who have failed conservative antibiotic therapy. Patients should also be informed to seek medical attention if they notice a decline in their respiratory status, pleuritic chest pain, or refractory fever in the setting of a known pneumatic process despite antimicrobials.
