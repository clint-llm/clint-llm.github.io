Lobular capillary hemangioma is usually a clinical diagnosis based on history and classical clinical findings. The history should include inquiries into previous trauma, association with pregnancy, and a thorough review of medications.

In some instances, a dermoscopic examination is valuable. Lesions show a pink or red homogenous papule with a scaly, white "collarette."

A histologic examination is warranted if a diagnosis cannot be achieved on clinical grounds. Some may choose to excise these lesions to alleviate patient anxiety rather than diagnostic uncertainty. Irrespective of the deciding factor for excision, it is strongly recommended that the tissue is sent for histopathologic confirmation to rule out any other sinister lesions.
