Physiologically, lung volumes can be either dynamic or static. Dynamic lung volumes are, by definition, dependent on airflow rate. In contrast, static lung volumes are not affected by the flow velocity. A variety of lung pathologies induce changes in lung volumes. Therefore, pulmonary function testing provides valuable diagnostic information since it helps measure various lung volumes and capacities.

Spirometry is a crucial test used by pulmonologists to diagnose restrictive and obstructive pulmonary diseases. It measures how air flows in and out of the lungs and records several lung volumes and lung capacities. During spirometry, the patient takes a normal breath, followed by a full inhalation, a maximum forced exhalation, and then another normal tidal breath.

Tidal volume is a static lung volume that, along with other static and dynamic lung volumes, is important for the diagnosis of patients with obstructive and restrictive lung diseases. Spirometry records tidal volume while the patient breathes quietly. In healthy adults, it measures approximately 7 mL/kg of ideal body weight. In an average healthy adult, 500 mL enters the lung with each tidal breath, of which only 350 mL reaches the respiratory zone since dead space measures approximately 150 mL.
