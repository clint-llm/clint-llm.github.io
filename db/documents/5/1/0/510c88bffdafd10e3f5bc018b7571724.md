All newborns should be screened for hearing loss before being discharged from the hospital. Those who pass initial screening should follow up as needed in their primary care medical home. Those who do not pass should be re-tested before discharge, with repeat testing occurring at least several hours after the initial screening.

In the well-baby nursery, this testing is often performed using OAEs. Newborns with risk factors for hearing loss should receive screening with AABR testing due to the higher risk of ANSD in these patients. Significant risk factors for hearing loss in children include care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for five days or longer, hyperbilirubinemia requiring exchange transfusion, culture-proven sepsis, and administration of ototoxic medications.

Newborns cared for in the NICU have been shown to have 6.9 times higher risk of hearing loss than newborns who do not require NICU care. Additional risk factors include in utero infection, neonatal infection, and craniofacial abnormalities or syndromic conditions.

In addition to newborn testing, children should be referred for further audiologic testing when a parent/caregiver, teacher, or other medical professional has concerns regarding the hearing. Research has demonstrated that parents often underestimate hearing loss in their children, though a 61% detection rate has been reported for parents or guardians who suspect hearing loss.
