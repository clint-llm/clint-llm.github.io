Most of the presenting symptoms are due to the local invasion of the tumor. Due to anatomical proximity, Pancoast tumors may cause symptoms secondary to neurological involvement (brachial plexus, Horner syndrome) and musculoskeletal symptoms (shoulder pain, vertebral, or rib pain).

Shoulder pain is present in up to 96% of patients and is the most common initial presenting symptom.

Horner syndrome is a combination of ipsilateral ptosis (drooping or falling of upper eyelid), miosis (persistent constricted pupil), and anhidrosis (inability to sweat on the ipsilateral side). Pancoast tumor causes second-order or pre-ganglionic Horner syndrome (i.e., affecting the second-order neuron, traveling from the sympathetic trunk, through the brachial plexus, over the lung apex).

In approximately 5 percent of patients, the tumor may extend into the intervertebral foramina causing paraplegia and spinal cord compression.
