There are no absolute contraindications to ileostomy formation, but the relative ones include:

- Short mesentery that disables the ileum from being exteriorized through the abdominal wall to the skin without tension. This, unfortunately, is more common in obese patients.

- Carcinomatosis that prevents full mobilization of the ileum

The ileostomy should be formed as distal as possible to allow enough bowel length for absorption of nutrients.

A high output ileostomy can lead to electrolyte disturbances (particularly important to monitor for and treat in patients with renal impairment), as well as malabsorption leading to malnutrition.

During ileostomy formation, it is important to spout the stump to get the effluent away from contact with the skin.

An ileostomy should be sited away from scars, skin creases, and bony prominences to allow placement of the stoma appliance and avoid leakage.
