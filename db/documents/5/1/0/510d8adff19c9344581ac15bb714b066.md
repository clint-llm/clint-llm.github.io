Keratoconus, with evidence of progression, is the most common indication for CXL. Other indications include pellucid marginal degeneration, Terrien marginal degeneration, and post-refractive surgery (such as LASIK, PRK, or radial keratotomy) ectasia. The Global Delphi Panel of Keratoconus and Ectatic Diseases recognized the lack of set criteria for documenting disease progression and suggested that two of the following three parameters should be considered when considering progression: steepening of either the anterior or posterior corneal surfaces or corneal thinning.

Many studies have based their criteria based on an increase in Kmax value, myopia and/or astigmatism, mean central K-readings, and a decrease in mean central corneal thickness.

Not every cornea with keratoconus needs to undergo CXL; simple spectacle correction and rigid contact lenses form the basis of conservative therapy. CXL is not indicated for stable KC, as might be the case in older eyes that naturally have stiffer corneas due to age-related changes.
