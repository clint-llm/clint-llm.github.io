Complications can occur after surgical repair. Early popular techniques, such as the Mustarde technique and z-epicanthoplasty, had major incidences of severe scarring. Other techniques have been developed for better cosmesis, such as the Y to V technique and medial epicanthoplasty with skin re-draping.

Many organic and inorganic materials are used for frontalis sling suspension to treat congenital ptosis surgically. Alloplastic materials include braided polyester sutures, polypropylene sutures, expanded polytetrafluorethylene, and silastic bands. Placing foreign material in the tissue can result in granulomatous formation, infection, or extrusion.

Homografts, such as autogenous fascia lata, are associated with longer recovery time and a second potential site of infection. Overcorrection of congenital ptosis can result in lagophthalmos and cause corneal complications.
