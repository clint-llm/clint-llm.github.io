The interprofessional healthcare team should understand the refractive index to enhance patient outcomes and satisfaction regarding proper eyeglasses and contact lens fittings. This coordination involves various professionals, including ophthalmologists, optometrists, opticians, optical technologists, and nurses. A key aspect to consider is the refraction of light to achieve proper focus on the macula of the eye based on measurements and assessments conducted by ophthalmologists or optometrists.

Based on these measurements, opticians and optical technologists play a crucial role in assisting patients in selecting appropriate glasses and contact lenses. For patients with high prescription needs, healthcare team members should inform them about different lens materials, such as high-index lenses that utilize a higher refractive index to achieve thinner spectacle lenses overall.

Different eyeglass materials also have different reflectivity. Opticians and technologists can guide patients on their preferred cosmetic look by applying coatings or changing materials that alter the refractive index and reflectivity.Â High-index lenses reflect more light than lower-index lenses due to the higher refractive index in these lenses as a consequence of the Fresnel equations.
