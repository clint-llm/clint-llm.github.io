Isolated male epispadias is characterized by a short phallus, an abnormal dorsally located urethral meatus, dorsal chordee, and a ventrally hooded prepuce. Depending on the position of the meatus, male epispadias is categorized into glandular, penile, and penopubic forms. Urinary incontinence is almost always seen in the penopubic forms due to the incompetent bladder neck. Until recently, it was believed that the degree of incontinence depends only on the position of the meatus, with distal (glandular) epispadias not having incontinence issues. Histological abnormalities in the roof of the urethra have shown that there are additional factors contributing to the development of continence in these patients.

Similar to male epispadias, female epispadias can be categorized into vestibular, sub-symphyseal, and retro-symphyseal types. Only a patulous urethral meatus is seen in the vestibular forms. However, the retro-symphyseal form can present with complete incontinence and extremely small bladder capacity.
