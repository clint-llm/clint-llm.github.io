Given the non-specific finding of acute watery diarrhea associated with V. cholerae, special considerations must be taken into account when determining a differential diagnosis. The differential diagnosis should be informed by geography and history. Although the most common cause of diarrhea worldwide is infectious, the setting of the infection or recent travel to endemic countries may make some infections more likely. Viral causes include norovirus, rotavirus, adenoviruses, and astrovirus, among others. Bacterial causes include Campylobacter, Shigella, Clostridium difficile, Salmonella, and different strains of Escherichia coli. Protozoa infections include Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Cyclospora, Entamoeba, among others.
