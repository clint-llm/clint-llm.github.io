Cone snail habitats include mainly tropical waters, such as the Red Sea, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific. Despite the preference for tropical environments, cone snails do live in warm deep seas off the coast of Florida. They tend to live in the deep seas near reefs and hunt primarily at night. During the day, they bury in the sand and primarily encounter humans only when provoked. While different sources report fatality rates ranging from 15% to 75%, the point remains that cone snail envenomation is a preventable cause of death of which all deep-sea divers should be aware.
