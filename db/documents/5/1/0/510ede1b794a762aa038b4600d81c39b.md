Given the pectoralis major's size, location, and blood supply it has been used in flap repairs in neck surgery. The muscle is highly vascularised via the thoracoacromial artery, so it has lower chances of necrosis in the flap formation.

Detailed knowledge of the anatomy of the pectoral muscle is necessary for breast surgery in particular. Modified radical mastectomy, breast reconstruction following mastectomy, and breast augmentation can pose risks to the nervous supply of the pectoralis major. Damage to the nerve can result in denervation and atrophy or fibrosis to a section of the pectoralis major. Pectoral nerve blocks are also more commonlyÂ used as postoperative analgesia.
