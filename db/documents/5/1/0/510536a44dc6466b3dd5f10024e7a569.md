An interprofessional approach to hypoglycemia is recommended.

Adequate measures to minimize hypoglycemic events involve participation and effective communication between the primary care physician, endocrinologists, diabetes educators, pharmacist, diabetic nurse, the patient's family, and the patient. The cornerstone of this management is the patient.

Patient education should address the importance of relatively detailed documentation regarding blood glucose levels, timing, units of insulin administered, and any pertinent notes such as increased/decreased food intake or exercise relative to blood glucose measurements. Such documentation allows a primary care physician or endocrinologist to make appropriate adjustments to diabetic medication therapy to best optimize blood glucose levels. Stability of blood glucose levels can be obtained with consistent dietary and exercise habits in addition to the appropriate timing of insulin therapy to avoid drastic spikes and dips in blood glucose levels. Hospitalized patients with newly diagnosed diabetes can be taught insulin administration and self-injections while in the hospital. Discussions with the patient will help decide the best medications to achieve safe glycemic control. Group education classes and local event planning can help diabetic patients learn and grow their knowledge between themselves as well as others in the household.

Non-adherence to medication or diet are the most common cause of treatment failure. Patients should monitor for signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia and have sources of glucose (for example, hard candy, fruit juice) immediately available. Developing programs to educate healthcare staff has also shown to provide better outcomes. Teaming up with local pharmacies or grocery stores can help some of the barriers often encountered by diabetic patients.

Patients should be advised to have fairly consistent exercise and dietary habits to avoid drastic spikes and dips in hour-to-hour blood glucose measurements.
