A significant portion of pathological disease within the lungs occurs at the alveolar level. BAL allows for the collection of the alveolar milieu and further analysis of its composition. Common scenarios for the use of BAL include work up for opportunistic and atypical respiratory infections in immunocompromised patients, unexplained radiographic pulmonary infiltrates or hypoxemia. BAL can also provide clues to support the diagnosis of some noninfectious conditions such as Diffuse Alveolar Hemorrhage (DAH), Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP), Eosinophilic Pneumonia, Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis (HP), Interstitial Lung Diseases (ILDs), chronic berylliosis, the presence of malignant cells and Asbestos exposure.
