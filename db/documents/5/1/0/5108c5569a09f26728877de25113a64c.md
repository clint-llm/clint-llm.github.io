The urinary bladder is designed to hold urine at low pressure and allow for volitional voiding at socially appropriate intervals. When a patient cannot void effectively or if prompt drainage of urine is required, a urinary catheter is needed. While most urinary catheterizations occur without difficulty, complications surrounding urinary catheterizations cause significant distress and create both short-term and long-term complications for the patient. It is critical to patient care for physicians to comfortably assess the cause of the difficult catheterization and choose interventions most likely to result in successful catheter placement.
