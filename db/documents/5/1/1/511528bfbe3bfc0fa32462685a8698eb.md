T. pallidum is a bacterial spirochete that spreads systemically within minutes of infection. It results in syphilis, which is predominantly a venereal disease, but vertical transmission can also occur, and more rarely, blood transfusion-associated transmission can be seen. Infection occurs via penetration of the spirochete through mucosal membranes as well as epithelial breaks in the skin. Unprotected sex is a major risk factor for the transmission of infection, especially in men who have sex with men (MSM), accounting for approximately 80% of cases in the United States. The penetration of the CNS is thought to happen in most (if not all) individuals. Therefore, neurosyphilis can potentially occur in any patient.
