Oxcarbazepine studies done in rats and dogs over a 3 and 6-month period have shown reversible dose-dependent liver weight increases, which is considered due to centrilobular megalocytosis. Oxcarbazepine metabolism differs significantly between humans and rats; therefore, this toxicity cannot be generalized to human patients.
