Several theories have tried to describe the mechanism of injury behind this fracture. Milch first suggested a push-off theory. According to it, an upward and outward force applied through the radius is responsible for the fracture.

Most commonly, these are Salter-Harris type IV fractures (a fracture that transects the metaphysis, physis, and epiphysis).
