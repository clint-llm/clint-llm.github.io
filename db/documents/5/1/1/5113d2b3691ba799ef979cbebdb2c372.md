If the patient is diagnosed and treated promptly, the mortality for acetaminophen toxicity is less than 2%. However, if patients present late and have developed severe liver failure, the mortality is high. About 1% to 3% of patients with severe liver failure need to undergo a liver transplant as a life-saving measure.

In general, children less than 6 years of age have a better prognosis than adults, chiefly because of their greater capacity to detoxify APAP. The overall prognosis of patients depends on the following criteria:

- Creatinine levels of more than 3.4 mg/dL

- Arterial pH remaining less than 7.3 despite adequate fluid hydration

- Prothrombin time more than 1.8 times control or an INR of more than 6.5

- Development of grade 3 or 4 encephalopathy
