A hematologist should be consulted at the earliest suspicion of a bleeding disorder. In cases with a known family history of bleeding diatheses, a pediatric hematologist should be consulted during the pregnancy so that an early and accurate diagnosis can be made.

As coagulation studies often require large amounts of blood, sampling the cord blood at the time of birth can be a valuable tool in making the proper diagnosis without having to sample large volumes of blood from the neonate. Furthermore, early consultation with hematology may be life-saving in patients with active bleeding requiring emergent blood product support. Consulting hematology early can allow for proper testing to be sent prior to administering FFP or other blood products, which may render coagulation studies useless for many days post-administration and delay appropriate treatment.
