The ability to transfer flaps is a critical skill reconstructive surgeons use to close many different types of tissue defects, ranging from small skin-only defects to large, composite tissue defects. These defects may be caused by traumatic, oncological, or congenital processes, and surgeons must understand how the etiology and anatomy involved affect the selection of the appropriate reconstructive option. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of tissue defects using flap transfer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the management considerations for patients with tissue defects.
- Explain the importance of adequate patient counseling and collaboration when planning flap transfer.
- Summarize the common pitfalls of flap design.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication within the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients undergoing flap transfer.
