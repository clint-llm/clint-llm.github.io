Ocular ultrasound can be performed for various reasons, including vision loss, headache, and trauma. It can be very beneficial in identifying or excluding retinal detachment, foreign bodies, lens dislocation, vitreous hemorrhage, and other superficial abnormalities that can cause loss of eyesight. ONSUS is usually performed in the setting of suspected or confirmed traumatic brain injury (TBI), intracranial hypertension, or optic neuritis.

ONSUS can also be used to help “rule out” elevated ICP in non-acute trauma settings, such as troubleshooting a malfunctioning intraventricular device, before or following lumbar punctures, or while evaluating the safety of neuraxial anesthesia in patients with a previous history of elevated ICP. It should be emphasized that these readings should be evaluated in the overall clinical context, as such applications are not well studied or validated.

ONSD is currently considered the best non-invasive modality for dynamic estimation of ICP.

- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

- Intracranial hypotension.

- Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

- Perioperative neurosurgical patients.

- Shunt evaluation.

- Head injury.

- Ischemic strokes- With every 0.1 cm increment in ONSD, the odds ratio for mortality increased 4.2 times.

- Hematoma progression in hemorrhagic strokes.
