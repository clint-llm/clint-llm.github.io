Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a clinically under-recognized genetic disorder that causes the defective production of alpha-1 antitrypsin protein. AAT protein protects the body from the neutrophil elastase enzyme, which is released from white blood cells to fight infection. This activity discusses the evaluation and management of AAT and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing and treating the disease to improve patient care.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.

- Outline the evaluation and management options available for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure prompt diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency to optimize patient management.
