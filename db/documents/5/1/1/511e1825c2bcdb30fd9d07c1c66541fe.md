The different surgical considerations with regard to arterial anatomy are:

- Aneurysms - May need surgical ligation, stenting, or clipping based on the location

- Arteriovenous fistula - May need separation of the vessels

- Ligation of an arterial bleeder - May need a trans-fixation suture for major arteries

- Thrombo-embolism - May need open/interventional radiology-assisted evacuation
