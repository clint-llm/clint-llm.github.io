Breast imaging typically begins with mammogram and ultrasound. Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be considered for dense breasts, mammographically occult tumors, or if there is the concern for the multifocal or multicentric disease. Additional studies can include computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen, bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) when indicated. Diagnosis can be obtained through breast biopsy as well as a biopsy of suspicious axillary nodes. Both histologic assessments including a status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2/neu (HER2), and Ki-67 and cancer staging are crucial to helping guide treatment recommendations. Also, Oncotype DX which is a 21 gene RT-PCR assay can be ordered for hormone positive, HER2 negative, node-negative breast tumors to help determine the need for chemotherapy. Lab work includes a complete blood count (CBC), blood chemistries, and liver function tests. Genetic counseling is offered to patients who are at high risk for hereditary breast cancer and fertility counseling if the patient is premenopausal. Distress screening and management addressing psychological, social, and physical needs of the patient are also integral in care of breast cancer patients.
