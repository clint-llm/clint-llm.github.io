Central retinal artery occlusion is a rare, emergent eye condition that should be suspected in any patient who presents with unilateral sudden painless vision loss. These patients usually present with vision loss in the range of finger counting to light perception. Patients who present with no light perception in the affected eye may have occluded the ophthalmic artery close to where it enters the eye which causes permanent and debilitating vision loss.
