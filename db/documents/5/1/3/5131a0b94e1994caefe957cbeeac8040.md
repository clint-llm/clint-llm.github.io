Membranous nephropathy is classified into Primary and Secondary.

**Primary (75% to 80%)**

- Idiopathic, but attributed to the presence of one of the following antibodies and the absence of a secondary cause.

- 70% to 80%: Antibodies against phospholipase A2 receptor (PLA2R) antigen, associated with HLA DQA1

- 15% to 20%: Antibodies against neural epidermal growth factor-like 1 (NELL)

- 1% to 5%: Antibodies against thrombospondin (THSD7A)

- Others: Antibodies against neutral endopeptidase (NEP) and exostosin (EXT1/EXT2)

**Secondary (20% to 25%)**

- Infections (hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, malaria, human immunodeficiency virus, schistosomiasis)

- Neoplasms (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of lungs and gastrointestinal tract, hematological malignancies)

- Drugs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors, penicillamine, probenecid)

- Heavy metal poisoning (gold, mercury)

- Autoimmune diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, IgG4 related nephropathy)

- Miscellaneous (hematopoietic stem cell transplant, graft versus host disease, diabetes mellitus)
