The roots of spinal nerves receive vascular supply from the radicular arteries. These arteries pass through the intervertebral foramina with the nerve roots. The first sixÂ vessels most commonly arise from the vertebral arteries or the ascending cervical branch of the thyrocervical trunk. In either case, the spinal branches of these two vessels anastomose, so if either source has a blockage, blood flow is maintained. The radicular arteries of the seventh and eighth segments always form from branches of the costocervical trunk.
