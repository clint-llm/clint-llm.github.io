The goal of any stapes procedure is to restore the vibration of fluids within the cochlea; increasing communication secondary to increasing sound amplification, bringing hearing levels to acceptable thresholds. Performing a stapedectomy serves as a way to re-establish sound transmission through an ossicular chain that has likely been stiffened through the disease process known as otosclerosis, which has caused a conductive hearing loss. The most vital factor for a successful surgical outcome is the experience of the surgeon who is utilizing the ever-changing techniques and technologies in this field. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of otosclerosis and highlights the use of stapedectomy and the interprofessional team in treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of otosclerosis and how it classically presents.
- Identify screening indications for stapedectomy in the treatment of otosclerosis.
- Describe the surgical technique for a stapedectomy procedure.
- Summarize the complications associated with the stapedectomy procedure.
