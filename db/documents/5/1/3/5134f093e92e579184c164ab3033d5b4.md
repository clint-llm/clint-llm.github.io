The kidneys are one of the paired retroperitoneal organs in the body.Â The diaphragm abuts the kidneys superiorly and posteriorly, along with the 12th rib.

In the classical anatomic position, the kidney's hilar structures are organized from anterior to posterior in the following order: renal vein, renal artery, and ureter/renal pelvis.

The renal vein is most often found anterior to the renal artery. Similar to the arterial distribution, the venous plexus capillaries coalesce into arcuate veins, which then drain into interlobular veins, trunks, and finally the renal vein.
