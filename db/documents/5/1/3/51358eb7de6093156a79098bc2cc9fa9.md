The current approach to Treacher Collins syndrome involves functional and aesthetic corrections as well as psychosocial support. Anticipatory care is important, as is early hearing and speech intervention. As there can be a familial inheritance, family planning and genetic counseling are invaluable for patients in their reproductive years. The management of a patient with Treacher Collins syndrome can be enhanced by utilizing an interprofessional team approach. It should involve a craniofacial or plastic surgeon, pediatric otolaryngologist, ophthalmologist, audiologist, geneticist, speech therapist, dental surgeon, dietician, psychologist, and other healthcare professionals.

It is recommended that patients with Treacher Collins syndrome receive their care from a singular craniofacial center to provide easy collaboration and access to expertise and to also create more possibilities for research in this rare syndrome.
