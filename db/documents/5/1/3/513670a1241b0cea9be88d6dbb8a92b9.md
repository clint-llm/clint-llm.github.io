It is essential to monitor for side effects of excessive stimulation of the muscarinic receptors, as previously due to the systemic effects of the oral preparation. Fortunately, pilocarpine is not among the narrow therapeutic index medications. However, there is no known antidote for treating these side effects, and care should still be taken by the healthcare team to monitor doses and weigh the pros and cons of treatment. If a patient is unable to tolerate the side effects of pilocarpine, they should notify their healthcare team, who may either decrease the dose or discontinue the treatment.
