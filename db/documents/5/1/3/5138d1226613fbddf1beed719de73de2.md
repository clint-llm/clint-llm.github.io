The disorder affects almost every organ system as peroxisomes are present in all organelles. Manifestations include severe craniofacial abnormalities, hypotonia, severe neurodevelopmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss, ocular abnormalities, and enamel abnormalities. Hepatomegaly is present in 80% of cases with increased liver enzymes and bilirubin levels. Renal cortical cysts are present in 70% of cases.

Depending on the age of presentation, ZS patients are divided into three groups.

Neonatal-infantile presentation

- Most of these children will present with hypotonia, reduced spontaneous movements, and poor cry. They frequently have difficulty feeding, and seizures can be early onset during neonatal life.

- They often have facial dysmorphism, including a high forehead, large fontanelles, wide sutures, hypoplastic supraorbital ridges, broad nasal bridge. Ocular abnormalities include glaucoma, cataracts, and retinopathy, and these patients can have varying degrees of sensorineural deafness.

Childhood presentation

- Developmental delay, failure to thrive, eye and hearing abnormalities including varying levels of hepatic dysfunction, adrenal insufficiency, and renal calcium oxalate stones. They can have regression of previously attained neurological milestones secondary to demyelination (leukodystrophy).

Adolescent - adult presentation

- Developmental delay and neuroregression, cerebellar ataxia, peripheral neuropathy, adrenal insufficiency, leukodystrophy.
