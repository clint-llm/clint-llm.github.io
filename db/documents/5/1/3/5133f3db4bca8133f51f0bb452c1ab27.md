The Thebesian vessels or veins are embedded in the walls of the heart itself. They serve to drain the myocardium and are present in all four heart chambers. They are more abundant on the right side of the heart and, more specifically, are most abundant in the right atrium.

The Thebesian vessels include arteriosinusoidal vessels, venosinusoidal vessels, arterioluminal vessels, and venoluminal vessels. The sinusoidal vessels connect the arterioles and venules with sinusoids first before draining into the chamber lumen. The luminal vessels run perpendicular through the myocardium and provide a direct connection between the arterioles, venules, and the chamber lumen, draining through openings in the endocardial surfaceÂ referred to as the "foramina venarum minimarum," "Vieussens' foramina," or "foramina Thebesii."

These vessels are unique to the cardiac circulation, providing an alternative route of nourishment and drainage of the myocardium and contributing to the right to left physiologic shunting of the body's circulation.

The Thebesian veins usually measure approximately 0.5 mm in diameter.
