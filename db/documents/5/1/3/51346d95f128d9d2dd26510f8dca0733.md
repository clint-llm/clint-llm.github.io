Factor V Leiden results from a mutation in the factor V gene G1691A that causes a missense mutation, changing the arginine to glutamine at the site (Arg506Gln).

Factor V deficiency, on the other hand, is a bleeding disorder accompanied by decreased levels of factor V protein. Decreased amounts of factor V protein are mainly caused by factor V inhibition via antibodies or an error in factor V protein production, secretion, and transport.
