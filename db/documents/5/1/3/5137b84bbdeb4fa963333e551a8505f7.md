The development of the subclavian arteries is unique to each anatomical side. On the left side, the fully developed subclavian artery arises from only the seventh intersegmental artery. The right side is unique as the three parts of the subclavian develop from three different embryological vessels. The first part of the right subclavian develops from the right fourth aortic arch, part of one of the six paired great embryologic vessels. The second part of the right subclavian develops from the right dorsal aorta, whose right and left pair develop the descending aorta. The final part of the right subclavian develops from the right seventh intersegmental artery, which is one of thirty arterial pairs that develop much of the distal vascular of the adult body.
