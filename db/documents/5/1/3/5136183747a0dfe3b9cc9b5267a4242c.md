The incidence of XGP varies from 0.6% to 1% of all cases of renal infections. The disease can occur in all age groups but is more common in women than in men, usually in their fifth and sixth decade of life. There is no specific race predilection. Although in most patients, a unilateral kidney is involved, bilateral involvement can rarely occur in a few cases. Both the kidneys are affected with equal frequency.

XGP is extremely rare in children, but when it occurs, there are two different presentations. The most common form involves the entire kidney and equally affects males and females. The less common form includes a localized area of the kidney and mostly affects females.
