- Always consider L. monocytogenes as an infectious agent in a patient that is a neonate, elderly, or immunocompromised.

- Transmission involves the fecal-oral route. L. monocytogenes is a foodborne illness that can replicate at refrigerator temperatures.

- Ampicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the treatment of choice along with other broad-spectrum antibiotics until an infectious agent can be confirmed.

- Early recognition is the key to an increased chance of survival.

- L. monocytogenes is uniformly resistant to cephalosporin antibiotics.
