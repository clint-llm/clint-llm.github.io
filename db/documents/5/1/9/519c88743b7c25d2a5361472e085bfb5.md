Across the globe, the geriatric population is increasing, making frailty a concern of increasing importance for healthcare systems. Frailty is a multidimensional geriatric syndrome associated with poor health outcomes and will continue to place a substantial and increasing burden on healthcare systems.

Frailty is the result of cumulative cellular damage from diverse etiologies over the life of the individual—typical aging results in loss of homeostatic reserve in physiological systems. However, despite the loss of these reserves, many individuals still function well with aging. Any stress or insult to these physiologic reserves can result in an older adult decompensating and thus causing increased frailty. Patients can be categorized as robust, pre-frail, or frail, depending on the degree of physiological and functional decline.

Frailty can develop due to factors such as (i) socio-demographic influences (e.g. poverty, living alone, low education level); (ii) psychological factors (e.g. depression); (iii) nutritional issues (e.g. malnutrition); (iv) polypharmacy; (v) diseases and complications (inflammatory states, cancer, endocrine disorders, dementia); and (v) low physical activity.
