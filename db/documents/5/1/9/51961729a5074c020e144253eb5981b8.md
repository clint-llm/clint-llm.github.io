Tuberculosis (TB) is a prevalent worldwide infection. One of the catastrophic manifestations of extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) is the affection of the central nervous system (CNS). This may take the form of either tubercular meningitis (TBM), tuberculoma, or spinal arachnoiditis. TBM develops either due to rupture of subependymal or meningeal tubercular foci or through the hematogenous route. CNS tuberculosis (CNS-TB) carries high morbidity and mortality among all forms of TB. This activity reviews the early identification and management of CNS-TB and highlights the importance of interprofessional team members in coordinating well to enhance outcomes in patients with CNS tuberculosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the global epidemiology of CNS tuberculosis.
- Describe the various clinical presentations of a patient with CNS tuberculosis.
- Outline the diagnosis and management strategies for CNS tuberculosis.
- Employ coordination among interprofessional team members for early institution of therapy, preventing and treating complications, and improving patient outcomes.
