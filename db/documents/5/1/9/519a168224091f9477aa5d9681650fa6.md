There is no known antidote. The mainstay of treatment is respiratory support and supportive care until the tetrodotoxin is excreted in the urine. Activated charcoal and/or gastric lavage can be done if the patient presents within 60 minutes of ingestion. Hemodialysis may be useful, especially in patients with renal disease. A monoclonal antibody against tetrodotoxin (anti-tetrodotoxin) is available. No studies on efficacy have been published. Healthcare professionals use neostigmine to treat acute respiratory failure from tetrodotoxin poisoning. However, a review of the current literature indicates that there is not enough data to provide evidence for or against this practice. For suspected tetrodotoxin poisoning, patients should be observed in the intensive care unit (ICU) for 24 hours due to some patients having a delayed onset of symptoms of up to 20 hours.
