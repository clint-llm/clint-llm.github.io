Neonatal conjunctivitis is not an uncommon problem seen after delivery. When it occurs, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a neonatologist, infectious disease consult, ophthalmologist, pediatrician, pharmacist, and a nurse practitioner. There are many causes of neonatal conjunctivities. Ophthalmia neonatorum (neonatal conjunctivitis) presents during the first four weeks of life with eye discharge and hyperemia and is usually an acquired infection during delivery. If left untreated it can lead to complications (ulceration and perforation of the cornea, blindness, chlamydia pneumonia). In severe cases, treatment should be initiated  without waiting for culture results. Neonatal nursing will be likely the first to encounter this condition. They will also be responsible for monitoring once therapy has been initiated. Empirical treatment should be started soon after sending the culture and tapered once the final results are back. The outcomes for most neonates with conjunctivitis are good, particularly with interprofessional intervention and monitoring. [Level 5].
