Physical variations of the coronary artery circulation include a left and right coronary artery that share a common trunk, an AV node that is supplied by the left circumflex artery, or rarely an AV nodal branch from both the right coronary artery and the left circumflex artery. The posterior interventricular artery (PDA - for posterior descending artery) may arise from the left circumflex artery in 10% of the population, or both the left circumflex artery and right coronary artery in 20% of the population.
