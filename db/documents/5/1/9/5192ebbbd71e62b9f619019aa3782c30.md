Epidural steroids injections (ESI) have been utilized to treat pain due to lumbar disc injuries since the 1950s. They are frequently used in the treatment of radicular pain, which is a neuropathic pain syndrome, along with the sensory distribution of a dermatome of one or more spinal nerves. Typically, the pain is due to nerve root irritation from mechanical compression by an intervertebral herniated disc and resultant inflammation. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and side effects of epidural steroids and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with low back pain.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of radicular pain.
- Review the proper technique of administering epidural steroids.
- Summarize the complications of epidural steroids and how to address them when they arise.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients receiving epidural steroids.
