The following factors may impact treatment decisions:

Tumor biology: Since mucinous carcinoma is more prevalent in the older population, hence estrogen(ER) and progesterone receptors(PR) are expressed more often than in younger women. Similarly, there are lower rates of HER-2 overexpression. This impacts the selection of appropriate therapy.

General health status: Higher prevalence of comorbidity, frailty, and cognitive decline in elderly patients are considered limiting factors when selecting treatment.

Functional status: This refers to the ability to perform routine daily tasks. Presence of functional limitation is independently associated with worse life expectancy and hence determines the overall survival of the patients. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (GCA) can be utilized to evaluate elderly patients to optimize mucinous cancer treatment.
