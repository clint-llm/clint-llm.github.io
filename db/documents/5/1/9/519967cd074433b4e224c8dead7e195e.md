The path to diagnose NCS is often a difficult one, and most of the times it comes under the diagnosis of exclusion. The workup is usually related to the presentation of typical Hematuria which includes urinalysis, urine culture, cystoscopy, ureterorenoscopy, and even renal biopsy. The vascular anomaly can then be ruled out by doing ultrasound imaging and color Doppler scanning which has a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of about 100%. The anteroposterior diameter and peak velocities of LRV should be measured at 2 points in the transverse plane. First, at the level of renal hilum and second, when it crosses the aorta and SMA. When the peak velocity and AP diameter at these 2 points exceed by factor 5, the diagnosis should be suspected of NCS. Then further workup should be done by CT angiography or MRA to define the anatomical relation of LRV to aorta and SMA. With MRA being superior to CTA due to the fact of absence of radiation and having multi-planer imaging.

The gold standard then to establish the final diagnosis is by doing the cine-video angiography and retrograde phlebography along with reno-caval pressure gradient measurement. The normal mean pressure gradients range from 0 to 1 mm Hg. To establish the diagnosis of NCS, the pressure gradient between the left renal vein and IVC should be greater than 3 mm Hg. The advantage of cine-video angiography is not only it allows visualization of LRV compression at the level of crossover between aorta and SMA, but it also shows reflux of collaterals into the adrenal and gonadal veins with stasis of contrast in the renal vein.
