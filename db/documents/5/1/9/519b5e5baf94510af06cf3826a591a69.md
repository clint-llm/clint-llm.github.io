The seizures in patients with MTLE share semiological characteristics with other types of epilepsies, such as absence seizures, insular seizures, and occipital lobe seizures. Patients with absence seizures also manifest with a blank stare and may have subtle automatisms which can mimic seizures of MTLE.

Further, other medical conditions may mimic temporal lobe seizures such as panic attacks, tardive dyskinesia, excessive daytime sleepiness, periodic limb movement disorder, transient psychotic episodes, and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES).
