Acne may appear in adolescence, and it persists through the early thirties. Acne is more common in males than in females. Urban populations are more affected than rural populations. About 20% of the affected individuals develop severe acne, which results in scarring. Some races appear to be more affected than others. Asians and Africans tend to develop severe acne, but mild acne is more common in the white population. In general, populations with darker skin also tend to develop hyperpigmentation. Acne can also develop in neonates but in most cases, resolves spontaneously.
