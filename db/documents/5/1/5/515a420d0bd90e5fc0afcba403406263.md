Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women in the United States and the leading cause of cancer death. One of the primary treatment approaches for lung cancer is removing all or part of the diseased lung. The earliest lung surgery approaches were limited by the complexity of operating on the lungs without general anesthesia as we know it today. This often resulted in the resection of more healthy tissue than may be necessary. The initial approach involved the removal of an entire lung, the pneumonectomy. As the morbidity and mortality of pneumonectomies became clear, the research ended in less radical procedures.

The North American Lung Cancer Study Group (LCSG) released a prospective randomized study in 1995 that demonstrated increased recurrence and worse outcomes with sublobar resection than lobectomy in lung cancer.
