Endometrial polyps are localized overgrowths of the endometrial glands and stroma that protrude out of the endometrium. The definite etiology of endometrial polyps is unknown. However, endometrial polyps are associated with endometrial hyperplasia; therefore, unopposed estrogen is considered to be a risk factor.

A majority of polyps are benign; however, malignant transformation can occur in 0 to 13%.
