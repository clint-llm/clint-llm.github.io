All healthcare personnel: clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists should be aware of the indications and adverse effects profile of PTU and function collaboratively as an interprofessional team. The clinicians should gather an appropriate medication history and consider drug interactions with PTU. All the healthcare personnel should educate the patients regarding medication-related adverse effects and the need for regular close surveillance. Patient education is a crucial aspect. Educate the patients that if there are any new symptoms, PTU should be discontinued immediately. Moreover, depending on the severity of symptoms, patients need to contact the prescribing clinician or go to the emergency department.

Clinicians will make the decision to dose PTU when appropriate. The pharmacist should verify all dosing by indications, perform medication reconciliation to check for drug-drug interactions, and report any discrepancies. Nursing will handle administration for inpatientÂ care, serve as an initial point of contact for outpatients, as well as be able to monitor treatment effectiveness. All healthcare personnel should monitor for adverse reactions as well as medication compliance and therapy effectiveness. If any member of the interprofessional team notes an adverse event, drug interaction, or therapeutic failure, they should document it in the patient's record and report their findings to the other team members so corrective action can be taken.

PTU therapy requires an interprofessional team approach, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, working together across disciplines to achieve desired patient results while minimizing adverse events. [Level 5]
