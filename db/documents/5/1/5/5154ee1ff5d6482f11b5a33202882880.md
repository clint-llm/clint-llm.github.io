Parents, caretakers, and healthcare professionals must recognize that upper extremity injuries can be a sign of nonaccidental trauma in at-risk populations. Perform a comprehensive history and physical evaluation to rule out occult injuries.

Significant complications include compartment syndrome, neurovascular injury, occult fractures, and hardware irritation. Instruct patients to notify a medical professional immediately for any acute weakness, paresthesias, cold extremity, skin color changes.
