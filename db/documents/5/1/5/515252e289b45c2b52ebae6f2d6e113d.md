The interprofessional healthcare team, e.g., clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, and NPs), nurses, pharmacists, etc., need to work together to address pain control in their patients appropriately and safely. The healthcare team should schedule these patients for routine follow-up visits that include a history and physical exam to monitor for adverse drug effects and drug misuse or signs of diversion. Monitoring for signs of drug misuse is a very important responsibility for all interprofessional healthcare team members because of the epidemic rates of drug misuse worldwide, particularly in the USA, which lead to death because of respiratory depression. Each member of the interprofessional team has both a responsibility as well as a unique perspective into the patient's case and should communicate to other team members if anything seems amiss. For example, a retail pharmacist can check the patient's prescription history for signs of "doctor shopping," whereby a patient seeks opioid prescriptions from multiple prescribers while not revealing their current prescriptions; this is where integrated prescription databases can prove especially useful.

Methods for monitoring drug misuse and drug diversion include the following examples: assessment surveys, state prescription drug monitoring programs, comprehensive prescription history, urine screening, adherence check-lists, motivational counseling, and dosage form counting, e.g., tablet counting. These strategies are valuable tools that enable all interprofessional team members to communicate accurately regarding the patient's status and provide optimal pain relief while preventing adverse events (including death and getting the patient the assistance needed in cases of misuse or diversion).
