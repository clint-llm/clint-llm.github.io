The annual incidence cited by Reed was 3.1% in 2012. In 2014, the incidence was 4.2 cases per 100 woman-years and differed by age, ethnicity, and marital status. Independent NIH-funded population-based studies by Harlow, 2003; Reed 2004 and 2006; and Arnold, 2007 demonstrated a point prevalence of 3% to 7% in reproductive-aged women. Three of the studies included clinical confirmation components. According to Harlow, 7% of American women will have symptoms consistent with vulvodynia by age 40. Interestingly, only 1.4% of women seeking medical care were correctly diagnosed.
