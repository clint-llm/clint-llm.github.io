The process of a single cell becoming a complex multicellular organism requires careful regulation of cellular activities, including differentiation, migration, and proliferation. All of these actions must happen at the correct time and place. This high level of coordination requires extensive, coordinated, and fast-acting cellular communication. There are several key signaling pathways identified in human and animal studies required for proper development, including FGF, hedgehog, Wnt, TGF beta, and notch. One ligand can bind several different receptors on different cells to cause different downstream effects. For example, in the Wnt pathway, the ligand can bind multiple receptor complexes and trigger several downstream signaling cascades resulting in diverse cellular responses. This is one example of how cellular receptors can turn the same signal into several different effects. Through the complex interaction of ligand and receptor, a single cell develops into a complex multicellular organism at the correct time relative to other cellular processes.
