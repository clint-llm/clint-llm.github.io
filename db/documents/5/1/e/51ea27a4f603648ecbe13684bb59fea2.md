Luteinizing hormone deficiency is a form of secondary hypogonadism and requires differentiation from gonadal disorders that cause primary hypogonadism and other hormonal disorders that affect the pituitary gland and hypothalamus. Following the diagnosis of secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, the clinician must determine the causative disorder.

Differential Diagnosis:

- Primary hypogonadism

- Primary amenorrhea

- Hypogonadism due to thyroid dysfunction

- Luteal phase dysfunction

- Prolactinoma

- Ovarian insufficiency

- Decreased sperm production

- Polycystic ovarian syndrome
