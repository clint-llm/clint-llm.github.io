Hemolytic uremic syndrome is part of a spectrum of diseases associated with thrombotic microangiopathy. Specifically, HUS has two variants termed typical and atypical HUS. The typical variant is caused by Shiga-like toxin (verotoxin) produced by Escherichia coli (O157: H7) and Shiga toxin by Shigella dysenteriae. The atypical form is linked to bacteria, medication, or immune processes capable of endothelial damage. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common bacterial infection associated with atypical HUS, while other causes include Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Clostridium difficile, HIV, histoplasmosis, and coxsackievirus, and H1N1 Influenza A.
