The initial evaluation should start with a lumbar spine examination. The examination should take into account the patient's gait, posture, and alignment as well as any leg length discrepancies. Also, the practitioner should examine the patient's hips, pelvis, and sacroiliac joint, noting sensory, motor, and deep tendon reflexes.

In piriformis syndrome, sensory, motor, and deep tendon reflexes are normal. The piriformis should be palpated as well just posterior to the hip joint and in the area of the greater sciatic notch.   Straight leg raise may also be positive although there is variable sensitivity and specificity for this provocative maneuver.

There are individual tests that stretch the piriformis and can be used to help aid in the diagnosis of exclusion. One of these is the Freiberg sign, which is performed by putting the hip in extension and internal rotation and having the patient externally rotate against resistance. The positive exam will reproduce pain around the piriformis. This test will have positive results in up to 63% of patients. Another individual test called the Pace sign is performed by resisting abduction and external rotation of the hip while the patient is in a seated position. Pace sign occurs in 30% to 74% in piriformis syndrome. FAIR test or also known as the piriformis stretch may elicit pain. Beatty sign has also been described and is accomplished by elevating the flexed leg on the irritated side while the patient lies on the asymptomatic side. Pain and reproduction of the symptoms are positive test results.
