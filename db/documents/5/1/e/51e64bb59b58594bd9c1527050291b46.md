There are no complications specific to the US for IV access as compared to the traditional method of IV access without US use.

A published study suggests that peripheral IV catheters placed under US guidance may fail earlier than expected, with an average life of approximately 26 hours. The shorter functional duration may beÂ due to the patients who require this modality or the individual placing the catheter, rather than the use of US itself.
