Basu et al. published the long-term outcomes of simple limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) on a population of 125 patients consisting of 65 adults and 60 children with unilateral LSCD. Successful outcomes were maintained in 76% of the eyes with a survival probability of 80% in adults and 72% in children after 12 months.

When compared with other surgical treatments of LSCD, SLET requires much less donor tissue than CLAU. Other advantages of SLET over CLET include the following:

1. No requirements for a laboratory

2. A single-stage procedure

3. More affordability

A meta-analysis of 22 non-comparative case series, including 1023 eyes, evaluated anatomic and functional outcomes of the three techniques SLET, CLAU, and CLET. The results of this review found clinical outcomes of SLET and CLAU exceed those of CLET with the anatomical and functional success of SLET (78%; 68.6%), CLAU (81%; 74.4%), and CLET (61.4%; 53%; p=0.0048). Note that the group had the lowest study quality and sample size of the three, which may explain the success rates observed.
