The venom of M. fulvius and M. tener is a highly potent neurotoxin. M. euryxanthus envenomation is not known to cause significant symptoms in humans, although this species does boast a protective sonic warning capability called a “microfart” (caused by air expulsion from its cloaca). The incidence of significant coral snake envenomation is less than that of pit viper bites for several reasons. Unlike pit vipers, coral snakes are more elusive and will often retreat from any signs of danger rather than confront any potential threats. Hence, coral snake bites commonly occur after intentional handling of the snake by humans or from harassment by curious animals.
