This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, pharmacology, monitoring, and relevant interactions of ibutilide, pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating patients with cardiac disorders that will respond to such therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of ibutilide.
- Summarize the indications for using ibutilide.
- Review the potential adverse effects profile for ibutilide.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients receiving treatment with ibutilide.
