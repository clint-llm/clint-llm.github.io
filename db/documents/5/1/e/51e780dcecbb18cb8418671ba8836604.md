Long-term outcomes have shown high success rates of 2 to 13 years.

Non-surgical endodontic therapy has a success rate of 85 to 94%, depending on the presence of a periapical radiolucency. Non-surgical endodontic retreatment has a success rate of 74 to 82%, and periapical surgery has a success rate of 60 to 91%.

With microscopes and delicate instruments, periapical surgeries remove the apical portion of the root and fill the root in an apico-coronal direction, known as a root-end resection and root-end fill. The dentist should assess postoperative healing radiographically at 12 months post-treatment. 88% of lesions show evidence of recovery at 12 months postoperatively, compared to only 50% when reevaluated at six months.

It is also important to note the lesion's size, shape, and presentation clinically and radiographically. This practice will provide comparative information for any follow-up visits.
