Ophthalmic assessment treatment should not preclude life-threatening interventions.

If a metallic intraocular or intraorbital foreign body is suspected, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is contraindicated as the risk of dislodging the foreign body can damage surrounding structures.

Additionally, there are important considerations when evaluating EOM motility in patients with open globe injuries. If the wound is posterior to the limbus (Zone 2 or 3 injuries), the examiner may limit EOM assessment or any eye movement before primary repair. While this is not an absolute contraindication, doing so may risk expulsion of intraocular contents. Pre-operatively, a retrobulbar block is contraindicated in the presence of an open globe.
