The syndrome can present as a mild self-limiting disease with the presentation of non-specific symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, sleep disturbance, nausea, and vomiting. However, it may also progress to life-threatening complications such as high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) and high altitude cerebral edema (HACE).

The AMS-C score derives from the Environmental Symptom Questionnaire (ESQ), which was formulated in 1979 to assess symptoms induced upon exposure to extreme environmental conditions. ESQ-III, the third and final revision, consisted of 67 questions, of which 11 are categorized to AMS-C. The questions are scored on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 reported as “not at all” and 5 reported as “extreme.” Each response score is then multiplied by the factorial weight of its symptom and a score of 0.70 or greater classified as AMS-C. Due to ESQ-II being an intricate assessment tool, it is less frequently used.

The Lake Louise Questionnaire was introduced in 1991 and was last modified in 2018.  It is now the most commonly used scoring system used to assess AMS. It defines AMS as the presence of headaches in addition to three other symptoms, including gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue/weakness, and dizziness/lightheadedness. Each symptom is appointed a point on a scale from 0 to 3, with 0 being no effect and 3 being severe. A total score of 3 or greater, with the presence of headaches, in a setting of rapid ascent to high altitude, is diagnosed as acute mountain sickness. The Lake Louise Questionnaire, although an effective assessment tool, has its limitation. It is a scoring system to standardize and diagnose AMS for use by investigators or research purposes, and it is not meant for clinical practice.
