The trachea and esophagus arise from a separation of a common foregut tube during early fetal development. Failure of separation or complete development of this foregut tube can lead to tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) and esophageal atresia (EA). Esophageal atresia presents in neonates as excessive drooling, choking, and failure to pass a nasogastric tube. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of esophageal atresia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of neonates with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of esophageal atresia.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of a neonate with esophageal atresia.
- Outline the postnatal management for neonates with esophageal atresia.
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional team care to improve overall outcomes for neonates with esophageal atresia.
