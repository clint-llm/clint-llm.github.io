Blunt chest trauma is more common than penetrating trauma and directly comprises 20 to 25% of trauma deaths. Among patients presenting after motor vehicle collisions, higher morbidity and mortality are associated with high-speed collisions and with a lack of seat belt use. Poorer outcomes are also seen in patients with advanced age and higher injury severity scores (ISS). Despite its higher incidence, less than 10% of patients suffering blunt trauma to the thorax require operative intervention, whereas 15 to 30% of patients sustaining penetrating chest injuries will need operative intervention. Penetrating chest trauma is associated with higher overall mortality. Incidence varies based on geographic location, predominating in urban areas, those prone to interpersonal violence, and areas of conflict.
