During the antepartum course, the care and management of patients serve significant challenges and obstacles, given the complexity of caring for both the patient and fetus. Because of this dual perspective, a team-directed approach of care by physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and healthcare aids is essential for improving maternal and fetal outcomes. This begins with adequate antepartum or prenatal care to ensure patients feel supported and informed. This also includes early detection and acknowledgments of patient complaints, signs, and symptoms of early disease processes, vital signs, laboratory values, and antepartum and prenatal care goals.
