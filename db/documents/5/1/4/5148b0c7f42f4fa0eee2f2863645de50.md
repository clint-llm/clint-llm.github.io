There are many causes of cough and most are benign. But cough can also be due to malignancies, nerve injuries and serious infections; thus a multidisciplinary approach is essential when a cough is persistent. The primary care provider, nurse practitioner, internist, and pulmonologist should not empirically prescribe anti-tussive agents to all patients with a cough; the key is to treat the cause. A thorough history is vital when trying to establish the cause of a cough; when the cough is prolonged and associated with other symptoms, a referral to a pulmonologist or an ENT surgeon is recommended.
