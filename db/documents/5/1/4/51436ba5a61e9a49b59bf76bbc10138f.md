Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) is a potent vasodilator that first gained FDA approval for the treatment of severe hypertension in 1974. First discovered in 1849 by Playfair, its applications in human medicine can be traced back to the early 1920s, with the first safety and efficacy data published in 1955. After an initial delay in gaining FDA approval due to difficulty in the development of a chemically stable formulation, SNP gained widespread use as a fast-acting antihypertensive agent and has been used clinically for hypertensive crises, heart failure, cardiac/vascular surgery, pediatric surgery, and a variety of other acute applications. While sodium nitroprusside's potential adverse effects and toxicity have led to its replacement by newer agents in some practices, it remains a useful tool in certain difficult clinical situations that require a potent, fast-acting, titratable vasodilator.

Sodium nitroprusside has the following FDA-approved indications:

- Acute hypertensive crises

- Acute decompensated heart failure

- Induction of perioperative hypotension (to reduce blood loss)

Off-label uses for nitroprusside include:

- Hypertension in the setting of acute ischemic stroke

- Afterload reduction in acute mitral regurgitation

- Increase cardiac output in cardiogenic shock and high SVR

- Acute preload reduction in select patients with valvular aortic stenosis

Emerging applications:

- Prevention and treatment of the "no-reflow" phenomenon in the percutaneous coronary intervention

- Symptomatic treatment of schizophrenia
