The mother's uterusÂ fosters the environment for fetal growth and placental vitality. Every organ system is involved in the process of fetal circulation because as the fetus grows and develops, it needs oxygen and nutrients that the blood supplies. The fetal blood will reach every aspect of the growing fetus except for the liver and lungs, which are bypassed. However, the fetal arterial system will receive waste products that originated from those organs.
