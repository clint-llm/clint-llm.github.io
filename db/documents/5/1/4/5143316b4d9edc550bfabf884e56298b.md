Management of myopia requires an interprofessional team of optometrists, paramedics, cornea surgeons, and retina specialists. The success lies in the accurate measurement of refractive errors by optometrists using various retinoscopy and auto-refractometers. Hence they need to be well-versed in the art of retinoscopy for faultless spotting of refractive errors.

Trained paramedical staff with pertinent instrumentation dynamics knowledge are critical for analyzing various myopic causes. Anterior segment imaging is crucial for determining the structural anatomy of the cornea. Corneal specialists are essential for ruling out ectatic corneal disorders, the most critical contraindication for refractive surgeries. The team of myopic management is not complete without retinal specialists.

Preventive management of peripheral retinal lesions is critical for the long-lasting success of myopic management. The timely intervention of peripheral retinal lesions utilizing green lasers by retinal surgeons significantly reduces the risk of retinal detachment.
