Studies often report the mean value of what they are researching.  For example, Eid et al. studied how well surgical residents can interpret clinical images compared to medical students and other residents. They reported the mean scores for medical students, general surgery residents, internal medicine residents, and radiology trainees of a quiz they gave to evaluate how well their subjects can interpret radiological results.

Some studies use the mean of a sample of the population to extrapolate the population's mean. Because the true mean of a population in most cases cannot be known, researchers will report a range with an upper limit and a lower limit of the true mean, which is called a confidence interval.  A 95% confidence interval means, if multiple different samples were selected from a population, the researchers would expect that 95% of the time, the mean of the selected sample would fall within the range they reported.

In addition to a confidence interval, the mean can also be reported with a standard deviation to report the range of the values reported. A mean reported with a range of +/- one standard deviation is the range of 68% of the values in the sample size if the sample has a normal Gaussian distribution.

As mentioned previously, the mean can be affected by outliers. If there are a few significant outliers in the data set, then the median may be a better representation of the center of the data set than the mean.
