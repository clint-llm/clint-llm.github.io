The prostate gland starts to develop laterally as epithelial buds from the urogenital sinus wall. These buds branch into solid cords which canalize and form the ducts and acini. The surrounding urogenital sinus mesenchyme forms the interfascicular fibroblasts and the smooth muscle of the prostate.****With androgenic stimulation of the androgen receptor expressed in prostatic Mullerian mesenchyma, the prostate forms.
