Lung cancer is the primary concern for long-term radon exposure. It is estimated that 21,000 deaths per year are due to lung cancer secondary to radon exposure. Since routine exposure to radon does not initially present with irritating symptoms or warning signs, it is important to screen patients for radon toxicity. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends a low-dose computed tomography (CT) scan for anyone over the age of 50 with at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and a history of radon exposure. However, the American Academy of Family Physicians has concluded that there is insufficient evidence for or against using low-dose CT to screen for lung cancer in individuals that are high risk.

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) also has not established any benefit from screening asymptomatic patients. More studies are needed to determine the best method to screen for lung cancer in patients who are exposed to higher radon levels. Nonetheless, a detailed physical examination, history, chest x-rays, CT scan, sputum cytology, or a combination of these tests can aid in making the diagnosis.
