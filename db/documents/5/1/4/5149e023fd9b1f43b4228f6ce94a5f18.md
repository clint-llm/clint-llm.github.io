In 1905, Nikolai Korotkov, a Russian military surgeon, wrote a 281-word report for the imperial medical military academy detailing his auscultatory technique for determining systolic and diastolic blood pressure. This technique requires only a sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff) and a stethoscope to listen to what is now known as Korotkoff sounds.

Korotkoff sounds are pulsatile circulatory sounds heard upon auscultation of the brachial artery. While advancements in technology have allowed for the use of electronic blood pressure machines, this non-invasive method of acquiring blood pressure measurements has proven accurate and easy to perform, making it the "gold standard" for blood pressure measurement, even today.
