There are few specific contraindications when it comes to prescribing ruxolitinib; however, there are medications and foods that should be used with caution alongside ruxolitinib. For example, as previously mentioned, grapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be taken alongside ruxolitinib due to possible interaction. Further, when taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, nelfinavir, and voriconazole alongside ruxolitinib, the ruxolitinib dose should be reduced as all these medications cause increased exposure to ruxolitinib. Careful consideration is necessary when fluconazole is taken alongside ruxolitinib as it inhibits both CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 and causes increased exposure to ruxolitinib. Hence, the dose of fluconazole should not exceed 200 mg daily when taken alongside ruxolitinib.

Other drug contraindications include concomitant ruxolitinib use with live vaccines.

Ruxolitinib is contraindicated in patients whose creatinine clearance is below 15 and who are not on hemodialysis. Patients should not breastfeed during treatment and for two weeks following discontinuation of treatment.

Clinicians need to exercise caution when prescribing ruxolitinib to patients who smoke or are past smokers, those with a creatinine clearance below 60, patients with hepatic impairment, and those with infection risks, particularly TB-related risk.
