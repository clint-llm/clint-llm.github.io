Patients with mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms present with abdominal pain (62.2%), weight loss (11%), abdominal mass (11%), acute pancreatitis (9.6%), fatigue (8.9%), and 16% were asymptomatic. Large mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms can compress surrounding organs and structures, leading to abdominal pain and a sensation of fullness. Conversely, many patients are asymptomatic, and lesions are found incidentally on imaging. Patients occasionally (16.5%) have elevated levels of CA 19-9 (> 37 U/L). On physical examination, patients can have abdominal tenderness and distention, and occasionally an epigastric mass can be palpated if it is significantly large. These lesions are often located in the body and tail of the pancreas and, thus, rarely cause obstructive jaundice. If patients present with a pancreatic head mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasm, then jaundice may be evident
