Transverse, or out-of-plane, and longitudinal, or in-plane, techniques have been described to start USGIVs. The longitudinal method allows the user to visualize the needle as it enters the vessel. However, this procedure is technically more difficult for those without significant ultrasound experience. Therefore, the transverse technique is recommended for beginners.

In the transverse technique, the provider locates the intended vessel with the probe marker towards the operator’s left side. The vein should appear as a black, or anechoic, circle on the screen. Try to get the vein in the middle of the screen so that fewer redirections of the needle will be necessary for cannulation. Many machines have a "guide” or “centerline” function that helps identify the middle of the screen. Likewise, the middle of the ultrasound probe is marked ensuring the needle puncture through the skin is over the intended vein.

The practitioner should hold the ultrasound probe in their nondominant hand and the IV needle in their dominant hand. Typically, the needle stick will be at a steeper angle than that of a landmark-based PIV. This difference is because most USGIVs utilize deeper vessels than PIVs. While a 45-degree angle is acceptable for most USGIVs, the angle may need to be adjusted based on the depth of the vessel. With the desired vessel in the middle of the screen, penetrate the skin adjacent to the middle of the ultrasound probe.

When the needle tip crosses the path of the ultrasound beam, it will look like a bright white dot on the screen. It is essential to move the ultrasound probe along the vessel path as the needle advances. It is helpful to keep the probe immediately in front of the needle. As soon as the bright dot of the needle tip appears on the screen, the probe is moved slightly proximal. This adjustment prevents confusing the distal needle tip with more proximal portions of the needle, which can look similar on the machine. As the needle advances, adjust its path left and right to keep it in line with the intended target vessel. Continue to advance the needle until it appears as a bullseye within the middle of the vessel. There will often be a small amount of blood in the chamber of the IV when the needle initially penetrates the vessel wall. However, it needs to insert a little further before attempting to thread the catheter. As the needle advances, adjust its angle to keep the needle tip within the middle of the vessel. This process ensures some of the catheter is in the vessel and not just the beveled needle tip.

The longitudinal technique is more difficult than the transverse. Therefore, it is not advisable for users without significant experience using ultrasound. For novice sonographers, the probe may slide from a vein to an adjacent artery or fascial planes may be mistaken for the vessel.

To perform this technique, the anechoic lumen of the intended vessel is located in a transverse plane. The probe is then rotated 90 degrees such that the plane of the ultrasound probe follows that of the vessel. In this technique, the needle penetrates directly adjacent to the narrow side of the probe. The needle is then adjusted to match the same direction as the ultrasound probe. The probe is held still over the vein, while adjustments are made to the needle until it is seen coming from one side of the ultrasound screen into the vessel. Advancement and securing of the catheter are the same as described in the transverse technique.
