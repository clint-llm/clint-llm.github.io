Raloxifene is a medication used to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis and the risk reduction of invasive breast cancer in post-menopausal women. Osteoporosis represents an increased risk for developing fractures. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator with an estrogen-agonistic effect on bone receptors. This activity outlines the indications, action, and contraindications of raloxifene as a valuable agent in the treatment of osteoporosis. In addition, this activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and dosing pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in patients treated with raloxifene.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of raloxifene.
- Describe the adverse effects of raloxifene.
- Review and select appropriate monitoring parameters for patients treated with raloxifene.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication for patients on raloxifene therapy where appropriate, including follow-up monitoring, and improve outcomes.
