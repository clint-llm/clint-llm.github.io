HPNS is one of the major limitations of deep diving. Unfortunately, no drug has been used successfully to prevent HPNS in humans. In general, modifications on breathing gas mixtures and compression profiles and selecting less susceptible divers may be partially beneficial for controlling HPNS. However, these methods are still inadequate for extremely deep dives regarding HPNS. Further studies about HPNS pathophysiology, prevention, and adaptation mechanisms should be performed to widen borders in modern diving for humans.
