Thermal burn injuries are a significant problem with high associated morbidity and mortality. Those associated with inhalational trauma (IHT) may be associated with higher mortality, but studies on prognosis are small and underpowered.Â It seems that %TBSA, presence of IHT, and age are the best predictors of mortality among the current published literature on burn prognosis.
