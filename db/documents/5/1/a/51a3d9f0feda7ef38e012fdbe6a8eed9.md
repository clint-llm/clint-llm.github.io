**Differentiating VBI from a hemispheric stroke**

- Lesions as a result of VBI have certain clinical features that make it possible to differentiate them from hemispheric strokes:

- Cerebellar signs like ataxia and dysmetria are common

- If the cranial nerve is involved, the clinical signs are usually ipsilateral to the lesion and the corticospinal clinical features are seen in the opposite leg and arm, due to crossing.

- Dysphagia and dysarthria are common with VBI

- With brain stem lesions, unilateral Horner syndrome may be present

- Nausea, vertigo, nystagmus, and vomiting are common when the vestibular system is involved

- Involvement of the occipital lobe results in visuospatial or visual field defects

- In general, cognitive impairment and aphasia (cortical deficits) are absent
