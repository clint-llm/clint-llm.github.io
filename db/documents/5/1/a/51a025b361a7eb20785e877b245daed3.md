Given the variety of etiologies of optic nerve cysts, treatment is not uniform or established in the literature.

Our understanding of treatment is mostly based on case studies or case series. The main concern with surgical resection or drainage of these cysts is that it can be associated with significant morbidity due to the risk of optic nerve transection. Additionally, surgeons have to ensure that the cyst itself is not a coloboma in an eye with stable vision as drainage can result in drainage of intraocular contents.

Colobomatous cysts can be aspirated if they are cosmetically unacceptable. In many cases, if the cyst returns after repeat aspirations, the eye and cyst may be removed, and the socket may be fitted with prosthetics.
