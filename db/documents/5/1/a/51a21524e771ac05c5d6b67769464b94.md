As ependymomas arise within different CNS compartments, their clinical presentation may vary from acute onset increased intracranial pressure causing nausea and vomiting, to a more chronic and insidious clinical course.

Ependymoma is a histological diagnosis, and it most commonly presents in three major anatomical sites: supratentorial, spinal cord, and infratentorial.

Ependymoma is commonly suspected in adult patients suffering prolonged clinical courses, who present a non-enhancing and well-demarcated intraventricular lesion on brain imaging, isodense in computed tomography, and isointense on T1 images on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
