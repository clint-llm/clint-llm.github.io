The REVEAL Registry PAH Risk Score Calculator is a tool clinicians may use to help prognosticate patients with pulmonary artery hypertension.

The tool has validation as a predictive algorithm for 1-year survival. Factors that are independently associated with decreased survival include the following:

- Men older than 60 years

- PAH associated with portal hypertension or connective tissue disorder

- Family history of PAH

- WHO Class III or IV renal insufficiency

- Resting systolic BP less than 110 mmHg

- Heart rate greater than 92 beats per minute

- Six-minute walk test less than 165 m

- Brain natriuretic peptide greater than 180 pg/ml

- Pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 32 Woods units

- Presence of pericardial effusion on echocardiogram

- TAPSE (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) less than 1.5 cm, percentage predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO less than 32%)
