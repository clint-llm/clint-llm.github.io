Management of orbital apex syndrome (OAS) requires a multidisciplinary approach to identify the cause and institute specific therapy. The ophthalmologist may be the first to diagnose orbital apex syndrome since most of the symptoms are visual, like a decrease in best-corrected visual acuity, diplopia, and reduced eye movement.

The otorhinolaryngologist plays a vital role by performing endoscopic resection of tissues through functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), the histopathological examination of which may be vital in identifying the cause. Clinicians and rheumatologists are indispensable in managing OAS secondary to systemic autoimmune diseases. The oncologist plays a crucial role in identifying and managing orbital apex syndrome secondary to primary malignancies and metastasis, thereby improving the patient's chances of survival.

The vascular surgeon is essential in managing carotic cavernous fistula, sinus, and cavernous sinus thrombosis. The general physician, diabetologist, and infectious disease specialist are vital in managing infectious causes of orbital apex syndrome. The outcomes and prognosis of OAS depend on the cause and the patient's general systemic condition; hence a multispeciality approach may help adequately treat the patient.
