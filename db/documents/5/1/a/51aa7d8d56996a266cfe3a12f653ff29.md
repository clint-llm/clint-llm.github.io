**Essentials for Nursing Practice**

Quality improvement has sparked sufficient attention for the urgency of effective collaboration and teamwork in improving patient outcomes. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the World Health Organization (WHO) support collaboration and teamwork as essential to quality improvement.

Quality is a national imperative to confront disparities in patient outcomes. Reports are alarming, showing 98,000 deaths from medical errors annually.

**Interprofessionality**

Collaboration and teamwork are essential elements in the concept of interprofessionality. Training physicians and nurses in interprofessionality have become a global mandate in clinical settings and educational programs.

**FEP Enhances Communication in Nursing**

The traditional medical hierarchy has created an organizational culture of ineffective communication. Communication flaws related to hierarchy issues between physicians and nurses.

In summary, the nurse educator should not underestimate the value of the FEP in nursing programs. Prior medical education and experiences unknotted to connect and compliment the value of nursing practice. The nurse educator has an extraordinary opportunity to analyze the FEP’s readiness to transition into nursing, design the learning environment, and implement strategies for the learner’s transformation into contemporary concepts of collaboration and teamwork.
