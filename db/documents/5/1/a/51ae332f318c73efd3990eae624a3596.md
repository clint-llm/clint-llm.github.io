Serum tests for hCG are immunometric assays. This means thatÂ they use 2two antibodies that bind to the hCG molecule, a fixed antibody and a radiolabeled antibody which adhere to different sites on the molecule, sandwiching and immobilize the molecule to make it detectable.

Urine assays are similar, although many detect total hCG levels greater than 20 mIU/mL.

Serum testing is much more sensitive and specific than urine testing. Urine testing, however, is more convenient, affordable, comfortable for patients, has a fast turnaround (5 to 10 minutes), and does not require a medical prescription.
