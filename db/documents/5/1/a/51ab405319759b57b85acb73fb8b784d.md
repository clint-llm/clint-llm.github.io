Nailfold capillary microscopy is utilized as a diagnostic method to differentiate primary Raynaud phenomena from secondary Raynaud phenomenon. It analyzes microvascular and morphologic changes in peripheral vessels seen with CTD, such as changes in architecture, capillary size, capillary density, the presence of hemorrhage, and avascular areas without capillary loops. This is done using a dermatoscope or ophthalmoscope. Nailfold videocapillaroscopy can also be used. Abnormal nail-fold microscopy is correlated with an increased likelihood of the development of CTD. The changes were seen are capillary loops appear enlarged or there is a loss of capillary loops. If there are mega-capillaries with a decreased capillary density, then these changes are indicative of scleroderma.
