Atherosclerosis or plaque build-up is the predominant etiology for an isolated aneurysm of the aortic arch as well as for those associated with descending aorta. The aneurysms found in relation to ascending thoracic aorta often result from cystic medial degeneration. The causes include Marfan syndrome, Loeys–Dietz syndrome, Ehlers– Danlos syndrome, Turner syndrome, familial TAA syndrome, and Behcet disease.

Both infectious as well as non-infectious inflammatory conditions of the aorta, or aortitis can also result in TAA. These include syphilis, giant cell arteritis, and Takayasu arteritis.

Along with the risk factors for atherosclerosis such as smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, factors that increase aortic wall stress, including pheochromocytoma, cocaine use, coarctation, weight lifting, also increase the likelihood for development of TAA.
