Metformin, FDA-approved in 1994, is an antidiabetic agent used in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin comes in both immediate-release and extended-release and is used in several combination products with other antidiabetic agents. Metformin also has several non-FDA-approved indications, including gestational diabetes, management of antipsychotic-induced weight gain, type 2 diabetes prevention, and the treatment and prevention of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Currently, metformin is the only ADA-recommended antidiabetic for pre-diabetes. As for potential indications, metformin is being studied for its possible antiaging, anticancer, and neuroprotective effects. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and adverse effects of metformin and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with diabetes mellitus.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of metformin.
- Identify the approved and off-label indications for using metformin.
- Review the potential adverse effects of metformin.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the use of metformin for type 2 diabetes and improve outcomes.
