Werner syndrome is caused by a truncating mutation in the WRN gene due to the production of a stop codon from a nonsense or frameshift mutation. The WRN gene encodes a 142 amino acid protein that is part of the Rec Q DNA helicase family. Its function is to unwind the 2 DNA strands and act as an exonuclease. The WRN gene plays a role in maintaining proper DNA replication and repair through base excision repair, non-homologous end-joining, and homologous recombination. It is also involved in maintaining telomere stability, which is pivotal for genomic stability. Telomeres are a marker for aging and act by counting the number of cell divisions.

It is postulated that epigenetic changes to histones can contribute to the pathogenesis of Werner syndrome, but there is not enough data to support this theory.

The mechanism behind skeletal muscle loss is unknown but postulated to be due to a defect in the mesenchymal stem cells in patients with Werner syndrome. The stems cells are thought to be of a senescent phenotype in Werner syndrome, rendering a low capacity for regenerative potential.
