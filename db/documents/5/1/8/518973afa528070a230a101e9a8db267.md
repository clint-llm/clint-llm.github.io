Interstitial edema and mononuclear cell infiltration, mostly T- lymphocytes into the tubules and interstitial space, are seen on light microscopy. Scattered plasma cells, macrophages, and occasionally noncaseating granuloma with eosinophils can also be found in the lesion. Interstitial fibrosis is often present. The extent of fibrosis is a key prognostic factor for renal recovery. When the AIN is associated with infection, the pathogen-specific molecular protein can be identified in the tissue samples.
