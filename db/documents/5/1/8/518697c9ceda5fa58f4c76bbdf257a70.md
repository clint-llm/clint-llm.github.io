The diagnosis of dementia can be stressful and overwhelming for patients and their families. Patient and caregiver education is a vital part of the clinical management of patients with dementia. Counseling must be given about regular clinic visits, medication compliance, a healthy diet, exercise, and sleep hygiene. Safety concerns become increasingly important as the disease progresses. Special attention should be paid to potential safety concerns, including when to retire from driving, the risk of wandering or getting lost, risks of fire or cooking mishaps, or lack of ability to prepare food for oneself. Patients with dementia often have a lack of insight into their own limitations. Caregivers do better redirecting or reassuring patients rather than trying to correct them. Support groups can help with the reduction of issues like anxiety, frustration, anger, loneliness, and depression. The patients and caregivers should be counseled about the diagnosis and the prognosis. Creating an individualized care plan can empower the patient.
