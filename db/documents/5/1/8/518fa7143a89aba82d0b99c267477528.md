To date, there remains sparse information about the toxicokinetics of ketamine in the human population.

In animal studies, however, the safety ratio (defined as the proportion of the usual recreational dose to a fetal or lethal dose) has been used to evaluate the acute risk observed with ketamine.

The definition of the lethal dose (LD50) is the amount of drug that results in death in 50% of experimental animals tested. Gable et al. determined the oral ketamine safety ratio for rodents as 25Â and estimated that the median lethal dose averaged at 11.3 mg/kg IV or 678 mg for a 70 kg human.

Ketamine has been used to provide analgesia in refractory chronic pain conditions and even anesthesia for short surgeries. However, the safety data is mixed regarding its toxicity when administered neuraxial in animals, with some authors suggesting that its neurotoxicity derives from preservatives. According to the latest Polyanalgesic Consensus Conference for intrathecal drug delivery, the designation for the administration of spinal ketamine was as a 6-line adjuvant used in conjunction with other neuraxial analgesics in individuals with refractory cancer or other terminal chronic pain conditions. There is a current ban on the publication on the study of intrathecal analgesics that lacks adequate safety data in several of the top pain and anesthesia journals.
