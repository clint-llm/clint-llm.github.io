Patellofemoral syndrome treatment is usually conservative and targeted at pain reduction, improved patellar tracking, and return to their previous level of function. The treatments of the patellofemoral syndrome are divided into 2 main sections, the acute and the recovery phase. The acute phase involves activity modification, NSAID use, and other conservative modalities such as ice.Â  NSAIDs, specifically naproxen, have been shown to decreased overall pain when compared to aspirin and placebo; however, they are usually not recommended as a long-term treatment.
