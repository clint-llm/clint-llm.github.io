Pulmonic stenosis is a defect of the pulmonic valve in which the valve is stiffened, causing an obstruction to flow. This disease is typically congenital, benign, and diagnosed in pediatric patients with potentially curative treatments. Pulmonic stenosis is also present in adults, usually in conjunction with severe cardiac structural diseases.
