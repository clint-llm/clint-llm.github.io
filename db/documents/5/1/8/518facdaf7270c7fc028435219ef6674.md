The age-adjusted incidence of epilepsy in North America ranges between 16 out of 100,000 and 51 out of 100,000 person-years. The age-adjusted prevalence ranges from 2.2 of 1000 to 41 of 1000, depending on the reporting country. Partial epilepsy may constitute up to two-thirds of incident epilepsies. Incidence increases in lower socioeconomic populations.

About 25% to 30% of new-onset seizures are thought to be provoked or secondary to another cause.

Epilepsy incidence is highest in younger and older age groups and increases steadily after 50 years of age. The most common cause of seizures and epilepsy in older people is cerebrovascular disease.
