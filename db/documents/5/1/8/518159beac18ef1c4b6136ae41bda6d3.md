A diagnosis of reactive perforating collagenosis is mostly clinical with the recognition of classic histological findings. A punch biopsy is warranted for diagnosis. No lab or imaging studies are needed, and it is unlikely that they would be beneficial to the treatment or diagnosis of reactive perforating collagenosis. The differential diagnosis for reactive perforating collagenosis is similar to other perforating skin disorders. The differential can include folliculitis, arthropod bites, prurigo nodularis, multiple keratoacanthoma, and dermatofibroma. The physical and histologic findings, childhood-onset, and family history help distinguish reactive perforating collagenosis from the previous diseases.
