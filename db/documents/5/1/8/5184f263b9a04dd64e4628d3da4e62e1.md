Adverse effects of dextran are uncommon when appropriately administered. However, focal allergic reactions at the injection site or systemic anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions are possible: the presence of rash, hives, wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath should cue the healthcare provider to this possibility. Immediate discontinuation and emergency treatment with intravenous fluids and H1/H2 blockers, epinephrine, and steroids may be warranted in severe cases for supportive treatment and to prevent airway closure.
