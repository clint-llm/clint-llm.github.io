The frequency of MCÂ was historically described as 1:23,000 for autosomal dominant MC (Thomsen disease) and 1:50,000 for autosomal recessive MC (Becker disease). It is now acknowledged that the autosomal dominant form is, in fact, rarer than autosomal recessive MC. A United Kingdom study of 300 MC patients demonstrated that only 37% of this cohort possessed autosomal dominant mutations.
