An interprofessional team of anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists, surgeons, and perioperative nurses must understand the patient, anesthetic, and procedural risk factors predisposing patients to accidental awareness.

When patients experience accidental awareness, structured interviews should be performed, and referral for psychological support should be offered. [Level 3]
