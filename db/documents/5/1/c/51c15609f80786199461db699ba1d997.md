Aneuploidy of chromosome 12 (trisomy), 22 (monosomy), and deletion of chromosome 6 are detected in granulosa theca cell tumors. Cytogenetic studies report trisomy of chromosome 12 and deletion in chromosome 6q to be associated with juvenile GCT. BRCA1 and BRCA 2 mutations do not imply an elevated risk of GCT, even though some studies have identified a family history of breast or ovarian cancer to be a significant risk factor. A case-control study by Boyce et al. suggested an independent association between non-white race and obesity in the development of GCT. At the same time, parity and oral contraceptive use were found to be protective.

There are some tumor predisposition syndromes associated with GCT, such as Peutz Jeghers syndrome and Potters syndrome. Juvenile GCT seems to have an association with Ollier disease [enchondromatosis] and Maffucci disease. Certain medications, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM),Â  gonadotropins, and clomiphene citrate, have also been found to increase the risk of GCT.
