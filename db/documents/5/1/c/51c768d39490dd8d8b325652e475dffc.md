Immediately following repair of an aortic transection, medical management of blood pressure is paramount. This protects the new anastomoses from the stress of hypertension. Ongoing care for the remainder of the patientâ€™s traumatic injuries may continue. Since the advent of endovascular repair has only occurred in the last 10 to 15 years, there is limited long-term data on the thoracic stent-grafts. This may be a consideration when choosing to use endovascular therapy in young patients. After repair, CT angiograms are used for surveillance at 1, 6, and 12 months and annually after that.
