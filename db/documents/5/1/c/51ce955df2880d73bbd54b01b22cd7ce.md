Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes clinicians, specialists, oncology nurses, and pharmacists. This interprofessional approach has been shown to improve patient outcomes through collaborative effort and open communication. [Level 5]

Secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy should be actively entertained in the differential of bone and joint pain and new-onset clubbing in a patient with known malignancy, chronic lung disease, liver disease, or cyanotic heart disease. Reciprocally, a new diagnosis of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy based on clubbing, periostitis,Â and arthropathy should always trigger a search for a primary cause. As opposed to inflammatory arthritis, both the joint and the adjacent bone are involved. Rheumatoid factor is absent usually, and if the synovial fluid is aspirated, it is noninflammatory. A technetium bone scan is the diagnostic imaging of choice. Treatment is best achieved by definitive treatment of the primary pathology wherever possible. Where the primary disease is noncurative, symptom suppression is achieved at varying degrees with bisphosphonates, COX-2 inhibitors, octreotide, and certain anticancer chemotherapies that target fibroblastic growth factors.
