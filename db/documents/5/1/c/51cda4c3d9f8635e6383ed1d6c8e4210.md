Ketamine's main site action is a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor, though it exhibits effects on a myriad of other receptors. It acts as an antagonist at muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, blocks sodium and potassium channels, activates high-affinity D2 dopamine receptors and L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, and facilitates gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibition. Ketamine may also increase neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin in the brain.
