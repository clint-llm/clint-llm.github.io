Skeletal muscle consists of multiple muscle fascicules, and each fascicule is composed of multiple muscle fibers. A muscle fiber is a multinucleated cell containing myofibrils, structures responsible for muscle contraction, and an enfolding plasma membrane (sarcolemma). There are also three layers of associated connective tissues: endomysium surrounding each muscle fiber, perimysium between different muscle fascicules, and epimysium (the outermost layer) covering all fascicules. The epimysium is connected to tendon or aponeurosis that attaches muscle to the bone or occasionally to the skin or connective tissue.

- The motor unit is defined as a motor neuron (or anterior horn cell), its axon with all branches, neuromuscular junctions, and innervated muscle fibers. This is the basic anatomical structure from which signals are recorded during EMG.

- The number of muscle fibers within one motor unit varies from muscle to muscle. Usually, muscles with high precision control (hand muscles, extraocular muscles) have a high innervation ratio (fewer muscle fibers per motor unit), while low, precise control muscles (quadriceps, gastrocnemius) have a low ratio.

- The number of motor units, the density of fibers in a single unit, and their special distribution throughout the muscle contribute to needle electrode recordings during electrodiagnostic studies.

At rest, the normal muscle membrane has only resting potential; therefore, resting muscle EMG is “electrically silent.”   Only when the needle electrode is close to the neuromuscular junction can small normal endplate potentials be recorded.

When a motor neuron is activated, the action potential travels along the nerve and arrives at the neuromuscular junction, where after a series of electrochemical processes, depolarization of the muscle fiber occurs. The action potential then propagates along the sarcolemma by shifts in sodium and potassium ion-driven currents, generating a depolarizing electrical field along with adjacent membrane segments. Thus, activation of each motor neuron generates a motor unit action potential, consisting of the summation of individual muscle fiber action potentials within a single motor unit. Assessment of motor unit action potential parameters is an essential part of needle EMG evaluation.
