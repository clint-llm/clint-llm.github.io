NM QA is not limited to instruments and includes other factors that can reduce the overall diagnostic quality of acquired images. These factors include:

- Incorrect radiopharmaceutical administration techniques

- Incorrect radiopharmaceutical administration

- An issue with the labeling of radiopharmaceuticals such as failed production

- Pre-exam instructions not being followed by patients, especially in the setting of 18-F-FDG PET scans

- Patient movement during acquisition

- Injection of radiopharmaceuticals to the incorrect patient

All these factors can be avoided or minimized by following specific rules, which include:

- Confirming patient identity and the requested scan before injecting a radiopharmaceutical

- A radiopharmaceutical's QC results should be checked before administering it

- Ensure injection techniques are followed correctly as any tissue radiopharmaceutical can give an unnecessary radiation burden to the patient and degrade the overall image quality

- Proper explanation to the patient about the procedure to avoid any movement during the scan
