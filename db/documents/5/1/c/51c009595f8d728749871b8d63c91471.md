Osgood Schlatter disease, also known as osteochondrosis or traction apophysitis of the tibial tubercle, is a common cause of anterior knee pain in the skeletally immature athletic population.  Common sports seen in association with the condition include:

- Basketball

- Volleyball

- Sprinters

- Gymnastics

- Football

Clinical presentation classically associates atraumatic, insidious onset of anterior knee pain, with tenderness at the patellar tendon insertion site at the tibial tuberosity. The condition is self-limited and occurs secondary to repetitive extensor mechanism stress activities such as jumping and sprinting.  Pain level dictates overall treatment, and management includes symptomatic treatment with ice and NSAIDs, as well as activity modification and relative rest from inciting activities in association with lower extremities stretching regimen to correct underlying predisposing biomechanical factors.

Even though the disorder is benign, the recovery can be prolonged and cause absence from sports. The onset of the disorder is gradual and commonly associated with repetitive activities of the knee. There is usually tenderness over the tibial tubercle.
