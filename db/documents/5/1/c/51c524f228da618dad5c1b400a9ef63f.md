Treatment of nocturia should be directed to the underlying cause when possible. There is also a need for new treatments for nocturia that are safer and more effective than what is currently available.  Until then, combination therapy, using several of the previously described treatments as needed, is recommended to reduce nocturnal voidings to a more tolerable level.

With minimal effort, using the guidelines above, it is possible for an interprofessional team of nurses, physician assistants, and physicians to significantly reduce nocturia episodes in the overwhelming majority of affected patients.

Nocturia is a common and bothersome urinary symptom in many patients. It significantly affects sleep, daily activities, and overall living quality. It frequently remains unrecognized, inadequately treated, and poorly managed. Early identification of the problem, combined with proper treatment and closer cooperation between health care providers, can significantly improve outcomes and quality of life for patients.
