VKC episodes are known to be recurrent, with severe, often debilitating itching that prevents the patients from routine work. Thus, it is essential to educate the patients about the natural course of the disease. Steroids remain the mainstay for acute episodes and antihistaminic mast cell stabilizers or immunosuppressants for maintenance therapy. It is also essential to educate patients about the need to monitor intraocular pressures at regular intervals once started on topical steroids. Rarely, rehabilitation therapy in low vision aids might be needed in patients with severe vision-threatening sequelae.
