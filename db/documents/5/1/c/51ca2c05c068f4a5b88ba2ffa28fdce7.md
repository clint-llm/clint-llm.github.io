The blood supply to the fibula is from the fibular artery (also known as the peroneal artery) which has many small branches which supply the diaphysis. The epiphysis and the proximal fibular head are supplied by branches of the anterior tibial artery. The periosteum also receives numerous small branches from the fibular artery and supplies the rest of the bone. It is important to know the blood supply of the fibula because this bone is often used as a graft for reconstruction of the mandible.
