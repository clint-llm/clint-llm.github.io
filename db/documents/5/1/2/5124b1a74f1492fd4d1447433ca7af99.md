Salicylates are widely available over the counter medications. They are commonly used for their analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-thrombotic properties. Toxicity can occur due to acute ingestion or from chronic ingestions that result in an increased serum concentration. Salicylates can be compounded into formulations with other classes of medications including narcotics, antihistamines, and anticholinergic medications. This can complicate management.
