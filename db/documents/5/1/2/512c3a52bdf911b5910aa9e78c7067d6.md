Chalazia (plural of chalazion), are the most common inflammatory lesions of the eyelid. They are typically slowly enlarging, non-tender eyelid nodules. Chalazia are typically benign and self-limiting, though they can develop chronic complications. Recurrent chalazia should be evaluated for malignancy. This activity describes the cause, pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of chalazion and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of chalazion.
- Review the presentation of chalazion.
- Summarize the treatment options for chalazion
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by chalazion.
