High levels of PA have been shown to significantly improve maintenance of weight loss in patients with obesity or who are overweight. However, the clinical application of this fact is significantly more complex. Patients should be counseled that >250 minutes of exercise a week, in addition to calorie restriction, will help maintain weight loss.

Increased self-monitoring and patient responsibility are good predictors of adherence to PA programs and weight loss maintenance.
