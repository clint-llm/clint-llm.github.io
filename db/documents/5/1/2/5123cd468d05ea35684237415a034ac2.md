Intestinal injury is common in both blunt and penetrating abdominal trauma. Due to the potentially life-threatening nature of these injuries, providers should have a good understanding of the management of such injuries. The mechanism and location of injuries should guide the clinician when treating a patient who has sustained trauma to the abdomen. This activity discusses the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of intestinal trauma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of intestinal trauma.
- Review the evaluation of patients with intestinal trauma.
- Outline the management options available for patients with intestinal trauma. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of intestinal trauma and improve outcomes.
