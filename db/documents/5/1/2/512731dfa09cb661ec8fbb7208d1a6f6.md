Besides visual observation with a biomicroscope or a dermoscope, other tests that may be done are:

- Biopsy and histopathological analysis: the biopsy may be incisional or excisional.

- CT or MRI scans: These tests may be done to determine the size and extent of the lesion.

- Photography: This may be done to follow growth over time in lesions that are not removed.

- High-resolution ultrasound: a technique to analyze buried lesions that are deeper in the eyelid.
