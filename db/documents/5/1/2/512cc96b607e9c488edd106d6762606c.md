Patients should receive counseling regarding the risk of radiation exposure through myocardial perfusion imaging protocols. Radiation exposure typically is more in SPECT than in PET imaging. In SPECT imaging radiation dose can range from 10 to 20 mSv depending on the agent and protocol used (one day vs. two-day stress imaging). Agents used commonly used in PET imaging expose patients to less radiation especially, rubidium-82 and nitrogen-13 ammonia with typically less than 10 mSv of exposure.
