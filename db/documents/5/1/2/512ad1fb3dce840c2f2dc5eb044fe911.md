The first consultation for a patient with an Austin Flint murmur should be with a cardiologist. The cardiologist can medically manage the patient while they coordinate care with prompt referral to a cardiothoracic surgeon for evaluation of surgical aortic valve replacement. If the patient is not a candidate for a surgical aortic valve replacement due to an elevated STS score, an interventional cardiologist trained in structural heart disease should provide a consult to evaluate the patient for a transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
