Thermal energy is typically applied near or on the peripheral nerve origins along the levels of the spinal cord and is most often performed for chronic back and neck pain syndromes. It has been used for facet joint painÂ treatment, targeting the medial branch of the primary dorsal ramus. Additionally, it has been applied for discogenic back pain, targeting the ramus communicans. Further targets include the dorsal root ganglia for radicular back pain and lateral branch neve for sacroiliac disease. Less frequently, the literature demonstrates success in facial pain syndromes, thoracic pain, and anterior/posterior pelvic pain syndromes as well.
