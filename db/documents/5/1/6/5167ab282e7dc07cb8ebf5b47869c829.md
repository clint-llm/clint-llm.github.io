M cells are important for maintaining mucosal immunity function, particularly in the intestines. The immunologic reaction to many common intestinal pathogens, such as various Vibrio species, depends on initial uptake by M cells.RANKL deletion/modification due to its role in M cell development.

Numerous intestinal pathogens also exploit the function of M cells to gain entry into the sub-epithelium, notable ones being Shigella and Listeria. Salmonella has been noted to target and destroy M cells, to both gain further entry into sub-epithelial tissues and avoid immunologic processing.Yersinia intestinal infections appear to use M cells as their primary method of entry into lymphoid follicles. HIV appears to use M cells as a method to spread and infect T cells based in mucosal lymphoid tissues.

M cells are being explored as vaccine and drug routes. Mucosal administration of many drugs and vaccines are often cheaper and safer than other methods. This route of administration also has the added benefit of engaging both the mucosal and systemic immune responses. Several studies have shown an ability to use M cells specifically to administer vaccines/drugs; however, the exact role efficiency of this method is still being explored.
