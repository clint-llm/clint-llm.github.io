Postpartum depression most commonly occurs within 6 weeks after childbirth. PPD occurs in about 6.5% to 20% of women. It occurs more commonly in adolescent females, mothersÂ who deliver premature infants, and women living in urban areas. African American and Hispanic mothers reported onset of symptoms within 2 weeks of delivery, unlike Caucasian mothers, who reported onset of symptoms later as one study reports.
