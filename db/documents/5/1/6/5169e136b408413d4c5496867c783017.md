The superior rectus and the inferior rectus areÂ vertical rectus muscles. The medial and lateral rectus muscles are the horizontal rectus muscles. Each of the rectus muscles originates posteriorly at the annulus of Zinn and courses anteriorly.

Each of the rectus muscles inserts on the globe at varying distances from the limbus, and the curved line drawn along the insertion points makes a spiral that is known as the spiral of Tillaux. Starting at the medial aspect of the globe, the medial rectus inserts at 5.5 mm from the limbus, the inferior rectus inserts at 6.5 mm from the limbus, the lateral rectus inserts at 6.9 mm from the limbus, and the superior rectus at 7.7 mm from the limbus. The medial and lateral recti insert along the horizontal meridian, while the inferior and superior recti insert along the vertical meridian.

The superior rectus is 10.6 mm wide at its insertion on the globe. The tendon is 5.8 mm, measured from the origin. The entire length of the muscle is 41.8 mm.

Extraocular muscles have a large ratio of nerve fibers to skeletal muscle fibers. The ratio is 1:3 to 1:5; other skeletal muscles are 1:50 to 1:125. Extraocular muscles are a specialized form of skeletal muscle with a variety of fiber types, including both slow tonic types, which resist fatigue, and saccadic (rapid) type muscle fibers.
