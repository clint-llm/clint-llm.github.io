Common surgical considerations regarding the postcentral gyrus or structures near the postcentral gyrus, such as the precentral gyrus, posterior parietal lobe, or insula, include tumor resection surgery, brain mapping for treatment of seizures, and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Cancers that can manifest near the postcentral gyrus include gliomas, astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and meningiomas. Patients with lesions in the primary somatosensory cortex experience somatosensory deficits, especially in the hands and face.

Other surgical considerations involving the postcentral gyrus are the use of deep brain stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson disease. Patients with Parkinson disease undergo deep brain stimulation and dopaminergic therapy to correct motor deficits. The subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus internus are two common targets for deep brain stimulation to treat motor symptoms seen in Parkinson disease.
