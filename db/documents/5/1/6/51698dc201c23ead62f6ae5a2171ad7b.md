Several medications have been related to DIVHD. In 1967, anti-migraine drugs such as ergotamine and methysergide were associated with valvular insufficiency.

In 2002, pergolide and cabergoline, used for the treatment of Parkinson disease and hyperprolactinemia, were also related to valvular changes among their users.

Anorexigens such as fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, and phentermine, developed to suppress appetite and achieve weight reduction in obese patients, were also linked with human valvulopathies in several studies.

MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, commonly known as ecstasy), a substance that acts as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agent and mainly used as a recreational drug, was linked to valvular insufficiency in 2007. Development of valvulopathy was reported in eight (28%) people in the study who took MDMA, an average of 3.6 tablets of MDMA per week for six years compared to none in the control group. A correlation was observed between the dose of MDMA and severity of valvulopathy.
