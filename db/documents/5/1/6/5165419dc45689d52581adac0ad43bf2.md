Naturally, there is little that can be done to address non-modifiable risk factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, and gravidity. Measures can be taken to address other factors such as maintaining a normal BMI, smoking cessation, keeping active, and avoiding tight clothing proximal to the spider veins. There is some evidence to suggest that compression stockings may be of some benefit in preventing new spider veins from forming after treatment.
