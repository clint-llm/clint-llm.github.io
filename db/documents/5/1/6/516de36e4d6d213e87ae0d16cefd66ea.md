Methotrexate (MTX) is an anti-metabolite most commonly used in chemotherapy and immunosuppressant in auto-immune diseases. This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for Methotrexate as a valuable agent in treating a wide variety of neoplastic diseases. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional healthcare team in managing patients with cancer and auto-immune conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of methotrexate in chemotherapy as well as in autoimmune diseases.
- Identify the common and rare but serious adverse events associated with methotrexate use.
- Outline the typical presentations of methotrexate toxicity and how to manage it.
- Review the importance of patient education before starting treatment with methotrexate in any disease to sustain continuity of treatment and prevent morbidity to a greater extent and increase life expectancy in cancer patients.
