Ultimately, the clinical significance is dependent on patients' age, risk factors, and location of pathology. Should pathology involve the breast parenchyma, there is an expected increase in patient morbidity when compared to pathology involving the skin, dermal appendages, or adjacent musculoskeletal structures. This is why, after every biopsy, the patient's pertinent imaging is reviewed to include the biopsy and samples in conjunction with the pathologic report. In the event that the imaging features and the pathologic report are discordant further diagnostic workup is needed, usually in the form of repeated minimally invasive biopsy or surgical excisional biopsy.
