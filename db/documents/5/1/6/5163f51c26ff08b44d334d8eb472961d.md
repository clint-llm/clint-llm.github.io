It is the severity of spinal cord injury which determines the prognosis for recovery of function. The American Spinal Injury Association classifies spinal cord injury into complete spinal cord injury which includes the complete absence of sensory and motor function below the level of injury, and incomplete spinal cord injury in which a patient has partial sensory function, motor function, or both below the neurologic level of the injury. However, this distinction may not be possible to make until spinal shock has resolved, as patients in spinal shock may lose all reflexes below the area of injury. While a physician entertains a diagnosis of spinal cord injury, the following history and physical exam findings are pertinent to explore.

**History**

- The presence of midline pain

- A distracting injury that may take attention from the spinal area, for example, a rapidly bleeding open fracture

- Paresthesias, the older the child, the more likely the child will report these symptoms

- Loss of consciousness may indicate head trauma, but one must not be distracted in ruling out concomitant spinal cord injury

- Urinary or fecal incontinence indicate lower spinal level injury

**Physical Examination**

- Determine the mental status using the Glasgow coma scale

- Attempt to delineate the level of the spinal cord injury or level of sensory loss

- Test for proprioception or vibratory function to examine posterior column function

- The anogenital reflexes should be tested. If anogenital reflexes are preserved, an incomplete spinal cord injury is suspected despite complete sensory and motor loss. This evaluation should include bulbocavernosus reflex, anal wink reflex, cremasteric reflex, and rectal tone

- A careful evaluation of the entire spine should be performed even if a cervical injury is detected early

- It is important to perform a serial neurologic examination to document neurologic improvement or deterioration in patients with suspected or diagnosed spinal injuries

- Beware that children with cervical and high thoracic spinal cord injuries are also at risk for respiratory failure and neurogenic shock.

The following are incomplete spinal cord syndromes which have typical presentations.

Central cord syndrome is the most common incomplete spinal cord injury which manifests as symmetric incomplete quadriparesis. There is disproportionately greater motor impairment in upper compared to lower extremities, bladder dysfunction, and a variable degree of sensory loss below the level of injury. The typical mechanism is hyperextension injury. The hallmark of this condition is greater damage to the middle portion of the cord than to the periphery. It may be related to the somatotopic organization of the corticospinal tract within the spinal cord. The lamination of the corticospinal tract is organized with the most lateral being the sacral components and advancing medially with the lumbar, thoracic, and cervical components toward the central spinal canal. Professionals believe that injury seen in central cord syndrome predominantly involves white matter.

Anterior cord syndrome is characterized by complete motor paralysis and loss of pain and temperature sensation, with sparing of proprioception and vibration sensation. However, the motor loss is greater in the lower extremities than the upper extremities. The typical mechanism is hyperflexion and axial loading. In this scenario, damage primarily involves the anterior two-thirds of the spinal cord and therefore affects the corticospinal tract and spinothalamic tracts. This damage results in motor paralysis and loss of pain and temperature sensation. Proprioception and vibration are spared because the posterior third of the spinal cord containing the dorsal columns is not involved. This condition has a poor prognosis with only 10% to 15% of patients demonstrating functional recovery.

**Brown-Séquard syndrome**is characterized by ipsilateral hemiplegia, ipsilateral loss of proprioception, and contralateral loss of pain and temperature. This syndrome usually occurs due to penetrating trauma resulting in physiologic hemisection of the spinal cord. This injury affects the lateral half of the cord and frequently occurs in the cervical spine. This causes damage to the fibers within the descending lateral corticospinal tracts and the ascending dorsal columns. They both decussate in the medulla, resulting in ipsilateral hemiplegia and ipsilateral loss of proprioception, respectively.

**Posterior spinal cord syndrome
**is a type of injury in which there is a preservation of motor function, pain, and temperature, but proprioception and vibration sensations are lost below the level of the injury. The posterior portion of the spinal cord can be damaged either by direct trauma or because of a secondary injury involving the posterior spinal arteries. This syndrome is linked to injuries associated with hyperextension of the neck. Patients with this injury may ambulate, but since they lose proprioception and vibratory sensations, direct visualization of their feet is required during walking. Therefore, they may not be able to ambulate in the dark.

**Cauda equina syndrome**.Since cauda equina contains lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal nerve roots, injury to cauda equina causes peripheral nerve injuries. Although it is not a direct spinal cord injury, this entity still requires emergency neurosurgical intervention. The following clinical features may be present: bowel and/or bladder dysfunction, decreased rectal tone, asymmetric sensory loss in the lower extremities, weakness of the lower extremities, decreased lower extremity reflexes, and saddle anesthesia, which is characterized by sensory deficit over the perineum, buttocks, and inner thigh.

**Spinal shock **is the temporary loss of spinal reflex activity with motor and sensory losses. This loss results from loss of sympathetic vascular tone resulting in paradoxical bradycardia with hypotension. During spinal shock, patients appear physiologically completely paralyzed but may show significant recovery after the initial phases of spinal shock have resolved.
