Specific treatment will vary according to the etiology of the watery eye and coexisting exacerbating factors.

In general, when there is a problem with one of the tear film layers or in the distribution of the tears through the ocular surface, the condition may improve with medical management (such as using artificial tears and lubricating ointments). In cases of tearing due to eyelid laxity, lower eyelid tightening surgery is useful, although the effect does not always last.**.**

In the case of true epiphora, when the obstruction is a cause, surgical treatment is often required to restore drainage. The appropriate procedure is chosen based on the specific site of obstruction. Punctal stenosis is managed with perforated punctal plugs, punctoplasty or punctum dilatation, and positioning of a monocanalicular or bicanalicular stent.

- Punctoplasty consists of surgical enlargement of the punctum.

- Conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy bypasses the canaliculi and the lacrimal sac due to the creation of a new direct passage of tears from the conjunctiva to the nasal space with the help of bypass tubes.

- Dacryocystorhinostomy is a surgery that creates a direct passage from the canaliculi to the nasal space by incorporating the lacrimal sac with the nasal mucosa after removing the bone adjacent to the lacrimal sac.

- Dacryocystorhinostomy with retrograde intubation consists of performing an external dacryocystorhinostomy and, after identifying the common canalicular opening in the lacrimal sac, inserting a silicon tube from this common internal opening out to the punctum.
