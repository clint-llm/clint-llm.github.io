Selective IgA deficiency is a disorder that requires an interprofessional healthcare team to provide the best diagnostic process, management, and patient follow-up. Providers, including pediatricians and primary care providers, should be involved in the care of these patients. Specialist consultation from an allergist or immunologist may be required. Patients who have recurrent pulmonary infections will benefit from a consultation with a pulmonologist. Nurses should work with the team to educate these patients on the importance of vaccinations and compliance with antibiotics. Those with food allergies and malabsorption may benefit from a dietary consult.

Selective IgA deficiency is usually a lifelong disease. However, a few patients may have normal levels of IgA. In contrast, cases that progressed to CVID over time have also been recorded. These observations are valid, particularly for adolescence or young adulthood.
