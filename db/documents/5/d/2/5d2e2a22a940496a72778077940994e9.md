Bacterial vaginosis is a condition caused by an overgrowth of normal vaginal flora. Most commonly, this presents clinically with increased vaginal discharge that has a fish-like odor. The discharge itself is typically thin and either gray or white. After being diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis, women have an increased risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted infections (STI), and pregnant women have an increased risk of early delivery. This activity reviews the cause, presentation, and diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of bacterial vaginosis.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with vaginosis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for bacterial vaginosis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with bacterial vaginosis.
