The workup for sixth cranial nerve palsy depends on what cause is suspected.  An aggressive workup should be performed in children as there is a significantly higher risk of neoplasm as a primary cause. In the setting of abducens nerve palsy associated with trauma, neuroimaging should be performed at the time of injury. If there is a concern of elevated intracranial pressure as a cause, lumbar puncture should be performed. If the palsy is suspected to be an ischemic cause, MRI is recommended as the preferred modality because of its superior capability of imaging the posterior fossa.

Laboratory studies include a complete blood cell count, diabetes testing, erythrocyte sedimentation, and C-reactive protein to assess possible giant cell arteritis. Other laboratory studies to be considered include acetylcholine receptor antibodies if there is a concern for myasthenia gravis, rapid plasma reagin test, and fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test if there is a concern for syphilis, Lyme titer, thyroid function tests, and an antinuclear antibody test.
