Epidermal cysts are commonly encountered by the primary care provider, dermatologist, nurse practitioner, surgeon and the internist. While the majority of these cysts are benign, it is important to send the excised sample for evaluation to ensure that there is no malignancy.

When completely excised, the outcomes are excellent. However, recurrences are common in patients with genetic syndromes.
