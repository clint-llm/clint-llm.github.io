Pseudocholinesterase is a serine hydrolase enzyme primarily produced in the liver that catalyzes the hydrolysis of choline esters, most prominently succinylcholine and mivacurium.

In addition to possessing multiple names, the enzyme exists in many pharmacogenetic variations, with butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) operating as the primary human cholinesterase form. When comparing concentrations within the human plasma, the ratio of pseudocholinesterase (BuChE) to true cholinesterase (AChE) overwhelmingly favors BuChE by a ratio of 1000 to 1.
