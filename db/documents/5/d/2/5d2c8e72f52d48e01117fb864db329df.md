Like many other clinical pathologies, it is best to practice preventative measures to avoid scapular winging and try to treat it once it has manifested in symptoms. The course of clinical cases in winging of the scapula can persist for up to two years. Most patients eventually recover, but at least one-fourth may have residual pain.
