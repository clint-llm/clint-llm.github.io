Giant fornix syndrome (GFS) is a chronic disease involving recurrent conjunctivitis with abundant purulent discharge in elderly patients with abnormally deep fornices, particularly but not exclusively in the superior conjunctiva. Patients with GFS are in the older age bracket, almost exclusively above 65 years old. The diagnosis is one of exclusion, i.e., ruling out other common causes of chronic conjunctivitis. Treatment includes topical and systemic antibiotics, topical steroids, and conjunctival resection. Because of chronicity and recurrences, patients may be on prolonged medical treatment. Surgical treatment may be considered for severe cases. This activity explores the etiology, pathogenesis, diagnostic tools, best treatment, and prognoses for GFS.

**Objectives:**
- Discuss etiological theories for giant fornix syndrome.
- Describe potentially useful diagnostic testing for giant fornix syndrome, including laboratory tests and imaging.
- Update best practices for giant fornix syndrome treatment.
- Provide indications and contraindications for the treatment of giant fornix syndrome.
