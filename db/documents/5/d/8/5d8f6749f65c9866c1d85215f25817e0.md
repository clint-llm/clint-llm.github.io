Head lag is more prevalent in preterm infants up to term-equivalent age; contrarily,Â most full-term infants can maintain their head position during the pull-to-sit test.

One prospective study at Hadassah Medical Centre in Jerusalem, Israel, found that only 4% of full-term newborn infants had head lag on routine clinical examination. However, 20% of these infants with head lag had other risk factors, including vacuum delivery, probable sepsis, and congenital malformations. In the remaining 80% (i.e., the group without risk factors), 62.5% had mild head lag, and 37.5% had moderate to severe head lag.
