Patients should have screening during their annual examinations for signs or symptoms of incontinence. A thorough history and physical is the first step in the diagnosis. Evidence-based conservative behavioral modifications should always be attempted first, regardless if pharmacological or surgical management is a consideration. The patient may be satisfied with improved stress urinary incontinence if it avoids surgery, particularly in high-risk patients. Patients should understand that their symptoms of SUI have the highest cure rate with surgery but can improve with only behavioral or pharmacologic treatment. an interprofessional team approach is necessary with urogynecologists, pharmacists, urologists, nurses, and general gynecologists to coordinate the education of the patient and meet patient expectations to improve outcomes.
