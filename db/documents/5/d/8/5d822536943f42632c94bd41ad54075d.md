The true incidence of paraneoplastic syndromes is unknown, though older reports or those limiting assessment to classic immune antibody markers describe an incidence of paraneoplastic disease as 1 in 10,000 cases of malignancy (0.01%),Â with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes having an incidence of 0.86 per 100,000 and prevalence of 4.37 per 100,000 cases.

Paraneoplastic Encephalomyelitis (PEM) constitutes 10% of all encephalomyelitis cases.
