A kidney biopsy is required to establish the diagnosis of AIN affirmatively. Since in real-world practice, not all suspected AIN cases are biopsied either due to improvement in the renal function after stopping the offending agent or the condition is treated empirically, the true incidence of AIN is likely underestimated. According to large retrospective biopsy registries, AIN was present in 1% to 10% of all kidney biopsies, most of which were performed for suspected glomerulonephritis.

Among the biopsies performed specifically for AKI evaluation, the incidence of AIN was higher, ranging from 6.5% to 35%. Drug-induced AIN represents almost two-thirds of all cases of AIN. Infections (10% to 15%), systemic disorders (10% to 15%), and idiopathic causes (5% to 10%) account for the majority of the other causes of AIN. Elderly patients are more vulnerable to drug-induced AIN as compared to younger ones.
