Based on limited data from multiple studies (observation and prospective cohort) from China, France, Spain, United Kingdom, United States, Italy that evaluated long-term consequences of acute COVID-19, patients with acute COVID-19 who required admission to the ICU and/or ventilatory support were shown to be at increased risk of developing post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.

Patients with pre-existing pulmonary conditions, older age, obesity are considered to be at increased risk of developing post-acute COVID-19 syndrome.

Through the evolution of this global pandemic, it became increasingly clear that patients with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease(CKD), chronic cardiovascular disease, underlying malignancies, organ transplant recipients, and chronic liver disease are at increased risk for developing severe COVID-19. However, it is unclear if the prevalence of these comorbid conditions as risk factors in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome is yet to be established.

Female patients recovering from COVID-19 were more prone to develop symptoms of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, especially fatigue, anxiety, and depression at 6-month follow-up.

Data evaluating racial and ethnic consideration in post-acute COVID-19 syndrome is limited. Halpin et al.,Â in their study evaluating post-COVID-19 symptoms 4 to 8 weeks after hospital discharge, noted that 42.1% of Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) participants reported moderate to severe breathlessness compared with 25% of white patients.
