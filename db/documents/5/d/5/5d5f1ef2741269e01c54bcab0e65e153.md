Specimen collection requirements are dependent on the procedure or test requested. Generally, for serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN)   levels, no additional patient preparation is required, and a random blood sample suffices.  However, the effect of recent high protein ingestion may increase serum creatinine and urea levels to a significant extent. Also, hydration status can have a considerable impact on BUN measurement.

For timed urine collections such as the 24-hour urine creatinine clearance, it is essential that urine be collected accurately over the required period as under or over collection will affect final results. Hence, a 5 to 8-hour timed collection is preferable to a 24-hour collection.

The collection of midstream urine for urine analysis is required as this sample is less likely to be contaminated by epithelial cells and commensal bacteria.
