A cardiac PET scan is a pretty safe procedure in the contemporary era. Radiation exposure and radiation-related adverse reaction is the only considerable complication of PET scan. Although the initial three-dimensional PET/CT technology was associated with significant radiation exposure, the advances in image acquisition and new software methods offer dose reduction in cardiac PET imaging. The newer PET software allows the reconstruction of both the relative myocardial perfusion and absolute myocardial blood flow data from the same scan. Due to the increased sensitivity of PET, it is now possible to obtain high-qualityÂ perfusion images at doses as low as 20 mCi.
