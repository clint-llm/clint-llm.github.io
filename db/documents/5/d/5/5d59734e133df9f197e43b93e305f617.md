The diagnosis and management of carotid contusion is not easy and hence the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, neurologist, trauma surgeon, vascular surgeon and the emergency department physician. The treatment of carotid artery contusion depends on patient stability, the presence of symptoms, other organ damage, and comorbidities. Before any specific treatment can take place, the patient must be treated like any trauma patient and stabilized. Undiagnosed or mismanaged cervical injuries secondary to neck trauma can result in a mortality rate of greater than 15%.  The treatment of carotid artery contusion varies from observation to heparinization, to open embolectomy. If the external carotid artery is involved, then conservative measures are adequate.

All symptomatic patients need to be monitored in an ICU setting. Nurses looking after the patient should perform neurovitals and know the symptoms of a stroke. Some patients with carotid contusion may require surgery. The outcomes for most patients with carotid contusion are good but in patients with a neurological deficit, recovery may not always be possible.
