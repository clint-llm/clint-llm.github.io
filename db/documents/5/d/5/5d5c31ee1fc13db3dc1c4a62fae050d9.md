Recovery after surgery varies, but typically four to six weeks should be expected for arthroscopy and approximately three months for an open approach. Patients will undergo physical therapy after the procedure. The exact time to begin physical therapy and the length of physical therapy depends on the type of surgery performed and the surgeon’s preference.

If an osteotomy is performed to shorten the ulna, patients are immobilized for approximately 4 weeks before they begin range of motion exercises. One way to determine when to start strength exercises is by grip strength. Estimations are that grip strength is 10% higher in the dominant hand. When grip strength is 80% of the expected normal, the athlete can begin strengthening exercises and gradually return to play. If the surgery is performed on the throwing arm, an elite athlete may be able to return to play in 8 to 12 weeks. If the surgical intervention is on the non-throwing arm, return to play in 6 to 8 weeks is possible.
