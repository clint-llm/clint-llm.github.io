The gross appearance of papillary fibroelastoma is classically described as a "sea anemone" with a central stalk and frond-like arms projecting outward. In vivo, these tumors can be as small as 2 mm with a mean of 9 mm and range up to several cm in maximal dimension. Histologically, the composition of PFEs is primarily collagen, elastin, and reticulin, with very little vasculature.
