**Subfalcine Herniation**

Owing to the anatomical organization of the brain within a fixed compartment (the bony cranium) and subdivided by dural reflections (the falx cerebri and tentorium cerebelli), it is vulnerable to damage from an increase in intracranial pressure (ICP).

The most common brain herniation syndrome is subfalcine herniation, in which raised ICP forces a cerebral hemisphere to the opposite side of the cranium, forcing the cingulate gyrus beneath the free edge of the falx cerebri.

**Schizophrenia**

Given the complexity of higher cognitive functions and the extensive connections of the cingulate cortex with other brain regions, it is not surprising that it plays a role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, a finding which has been confirmed in post-mortem anatomical studies.
