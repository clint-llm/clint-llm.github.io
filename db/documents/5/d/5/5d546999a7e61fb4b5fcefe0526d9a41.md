After ingestion or topical application, 5-FU enters cells via a facilitated transport mechanism and is converted to fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP). FdUMP complexes with the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS), inhibiting the production of the compound deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP). dTMP is essential for DNA replication and repair, and depletion of this compound results in an imbalance of intracellular nucleotides leading to double-stranded breaks in DNA by the enzyme endonuclease.

5-FU exhibits other mechanisms of action that include interference with RNA processing and increasing p53 expression.
