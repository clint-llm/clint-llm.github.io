Patients with simple partial seizures should have the same education concerning epilepsy as those individuals with other seizure types.Â Education should not be limited only to the patients, but also to family members and caretakers. Although the conscious level is intact in simple partial seizures precautions regarding aspiration should be taken. Certain lifestyle modifications can help to control seizures and these include; avoiding triggers, taking plenty of sleep, and a ketogenic diet. Regular follow-up is mandatory and checking antiepileptic drug levels in the blood is also necessary.
