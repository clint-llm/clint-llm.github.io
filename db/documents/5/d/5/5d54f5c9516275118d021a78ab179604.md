Angioneurotic edema can be classified into two main categories, such as allergic and non-allergic angioneurotic edema. Non-allergic angioneurotic edema can be subclassified into hereditary, i.e., C1-esterase-inhibitor deficiency (HANE), acquired (AANE), drug-induced and idiopathic ANE. Type 1 and 2 hereditary ANE are autosomal dominant disorders due to mutations in the gene encoding for C1-inhibitor.

Angiotensinogen converting enzymes inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin-2 antagonists, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), oral contraceptive pills (OCPs), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and vaccines are common causes of drug-induced ANE. Acquired ANE can be caused by serious and/or chronic illnesses such as lymphoproliferative disorders, autoimmune disease, neoplastic conditions, and infections. ANE can be precipitated by any type of surgery, viral infection, exposure to heat and cold, pregnancy, minor trauma (e.g., dental work, tongue piercing), mental stress, and ingestion of certain foods.
