Due to the recent differentiation of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) from other AAVs, widespread data regarding its demographic factors in the American population is not available yet. One study conducted in Rochester, Minnesota, over a period of 20 years estimated the annual incidence of AAV to be 3.3 per 100,000 with a prevalence of 42.1 per 100,000. The incidence of GPA and MPA were approximately 1.5 per 100,000.

Overall the incidence of MPA is more significant in southern Europe as opposed to northern Europe; for instance, the incidence in Norway is 2.7 per million but increases to 11.6 per million in Spain.

**Race**

MPA is more common in the White than Black population.

**Age**

The median age of onset is 50 years.

**Sex**

The disease is more prevalent among males.
