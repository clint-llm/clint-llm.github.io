More than 90% of affected individuals show malformations of the great toes at birth but otherwise appear normal with normal joint mobility. In the first decade of life, heterotopic ossification starts, and a majority of the cases of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva develop inflammatory soft tissue swellings which are episodic, painful, and may show flare-ups.

Joint disability sets in the third decade of life due to the fusion of the heterotopic bones formed in the soft tissue with the normal bones, thus fixing the joints.
