Bacterial transposons belong to two classes: compound transposons (class I) and complex transposons (class II). A class I transposon contains a copy of an insertion sequence (IS) at each end. At its ends, a class II transposon has two equal sequences of 30/40 pairs of nucleotides each, arranged in the opposite orientation.

The transposition can be replicative or non-replicative. In non-replicative transposition, there is a cut of the double helix to the original site before the transposon moves. In other cases, the transfer takes place without cutting the double helix to the site of origin (conservative transposition). In the replicative transposition, as a consequence of the replication, there will be a copy of the transposon at the insertion site and another at the origin site, without any cut of the double helix. This process will lead to the formation of an intermediate called co-integrated.
