Patients who develop abscesses may present to their primary care provider's office, the emergency department, outpatient surgery office, etc. Depending on the size, location, and patient comorbidities, the provider should assess and refer the patient to an appropriate specialist for definitive care. Interpersonal communication is important for handoff as the patient is sent to the experienced provider for care.

If any laboratory testing or additional objective/historical data is obtained, it should be sent to the provider who the patient ultimately seeks for definitive treatment. Proper and complete communication will enhance patient-centered care, decrease the likelihood of adverse outcomes, and facilitate a quicker recovery. Patients may require close follow-up and local wound care, but this is case-specific. Home health nursing is a popular option for patients to receive close monitoring at home.
