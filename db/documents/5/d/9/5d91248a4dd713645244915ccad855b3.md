Complications of peripheral nerve blocks are rare. There is always a risk that a peripheral nerve block will be unsuccessful. Certain complications are more common in certain anatomical locations (see techniques above). Known complications of peripheral nerve blocks include the following:

- Nerve root injury

- Paresthesias

- Intrathecal or epidural injection of the anesthetic agent

- Traumatic injury to surrounding structures, including blood vessels and musculature

- Pneumothorax

- Infection with or without abscess formation

- Local anesthetic toxicity, with central nervous system and cardiovascular compromise
