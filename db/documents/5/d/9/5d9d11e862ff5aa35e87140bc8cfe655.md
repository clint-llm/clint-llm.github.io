Both genetic and environmental factors play a role in keloid development. Predisposed individuals may develop a keloid following any level of skin trauma including surgery, piercings, acne, tattooing, insect bites, burns, lacerations, abrasions, vaccinations, and any other process resulting in cutaneous inflammation. Increased tension in a wound also may contribute to keloid formation.
