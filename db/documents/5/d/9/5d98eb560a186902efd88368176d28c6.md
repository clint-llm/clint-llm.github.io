Osteopetrosis is most frequently diagnosed based on the patient having the typical clinical and radiographic findings of the disease.

Radiographs will show diffuse osteosclerosis throughout the skeleton with a “marble bone” appearance. There will generally be increased cortical thickness with associated decreased medullary canal diameter. The “Erlenmeyer flask” deformity can be found at the metaphyses of long bones, particularly at the proximal humerus and the distal femur. A “bone-in-bone” or “endobone” appearance most frequently is noted in the bones of the spine or the hand phalanges. “Rugger jersey spine” is another axial skeleton radiographic finding that can occur secondary to excessive sclerosis of the vertebral endplates.

If clinical and radiographic findings do not yield a diagnosis, laboratory findings of increased creatinine kinase BB and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase can aid in diagnosis.

Genetic testing can also be performed to evaluate for the presence of the gene mutations associated with the condition.
