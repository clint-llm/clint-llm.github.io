Atheroembolic renal disease occurs in patients with systemic generalized atherosclerosis. Risk factors include older age, male gender, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking. These patients frequently have coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal artery stenosis, renal insufficiency, aortic aneurysm, or other similar atherosclerotic diseases.

The reported incidence ranges between 1.1% and 4.5% because of different study designs and criteria for diagnosis.

The exact prevalence of atheroembolic renal disease is unknown and it is an underdiagnosed condition.
