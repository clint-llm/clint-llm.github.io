Severe burn injuries trigger a hypermetabolic response with the activation of the complement system and the release of inflammatory and vasoactive mediators. These mediators increase local and systemic capillary permeability, rapidly displacing intravascular fluids, electrolytes, and plasma proteins into the interstitium. The extensive capillary leak results in large fluid shifts, intravascular fluid depletion, and significant burned and non-burned tissue edema. This response can begin within minutes and rapidly transpires over the first 24 hours after the injury: maximum intravascular hypovolemia and edema formation peak at about 8 to 12 hours post-injury.

Massive systemic fluid loss, accompanied by decreased cardiac output and increased vascular resistance, eventually leads to critical hypoperfusion and subsequent tissue injury. This phenomenon, known as “burn shock,” is a combination of distributive, hypovolemia, and cardiogenic shock and is treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation. Fluid management in severe burn injuries aims to maintain tissue perfusion and prevent end-organ ischemia in the earliest phases of burn shock. Prompt and adequate fluid resuscitation has consistently decreased morbidity and mortality in victims of severe burns. This improvement in outcomes has led to the development of many resuscitation protocols that aid in calculating initial fluid requirements.
