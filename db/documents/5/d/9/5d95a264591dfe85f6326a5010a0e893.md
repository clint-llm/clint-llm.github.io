The medical community should understand the personal and familial anxiety that a murmur classification brings. In the setting of such benign findings, clinicians should strive for better nomenclature of such benign findings as to not increase anxiety and to decrease unnecessary investigation by perhaps renaming “benign murmurs” as innocent flow sounds or benign heart sounds. This might ease the minds of our patients’ and their families and would allow them to participate in everyday activities without impending concerns of possible underlying heart disease in addition to reducing health care costs.
