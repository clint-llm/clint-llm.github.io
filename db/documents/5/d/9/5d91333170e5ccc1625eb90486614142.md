The thyroid gland is the embryonically the earliest endocrine structure to appear in human development and appears at embryonic day 22 in humans. The thyroid gland originates from the endoderm. Specifically, it derives from a median endodermal down-growth from the tongue.

After embryogenesis, the physiology of the thyroid is under the control of the requirement for thyroid hormones and the supply of iodide. Thyroid hormone plasma levels and action are monitored by hypothalamic supraoptic nuclei and thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary. The expression of transcription factors NK2 homeobox and paired box (PAX 8) are crucial for the proper expression of proteins creating the thyroid gland.
