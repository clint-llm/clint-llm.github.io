Nummular dermatitis is a pruritic inflammatory dermatosis seen most commonly in middle-aged adults. Many potential triggers have been identified, yet the etiology remains incompletely understood. Although it follows a benign course, nummular dermatitis can negatively impact patients' quality of life commensurate with its severity. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of nummular dermatitis and explains the healthcare team's role in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify potential triggers of nummular dermatitis.
- Summarize the distribution and morphologic patterns of nummular dermatitis.
- Review potential adjunctive tests and management options available for nummular dermatitis.
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination to improve outcomes for patients with nummular dermatitis.
