Before surgery, the patient has typically been evaluated by an emergency room or trauma provider to stabilize other injuries, if present. Intraoperative personnel includes the opthalmologist, orbital surgeon (an ophthalmologist trained in oculoplastic and orbital surgery, an otolaryngologist, or an oral and maxillofacial surgeon), first (and possibly, second) surgical assistant, anesthesia provider, operating room nurse, and surgical technician.
