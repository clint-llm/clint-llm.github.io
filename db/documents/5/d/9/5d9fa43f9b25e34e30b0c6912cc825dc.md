Airway suctioning is routinely done in most care settings, including acute care, sub-acute care, long-term care, and home settings. Suctioning is performed when the patient is unable to effectively move secretions from the respiratory tract. This may occur with excessive production of secretions or ineffective clearance, which leads to the accumulation of secretions in the upper and lower respiratory tract. This can lead to possible airway obstruction and ineffective airflow. This ultimately leads to an impaired exchange of gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide, which is necessary for optimal cellular function.
