If masses are noted in the external auditory canal on the otoscopic exam, there are several differential diagnoses to consider. These include EAE, osteomas, cholesteatoma, keratosis obturans, aural polyps, and tumors.

On exam alone, it can be challenging to distinguish EAE from osteomas. The patient history helps to make this clinical distinction. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for EAE if the patient has a history of repeated cold water emersion. External auditory exostoses are generally bilateral and multinodular. Osteomas are most commonly pedunculated, singular, unilateral, and positioned laterally in the ear canal.

A cholesteatoma is a cystic mass of keratinized squamous epithelium located in the middle ear.

Aural polyps are benign fleshy growths in the external auditory meatus or inner ear.
