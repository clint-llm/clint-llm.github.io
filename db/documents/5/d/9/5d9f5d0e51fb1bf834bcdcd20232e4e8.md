Patients should have protection from further injury by covering exposed areas. The care of patients with frostbite begins with rewarming in the field if there is no anticipation of refreezing, as thaw-refreezing may worsen injuries.

In-hospital management includes warm water baths, approximately 40-42 degrees C. Patients with systemic hypothermia should be managed by raising core temperature above 35 degrees C using warm IV fluids, and this should precede warming of the affected extremity.

Although controversial, some sources recommend drainage or excision on white, cloudy-appearing blisters, while hemorrhagic blisters should be left intact. As with burn patients, particular care to prevent infections and dehydration should be a priority. Overly aggressive surgical debridement may remove skin that is otherwise viable, so complete rewarming should be achieved before surgical debridement. Signs of compartment syndrome (edema, pulselessness, extreme pain) should prompt urgent surgery. Delayed amputation (up to 6 weeks following injury) until the determination of tissue viability may prevent surgical morbidity from unnecessary procedures.

Patients with full-thickness injuries and evidence of ischemia and no restoration of tissue perfusion after rewarming may be candidates for thrombolytic (tPA) therapy.
