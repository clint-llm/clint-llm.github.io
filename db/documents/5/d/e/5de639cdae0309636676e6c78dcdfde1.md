Cognitive decline affects many individuals above the age of 60. Mild cognitive impairment and dementia, commonly Alzheimer dementia, can affect many cognitive domains and negatively impact the quality of life. A geriatric evaluation can differentiate normal aging and age-related cognitive decline. This activity describes the assessment, treatment, and management of cognitive decline and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, treating, and managing the patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the steps in the geriatric evaluation.
- Review the etiology of age-related cognitive decline.
- Outline the examination findings in geriatric patients with age-related cognitive decline.
- Summarize the management of age-related cognitive decline.
