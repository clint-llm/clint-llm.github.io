Diphenhydramine competes against histamine to bind to H1-receptor sites on effector cells in the respiratory tract, blood vessels, gastrointestinal tract, and CNS. Within the CNS, diphenhydramine can occupy, even at therapeutic doses, H1-receptors in the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, hippocampus, and pons. This can lead to significant sedation and can produce moderate to severe neurological and respiratory signs/symptoms characterized by intoxication and overdose.
