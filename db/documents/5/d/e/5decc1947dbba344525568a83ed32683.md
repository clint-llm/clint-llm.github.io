Educating dentists, oral surgeons, and primary care physicians on the benign course, reactive nature, diagnosis, management, and oral melanoacanthoma treatment is essential. It will relieve clinicians' and patients' stress when a pigmented lesion arises in the oral cavity, particularly when there is an inciting factor or irritant.

The primary care physician sometimes may first see pigmented lesions; timely referral to a dentist or an oral or head and neck surgeon for a biopsy is essential since the clinical appearance of oral melanoacanthoma is nondiagnostic.Nonetheless, the lesion does not require treatment, and elimination or cessation of local irritants and periodic follow-ups are the recommended interventions.

Educating patients about the importance of letting their dentist or primary care clinician know about any new pigmentation in the mouth is essential and coordinating for follow-up exams until the lesion is resolved.
