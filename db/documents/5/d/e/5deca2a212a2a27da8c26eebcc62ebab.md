Diagnosis of a concussion remains an exclusively clinical diagnosis based on history and exam findings. However, there is no single pathognomonic finding or a minimum number of symptoms for diagnosing a concussion. Several standardized diagnostic tools can be employed in the pre-hospital setting following an acute head injury to assist in determining the presence of a concussion. The Sideline Concussion Assessment Tool 5 (SCAT5) is one of the most commonly used tools for a concussion assessment, particularly by athletic trainers and sports medicine providers to assess athletes on the sideline after a potential head injury. The Child SCAT-5 exists for the assessment of patients between 5 and 12 years of age.

Imaging modalities can be employed to rule out other injuries that may mimic the signs or symptoms of a concussion. In the hospital, a CT scan of the head is the radiographic study of choice for a quick evaluation to exclude neurosurgical emergencies.

If the symptoms are prolonged for more than seven days, consider an MRI, which offers more details.

Two serum biomarkers that show promise include ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase and glial fibrillary acidic protein, which appear to be elevated early in the post-injury phase.
