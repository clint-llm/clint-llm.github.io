An ultrasound machine with transabdominal and transvaginal transducers is required. Transducers of 3.5 Mhz or more are used for transabdominal scans, whereas transducers of 5MHz or more are used for transvaginal scans. In recent years, 3D ultrasound has shown value in performing SIS and assessingÂ AFC and ovarian volumes.
