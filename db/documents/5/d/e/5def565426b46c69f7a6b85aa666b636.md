Overdosing on ACE inhibitors may lead to significant hypotension, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia.

As per the manufacturer label, hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis may only have little effect on the elimination of quinapril and its metabolite. Angiotensin II can be used as a specific antidote in the setting of quinapril overdose. However, it is only available in research facilities. As quinapril causes hypotension through vasodilation and effective hypovolemia, the infusion of the normal saline solution may help during the treatment of quinapril overdose.
