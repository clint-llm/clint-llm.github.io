Endovascular repair of aortic coarctation and the timing of this intervention is an important factor in the overall outcome of the patient. Early intervention, especially in the younger population, is associated with a diminished risk for the development of late hypertension and improved survival. Even though there are diminished survival and higher prevalence of development of late hypertension with individuals repaired later on in life, there is still benefit in these cases with endovascular repair. Coarctation repair improves the feasibility of medical management of blood pressure and allows for a decreased amount of pharmacotherapy to control hypertension. On account of the known benefits of repair and improved technologies facilitating endovascular repair, early intervention in childhood has become the common practice. The downside of this is the extensive follow-up and further re-intervention in the future.
