Patient education and a more conservative approach can prevent chronic tendinopathy

- A change to another sport (swimming, weight training, rowing, cycling) allows the tendon to rest

- Eccentric exercise therapy (exercises that cause stretching combined with the contraction of a muscle) decreases pain and prevents chronicity

- Scientific evidence supports many conservative treatments, such as the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen)

- The choice of running shoes that provide enough cushioning for the heel strike

- A warm-up exercise routine, and stretching the calf muscles before playing sports

- Gradually increasing the distance and running speed by only 10% per week, avoid running unhurriedly, running on slopes, and cooling properly after exercise

- Extracorporeal shock wave therapy may help

- Moreover, surgery is usually the last resort if recovery is prolonged
