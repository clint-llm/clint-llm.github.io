Patients with transplantation osteoporosis may present with bone pain, low impact fractures, or bone deformities. Transplant recipients are usually not evaluated and treated for osteoporosis in current clinical practice. Hence when a history of transplantation is present, a high index of suspicion for osteoporosis and related fractures should be present that would potentially aid in the diagnosis.
