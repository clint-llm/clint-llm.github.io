The adrenal glands are retroperitoneal structures, bilaterally located superior to the kidneys. They are highly vascularized organs. Adrenal glands have a couple of anatomically and physiologically separated segments, including cortex and medulla. The former one has three distinguished layers; glomerulosa, fasciculata, and reticularis, responsible for secreting aldosterone, cortisol, and androgens, respectively. They consequently regulate homeostasis. The second segment, medulla, mainly secretes epinephrine and norepinephrine, which are hormones essential during stress episodes.
