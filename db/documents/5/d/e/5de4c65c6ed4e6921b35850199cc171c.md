Management skills in the healthcare setting are composed of sets of competencies essential for healthcare professionals who effectively and efficiently manage a variety of medical, nursing, or public health resources to attain goals that ideally align with improving the overall health of the population and healthcare system.

In this activity, healthcare professionals who manage at any level of the health systems serve as healthcare managers, encompassing a wide range of specialties, including physicians (clinicians, surgeons, public health physicians, and other specialists), nurses, laboratory professionals, public health managers, dentists, among other healthcare professions.

As expressed in references both for theoretical and practical guidance documents, management skills are often separated from leadership skills as these two sets of skills were known to be generally different.
