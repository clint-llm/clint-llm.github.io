Congenital ptosis is associated with maldevelopment of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle.

- **Simple congenital ptosis:**Idiopathic in origin.

- **Congenital ptosis along with superior rectus muscle weakness:**often termed double-elevator palsy

- **Marcus Gunn Jaw-winking ptosis (congenital synkinetic ptosis):**the external pterygoid's motor innervation is misdirected to supply the ipsilateral levator muscle. With mastication, the ipsilateral eyelid elevates.

- **Blepharophimosis Syndrome:**This syndrome comprises blepharophimosis, congenital ptosis, epicanthus inversus, and telecanthus.

- Other less common causes of congenital ptosis include:

- Third cranial nerve palsy
- Horner Syndrome: characterized by mild ptosis, miosis, anhidrosis, ipsilateral heterochromia of the iris.
- Secondary to birth trauma
- Periorbital tumors like plexiform neurofibromatosis, neuroblastoma, lymphoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroma leukemias can induce mechanical ptosis.
- Pseudotumor of the orbit- ptosis induced by inflammatory disease of the orbit and secondarily affects the eyelids.
