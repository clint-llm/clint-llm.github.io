Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma,  accounting for about 25% to 30% of all non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This disease presents as a rapidly growing mass or enlarging lymph nodes in a nodal or extranodal site. Though aggressive, it does respond well to chemotherapy. It can affect many organ systems and is best managed by an interprofessional team, including the medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and nephrologists. Radiation therapy can be needed in extranodal lymphomas.

Kidney involvement has been well documented in patients with lymphoma. It is important to get the nephrologist involved early in the course of the disorder as renal failure is a complication of DLBCL itself, or renal failure can manifest during treatment. Careful assessment of the renal indices, including acid-base, electrolytes, and volume status, should be assessed.
