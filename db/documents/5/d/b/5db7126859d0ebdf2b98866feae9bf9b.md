The concentration of solutes is high inside cells as compared to the extracellular space. In water toxicity, with excessive ingestion of water, this excess water migrates to the site with increased solute concentration owing to diffusion. Thus the amount of intracellular water increases, causing the cells to swell. In the CNS, the swollen neurons increase the intracranial pressure which leads to the symptoms of confusion, lethargy, headache, and drowsiness. Further, an increase in ICP may cause bradycardia and hypertension.
