The use of anticoagulation for the prevention of stroke is a risk-vs-benefit assessment. Patients initiated on anticoagulation should not be bridged with unfractionated heparin or LMWH, as there is an increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation and ischemic recurrence. Furthermore, for patients with severe stroke (NIHSS score over 8), a longer delay in initiation of anticoagulation may be reasonable.

Patients at increased risk of bleed, where risk is greater than benefit, should most likely avoid anticoagulation. There are unresolved questions, yet anticoagulation is unsuitable in patients who have severely impaired renal function, severely impaired liver function, and severe and symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation, such as parenchymal hematoma.
