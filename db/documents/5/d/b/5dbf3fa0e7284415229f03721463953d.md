Genetic counseling is important for genetic cystic kidney diseases such as ADPKD and ARPKD.

Young ADPKD patients can be asymptomatic until the appearance of complications such as hypertension and renal failure. Early identification can prevent these complications by following a healthy lifestyle, such as visiting the doctor regularly, restricting salt, and exercising regularly.
