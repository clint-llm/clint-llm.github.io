CMNsÂ are usually diagnosed by their clinical appearance. Examination with dermatoscopy or biopsy for histology may be used in cases of diagnostic doubt.

Dermatoscopy evaluation most commonly reveals globular pigmentation patterns, while structureless, reticular, or mixed patterns may occur.

Tissue biopsy may be used as a means of ruling out malignant differential diagnoses through histopathological assessment.
