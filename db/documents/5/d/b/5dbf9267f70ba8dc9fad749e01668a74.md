Hydrochlorothiazide inhibits sodium chloride transport in the distal convoluted tubule. More sodium is then excreted in the kidney with accompanying fluid. Pharmacological effects begin in about 2 hours after an oral dose, peak in 4 hours, and lasts for about 6 to 12 hours. Hydrochlorothiazide is not metabolized, and a majority is excreted in the urine unchanged.Â It also causes a loss of potassium and bicarbonate.

The long-term actions of hydrochlorothiazide when it comes to reduction in blood pressure are not well understood. When administered acutely, the drug does lower blood pressure by promoting diuresis and decreasing plasma volume. However, following chronic use, hydrochlorothiazide appears to be reducing blood pressure by decreasing peripheral resistance. How the drug causes vasodilation is not known, but laboratory evidence suggests that it may be inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, desensitizing the smooth muscle receptors to the rise in calcium, or preventing autoregulation in the kidneys.
