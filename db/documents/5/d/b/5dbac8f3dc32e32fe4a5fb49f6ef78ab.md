With advanced age, degenerative MV disease is the most common cause of MR. MVr is the gold standard for degenerative MR and is the recommendation of the current guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease. The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend that surgery take place before LV dysfunction (class IIa) in experienced centers. Mitral regurgitation imposes significant volume overload on the LV, leading to permanent structural and functional deterioration of the myocardium and subsequent heart failure. Timely correction of MR is paramount to the preservation of cardiac function. MIMVS and transcatheter MVr technologies have been instrumental in allowing repair of MV pathology in high-risk patients who are not appropriate for open-heart surgery.
