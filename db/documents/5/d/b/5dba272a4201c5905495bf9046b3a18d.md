Capillary hemangiomas (infantile hemangiomas, juvenile hemangiomas, hemangioblastomas, or strawberry nevi of infancy) are common benign orbital neoplasms in children. Hemangiomas are benign tumors that arise de novo and undergo clonal proliferation and growth out of proportion to the patient. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of capillary infantile hemangiomas and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of capillary infantile hemangiomas.
- Describe the clinical features of superficial, deep, and mixed lesions of capillary infantile hemangiomas.
- Review the use of ultrasound, CT scan, and MRI in the evaluation of capillary infantile hemangiomas.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by capillary infantile hemangiomas.
