MGD is a very commonly prevalent disorder. Careful history taking and thorough examination can help early diagnosis, even in the asymptomatic stage. The patient may present for a routine check-up or complaints like blurred vision, irritation, soreness or redness of eyes, ocular pain.

Patients, especially those with refractive errors and wearing contact lenses, might often present to optometrists. Thus, optometrists must be aware of disease evaluation and management basics. Optometrists and general ophthalmologists should evaluate and diagnose this condition early and initiate timely treatment. Patients should be advised to choose management options like eyelid hygiene, warm compresses, and manual gland expression once diagnosed with MGD. Patients presenting late or with advanced stages should ideally be started on essential management and referred to an ocular surface or cornea specialist for further management.
