Gradual onset of symptoms combined with extrapulmonary involvement and a normal WBC count points to atypical pneumonia. Most patients with M. pneumoniae pneumonia present in outpatient settings, and treatment is often with empiric antibiotics for atypical pneumonia. Note that many patients may undergo a period of symptomatic management before seeking medical attention and/or receiving antibiotic treatment.

Treatment of M. pneumoniae includes macrolides, doxycycline, or fluoroquinolones. Azithromycin is the most frequently used antibiotic and is usually prescribed for 5 days (500 mg for the first dose, followed by 250 mg daily for 4 days). Patients receiving doxycycline or fluoroquinolones should be given 7 to 14 days of treatment.
