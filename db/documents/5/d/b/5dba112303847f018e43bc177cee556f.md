A high index of suspicion, along with exposure history, high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT) scan, and marked lymphocytosis are the main factors leading to the diagnosis of farmer's lung.

Sputum cultures, antigen detection, and serum antibodies evaluation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) can also be used. Serological studies are usuallyÂ not useful markers, especially in chronic cases, as they may indicate mere exposure.

The forced mid-expiratory flow (FEF25-75%) and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) have been found to be reduced in a significant proportion of the patients suffering from hypersensitivity pneumonitis/farmer's lung.

Bronchoscopic evaluation with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be useful in some cases and may suggest a gross lymphocytosis and CD4/CD8 ratio reversal. Transbronchial biopsy (TBLB) may not be useful in all cases since it may miss the disease process. In nearly half of the cases, findings may be nonspecific.

Surgical lung biopsy will be the final diagnostic choice but may not be possible in a chronic patient who has fibrotic lung and hypoxia.

This highlights the usage of history, clinical examination, imaging, and bronchoscopic evaluation, indicating a lack of definite, standard criteria, and the necessity of an integrated approach.
