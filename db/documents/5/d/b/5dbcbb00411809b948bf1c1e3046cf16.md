The eukaryotic cell is compartmentalized, with different cellular compartments defined by biological membranes. The synthesis of components of the translational machinery begins with the transcription of mRNAs, tRNAs, and rRNAs in the nucleus by RNA polymerases II, III, and I, respectively. Transfer RNAs and the mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins exit the nucleus and the latter get translated in the cytoplasm. Ribosomal proteins then return to the nucleus where they assemble hierarchically on rRNAs being transcribed by RNA polymerase I. This assembly process defines a compartment of nucleus referred to as the nucleolus. Ribosome assembly is a complex process involving hundreds of accessory factors that transiently associate with ribosomal subunits during their maturation. While most of the steps involved in maturing ribosomal subunits occur within the nucleolus before the subunits exiting through nuclear pores, final steps in subunit maturation occur in the cytoplasm. Ribosomes translating most cellular mRNAs do so as free ribosomes in the cytoplasm. In contrast, ribosomes translating mRNAs encoding proteins destined for secretion from the cell or resident proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, or plasma membrane get localized to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane.
