The importance of identification and management of imposter syndrome ranges from the individual to the societal level. Prevention, early intervention, and management of IS would likely ameliorate the detrimental effects imposter syndrome has on individuals, patients, teams, and families.

Given the existence of multiple definitions and diagnostic criteria for IS, a formally validated diagnostic tool and/or a DSM definition would further research into the diagnosis, management, and prognostication.

Improving diagnosis and management will likely enhance the healthcare team's performance and enhance team performance. Improving team performance in healthcare settings reduces costs and burdens on the healthcare system and improves patient outcomes. Additionally, improved diagnostics and interventions for IS will likely lead to decreased disparities in minority groups in these high-pressure academic and clinical settings.

Current research and literature are at the Oxford CEBM Level 4 and 5 evidence. Potential future research exists in further identifying the etiology, pathophysiology, epidemiology, identification, and management of imposter syndrome/phenomenon.
