Contemporary data suggests that osteocytic functions have led to various therapeutic measures to alter their physiology. Osteocytes, the prevalent and advanced-most bone cells, and osteocyte-derived proteins (i.e., sclerostin) lead to the development of newer strategies to treat various orthopedic conditions.

Researchers recognize that sclerostin as a vital molecule governing bone health. Osteocytes, source of sclerostin, are the main integrators of mechanical and chemical signals that lead to significant changes within the human body. The deep reach of the sophisticated vascular system passing via the canalicular fluid and osteocytic network composes a model delivery system for various small molecules.

Further applications of sclerostin action are under active research, as seen in chondrocyte expression of sclerostin in osteoarthritis. Maintaining sclerostin levels is crucial to protecting the intricate balance among the osteoblast, the osteocytes, and the osteoclast.
