The facial nerve, composed of approximately 10,000 axons, provides motor control of the muscles of facial expression, in addition to the posterior belly of the digastric, the stylohyoid, and the stapedius muscles. Upon emerging from the temporal bone, the facial nerve travels through the parotid gland, separating the deep and superficial lobes, and then continues distally beneath the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) of the face. Because the mimetic muscles are contiguous with the SMAS layer, the majority of the muscles of facial expression are innervated from their deep surfaces; the exceptions are the buccinator, the mentalis, and the levator anguli oris muscles, which lie deeper within the face and are therefore innervated from their superficial surfaces.
