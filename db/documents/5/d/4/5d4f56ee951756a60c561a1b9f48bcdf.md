Although the etiology is unknown, sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that results in the formation of granulomas. Classically, the granulomas in sarcoidosis are non-caseating granulomas, which may be found throughout lymph nodes and organs, including the brain and nervous system. About 5% to 10% of patients with sarcoidosis will have neurologic complications.

Neurosarcoidosis tends to occur in patients who have systemic features and active disease. The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is difficult and usually one of exclusion. Sometimes a nerve or muscle biopsy may reveal a non-caseating granuloma. There is no cure for neurosarcoidosis. Most patients require long-term treatment with corticosteroids.
