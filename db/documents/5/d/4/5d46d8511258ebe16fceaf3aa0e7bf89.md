Coronary arteriovenous fistula should be suspected in patients who present with unexplained heart failure, have continuous murmur on auscultation, and have prominent collaterals and dilated coronary arteries on cardiac catheterization and coronary artery computed tomography. Small fistula can be followed up with serial echocardiography, and large, symptomatic fistula like myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, ventricular dysfunction, and endarteritis should be repaired. Cardiology should be consulted with suspicious echocardiographic findings. Cardiothoracic surgery and intervention cardiology should be on board for the management of diagnosed cases like open surgical ligation of complicated fistula vs. percutaneous transcatheter closure. This activity examines the etiology, presentation, sequelae, and management of coronary atriovenous fistula.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the types of coronary arteriovenous fistula.
- Outline the clinical features of coronary arteriovenous fistula and recognize it as a rare cause of unexplained heart failure. 
- Review the common diagnostic modalities and outline the importance of cardiac catheterization and coronary computed tomography
- Summarize the role cardiology consultation when a coronary arteriovenous fistula is suspected
