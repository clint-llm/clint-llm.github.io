The upper limb musculature is derived from the dorsolateral cells of somites that migrate into the limb around the fourth week to form muscles. With elongation of the limb buds, the muscle tissue splits into flexor and extensor components determined by connective tissue derived from the lateral plate mesoderm. The zone of polarizing activity at the posterior border of the upper limb secretes sonic hedgehog to control anterior-posterior patterning.
