Just as translational science and research have gained momentum in the recent decade,Â  the idea of translation in healthcare simulation has advanced also. This article applied the knowledge gained from translational science and research to healthcare simulation, including the translational science and translational simulation educational spectrums.

This article provides the rationale for why translational science has become a larger focus in recent years in both the larger scientific community and in healthcare simulation. It is anticipated this trend will continue with the ultimate goal of improving the lives of our patients and populations through a continued focus on translational activities.
