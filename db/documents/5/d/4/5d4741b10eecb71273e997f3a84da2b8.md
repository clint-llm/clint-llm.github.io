Children with type 2 diabetes mellitus most often present during asymptomatic screening.

Children may have the typical symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, and weight loss. Children with type 2 diabetes mellitus are more likely than adults with the disorder to present in DKA (5% to 13%), especially if they are of ethnic minority descent. Adolescents with type 2 diabetes mellitus may also present in Hyperosmolar Hyperglycemic State (HHS).

Physical exam findings can include acanthosis nigricans (dark, velvety rash present in the axillae and neck). The American Diabetes Association recommends screening children at 10 years old or at the start of puberty in children who are obese (> 95th percentile BMI for age) or are overweight (BMI > 85th percentile for age or > 120% ideal body weight) and have two risk factors. These factors can be positive family history, high-risk ethnicity, signs of insulin resistance (polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), acanthosis, symptoms), or history of maternal gestational diabetes mellitus.
