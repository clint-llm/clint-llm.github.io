While locating the foramen of Winslow and viable tissue in the operating room is quite simple, finding it in stiff, non-pliable fixed tissue in the dissecting laboratory can be quite difficult. To find the foramen of Winslow, a physician can begin at the hepatogastric ligament and follow the lesser curvature of the stomach distally to the pylorus, at which point the lesser omentum is known as the hepatoduodenal ligament. They then follow the duodenum distally until the termination of the hepatoduodenal ligament, then the finger can be slipped around the edge of the hepatoduodenal ligament and into the foramen of Winslow. The physician then follows the cystic duct to its junction with the common hepatic duct, then follow the course of the common bile duct within the hepatoduodenal ligament at which point they are within the foramen of Winslow. Finally, they take down the hepatic flexure of the colon, then follow the second portion of the duodenum proximally until they reach the first portion of the duodenum which is the inferior wall of the foramen of Winslow.
