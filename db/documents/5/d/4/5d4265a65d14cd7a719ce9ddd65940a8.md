Copper metabolism plays an important role in physiologic homeostasis. Copper toxicity, however, induces several pathologic processes that are detrimental to human health. This discussion highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the importance of early recognition of copper toxicity in regards to improving patient outcomes.
- Outline the potential risk factors for copper toxicity.
- Review the first and second-line treatments available to patients with copper toxicity.
- Explain the importance of improving patient education by an interprofessional team to enhance the prevention of copper toxicity.
