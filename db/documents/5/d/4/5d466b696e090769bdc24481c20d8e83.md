To prepare for endotracheal intubation and IMV, closed-loop communication between team members is required. A time-out should be conducted to review patient details, consent, and anticipated approach to intubation unless a life-threatening emergency. A respiratory therapist, intensivist, nurse, and ICU pharmacist should be a part of the team. An appropriate pre-oxygenation method should be discussed. High flow devices such as HFNC, non-rebreather mask, and in some instances, NIPV can be considered for pre-oxygenation to minimize intra-procedure hypoxemia as there is a high risk of sudden de-recruitment and hypoxemia after neuromuscular blockade during induction.

The induction method, such as rapid sequence intubation, should be reviewed along with pre-existing allergies, prior intubations, and contraindication to each medication. In most hospitals, video laryngoscopy has been recommended for intubation to minimize aerosolization and improve efficiency.
