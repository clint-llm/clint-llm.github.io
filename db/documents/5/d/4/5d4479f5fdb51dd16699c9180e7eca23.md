In children younger than five years old, the retropharyngeal space contains chains of lymph nodes that drain the nasopharynx, adenoids, posterior paranasal sinuses, and middle ear. An antecedent upper respiratory tract infection can result in suppurative adenitis of these retropharyngeal lymph nodes and eventual abscess formation. As these retropharyngeal lymph nodes atrophy and involute during normal development, antecedent upper respiratory tract infection resulting in retropharyngeal abscess becomes less likely. In older children and adults, trauma to the posterior pharynx resulting in retropharyngeal infection is the more likely mechanism through which retropharyngeal abscess originates.

After suppurative adenitis or trauma results in the seeding of the retropharyngeal space, cellulitis results and eventually leads to phlegmon and abscess formation in the retropharyngeal space. Retropharyngeal abscesses are often polymicrobial infections. Bacteria that commonly contribute to these infections include Group A Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Fusobacterium, Haemophilus species, and other respiratory anaerobic organisms.

As the retropharyngeal abscess grows in size, it results in gradual upper airway obstruction and eventually asphyxiation if left untreated. Although mortality from sepsis does occur in these patients, the number one cause of death in patients with retropharyngeal abscess remains upper airway occlusion.
