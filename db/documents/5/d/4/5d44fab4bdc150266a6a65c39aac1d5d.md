Trichinellosis occurs worldwide, and estimates are that about 10000 cases occur each year.Trichinella, and thus far reports exist of twelve genotypes of Trichinella.Trichinella spiralis, although other species of Trichinella implicated in human disease are: T. nativa, T. nelson, T. britovi, T. pseudospiralis, T. murelli, T. papuae.

The highest number of cases appear to be in China where pig consumption is the highest in the world. In the arctic, polar bears, seals, and walrus have been identified as vectors for Trichinella. In recent years, consumer preference for eating antibiotic-free meat has also led to an increase in Trichinella in Europe.
