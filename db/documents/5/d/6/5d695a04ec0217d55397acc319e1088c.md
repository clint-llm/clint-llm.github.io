The term “koilonychia” is derived from the Greek word ‘koilos’ which means ‘hollow’ and ‘onikh’ means ‘nail’. This abnormality of the nails is also called as spoon-shaped (concave) nails. ** **The nail abnormality is characterized by thin, brittle, concave nail dystrophy either placed horizontally or vertically, where the finger or toenail plate seems to be centrally depressed and everted laterally. It can be found in newborns, children, and adults. When a patient presents with this symptom, it is imperative to look into further to see if there are more serious health concerns that may be present.
