Local and topical anesthetics are generally safe when dosed properly, and they remain confined to the site of administration, such as a nerve plexus or infiltrated tissue. However, if large quantities of local anesthetic enter the systemic circulation, toxicity can result from supratherapeutic drug levels.

Patients with a suspected local anesthetic overdose should be treated immediately with intravenous lipid emulsion 20% at 1.5 mL/kg (lean body mass) given over 1 minute, followed by a 0.25 mL/kg/minute infusion. The bolus may be repeated up to two times for refractory cardiovascular compromise. The infusion can be increased to 0.5 mL/kg/minute if the patient has the return of cardiac function but remains hypotensive. The maximum recommended dose is 10 mL/kg over the first 30 minutes (per the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine 2011 Consensus Statement).
