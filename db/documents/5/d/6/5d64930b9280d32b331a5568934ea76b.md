Electron microscopy is a relatively young imaging technique that allows observation of the ultrastructure of cells. Since the first use of electron microscopy in the early 1930s, it has revolutionized our understanding of cellular biology. The ultrastructure of a cell refers to the biological structures that can't be seen with standard light microscopy, such as cilia and extracellular proteins. Through the utilization of electron microscopy, it has been possible to better characterize the features of the male urethra. For example, some even more subspecialized regions of the male urethra have been recently described due to certain portions of the epithelium of the prostatic and spongy urethra expressing cilia on their apical surfaces. Research has shown that some regions of epithelium contain higher concentrations of glycogen compared to the rest. These findings suggest that the urethra is a more complex and dynamic organ than previously understood.
