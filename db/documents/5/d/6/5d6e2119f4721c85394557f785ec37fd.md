The etiology of CTK is still unelucidated. However, there are several hypotheses, including a reaction to a component of surgical gloves, meibomian gland secretions, povidone-iodine, or marking pen ink.

As the etiology of CTK is only speculative, there are no proven risk factors that lead to its development. However, CTK's initial description as a complication of LASIK surgery, and the vast majority of published reports are associated with excimer laser ablation. Therefore, patients undergoing refractive laser correction seem to be at the greatest risk. Additionally, since a majority of cases of CTK correlate with preceding DLK (95% in the initial study by Sonmez et al.), or persistent, and therefore coexistent, (64%), risk factors associated with DLK may also have an association with CTK.
