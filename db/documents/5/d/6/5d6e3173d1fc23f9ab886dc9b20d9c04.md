PTX exposure, and resulting toxicity, are most frequently associated with inhalation of vapors while cleaning or eradicating the coral from home aquariums. As a result of their rapid growth, unwanted zoanthids require removal from certain areas of the aquarium, which is most often done with boiling in water and/or scrubbing affected rocks. The resultant inhalation of steam or aerosolized droplets can lead to respiratory symptoms such as rhinorrhea, cough, and dyspnea. This activity will discuss the etiology, pathophysiology, and suggested management of toxic ocular exposure to palytoxin (PTX), leading to corneal toxicity as described in retrospective case reports of incidental contact. Additionally, it will review physical exam findings and prognosis of patients with presumed PTX associated keratoconjunctivitis. Finally, the role of the healthcare team in diagnosis and treatment will be discussed.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of palytoxin exposure keratitis.
- Outline the history and clinical symptoms associated with palytoxin keratitis.
- Identify the appropriate treatment for patients with suspected palytoxin keratitis.
- Identify the role of the healthcare team in the diagnosis and treatment of palytoxin exposure.
