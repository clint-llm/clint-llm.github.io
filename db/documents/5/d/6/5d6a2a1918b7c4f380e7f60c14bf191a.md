The differential diagnoses of SIADH include all the causes of hyponatremia.

If the serum osmolality is reduced and urine osmolality is >100mOsm/kg, the volume status of the patient needs to be estimated and the likely cause identified as follows:

- Euvolemia - SIADH

- Hypervolemia - Cardiac failure, cirrhosis

- Hypovolemia - Vomiting, diarrhea
