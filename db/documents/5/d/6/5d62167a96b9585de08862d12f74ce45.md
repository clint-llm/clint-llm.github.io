Compartment syndrome is a condition in which increased tissue pressure within a limited space compromises the circulation and function of the contents of that space. This happens when intramuscular pressure is elevated over a certain level for a period of time sufficient to reduce capillary perfusion. The inadequate tissue perfusion then leads to inadequate tissue oxygenation to the nerves as well as muscles within the affected compartment. This activity reviews the diagnosis and treatment of forearm compartment syndrome by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the common causes of forearm compartment syndrome. 
- Describe the clinical signs and symptoms in patients presenting with forearm compartment syndrome. 
- Explain the evaluation of a patient presenting with suspected forearm compartment syndrome. 
- Review the importance of communication and involvement of the interprofessional team in providing the best outcome for patients who present with forearm compartment syndrome.
