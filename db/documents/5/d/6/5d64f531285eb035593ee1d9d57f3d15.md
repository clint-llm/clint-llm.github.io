**Mu Receptor Agonists: Dosing Challenges**

The majority of clinically useful opioid analgesics bind primarily to mu-opioid receptor sites where they have agonist effects. Examples of these mu receptor agonists include morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl, oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone. Because they act on the same receptor, these drugs are theoretically interchangeable, provided the doses are adjusted for relative potency.
