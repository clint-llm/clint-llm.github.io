Transposition flaps are employed when surgical defects pose a risk of functional impairment and/or aesthetically displeasing results if repaired by simple primary closure, second intention, skin grafting, or sliding flaps. Advantages of transposition flaps include less undermining when compared to large, sliding flaps and superior ability to displace tension away from the defect and any nearby free margins, as well as to reorient tension vectors in more favorable directions.

Rhombic transposition flaps are particularly useful for defects near the medial and lateral canthi, cheeks, and lateral upper two-thirds of the nose, but they also have a well-defined role in the lateral forehead, temple, perioral, inferior chin, and dorsal hand defects.

Bilobed transposition flaps can be utilized in defects of the lower third of the nose, the helix, and the posterior ear. Nasolabial transposition flaps are used for medium-sized defects of the nasal ala. The z-plasty can improve the cosmesis of scars crossing RSTLs and help release scar contractures by redistributing tension over the wound.
