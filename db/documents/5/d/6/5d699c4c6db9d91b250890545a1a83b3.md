Status asthmaticus is a medical emergency, an extreme form of asthma exacerbation characterized by hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and secondary respiratory failure. All patients with bronchial asthma are at risk of developing an acute episode with a progressive severity that is poorly responsive to standard therapeutic measures, regardless of disease severity or phenotypic variant. This is also known as status asthmaticus.

If not recognized and managed appropriately, asthmatics portends the risk of acute ventilatory failure and even death.

Despite advances in pharmacotherapy and access to early diagnosis and treatment of asthma itself, it remains one of the most common causes of emergency department visits. No single clinical or diagnostic index has been known to predict clinical outcomes in status asthmaticus. Hence, a multi-pronged and time-sensitive approach combining symptoms and signs, assessing airflow and blood gas, and a rapid escalation of treatment based on initial treatment response is favored to diagnose and manage the condition.
