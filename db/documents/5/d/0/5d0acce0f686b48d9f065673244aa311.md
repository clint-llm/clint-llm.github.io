The evaluation of craniopharyngioma required a multi-disciplinary approach with evaluation by an endocrinologist, neuro-opthalmologist, and neurosurgeon.

Imaging: Craniopharyngioma is diagnosed with computerized tomography (CT) and or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during the evaluation of visual symptoms. MRI is the standard of care in identifying craniopharyngiomas or any other pituitary tumors as it provides better information on the tumor, its location, and association to the surrounding structure. The cystic area is visible on both modalities but calcification is primarily seen with CT imaging. Craniopharyngioma is heterogeneous in texture; the combination of solid, cystic, and calcification components is a clue to its diagnosis on imaging modalities. ACP is primarily large irregular with 90% calcification and a cystic area, while PCP is mostly solid, and rarely with cysts and calcifications.

Visual Exam: A complete visual exam, including acuity and visual field, should be done by a neuro-opthalmologist in patients with visual disturbances.

Endocrine Evaluation:

- GH Deficiency: Initial laboratory evaluation includes checking insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein -3, and bone age X-ray. Checking plasma GH level add limited value as it is secreted in a pulsatile fashion. If insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is normal in patients with craniopharyngioma, then provocative tests using pharmacologic agents to stimulate GH secretion should be performed. The pharmacologic agents are glucagon, levodopa, arginine, or insulin. The use and interpretation of these agents should be done cautiously as stimulation of GH secretion with insulin is not the right choice in a patient with a history of seizure disorder as hypoglycemia can further precipitate the seizures.

- Gonadotropin Deficiency: This is diagnosed by observation of a lack of pubertal growth in adolescents. Checking gonadotropins, estradiol or testosterone may not aid in diagnosis.

- TSH Deficiency: Checking Free T4 is the key to diagnose central hypothyroidism. TSH level will be inappropriately normal to the low free T4 level.

- ACTH Deficiency: A baseline morning cortisol with a low ACTH level can give a pretty good assessment of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. AM cortisol of more than 18 ugs/dl rules out adrenal insufficiency. Dynamic testing like a cosyntropin stim test can be done in selected patients where AM cortisol is equivocal or indeterminate.

- Vasopressin Deficiency: The diagnosis is established by documenting fluid intake and output along with checking plasma sodium, plasma, and urine osmolarity. The urine is diluted due to the lack of vasopressin. A water deprivation test can be done to confirm the diagnosis.
