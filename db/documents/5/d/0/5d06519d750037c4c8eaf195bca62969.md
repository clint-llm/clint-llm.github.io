Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening syndrome associated with the use of dopamine-receptor antagonist medications or with rapid withdrawal of dopaminergic medications. NMS has been associated with virtually every neuroleptic agent but is more commonly reported with the typical antipsychotics like haloperidol and fluphenazine. Classic clinical characteristics include mental status changes, fever, muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability. This activity describes the presentation of neuroleptic malignant syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain when the diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome should be considered. 
- Explain how to diagnose neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
- Explain the management of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
- Explore strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
