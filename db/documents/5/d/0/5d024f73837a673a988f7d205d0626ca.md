Postsurgical and descending necrotizing mediastinitis are both associated with high morbidity and mortality if not treated early. They are both considered life-threatening conditions with descending necrotizing mediastinitis having a mortality of 20% to 40%, despite current treatments.

Comparatively, there is a better prognosis for fibrosing mediastinitis, with unilateral involvement shown to have better outcomes than bilateral involvement.
