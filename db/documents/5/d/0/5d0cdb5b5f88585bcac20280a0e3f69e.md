PatientsÂ should consult a dermatologist when they detect any firm nodule in their skin and receive education regarding the clinical course, outcome, and treatment of osteoma cutis. Health care practitioners should notify patients about educational websites. The latter is very helpful in understanding this benign lesion, its etiology, outcome, and treatment. Patient tutoring plays a very crucial role in the deterrence of the processes that can cause osteoma cutis. The patients should also be educated about the importance of regular follow-up and the treatments they are taking.
