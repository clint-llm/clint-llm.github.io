There is evidence of a bidirectional relationship between the two conditions, COPD and OSA.

Cigarette smoking is a common risk factor for the independent development of COPD and OSA. This accelerates the underlying disease process through oxidative stress and inflammatory mediator release, which can result in upper airway inflammation and increases the risk for obstructive sleep apnea.

Depending on which subtype is predominating in patients with COPD, there may be an increased or decreased risk of developing obstructive sleep apnea. For example, with the emphysema subtype of COPD, patients typically demonstrate hyperinflated lungs and lower body mass index (BMI) from the prominent dyspnea and increased work of breathing commonly seen in advanced stages of COPD. On the other hand, the chronic bronchitis phenotype is associated with increased BMI and a higher risk of developing OSA, mainly when adipose tissue is deposited around the neck.
