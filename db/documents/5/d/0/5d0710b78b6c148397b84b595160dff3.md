Choledocholithiasis is the presence of stones within the common bile duct. It is estimated that common bile duct stones are present in anywhere from 1-15% of patients with cholelithiasis. The present-day treatment of bile duct stones is endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or in some cases a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with bile duct exploration. In most US centers, when bile duct stones present, ERCP is usually followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of choledocholithiasis, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of choledocholithiasis.
- Outline the evaluation of suspected choledocholithiasis cases.
- Review the appropriate surgical approach for a patient with choledocholithiasis.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of choledocholithiasis and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
