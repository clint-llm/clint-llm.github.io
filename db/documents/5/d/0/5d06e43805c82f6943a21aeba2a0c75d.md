Older patients are at higher risk of side effects from pentoxifylline. Careful monitoring of blood pressure and glucose level is recommended when administering pentoxifylline in patients on antihypertensive and antidiabetic medications. They are at high risk for hypotension, falls, and hypoglycemia. Patients with liver disease should also receive close follow-up with periodic laboratory monitoring. Patients at increased risk of bleeding should be advised ofÂ potential signs and symptoms of bleeding and monitored with periodic laboratory data, including hematocrit and hemoglobin. Clinicians should exercise caution with patients who have cardiac arrhythmias and low blood pressure.
