As with all lacerations, scarring, infection, pain, and the need for additional repair are potential complications. Chondritis and hematoma formation are complications specific to ear lacerations. Patients should be reevaluated 24 to 48 hours after the repair to assess for the development of these complications. The vast majority of chondritis is provoked by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and should be treated with ciprofloxacin.
