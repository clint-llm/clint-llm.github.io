Histopathologic studies are rarely used to diagnose subacromial bursitis. These studies are more relevant in cases of infection or in the setting of chronic or recurrent subacromial bursitis, where the etiology may not be apparent. In their research, Santavirta et al. demonstrated the presence of chronic mononuclear cell infiltrates in inflamed bursal tissue. Immunohistochemistry revealed these cells to be mainly CD2-positive T lymphocytes and less commonly CD11b macrophages/monocytes.
