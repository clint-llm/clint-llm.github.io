In 2000, the Institute of Medicine published its summary findings of all the research done on implants. They concluded that there was no evidence that silicone implants caused any systemic diseases and that implants do not last forever. Despite many attempts to refute this, no new evidence to the contrary has been found. In March of 2017, the FDA did issue a warning that there was a link between textured implants and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This is now called breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma or BIA-ALCL, and the risk of having this occur was estimated to be 1:30,000.
