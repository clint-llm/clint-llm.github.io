The current standard of care for onchocerciasis is the use of ivermectin 150 mcg/kg given once or twice a year depending on the level of individual disease burden and community endemicity. Currently, ivermectin is distributed as a community-directed mass drug administration (MDA) and more than 100 million people are treated each year under a donation program. Ocular complications associated with onchocerciasis were treatable, are managed by standard ophthalmic treatment protocols.
