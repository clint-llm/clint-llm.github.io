The symptoms of nerve agent toxicity are sometimes very subtle. Therefore, health care providers must be on the lookout for key findings especially if the clinical situation is agriculture or terrorism. Nerve agent toxicity is a clinical diagnosis often presenting with excessive secretions, respiratory distress, and paralysis. Staff should first protect themselves by dressing in the proper personal protective equipment if nerve agent exposure is suspected. All patients with suspected nerve agent toxicity should receive atropine and pralidoxime in a timely fashion along with aggressive supportive care. The patientâ€™s respiratory status should be closely monitored as airway protection may be needed. Cardiac status should also be monitored as ventricular tachycardia brought on by QTc prolongation can sometimes occur. Patients may also experience excessive central nervous system (CNS) stimulation which can cause seizures. In summary, nerve agent toxicity is a potentially deadly exposure that must be promptly diagnosed and managed in patients afflicted with this syndrome.
