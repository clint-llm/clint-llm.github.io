The risk factors for developing post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia are not entirely understood; hence, more data is needed to inform patient selection to avoid this condition. Individuals considering bariatric surgery for weight loss should be aware of the symptoms of post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia, its effects on quality of life, and the treatment options.

Avoiding large meals with simple carbohydrates and consuming small, frequent meals rich in protein, healthy fats, and fiber may help improve symptoms. Pharmacotherapy can be considered for people who do not respond to dietary changes. Patients who fail conservative measures may need surgical interventions to treat this condition.
