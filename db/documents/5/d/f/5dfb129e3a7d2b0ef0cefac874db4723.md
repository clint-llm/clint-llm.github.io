Nitroprusside is administered only as an IV infusion diluted in D5W (it is not suitable for direct injection). It requires protection from light at all times.

Typical infusion rates range from 0.5 to 4 mcg/kg/minute which are then titrated to desired effect. Typical infusion concentrations for adults are 200 mcg/mL or 400 mcg/mL.

The maximum infusion rate is approximately 10 mcg/kg/minute, not to be sustained for more than 10 minutes at a time. If sufficient blood pressure control has not been achieved at that point, alternative agents should be considered (e.g., clevidipine).

The half-life elimination of sodium nitroprusside in circulation is roughly 2 minutes. Once metabolized into thiocyanate, half-life elimination occurs in approximately three days; renal dysfunction can easily double or triple this figure.

SNP is ultimately excreted from the body via urine as thiocyanate.
