Acanthosis nigricans is not treatable. It may fade over time by treating the cause, insulin resistance. Controlling blood glucose levels through exercise and diet often improves symptoms. Topical fade creams can lighten skin in less severe cases. Acanthosis nigricans malignant may resolve if the causative tumor is removed successfully.

The goal of treatment is to treat the underlying disease. In the majority of patients, the treatment is done only for aesthetic reasons. In some patients, weight loss and correction of insulin resistance lowers the burden of hyperkeratotic lesions. Acanthosis nigricans associated with insulin resistance can be treated with drugs such as metformin and rosiglitazone which are insulin-sensitizing agents.

All inciting agents and medications should be discontinued. One should make attempts to lower the lipid profile. Reports suggest that dietary fish and niacin may help.

Dermatologists sometimes prescribe keratolytics, such as topical retinoids (e.g. topical tretinoin 0.1% or combination of tretinoin 0.05% and 12% ammonium lactate) and podophyllin.

Melatonin can also improve cutaneous symptoms in obese patients with Acanthosis nigricans by improving the inflammatory status and insulin sensitivity.

Cosmetic treatments that have been tried include using alexandrite laser, dermabrasion, and chemical peels.
