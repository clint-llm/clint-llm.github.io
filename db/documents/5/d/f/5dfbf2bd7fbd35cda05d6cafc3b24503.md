Nurses should:

- Address patients appropriately. Do not refer to patients by associating them with their disease process ("the patient with hypertension," "the patient with bilateral tibia/fibula fracture").

- Talk to patients as if they were individuals rather than assignments.

- Not rush patients.

- Be readily available and accessible in case patients call for assistance.

- Recognize patients' feelings and know that their feelings require acknowledgment.

- Observe patients' physical and psychological well-being.

- Offer patients the chance to ask questions and assess their understanding of the issues to resolve misunderstandings.

- Be trained on professional behavior, including proper etiquette, how to behave with emotional patients, and how to handle disruptive team members.

Health care providers should be made aware of some “red flags” that indicate heavy substance abuse disorders. Some signs include the smell of alcohol on breath, aggressiveness, abnormal gait, slurred speech, impaired judgment, or withdrawal symptoms. Patients with substance abuse disorders may also have difficulty maintaining friendships, staying interested in hobbies, or be struggling financially. They may also have prior records of driving under the influence, involvement in assaults or domestic violence, theft, or drug possession.
