The evaluation begins with PA and lateral views of the wrist alongside scaphoid views, taken with the wrist at approximately 30 degrees of extension and 20 degrees of ulnar deviation. The estimates are that up to 25% of scaphoid fractures are not evident on initial plain radiographs. If high clinical suspicion exists, the wrist should undergo immobilization in a splint or cast for 7-14 days and plain radiographs repeated. If early confirmation is needed, bone scans can be done to diagnose occult fractures at 72 hours post-injury.

Persisting clinical suspicionÂ after negative repeat radiographs warrants Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT).

Although CT scan has also high sensitivity and specificity, fractures with less than 1 mm displacement can be missed.

There are no particular laboratory tests, but if surgery is to be done, then routine blood work, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, clotting screen, and group and save are required.
