Loratadine is a piperidine histamine H1-receptor antagonist with anti-allergic properties but without sedative effects. The drug is an FDA-approved medication to relieve and treat allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and urticaria (allergic skin rash).

The drug was involved in controversy as one of the first direct-to-consumer advertised drugs., leading to further FDA clarification on what must appear in drug advertising.
