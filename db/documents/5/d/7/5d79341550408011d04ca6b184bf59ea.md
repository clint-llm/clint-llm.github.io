Pancreatic cancer refers to the carcinoma arising from the pancreatic duct cells, pancreatic ductal carcinoma. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The 5-year survival rate in the United States ranges from 5% to 15%. The overall survival rate is only 6%. Surgical resection is the only current option for a cure, but only 20% of pancreatic cancer is surgically resectable at the time of diagnosis.

Close cooperation among various specialties including surgeons, oncologists, radiation oncologists, pathologists, and radiologists is extremely important for the chance of survival in patients with resectable disease and borderline resectable disease.
