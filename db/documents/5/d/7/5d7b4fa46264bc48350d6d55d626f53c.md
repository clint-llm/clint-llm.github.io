There are currently no known FDA contraindications to quetiapine. However, there are several precautions to be considered when administering this drug. As mentioned before, quetiapine and other atypical antipsychotics are associated with an increased risk of death in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. Also, precaution is a consideration with drugs that increase QT intervals and patients with prolonged QT intervals. Drugs include Class I and Class III antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, macrolides, fluoroquinolone, pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, first-, and second-generation antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, quinine, halofantrine, and albendazole. These combinations put the patient at risk for torsades de pointes. Precautions are also necessary for patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia.
