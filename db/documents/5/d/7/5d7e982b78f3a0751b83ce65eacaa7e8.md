Cisplatin is an antineoplastic agent that came into use in the late 1970s. Cisplatin, while highly toxic, is one of the most heavily utilized chemotherapeutic agents for hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. It can be used as a single-agent or combination therapy for induction and neoadjuvant therapy.

**Adult Indications**

Cisplatin is FDA approved for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer, testicular cancer, and bladder carcinoma.

Malignancies that predominate in women, such as breast cancer, cervical and endometrial carcinoma, and gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, sometimes receive treatment with cisplatin in combination with other medications such as taxane derivatives, 5-FU, and doxorubicin.

Gastrointestinal malignancies such as esophageal, gastric, and hepatobiliary cancer have also been treated off-label with this medication and radiation.

Other off-label uses include treatment for metastatic, advanced, and refractory cancers; this includes the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, penile cancer, thymoma, head and neck cancers, osteosarcoma, multiple myeloma, and mesothelioma.

**Pediatric Indications**

Cisplatin hasÂ no approved indications for treatment in children. When utilized off-label, its indications are for historically aggressive tumors.
