In addition to an ophthalmologist, an optometrist, ophthalmic technician, nurse, or emergency medicine physician may use tonometry during an ophthalmic office visit, emergency room visit, or ambulatory settings as needed. Communication among these professionals, operating as an interprofessional team, regarding the particular tonometry method is important so eye pressure measurements can be accurately compared throughout time.

Portable techniques such as the Tono-pen and rebound tonometer are simple to use, while stationary methods such as GAT require more specialized training. Each medical professional mentioned above may use various tonometry methods based on comfort level and training. A point of emphasis among all professionals performing tonometry must be the proper use of topical anesthesia to minimize patient discomfort for methods including Tono-pen and GAT. Avoid any tangential movement across the cornea during tonometric measurement to prevent corneal abrasions. Additionally, ensure any disinfecting solution is rinsed from the tonometry surface that contacts the cornea to avoid potential toxic keratitis.

Tonometry readings may need to be re-measured among professionals to ensure consistency of readings. If there is a question about the accuracy of a reading or device, an alternative tonometry method may be used to help confirm or refute the reading. In an acute setting where acute-angle closure glaucoma is suspected, an emergent intraocular pressure reading must be acquired. This is typically initially done in the emergency room by a physician or nurse, with a consulting ophthalmologist confirming the pressure on arrival and administering pressure-lowering medication or performing additional interventions to save vision.
