Tricyclic antidepressants use along with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, linezolid, and IV methylene blue is contraindicated as they can lead to an increased risk of developing serotonin syndrome. Serotonin syndrome can be life-threatening as it can cause a change in mental status, autonomic instability, neuromuscular changes, seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms. More importantly, concurrent use of both medications can cause convulsions, hyper-pyretic crises, and death. The patient must discontinue MAO inhibitors for at least 14 days before starting nortriptyline.

Postmarketing reports have shown a possible association between nortriptyline and the unmasking of Brugada syndrome. For this reason, patients with confirmed or suspected Brugada syndrome should avoid nortriptyline as it can result in EKG abnormalities, syncope, and even sudden cardiac death.
