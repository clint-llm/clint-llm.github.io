The amount of blood pumped by the heart is closely matched to global metabolic needs. Changes in cardiac output from baseline are directly proportionate to changes in total body oxygen needs. During times of physiologic stress, cardiac output will increase to ensure adequate tissue perfusion. Fick’s principle illustrates this notion and can be used to calculate cardiac output based on oxygen exchange through a capillary bed. In equation form: CO = VO2/ (a – v O2 difference) where VO2 represents oxygen use by tissue and a-V O2 is the difference in oxygen content of arterial and venous blood.  This Fick’s principle also represents one method to measure CO.

Another method for measuring CO function is the thermodilution method using the change in temperature of blood between a port in the catheter and a thermistor. Thermodilution catheters are usually placed with the proximal (injection port) in the superior or inferior vena cava or right atrium, and the distal port where the thermistor is located is in the pulmonary arteries.

CO is dynamically altered by changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) or systemic vascular resistance. This can be represented by CO = MAP/TPR.
