Literature has shown that having precautionary action plans for WPV generally decreases the rate and severity of WPV over time. However, risk assessment tools have still been underdeveloped. Screening instruments such as STAMP, VRSDSiT, Alert System, and the BVC all function to assess specific patient behaviors and estimate the probability of violence.

Alert systems utilize mental status, behavioral, and orientation criteria to flag patients for potential WPV. Risk is highest if they have at least three of the following: shouting or demanding tone, are drunk or under the influence, confused or hallucinating, withdrawn, agitated, suspicious, or otherwise have an alteration in mental status.

Flagging at-risk patients shows high predictive value. The Behavior of Concerns Chart (BVC) has the highest predicted validity for WPV, especially in the ED. Senz et al was the first study to apply the BVC in the ED setting, intending to provide a standard for both communication and shared understanding amongst administrative, physician, nursing, and security staff.

This guideline may significantly reduce unplanned WPV and mechanical restraint usage. Its adoption has also improved the perception of organizational support and cognizance of WPV.
