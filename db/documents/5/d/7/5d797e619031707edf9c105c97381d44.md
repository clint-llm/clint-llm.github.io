Radioactive iodine is widely used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism and thyroid carcinoma. Radioiodine administration requires a specialized interprofessional team of highly trained healthcare providers, including nurses, physicians, radiotherapy-specialized pharmacists, and radiation safety. All providers involved in radioiodine administration should be aware of its indications, contraindications, and adverse effects. One contraindication all providers should be mindful of is pregnancy. Providers should collaborate and ensure proper education of women of childbearing age to prevent radioiodine administration if pregnant and/or breastfeeding due to potential teratogenic effects; health care providers should obtain a thorough sexual history and implement routine pregnancy testing in women of childbearing age.

Additional recommendations to enhance patient-centered care include establishingÂ interprofessional collaboration and open communication among providers (i.e., tumor board discussions), quality assurance measures to identify areas for improvement of health care delivery, and finally, implementation of checklists ito ensure efficient provider-patient communication and reduce adverse clinical outcomes.
