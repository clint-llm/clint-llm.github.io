When used on appropriately selected patients, vagal maneuvers are relatively safe, and complications are rare. Most complications are likely an exaggerated and transient response to the maneuver, which may include bradycardia, prolonged sinus pauses, asystole, atrioventricular block, and/or hypotension.  Rarely, other tachyarrhythmias (i.e., atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation) may be provoked as a result of this maneuver.

Carotid Sinus Massage – Neurologic complications following CSM are rare and usually transient. The overall risk of stroke or embolic event with persistent neurological deficits is approximately 1 in 1000, enough to warrant obtaining informed consent before performing the procedure.

Valsalva maneuver – Rarely, increased pressures may cause rupture of the round window of the ear.

Diving Reflex – Aspiration and drowning are potential complications in patients not capable of safely submerging their face in a basin of ice water. When using the bag of ice water method in pediatric patients, care must be taken to avoid prolonged exposure to the skin or burns may occur. It is also important to avoid obstructing the patient's airway.
