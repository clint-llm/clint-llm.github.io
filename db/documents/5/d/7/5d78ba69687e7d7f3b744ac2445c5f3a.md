The complications associated with mitral valve repair are very similarÂ in open repair or transcatheter percutaneous repair. Mortality of mitral valve repair in recent studies has shown zero deaths related to repair and overall less than 3% complication rate. The following are some important complications:

- Catheter-related complications to access the site, such as hematoma, arteriotomy, dissection, arteriovenous fistula

- Stroke

- Myocardial infarction due damage or irritation to the left coronary artery

- Perioperative bleeding and resulting blood products transfusion-related complications

- Mitral regurgitation

- Pericardial tamponade

- Arrhythmias and heart blocks

- Heart failure

- Drug reactions

- Surgical site infections

- Sepsis

- Pulmonary complications, such as pneumothorax, pneumonia, embolisms

- Renal failure due to concomitant use of contrast dye
