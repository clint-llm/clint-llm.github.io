Nummular dermatitis is a pruritic eczematous dermatosis characterized by multiple coin-shaped lesions. It may occur as a feature of atopic dermatitis, asteatotic eczema, or stasis dermatitis. The prognosis of this condition is excellent. Most cases can be treated successfully with conservative measures and topical corticosteroids, and a majority of patients will eventually achieve remission. Nummular dermatitis may also be referred to as nummular eczema, discoid eczema, and microbial eczema.
