The ventral telencephalon gives rise to the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences, which are the source of neurons in the striatum and cortical interneurons, respectively. Many precisely timed molecular signals must take place to ensure proper development of the caudate nucleus to occur. Differential gene expression in neurons destined to comprise the striatum include ASCL1, DLXs, LHXs, and GSX2.

The dentate gyrus and olfactory bulb are the two widely accepted sites of neurogenesis in adult mammals.
