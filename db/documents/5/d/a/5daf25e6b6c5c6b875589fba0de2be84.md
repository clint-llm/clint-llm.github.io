Minor cases of actinic prurigo can be treated with sun-avoidance alone. Proper sun protection includes avoiding sunlight by staying indoors or in shaded areas, wearing protective clothing, sunglasses, and wide-brim hats, and using a broad-spectrum sunscreen. Topical corticosteroids and non-sedating antihistamines will provide relief for acute episodes. The more severe and persistent disease requires treatment with systemic therapies such as antimalarials, tetracyclines, and systemic corticosteroids.

Thalidomide has been described as the hallmark therapy for severe refractory cases of actinic prurigo. Treatment with thalidomide has a major limiting side effect profile, which includes peripheral neuropathy and teratogenicity. Treatment with thalidomide is contraindicated during pregnancy or in individuals trying to become pregnant. Females of childbearing age must use contraception during therapy with thalidomide. Screening for peripheral neuropathy is typically initiated pre-treatment and continued throughout the treatment process.

Alternative immunosuppressive regimens with agents like cyclosporine A have been described as successful as well. Photochemotherapy with psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) has also been shown to successfully manage symptoms and treat skin changes caused by actinic prurigo.
