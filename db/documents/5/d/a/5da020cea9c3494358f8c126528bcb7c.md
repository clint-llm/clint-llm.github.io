**Common Carotid Artery Bifurcation Variance**

The common carotid arteries usually bifurcate at the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. However, there are physiologic variants in specific individuals due to anatomical, genetic variations and also impact the success of certain surgical procedures to address disease states such as atherosclerosis.

**Genetics**

It is also important to note that carotid body tumors such as paragangliomas are frequently associated with a genetic mutation. This mutation is notably at the SDH gene. Interestingly, carotid body paragangliomas are also noted most frequently with populations who reside at higher altitudes.
