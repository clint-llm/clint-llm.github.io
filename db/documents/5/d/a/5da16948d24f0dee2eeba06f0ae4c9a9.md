Fresh frozen plasma can only be administered intravenously. Fresh frozen plasma must be ABO compatible with the recipient’s red cells. Upon visual inspection, the fresh frozen plasma container and fluid should have no leakage, clots, or abnormal color. Fresh frozen plasma is stored at -30 Celsius. Before administration, fresh frozen plasma is thawed in a water bath at 30 to 37 Celsius over 20 to 30 minutes or in an FDA-cleared device as quickly as 2 to 3 minutes. Fresh frozen plasma should be administered immediately after thawing. If fresh frozen plasma is not given immediately after thawing, it should be stored at 1 to 6 Celsius.

If the thawed fresh frozen plasma is not used in 24 hours, it should be discarded. Once thawed, the activity of clotting factors, particularly factor V and factor VIII, decline gradually. After the initial dosage, re-administration may be needed every 6 to 8 hours if there is ongoing bleeding due to the short half-life of factor VII; factor VII has a half-life of 2 to 6 hours.
