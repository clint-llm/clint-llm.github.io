Any of the four FDA-approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors are highly effective in treating chronic phase CML. In selecting front-line therapy, a patient’s age, comorbidities, and tyrosine kinase toxicities must be taken into account.

For patients with chronic phase CML, the use of the Sokal or Hasford risk stratification scores helps predict outcomes and choose the first-line tyrosine-kinase inhibitor.

At baseline, all patients should undergo bone marrow examination and cytogenetic analysis to monitor treatment response. The patient should be monitored at 3, 6, and 12 months after starting therapy using cytogenetic and molecular studies such as PCR performed on peripheral blood.BCR-ABL1 transcripts of less than or equal to 0.1% on the international scale (IS).

The European Leukemia Net (ELN) 2013 criteria can be a guide to monitor failure or suboptimal response to first-line therapy or second-line therapy. These criteria evaluate patients with chronic phase CML at 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months and then any subsequent follow-up; the optimal response is defined by PCR as BCR-ABL1 transcripts (IS) of less than or equal to 10%, less than 1%, and less than or equal to 0.1%, respectively. Alternatively, if quantitative PCR is not available, cytogenetics can determine levels of the Philadelphia chromosome but is not useful in cryptic BCR-ABL1. If the optimal response is not achieved, there is a warning response group and a failure response group. In the warning group, consideration of dose escalation of imatinib or changing tyrosine kinase inhibitors is warranted.

In the event of tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, analysis of the BCR-ABL1 mutational profile may be useful in choosing second- or third-line therapy. The T315I mutation has been shown to confer resistance to imatinib and all second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In these patients, ponatinib should be considered.Y253H, E255K/V, or F359C/V mutations, dasatinib or bosutinib may have better responses, and in cases of V299L and F317L mutations, nilotinib may have promising outcomes.

For accelerated or blast phase CML, treatment considerations include evaluation for allogeneic HSCT, whether the advanced phase presented while the patient was on or off tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, comorbidities, age, prior therapy, and analysis of BCR-ABL1 mutation profile. Chemotherapy is often required in advanced CML to reduce disease burden and prepare for allogeneic HSCT.

In patients who achieve a long-term deep molecular response to therapy, discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be considered. Treatment-free remission can be achieved in approximately 40% to 60% of the low risk to intermediate-risk patients. Characteristics that predict treatment-free remission include cases with low Sokal risk, no history of tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, and duration of tyrosine kinase inhibitor use greater than five years. Most relapses will occur within the first six months of discontinuation, and molecular monitoring should occur monthly for the first year post-discontinuation and every 6 to 12 weeks indefinitely. If molecular relapse occurs, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy should be re-initiated.
