Refractive errors are among the most common treatable eye disorders.

The duochrome test technique involves several steps. The patient is first assessed with refraction and given the best correction. With the initial MPMVA or final refractive lens correction on the trial frame or phoropter in place, the duochrome chart can then be projected. Next, the patient is asked to identify the most distinct and focused letters by comparing them on the green versus the red background of the duochrome chart. If the patient reports the letters in the green background as most distinct, plus lenses are consecutively added using +0.25 DS steps until similar clarity from both backgrounds is achieved. If the patient reports the letters in the red background as most distinct,Â  then minus lenses of -0.25 DS steps are consecutively added until similar clarity of letters in both backgrounds is achieved.

It is, however, commonly seen that most patients do not experience equality in clarity between the red and green halves of the charts. Most patients switch from seeing green as clearer to red and vice-versa. The rule of thumb in these cases is to leave younger patients one step into the green and older patients one step into the red. Pseudophakic patients should be left one step into the green.

A simplified version of the duochrome or bichrome test can also be used as a quick eye screening test to assess a person's global refractive error. This subjective screening method can determine if the individual is emmetropic, hyperopic, or myopic. This type of assessment can be helpful in a population-based setting to determine individuals needing further evaluation from an eye care professional for lens prescription. This type of screening does not provide information regarding the required correction or the severity of the refractive error and is thus not normally used in a routine clinical setting.

The test involves using two colored filters, usually red and green, and a standard eye chart with a white background. First, the patient sits 6 meters or 20 feet from the chart. A red or green filter is placed over one eye with the other occluded. The patient is then asked to read the letters on the eye chart out loud, starting from the top row and working their way down. The colored filter is then switched to green, and the patient rereads the chart with the other eye covered. This is repeated in the contralateral eye. The test results are compared to determine whether the patient is nearsighted, farsighted, or has no significant refractive error. If the patient reads more letters with the red filter, they are likely to be nearsighted (myopic), while if they read more letters with the green filter, they are likely to be farsighted (hyperopic).

This version of the duochrome or bichrome test is a useful screening tool for detecting refractive errors, but it is not a substitute for a comprehensive eye exam. If the test indicates a possible refractive error, the patient should be referred to an eye care professional for further evaluation and treatment.
