Embryological formation of the vertebral column secondarily gives rise to the vertebral canal. During gastrulation, there are three germ layers: mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm. The paraxial portion of the mesoderm will ultimately differentiate into forty-two pairs of segments, somites, that develop in a cephalocaudal direction during embryological development. The somites will further develop into dermatomyotomes and sclerotomes. The sclerotomes will later develop into the bony structure of the human spine.

The ossification and development of the individual vertebrae that comprise the vertebral column allow the vertebrae to form a foramen through which the spinal cord traverses. Vertebral ossification is very specific, and it includes eight different ossification centers: three primary centers and five secondary centers. The primary centers include the bilateral neural processes and the centrum of the vertebrae. The secondary ossification centers include the transverse process tips, the tip of the spinous process, and the superior and inferior surfaces of the vertebral body.
