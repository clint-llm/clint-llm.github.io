The male urethra is a crucial component of the male genitourinary system. Its function is not limited to just micturition, as it is also an essential portion of the male reproductive system. The urethraÂ is a dynamic fibromuscular tube which serves as the terminal region of both the male urinary and reproductive systems. The average male urethra is 20 cm long and begins within the bladder wall and ends in the distal glans of the penis.
