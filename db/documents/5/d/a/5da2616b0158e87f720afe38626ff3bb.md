Aphthous ulcerations are initially and primarily the result of T cell-mediated immune dysfunction but also may involve neutrophil and mast cell-mediated destruction of the mucosal epithelium. Lesions can have alterations in several intercellular mediators, such as elevations in interferon gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukins (IL)-2, IL-4 and IL-5, as well as various adhesion molecules involved in cell communication and epithelial integrity. This inflammatory process results in a pseudomembrane containing fibrinous exudate, bacteria, inflammatory cells, and necrotic mucosal cells.

Aphthous ulcers occur on non-keratinized oral mucosae such as along the labial or buccal surfaces, soft palate, the floor of the mouth, the ventral or lateral surface of the tongue, tonsillar fauces, free (marginal or unattached) gingiva adjacent to teeth, and alveolar gingiva in the maxillary and mandibular sulci. In contrast, ulcerations from herpes simplex virus (HSV) involve the keratinized mucosal surfaces such as the attached gingival and dorsum of the tongue, lips, and hard palate.
