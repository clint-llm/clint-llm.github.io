PMT should be considered in any patient with a dual-chamber pacemaker presenting with tachycardia. EKG done during the episodes shows ventricular pacing at or slightly below the upper rate limit, with atrial sensing and A-V association.

Definitive diagnosis is achieved by performing device interrogation and examining the telemetered intracardiac electrograms. This will show retrograde conduction with atrial sensed beats following ventricular paced beats, whereas in normal situations, the atrial sensed beats should precede ventricular pacing.
