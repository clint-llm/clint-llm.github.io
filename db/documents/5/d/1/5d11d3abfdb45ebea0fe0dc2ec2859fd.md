The following items are pertinent to the clinical assessment of the status of the vascular system:

- Blood pressure (BP): normal BP -  less than 120 (systolic [S]) and  under 80 (diastolic [D]); elevated BP - 120 to 129 S and less than 80 D; hypertension stage 1: 130 to 139 S or 80 to 89 D; hypertension stage 2: over 140 S or greater than 90 D; hypertensive crisis: over 180 S and/or greater than 120 D.

- Pulses - Palpation in the arterial regions of the carotid, femoral, popliteal, dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial, etc. for the distribution of blood flow.

- Bruit – Auscultation for vibration sound localized to an arterial wall that is caused by turbulence and suggests a lesion.

- Skin findings – Cyanosis, pallor, edema, and ulceration can indicate a vascular etiology. With ulceration, distal ulceration of the foot is more associated with an arterial etiology compared to ulceration of the malleolar region, which better suggests a venous cause.

- Capillary refill – Refers to the amount of time required for refill after compression of a nailbed, and indicates perfusion status.
