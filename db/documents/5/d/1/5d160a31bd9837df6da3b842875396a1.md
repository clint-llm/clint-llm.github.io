The adverse effects associated with the administration of lumateperone are mild to moderate.

In a Phase III clinical trial consisting of 148 participants who received the currently FDA-approved dosage of 42 mg, 17.6% experienced somnolence, 12.7% experienced sedation, and  5.3% experienced fatigue. Overall, 64.7% of this group experienced adverse effects.

Another clinical trial compared lumateperone to a standard-of-care antipsychotic consisting of 302 patients for six weeks. Those who switched to lumateperone from their current antipsychotics experienced statistically significant improvements in parameters measuring LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and prolactin levels.
