Tests for potential vision gather data starting from the retina up to the visual cortex. While some tests, like the electroretinogram, test the photoreceptors and bipolar cells, others, like the visually evoked potential, test the entire visual pathway up to the visual cortex. They allow for evaluating the integrity and functioning of the visual system.
