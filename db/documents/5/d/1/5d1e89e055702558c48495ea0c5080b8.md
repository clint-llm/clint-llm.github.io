Tenecteplase (sometimes abbreviated TNK, although this is discouraged by the Institute for Safe Medicine Practices)Â is a thrombolytic agent manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. Tenecteplase is an FDA-approved medication specifically indicated for reducing mortality in patients with ST-elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). Off-label indications include thrombolysis in treating acute ischemic stroke, pulmonary embolism, and central venous catheter clearance. The most widely used indications are acute myocardial infarction and acute ischemic stroke.

Tenecteplase has emerged as the preferred thrombolytic agent for the management of acute myocardial infarction due to its efficacy, convenience, and cost-effectiveness compared to the FDA-approved alteplase. While tenecteplase is not FDA-approved for acute ischemic strokes, its off-label use is increasing due to its favorable attributes such as single-dose intravenous administration and lower cost when compared to alteplase.Tenecteplase, administered at the stroke dosage of 0.25 mg/kg up to 25 mg, is a more cost-effective option compared to alteplase for stroke treatment in the US market, with a cost difference of approximately $3000.
