The epidemiology of psoriatic arthritis is heterogeneous and varies widely amongst various population groups. It has been estimated to have a prevalence of 0.05% to 0.25% in the general population and around 6% to 41% in psoriasis patients.

In most patients, the onset of skin disease precedes that of arthritis (68%); in about 15% of patients, the arthritic manifestations coincide with the skin disease, and in 17% of patients, arthritis occurs before the skin manifestations making the diagnosis more difficult.

A literature review of the epidemiology of psoriatic arthritis showed a worldwide prevalence of PsA ranges from 0.1% to 1%.

The pooled prevalence of PsA in patients with PsO is 19.7%, 21.6% in adults, and 3.3% in children.
