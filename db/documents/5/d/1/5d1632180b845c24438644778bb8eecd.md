The diaphragm is a dome-shaped structure that separates the abdominal and thoracic cavity. It's composed of slow-twitch type I and fast-twitch type IIa myofibers. These muscle fibers originate from the lumbar vertebrae and abdominal wall, the ribs and the xiphoid process, and the floating ribs. It is innervated by phrenic nerves that arise from the nerve roots from C3 to C5. The phrenic nerve trifurcates at the dome of the diaphragm just prior to enervation. The diaphragm opposes the lower rib cages from the sides called a zone of apposition. As the diaphragm contracts, it pushes down into the abdominal cavity, generating a negative pressure in the lungs, which drives the air into the lungs. As the diaphragm relaxes, the elastic recoil of the lungs pushes the air out. In a cervical SCI, there is direct damage to the respiratory bulbospinal pathways. In higher SCI, the spinal roots to phrenic nerves are spared; however, there is an interruption in the roots from the respiratory center in the brain to the medulla.
