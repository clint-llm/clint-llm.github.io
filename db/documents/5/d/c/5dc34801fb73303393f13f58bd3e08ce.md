- Riedel thyroiditis is an extremely rare form of fibrosing thyroiditis. It can occur in isolation or in association with other fibrosing disorders.

- Clinically, it presents as a woody hard mass in the neck region.

- The involvement of extrathyroidal structures in the neck is a characteristic feature and can result in dyspnea, dysphagia, stridor, and dysphonia.

- Ultrasonography would show a hypoechoic hypovascular mass. CT and PET scans are useful for assessing extra-thyroidal extension and remote areas of fibrosis,Â respectively.

- Establishing a diagnosis is by performing an open biopsy. Fibrous tissue with an eosinophilic infiltrate is characteristic of Riedel thyroiditis.

- Surgery is challenging due to the lack of tissue planes between the fibrotic and normal tissue. Therefore, performing a limited extent of surgery is for the relief of obstructive symptoms.

- Medical treatment is with glucocorticoids and tamoxifen. There appears to be a potential role for mycophenolate mofetil, which needs to be studied further.
