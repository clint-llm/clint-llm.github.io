Worldwide, atherosclerosis is the most common cause of morbidity and mortality manifesting as cardiovascular disease, carotid artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and renal artery stenosis.

Some of the types of stents used are:

1. Coronary angioplasty

- Bare metal stent

- Drug-eluting stent

- 
              
- Early generation drug-eluting stents: Sirolimus-eluting stent and Paclitaxel-eluting stent
              
              
- Durable polymer drug-eluting stents: Everolimus-eluting stent, Zotarolimus eluting stent, Ridaforolimus-eluting stent
              
              
- Bioabsorbable polymer drug-eluting stents
              
              
- 
                  
- Thin-strut bioabsorbable polymer DES
                  
                  
- Ultra-thin strut DES: Orsiro stent
                  
                

              
              
- Polymer free DES
              
              
- Others: Combo stent - sirolimus elution from biodegradable polymer matrix which is abluminal in shape with a CD34 antibody layer

The choice of stent depends on local availability and interventional cardiologist's expertise - Everolimus-eluting stents, Zotarolimus-eluting stent, ridaforolimus-eluting stents, and the biodegradable stent are usually the first choice. A bare-metal stent is preferred in cases where the patient is actively bleeding, or the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy cannot be >30 days e.g., non-cardiac surgery within 4-6 weeks of PCI.

2. Carotid angioplasty

- Self Expanding Stents

- 
              
- Cobalto alloy braided mesh stent
              
              
- Nitinol open-cell stents (cylindrical or tapered)
              
              
- Nitinol closed-cell stents
              
              
- Hybrid nitinol stent

- New Hybrid Carotid Stent

There is no clear guideline on which stent is ideal; there is a trend towards a tailored approach where the choice of stent and procedure is made based on individual carotid anatomy, plaque complexity, anatomopathological variables, and local availability and technical expertise.

3. Peripheral arteries

- Balloon-expandable stents

- Self-expandable stents

- Covered stents

- Drug-eluting stents

- Drug coated balloon stent

- Dual therapy stents

- Bioabsorbable vascular scaffold

- Bioengineered stent

The choice of an appropriate stent depends on the access site, lesion location, stent availability, plaque complexity, and vascular anatomy evaluation, and expertise of the operator.

Angioplasty is sometimes combined with atherectomy procedures to remove the plaque using specialized devices. Types of atherectomy procedures are Mechanical: Directional, Rotational, or Orbital devices or Laser evaporative methods that require the use of costly disposable devices. Evidence regarding their efficacy is lacking, and their use is still under investigation in specific niche indications.
