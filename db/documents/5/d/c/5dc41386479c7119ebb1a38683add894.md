Many doctors and hospital staff aim to reduce the time a patient spends at a medical facility due to acquired infections. One of these acquired infections includes Staphylococcus epidermidis. S. epidermidis can avoid phagocytosis by excreting polysaccharides. These polysaccharides prevent opsonins from recognizing the pathogen. S. epidermidis becomes increasingly resistant to antibiotics increasing the need to develop another approach to treat gram-positive and gram-negative infections. Artificial opsonin is a therapeutic strategy to enhance phagocytosis in immunocompromised patients and patients infected with antibiotic-resistant pathogens.

Opsonophagocytosis killing assay (OPKA), is an in vitro assay commonly used in vaccine research. It can quantitatively measure antibody-mediated opsonophagocytosis. Researchers have used OPKA in studying various pathogens that have caused substantial deaths worldwide. For example, the researchers recently used it to study the efficiency of a vaccine against group A Streptococcus (GAS).Streptococcus.
