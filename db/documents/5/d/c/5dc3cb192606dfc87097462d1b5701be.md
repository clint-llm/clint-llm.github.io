The differential diagnoses of SSADH deficiency include other disorders of GABA metabolism, which include GABA transaminase deficiency and homocarnosinosis.Â GABA transaminase deficiency results from mutations in the ABAT gene and the clinical features are characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, hypersomnolence, movement disorder, and seizures.

Another important consideration is other disorders causing bilateral symmetrical signal changes in the globus pallidum. These disorders include organic acidemias, especially methylmalonic academia, mitochondrial disorders, pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. Late-onset isolated sulfite oxidase deficiency (ISOD) is another disorder with globus pallidus signal changes.
