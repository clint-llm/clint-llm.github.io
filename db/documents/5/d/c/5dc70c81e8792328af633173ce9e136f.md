In order to understand the anesthetic indications, one must first delineate the surgical interventions.

More commonly, as the patients age, they will receive several potential surgeries depending on their manifestation of the syndrome. In general, the surgical goal is to wait for the facial skeleton and tissues to finish normal development before intervention.

If the temporomandibular joint fails to develop, early surgical intervention can be indicated between 6 and 12 years of age (normal development finishes between 16 and 20 years of age).

The majority of patients will undergo any needed major surgery when they reach skeletal maturity.Â Determining this age is often a team undertaking with serial radiographs and measurements done to determine when growth is finished, with females generally finishing earlier than males. Generally, it will be between 16 and 20 years of age.
