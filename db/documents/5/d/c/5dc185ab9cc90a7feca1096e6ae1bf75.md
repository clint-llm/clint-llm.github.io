The presence of focal neurologic findings or mental status changes is predictive of complications following trauma. A neurologic examination helps to localize and lateralize lesions due to traumatic head or spine injury. The physical examination in the setting of significant trauma must be assessed rapidly, is individualized based on the patient's medical stability, combativeness, and type of injuries, and is often performed under chaotic circumstances.
