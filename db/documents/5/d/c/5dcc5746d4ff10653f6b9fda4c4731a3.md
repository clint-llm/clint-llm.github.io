The prognosis of sarcopenia largely depends on age, comorbidities, falls, and fractures. Additionally, patients who have sarcopenia undergoing surgical procedures have less favorable outcomes than those without sarcopenia. These include an increased risk of postoperative complications, falls, LOS, fractures, and greater morbidity and mortality. Ultimately, the prognosis of sarcopenia alone is uncertain and not well studied, thoughÂ consistent evidence demonstrates sarcopenia as an indicator of poor prognosis in several medical conditions and surgical procedures.
