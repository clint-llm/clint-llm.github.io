Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the knee is a somewhat rare cause of knee dysfunction and pain that has been recognized for over one hundred years, but the etiology is still poorly understood.

Patients with osteochondritis dissecans can present with knee pain as the primary complaint, or osteochondritis dissecans can be discovered incidentally on radiographs obtained for unrelated injuries.
