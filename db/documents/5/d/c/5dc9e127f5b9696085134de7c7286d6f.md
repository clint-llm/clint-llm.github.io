**Surrogate Marker for Malnutrition**

The thickness of the adductor pollicis muscle (TAPM) has been proposed recently as a relatively accurate marker of malnutrition in surgical patients.

**Thumb-in-Palm Deformity**

One of the most common manifestations of cerebral palsy in the upper extremity is the thumb-in-palm deformity. This is characterized by a fixed contraction of the thumb at the MCP joint into the palm. Because of the dynamic interplay of many muscles on thumb positioning and movement, correcting significant deformity poses a unique surgical challenge.  There are two main muscle issues which lead to the thumb-in-palm deformity in cerebral palsy

- Spasticity and contraction of thenar adduction muscles

- Weakness of voluntary control of thenar abduction muscles

Mild thumb-in-palm deformities can be initially treated with a combination of botulinum toxin injections, occupational therapy, and splinting.

The most common type of thumb-in-palm deformity is a type 1 deformity where the first digit is adducted across the palm.

- Release/lengthen spastic muscles: Releasing the adductor pollicis muscle in the palm can achieve this.

- Augment the weak/flaccid muscles: Rerouting of the extensor pollicis longus to the first dorsal compartment increases the strength of the muscle.

- Stabilize the joint if unstable.

Several other surgical techniques are available to correct this particular deformity along with additional different subtypes of the thumb-in-palm deformity. This surgery, combined with a patient dedicated to post-operative rehabilitation, typically has a very good prognosis in regards to regaining dexterity.
