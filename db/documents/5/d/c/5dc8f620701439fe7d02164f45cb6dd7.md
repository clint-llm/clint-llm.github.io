Dobutamine toxicity is rare, and the half-life is short at 2 minutes. Symptoms are generally due to sympathetic overstimulation and can include chest pain, palpitations, headaches, tremors, shortness of breath, nausea, and vomiting. To reverse the tachycardia caused by dobutamine, metoprolol intravenous can be given.
