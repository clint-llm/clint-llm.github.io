The following are the functions of GnIH:

- Inhibits gonadotropin (FSH and LH) secretion from the anterior pituitary gland

- Inhibits reproduction and reproductive behavior

- Inhibition of gonadal development

- Regulator of steroidogenesis and gametogenesis

- Decreases LH pulse amplitude

- Involved in pubertal delay due to imbalance in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG) and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axes

- Mediates stress-induced reproductive dysfunction
