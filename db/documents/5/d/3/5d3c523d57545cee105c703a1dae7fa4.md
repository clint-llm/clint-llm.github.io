Many of the complications of episiotomy are similar to those of spontaneous perineal tears. For this reason, one must ensure that the benefits of the procedure outweigh the risks during the decision-making process.

The adverse effects of episiotomy include bleeding, prolonged wound healing, complications in subsequent vaginal deliveries, dyspareunia, pelvic floor dysfunction, urinary fistulas, and inappropriate wound scarring.

The most important complication of an episiotomy is an injury to the external anal sphincter muscle, which can lead to incontinence and fistula formation. It is important to note that the use of episiotomy does not protect women from such complications. However, there was one literature review showing that the median episiotomy approach increases the risk of anal sphincter injury when compared to the mediolateral technique.
