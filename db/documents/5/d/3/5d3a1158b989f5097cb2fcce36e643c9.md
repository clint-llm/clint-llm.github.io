History and physical exam are vital for disease recognition, treatment, and prevention. The patient encounter starts with vitals and general appearance, which can clue a clinician into potential diseases such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome. Although no identified genetic group is predisposed to metabolic syndrome, there are genetic disorders that may predispose individuals to the development of the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Therefore, a patient should be questioned about any such potential genetic disorders. Social and lifestyle history should also be obtained, as there are modifiable factors that can significantly impact the development of the metabolic syndrome.  A physical exam is crucial for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome as one of the criteria involves the waist circumference. Furthermore, if suspected, the patient should be screened for physical manifestations of insulin resistance such as peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy, acanthosis nigricans. A clinician should listen for arterial bruits that could be due to atherosclerotic disease. Patients with dyslipidemia may present with xanthomas.  Thus, a thorough physical examination is vital to the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome.
