Multiple variables determine the prognosis of each case of viral pneumonia, such as the following:

- The relative for virulence of the species of infecting virus-for example, hantavirus, SARS, or MERS carries a much worse prognosis than RSV or influenza virus.

- The immune competence of the patient such that immune impaired patients with HIV carry a much worse prognosis than a gravid female or a previously well, immuno-competent baby.

- The underlying pathologies of the patient, such as the presence of COPD, congestive heart failure, diabetes, cancer, and/or hematological dyscrasias, greatly increases the anticipated morbidity and mortality.

- The presence or absence of concomitant bacterial infection

- The relative point during the infective process at which diagnosis was made and definitive treatment started (if available).
