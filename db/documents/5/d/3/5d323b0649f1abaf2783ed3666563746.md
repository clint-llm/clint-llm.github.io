The anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap, which was first described by Song (1984), is now well-established in reconstructive microsurgery as a workhorse flap. It is a versatile flap with many excellent attributes that include long vascular pedicle with adequate vessel diameter, ability to harvest large areas of skin without added donor site morbidity, adaptability for use as a sensate flap, use as a flow-through flap for vascular gaps in the extremities, flexibility of the flap to be folded for use as a double skin paddle, and use as a chimeric flap to reconstruct composite soft tissue defects almost anywhere in the body. A two-team approachÂ permits simultaneous flap harvest and resection/debridement at the recipient area. The ALT flap can also be used for breast reconstruction if lower abdominal skin is unavailable due to previous scars or surgeries.

The ALT flap is relatively easy to harvest if the principles of perforator dissection are followed. The vascularity of the flap is reliable even though there is some variability in its perforator anatomy.
