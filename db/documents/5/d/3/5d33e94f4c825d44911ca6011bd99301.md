Illnesses caused by E. coli can be prevented by regular hand washing, washing fruits and vegetables, and thoroughly cooking meat. When traveling to areas with inadequate sanitation practices, such as in many developing regions, illness can be avoided through consuming purified water and thoroughly cooking food or by rinsing raw fruits and vegetables in purified water. When infection cannot be avoided, or patients are at high risk for complications of diarrheal illness (e.g., immunosuppressed), prophylactic antibiotics can significantly reduce disease. The ISTM recommends travelers at risk for contracting diarrheal illnesses who require antibiotic prophylaxis should take rifaximin or bismuth-subsalicylate for chemoprophylaxis.

- Rifaximin: 200 mg 1-3 times daily for the duration of travel; not to exceed two weeks (first line)

- Bismuth-subsalicylate: 524 mg every 30 – 60 minutes as needed up to 8 doses in 24 hours (second line)

Reducing the risk of extraintestinal infections is disease-specific but includes interventions such as reducing the use of indwelling medical devices to prevent catheter-associated urinary tract infections. Developing ICU protocols to reduce aspiration risks, including elevating the patient’s head of the bed to 30 degrees, leads to lower rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
