The managing strategy for managing accommodative excess goals on eliminating the underlying cause ( functional or organic) and improving visual hygiene is important in the case of functional etiologies.

Treatment options for the accommodative excess can be an optical correction, vision therapy, pharmacological, and a combination of them.

- Optical correction: refractive error correction with appropriate spectacle is the first consideration for managing accommodation excess because uncorrected refractive errors can cause accommodative fatigue. The correction should be given after cycloplegic refraction. In addition, near work should be restricted for a period.

- Vision therapy (VT): The objective of vision therapy in accommodative excess aims to improve accommodative amplitude and improvement of the accommodative facilities.

The target of vision therapy is to normalize the accommodative amplitude. This is followed by increasing the speed of response on accommodative stimulation. Finally, normalize accommodative and vergence reflexes and maintain them.

- Pharmacological: The most effective option is to use cycloplegic drugs to relax the ciliary muscle spasm. Atropine 1% show a better result than other cycloplegic drugs like homatropine 2%, cyclopentolate 1%, and tropicamide 1%; they are associated with ocular discomfort and near vision problem.
