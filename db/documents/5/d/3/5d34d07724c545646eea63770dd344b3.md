Because of inferior vena cava syndrome (IVCS) is not a primary diagnosis; it is often missed and leads to adverse outcomes for the patients. Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is a better-recognized entity because of its specific presentation: right upper extremity swelling with skin discoloration and signs of decreased blood return to the right heart. In contrast, IVCS causes bilaterally lower extremity swelling, which can be misdiagnosed as congestive heart failure exacerbation, nephrotic syndrome, lymphangitis, or varicose veins.

IVCS can also be accompanied by symptoms consistent with hemodynamic instability, which can mimic several conditions such as circulatory shock, cardiogenic shock, pulmonary embolism, acute heart failure, acute pulmonary edema, etc. As a result, the responsibility of the entire interprofessional team, which includes both primary care providers, specialists such as trauma surgeons, transplant surgeons, hematologists, oncologists, and general surgeons, to name a few, nurses, social workers, pharmacists to counsel regarding medications that can cause prothrombotic states to advise the patients on how to reduce the risk of thrombosis, counsel on the importance of medications compliance if the patient is on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, and to promote lifestyle modifications to reduce the risk of thrombosis as well as obstruction of the IVC, which can cause severe morbidity and increased risk of mortality.
