**Cone Light Adaptation**

Light adaptation principally involves Ca, which acts as a second messenger to effect negative feedback upon light-driven membrane hyperpolarization. This negative feedback helps photoreceptors to avoid response saturation. The difference between the light levels at which rods and cones are capable of signaling arises from the fact that cones forego high sensitivity for much more effective light adaptation and therefore a broader signaling range

**Cone Pathways**

Within the retina, cone signals transmit through bipolar cells (BCs) to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that transmit retinal signals to the brain via the optic nerve. Influences from horizontal and amacrine cells shape Cone-to-BC and BC-to-RGC signaling within the retina.
