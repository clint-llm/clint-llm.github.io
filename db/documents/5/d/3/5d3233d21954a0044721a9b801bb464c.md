Airway suctioning is a procedure routinely performed in inpatient and outpatient settings. It is important to maintain the patency of the natural or artificial airway to allow for adequate airflow for gas exchange. It is essential for all healthcare personnel and family members who take care of patients with an artificial airway to be familiar with this procedure and potential complications to minimize adverse outcomes. This activity reviews the indications, preparation, and technique needed by the interprofessional team to perform this simple procedure in different settings.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications and contraindications of airway suctioning.
- Outline the preparation and equipment needed for airway suctioning.
- Review the procedure of airway suctioning and its common complications.
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients requiring airway suctioning to help improve outcomes.
