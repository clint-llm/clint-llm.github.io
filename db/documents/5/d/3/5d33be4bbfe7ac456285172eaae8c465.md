Mucoceles and ranulas are among the most common disorders of the salivary glands. Mucocele, which is of minor salivary gland origin, arises when there is a disruption of the flow of its secretions. Mucoceles are of two types: extravasation mucoceles and retention mucoceles. The former results mostly from trauma to the salivary duct, leading to the collection of secretions in the connective tissue.

Ranulas are mucoceles that are of major salivary gland origin and occur on the floor of the mouth. Like mucoceles, these lesions also have two types: oral ranulas and cervical/plunging ranulas. While the oral ranulas form because of leakage and accumulation of secretions of major salivary gland above the mylohyoid muscles, cervical/plunging ranulas result from the collection of mucus along the fascial planes of the neck.
