When the diagnosis of MIRM is being entertained, consultation with infectious diseases specialists or dermatology may be helpful. Consultation with otolaryngology, ophthalmology, gastroenterology, and urology may be obtained for site-dependent mucosal lesions to help mitigate long-term sequelae. Burn specialists should be consulted for extensive cutaneous lesions with detachment.
