The tibialis anterior is one of four muscles in the anterior compartment of the leg. The others include extensor digitorum longus (EDL), extensor hallucis longus (EHL), and fibularis tertius. The deep peroneal nerve innervates all muscles and is perfused by the anterior tibial artery. Collectively, the muscles dorsiflex and invert the foot at the ankle joint. The extensors (EDL and EHL) also extend the toes; the EDL extends the lateral four toes while the EHL extends the great toe. The fibularis tertius arises from the inferior EDL and contributes to eversion.

The antagonist muscles of the anterior compartment are the muscles of the posterior compartment. Collectively, the posterior muscles plantarflex the foot at the ankle joint.
