**Radiculopathy and Loss of Reflexes**

Radicular pain is irritation or inflammation of a nerve root. This is usually due to disc herniation. The symptoms include pain that travels in a dermatomal fashion. Motor deficits, as well as sensory deficits, can occur due to disc herniations.

**Femoral Hernia**

Femoral hernias are less likely to occur than inguinal hernias; however, they are more likely to occur in elderly females. They are protrusions of abdominal contents through a weakening in the femoral canal. They create a bulge in the groin area and can lead to strangulation and necrosis of abdominal contents if not treated. Because the hernia sac is located in the femoral canal, the femoral vein will be located lateral to the hernia sac.

**Psoas Abscess/Hematoma**

Any infection or hematoma can cause a mass effect injury near the psoas muscle or iliacus muscle. Due to the relationship of these muscles to the femoral nerve, the growing abscess or hematoma can begin to compress the femoral nerve. This can lead to nerve injury, potentially affecting motor or sensory innervation from the femoral nerve.

**Femoral and Saphenous Nerve Blocks**

Femoral nerve blocks are common in the management of hip pain in hip fracture patients; this is because they avoid the side effects and addictive properties of opioids. The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) blocks target articular branches of the femoral nerve to alleviate pain in the hip.

**Femoral Nerve Damage**

- The most common etiology is direct, sharp trauma.

- A compressive etiology can damage the nerve due to ischemia, such as hematoma or tumor.

- Iatrogenic injuries have been reported following intraabdominal operations and hip surgeries due to prolonged compression, retraction, or stretching of the nerve.

- Proximal interlocking screw placement through femoral IM nailing can be a risk factor for iatrogenic injury of the femoral nerve.

- Although uncommon,Â femoral nerve neuropathy has been reported in complex anterior and posterior spinal surgery.

Clinically, patients will have quadriceps wasting, loss of knee extension, and to a lesser extent, hip flexion due to the involvement of the iliacus and pectineus muscles. On the sensory side, there will be a loss of sensation over the anterior and medial thigh due to the involvement of the anterior and medial cutaneous nerves of the thigh. Furthermore, loss of sensation will occur over the medial aspect of the lower leg and foot due to the involvement of the saphenous nerve. Although the prognosis in most cases is satisfactory, some cases necessitate nerve repair or grafting, and some cases cause permanent residual neurologic deficits.

**Femoral Neuropathy in Obstetric Patients Undergoing Vaginal Delivery**

Femoral neuropathies may occur during vaginal delivery. Commonly, patients are put in the dorsal lithotomy position, in which the thigh is flexed at the hip, and the leg is flexed at the knee. This position compresses the femoral nerve against the inguinal ligament, compromising the blood supply to the nerve. At the end of the delivery, the patient attempts to stand and falls to the floor because the quadriceps femoris muscle is not functional due to the loss of its innervation by the femoral nerve. The quadriceps femoris muscle inserts onto the patella. The patellar ligament attaches to the tibial tuberosity. When the quadriceps femoris muscle contracts, it extends the leg at the knee. This action is crucial to prevent the leg from buckling. Thus, if one is assisting the patient in arising from a gurney after delivery, one must be able to catch the patient if she falls due to femoral neuropathy.

An interesting variation is seen in patients who experience signs and symptoms that indicate femoral neuropathy. However, they also have other signs demonstrating this is not a true femoral neuropathy. For example, the patient appears to have not only femoral neuropathy but also a foot drop. The presence of foot drop indicates that this patient does not have a true femoral neuropathy but rather a lumbosacral plexopathy. This condition is also associated with a difficult delivery.

**Femoral Neuropathy caused by Surgical Treatment of the Fracture of the Patella**

The surgical repair of a patellar fracture can cause femoral neuropathy.

**Testing the Femoral Nerve**

The femoral nerve can be tested by the following procedure. The patient is placed in a prone position. The leg is flexed at the knee, and the examiner raises the leg (Reverse Lasegue test). Hyperextension of the hip with the leg flexed at the knee causes stretching of the femoral nerve with consequent pain.

**Testing the Patellar Tendon Reflex**

The patellar tendon reflex is tested by tapping the patellar tendon with a reflex hammer, causing a reflex contraction of the quadriceps femoris muscle. This reflex involves the femoral nerve and the L2-L4 ventral primary rami. The muscle spindle fibers of the quadriceps femoris are stimulated by tapping the patellar tendon. They cause activation of sensory axons that have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia from L2-L4 because they are innervated by the femoral nerve. The central processes of the cells of the dorsal root ganglia enter the spinal cord by the dorsal roots and then pass to the alpha-motor neurons of the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Stimulation of these neurons, whose axons are located in the femoral nerve, causes contraction of the quadriceps femoris muscle. This reflex is involved in maintaining tone in the quadriceps femoris muscle. The activity in this circuit can be modulated by neurons from higher influences.

**Reasons for performing a patellar tendon reflex**

**Decreased Patellar Tendon Reflex.**Diseases of the lower motor neurons connecting the ventral horn of the spinal cord to the quadriceps femoris muscle may take several forms. For example, poliomyelitis is an infection by a virus that attacks and kills the alpha-motor neurons of the spinal cord. This can result in paralysis and death of the lower limb muscles, including the quadriceps femoris muscle. In this case, the result is a lower motor neuron syndrome. Damage to the femoral nerve (femoral neuropathy) from various causes ranging from trauma to poliomyelitis to a spinal cord injury will cause decreased or absent patellar tendon reflexes (hyporeflexia).

**Increased patellar tendon reflexes**may be seen in cerebrovascular accidents (strokes). Here the neurons that run in the pathway from the motor cortex to the corticospinal tracts to the alpha-motor neurons are damaged or destroyed. This causes weakness (paresis) or frank paralysis (plegia). In addition, there are suppressor fibers that run with the lateral corticospinal tracts to the alpha-motor neurons. These neurons suppress the patellar tendon reflex. In the presence of a brain injury due to trauma or stroke, the loss of the suppressor neurons causes hyperreflexia (increased deep tendon reflexes).
