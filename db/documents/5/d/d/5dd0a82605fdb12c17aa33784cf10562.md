The prognosis for CEA is very good, with most children (80% to 90%) achieving remission by 12 years of age. Typical absence seizures are responsive to one or two AEDs in most cases. Prognosis becomes less favorable depending on how it is defined (particularly age of onset) and whether other seizure types develop. However, there is debate regarding whether these cases represent one of the other idiopathic (genetic) generalized epilepsies such as JAE or JME.
