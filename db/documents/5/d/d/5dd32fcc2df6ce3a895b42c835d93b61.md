Transvaginal ultrasound imaging is unique in its ability to closely visualize the female reproductive organs that would otherwise be difficult to see on transabdominal ultrasound. Additionally, unlike computer tomography (CT), this is a more up-close imaging modality without the utilization of ionizing radiation. There are many indications for this, both diagnostic and interventional. An ultrasound technician first conducts a transabdominal scan for a thorough exam and follows it with a transvaginal ultrasonographic exam. Images are uploaded to a picture archiving and communication system or PACS system for the radiologist to interpret.

Adnexal/ovarian masses and cysts, endometrial pathologies, fibroids, and pregnancyÂ  (ectopic and intrauterine), as well as evaluation of developmental anomalies, are a non-exhaustive list of indications that are commonly evaluated with this imaging modality.
