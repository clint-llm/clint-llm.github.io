The pathophysiology of PPS can be divided into two groups, alpha-synucleinopathies and tauopathies. These groups allude to the type of protein (alpha-synuclein and tau proteins) which folds into a toxic and cell-damaging form.

In tauopathies such as PSP and CBD, cytoskeleton proteins become abnormally phosphorylated, leading to the development of tau inclusions in neurons and glial cells.

The specific PPS condition is related to the type of neurons targeted and the location of these toxic proteins in the brain.

**Lewy Body Dementia (LBD)**

In LBD, alpha-synuclein dysfunction and associated Lewy body deposits contribute to the impairment of particularly susceptible dopaminergic and cholinergic neurons.

**Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)**

MSA is suggested to be due to the prion-like spreading of alpha-synuclein proteins primarily, as well as glial cytoplasmic inclusions of tau and ubiquitin proteins.

**Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP)**

PSP involves tau cytoplasmic inclusions within neurons, referred to as neurofibrillary tangles.

**Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD)**

CBD is associated with tau astrocytic plaques and inclusions in the glia. These tau proteins lead to severe gliosis, neuronal loss, and ballooned achromatic neurons.
