Celiac artery compression syndrome may mimic several other medical conditions posing a diagnostic challenge for the physician. It can be mistaken for other conditions that can cause post-prandial pain such as gallbladder disease including biliary dyskinesia and cholecystitis. Other intra-abdominal pathologies such as appendicitis, colorectal malignancy, hepatitis, gastroparesis and gastritis/peptic ulcer disease can also mimic celiac artery compression syndrome. Furthermore, chronic mesenteric ischemia secondary to atherosclerotic disease may have a similar presentation as celiac artery compression syndrome. Some of these conditions may co-exist simultaneously as well. Presence for abdominal bruit on examination may lead to consideration for other entities such as renal artery stenosis or arteriovenous malformations.
