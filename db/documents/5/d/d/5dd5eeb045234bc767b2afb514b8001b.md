Erb palsy is a disorder of clinical diagnosis, but some interventions can confirm it. MRI of the brachial plexus and cervical cord is likely the best imaging technique if required. An MRI can also exclude any cancer or tumor that may affect the brachial plexus. An X-ray of the baby's shoulder excludes any fractured bone or problems with the shoulder or elbow joints. Electromyography (EMG) results can estimate and record the electrical activity of the muscle, with absent fibrillations likely indicating neuropraxia. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) can measure the time required for the electrical stimulus to move through a particular nerve.Â  CT myelography works by injecting the contrast material to give detail of the neonate spinal cord and nerve root.
