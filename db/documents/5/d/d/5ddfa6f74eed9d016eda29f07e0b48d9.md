Sweet syndrome may be idiopathic, which is most common, or may be associated with an underlying condition.

Several malignancies have reported correlations with Sweet syndrome, including myeloproliferative disorders (myelodysplasia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, multiple myeloma, monoclonal gammopathy, lymphoma, and rarely with solid tumors. Sweet syndrome may occur before, at the time of or after the diagnosis of malignancy. When associated with malignancy, it is more likely to be associated with older age of onset and cytopenias. Pathological features with the histiocytoid sweet syndrome are more likely to be associated with malignancy, especially myelodysplastic syndrome.

Sweet syndrome can also occur in association with several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. These include inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease), rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome, Hashimoto thyroiditis, Behcet disease, and dermatomyositis.

Post-infectious Sweet syndrome has been described 1 to 3 weeks after upper respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Association with other infections such as HIV, viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, and there have been some reports of chlamydia infection.

Drug-induced Sweet syndrome has been a well-known entity, with several drugs reported to cause Sweet syndrome. G-CSF is the most common drug, while several others, including antibiotics (minocycline, nitrofurantoin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, norfloxacin, ofloxacin), antihypertensives (hydralazine, furosemide), NSAIDs (diclofenac, celecoxib), immunosuppressives (azathioprine), antiepileptics (carbamazepine, diazepam), anti-cancer (bortezomib, imatinib mesylate, ipilimumab, lenalidomide, topotecan, vemurafenib), antipsychotics (clozapine), antithyroid (propylthiouracil), etc. Sweet syndrome in these cases occurs after exposure as well as re-exposure to the responsible drug and resolves with or without corticosteroids after the withdrawal of the drug.

Pregnancy carries correlations with the development of Sweet syndrome in about 2% of cases. Prognosis is favorable with spontaneous resolution after delivery and no infant or maternal morbidity or mortality.
