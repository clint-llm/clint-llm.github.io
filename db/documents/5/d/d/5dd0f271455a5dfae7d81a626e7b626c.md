Branchial cleft cysts are congenital epithelial cysts that comprise approximately one-third of congenital neck masses. They are benign lesions and can present at any age. They typically present after an upper respiratory tract infection as a waxing and waning neck mass that parallels the course of the illness. This activity explains the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of patients with branchial cleft cysts. It highlights the role of the interprofessional team in treating and decreasing morbidity in patients with branchial cleft cysts.
