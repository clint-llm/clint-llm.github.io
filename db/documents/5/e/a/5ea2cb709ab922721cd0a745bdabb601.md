Donovanosis lesions usually start as a painless papule or subcutaneous nodule. The lesions develop a classic “beefy-red” appearance due to their high vascularity and they tend to bleed easily. The initial lesion takes on an ulcerative morphology after minor trauma. There is usually no regional lymphadenopathy. Developing subcutaneous granulomas known as pseudobuboes is possible. The lesions are progressive in an outward direction from the center. The borders of the lesions are sometimes described as “snake-like” in appearance. Self-inoculation is possible and may create mirror-image lesions in the same general location, usually across skin folds.

The genitals are affected in 90% of cases and the inguinal region in 10% of cases. The most common sites where men are affected are the prepuce, coronal sulcus, frenum, glans, and anus. The most common sites where women are affected are the labia minora, fourchette, cervix, and upper genital tract. Pregnant patients experience quicker progression of donovanosis lesions and respond slower to treatment compared to the general population.

Extragenital lesions occur on the lips, gums, cheek, palate, pharynx, larynx, and chest 6% of the time.

There are four types of lesions.

- Classic ulcerogranulomatous lesions are the most common type of lesion with beefy-red, non-tender ulcers that bleed easily.

- The second type is hypertrophic or verrucous with irregular raise edges and dry texture.

- The third type is necrotic, offensive-smelling, deep ulceration that causes tissue destruction.

- The last type is sclerotic or cicatricial with fibrous and scar tissue.
