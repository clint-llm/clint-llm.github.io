Veins in almost any organ can be thrombosed or occluded. In many cases, because of collateral formation, symptoms do not occur immediately. However, the problem with vein thrombosis is the potential for the clot to embolize. Each year thousands of patients die from a pulmonary embolism, and in most cases, the cause is an embolic blood clot from the extremities. Healthcare workers including nurse practitioners must be aware of the complications of vein obstruction, particularly in the leg and pelvic veins, central neck veins, hepatic veins, and the superior mesenteric veins. In many cases, a duplex ultrasound will reveal the vein obstruction, and appropriate patient referral is necessary.
