Midazolam has poor oral absorption and has an elimination half-life of 1.5 to 2.5 hours. Midazolam converts into its active metabolite alpha-1 hydroxy midazolam, which contributes to 10% of drug action. Midazolam metabolism occurs via hepatic CYP450 enzymes and glucuronide conjugation. The mechanism of action of midazolam indirect and is related to GABA accumulation and its affinity to the benzodiazepine receptors. Two separate receptors for GABA and benzodiazepine couple to a common chloride channel. It increases the frequency of chloride channel opening. Occupation of both the receptors cause membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal inhibition. The anticonvulsant activity of midazolam is related to the excess GABA action on motor circuits in the brain. Midazolam acts on glycine receptors and produces a muscle-relaxing effect. Almost all the pharmacologic effects, including sedation, anxiolysis, anterograde amnesia, and anticonvulsant effect, can are explainable through its action on GABA receptors. Age-related deficits, hepatic, and renal insufficiency, also affect the pharmacokinetics of midazolam.
