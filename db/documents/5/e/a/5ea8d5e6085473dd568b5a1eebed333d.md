The etiology of benign breast disease has demonstrated a strong clinical association with women receiving estrogen and anti-estrogen treatment. The prevalence of benign breast lesions in postmenopausal women receiving estrogens and progestins for over eight years is increased by 1.7 fold. During the Women’s Health Initiative study (WHI), the combined use of estrogen and progestin correlated with a 74% risk of benign breast disease. The use of anti-estrogens led to a 28% reduction in the prevalence of benign proliferative breast disease.

**Study selection criteria**

The analysis used prospective cohort and nested case-control studies of at least 300 cases and meta-analyses.

* Relative risks estimated from standardized incidence ratios.

† Controls were women who had non-proliferative benign breast disease.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) typically presents with factors such as anovulation and hyperandrogenaemia, which is evident in 5 to10% of women within reproductive age.

Previous studies have concluded that hyperestrogenism and anovulation are associated with benign breast conditions, as the growth of glandular breast tissue is affected by the levels of estrogen and progesterone in pathological processes.
