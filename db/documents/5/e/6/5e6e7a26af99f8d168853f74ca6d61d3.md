The treatment of myelophthisic anemia is variable because it has as its basis the underlying etiology. For patients with malignancies, treating, and getting rid of the malignant tissue either through chemotherapy or radiation will help to eliminate the infiltrating tissue taking the space of hematopoietic cells. Rosner et al. (2013) reported a case report where an advanced staged melanoma causing myelophthisis responded to immune checkpoint inhibition with the anti-programmed cell death-1 inhibitor or PD-1 inhibitor, called pembrolizumab.

Because a patient with myelophthisic anemia has low hemoglobin levels, transfusion of packed red blood cells is also indicated. Even though other cell lines are also low, transfusions of platelets or giving leukocytes stimulating medication are also not indicated unless there is severe concurrent bleeding or infections.

For a patient with myelophthisic anemia following primary myelofibrosis, a study demonstrated survival benefits from the use of ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor.
