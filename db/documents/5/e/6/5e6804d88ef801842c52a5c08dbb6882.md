Hartnup disease requires differentiation from other conditions that result in a photosensitive skin rash. The common causes include:

- Nutritional pellagra

- Lupus erythematosus

- Congenital poikiloderma

- Carcinoid syndrome

- Seborrheic eczema

Nutritional pellagra has normal urine analysis. Lupus has specific antinuclear (ANA), anti-Smith, and anti-double-stranded (anti-ds Ab) antibodies in plasma. Carcinoid syndrome is associated with flushing, diarrhea, and elevated levels of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid(5-HIAA) levels in urine. Seborrheic eczema has yellow crusting on skin lesions, and there is a history of allergies.
