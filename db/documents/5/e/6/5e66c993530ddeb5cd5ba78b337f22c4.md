Calcaneus fractures are a severe and life-changing injury.

- Initial care includes full neurovascular and musculoskeletal examination and patient history.  Splinting, ice and elevation will be helpful in improving tissue quality for later operative intervention.

- Correct diagnosis and workup must include orthogonal X-Rays, specialized views, and a CT scan is considered the gold standard for a complete diagnosis.  Consideration must also be given to imaging of other parts of the patient's body based on history given the high energy nature of the injuries that tend to cause calcaneal fractures.

- Patients must be counseled that there are advantages and disadvantages to surgical treatment. The provider must also keep in mind that certain fracture morphologies necessitate surgical care and that certain patient groups will do more poorly with surgery.

- Once the patient and the surgeon have determined to proceed with surgical treatment the goals must include adequate reduction of articular surfaces and restoration of calcaneal morphology.  The surgeon must then determine the appropriate approach and implants required to obtain that goal.

- The patient should be counseled of the expected sequela of surgical treatment and that, despite an adequate reduction, in more severe injuries subtalar osteoarthritis is extremely common.
