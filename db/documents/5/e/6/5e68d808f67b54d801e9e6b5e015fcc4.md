Mohs surgery has had a high degree of clinical success.

- Mohs surgery reports excellent 5-year cure rates for non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC), in particular basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Examples of 5-year cure rates include:Â  Primary BCC (99%), recurrent BCC (94.4%), primary SCC (92-99%), and recurrent SCC (90%).

- Mohs surgery also can be used to treat other less common tumors, including dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, microcystic adnexal carcinoma, extramammary Paget disease, Merkel cell carcinoma, and sebaceous carcinoma.
