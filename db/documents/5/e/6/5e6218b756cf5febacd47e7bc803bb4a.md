Surgeons should excise adenomatous polyps of any type completely and confirm clear margins.

- Average risk (no first-degree relative to colon cancer): Colonoscopy at age 50

- No adenoma or carcinoma, repeat in 10 years

- One to two small (no more than 1 cm) tubular adenomas with low-grade dysplasia, repeat in 5 to 10 years

- Three to ten adenomas, or a large (at least 1 cm) adenoma, or any adenomas with high-grade dysplasia or villous features, repeat in 3 years.

- More than ten adenomas on a single exam, repeat within 3 years

- Increased risk (positive family history in the first-degree relative before age 60, or in two or more first-degree relatives at any age if not a hereditary syndrome) Colonoscopy at age 40, or 10 years before the youngest case in the immediate family (whichever is earlier). Repeat with above surveillance guidelines with the caveat that maximum time between screening should be 5 years.

- High-risk (hereditary colon cancer/polyposis syndromes):

- FAP: Annual flexible sigmoidoscopy; if genetically proven FAP, consider colectomy.

Surgery is necessary if the polyp is more than 2-3 cm, is sessile and the margins are not clean following a polypectomy.
