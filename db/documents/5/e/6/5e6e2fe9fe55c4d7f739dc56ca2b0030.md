Prolactin is one of the hormones secreted by the pituitary gland. Different conditions cause increased secretion of prolactin. The important cause of increased prolactin secretion is a noncancerous tumor of the pituitary gland called a prolactinoma. It can commonly cause menstrual irregularity, milk secretion from the breast, weak bone, headache, and visual field defects. MRI of the brain may be required for the evaluation. This can be treated successfully with medical therapy alone which normalizes prolactin concentration and also reduces the size of the tumor. In a minority of cases, medication is not effective and should be treated with surgery and rarely with radiation.
