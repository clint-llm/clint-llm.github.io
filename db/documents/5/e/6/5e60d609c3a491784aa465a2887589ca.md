Neuromas are benign tumors of the nervous system most commonly arising from non-neural nervous tissue, although they are not considered neoplasms. Certain neuromas have a particular location and symptoms, while others can develop anywhere in the body. The term neuroma is often used for post-traumatic swelling of nerves as well. They develop as an injured nerve starts to heal in an uncontrolled manner resulting in a lump of unorganized axon fibers and non-neural tissue growth. Neuromas often arise post-trauma, including elective surgery. They can be part of a syndrome such as neurofibromatosis, or they can be a true neoplasm such as acoustic neuroma or Morton neuroma.

Diagnosis is mainly clinical, and treatment is most often surgical excision with a strong emphasis on prevention, meaning surgical exploration and repair of nerve injuries.
