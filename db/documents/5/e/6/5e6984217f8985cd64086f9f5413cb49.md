A biopsy is the diagnostic procedure of choice for GCBL. While biopsying a suspected GCBL lesion, care must be taken to go deep and far enough to look for the characteristic broad basis extruding deeply into the underlying tissue. Special attention should also be paid to look for any possible foci of SCC because these usually make recurrence and metastasis more likely.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium contrast is used to look for tumor expansion while planning surgical removal.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy should only be considered when sufficient clinical evidence points towards its need because GCBL generally does not metastasize into lymph nodes.
