The neurologic consequences of injury to the vertebral artery are due to cerebral ischemia from thromboembolism, hypoperfusion, hemorrhage, or a combination of the three. In most cases, vertebral artery injury is due to an intimal tear. The torn, exposed endothelium promotes platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. This thrombus may cause local occlusion of the vessel, but more commonly, the clot will embolize to the cerebral circulation resulting in a stroke. Intimal tears may also dissect and create a false lumen that may lead to arterial occlusion. Partial transection of the artery may result in pseudoaneurysm. A pseudoaneurysm can be a source of emboli or hemorrhage if it ruptures. Complete vertebral artery transections may result in hemorrhage, which may be intracranial or extracranial depending on the location.
