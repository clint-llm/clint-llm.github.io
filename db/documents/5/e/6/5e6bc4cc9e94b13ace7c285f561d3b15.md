Pimavanserin may cause QTc prolongation. Patients should receive instructions to report any new onset palpitations, syncope, or near-syncope. Likewise, clinical illnesses such as gastroenteritis or the initiation of diuretic therapy, which could lead to hypokalemia, should also be reported as prompt identification and correction of electrolyte abnormalities minimizes the risk of arrhythmias. Pimanversin is not associated with the constellation of weight gain, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia, called metabolic syndrome seen in other atypical antipsychotics. However, it is still beneficial for the patient to eat a healthy diet, engage in an exercise regimen, and abstain from or stop smoking while taking the medication. Given that pimavanserin undergoes hepatic metabolization via the same cytochrome P450 pathways as various other medications, providers should be aware of drugs that may inhibit or induce the metabolism of pimavanserin and adjust dosing accordingly.
