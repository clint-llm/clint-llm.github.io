As discogenic pain shares clinical features with other etiologies of axial low back pain, further workup ranging from radiographic imaging to interventional procedures is often necessary. As mentioned previously, disc degeneration can be seen on imaging in asymptomatic individuals, and findings positively correlate with age. Therefore, positive findings on imaging must be taken in the context of the patient’s presentation. Conventional radiographic findings include disc-space narrowing, vacuum disc phenomenon due to accumulation of nitrogen in degenerative fissures, endplate sclerosis, and osteophyte formation. CT can identify these same changes earlier in the course of the disease process. MRI is the modality of choice to evaluate disc degeneration due to superior soft-tissue contrast. A High-Intensity Zone (HIZ) is an MRI finding seen on T2-weighted imaging as a hyperintense signal within the posterior annulus that has been shown to correlate with annulus damage as well as pain.

Additional findings are Modic changes, which are degenerative changes in the vertebral endplates and bone marrow. There are three types of Modic changes based on T1-weighted and T2-weighted characteristics. Type I Modic changes are seen as a low signal in the endplates and adjacent marrow on T1-weighted imaging but hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging (See figure). These changes are highly associated with disc degeneration and pain and have high specificity for positive discography.

Provocative discography is a fluoroscopically-guided diagnostic procedure involving deliberate administration of contrast into the nucleus pulposus of the suspected painful disc. The pressurized injection of contrast simulates mechanical loading and induces pain. Additionally, the pattern of contrast spread is indicative of the degree of disc disruption. This procedure is only performed when there is a high pretest probability of discogenic pain based on patient presentation and imaging. This is in part due to potentially significant post-procedural complications, including diskitis, dural puncture, disc rupture from contrast overpressurization, and worsening of underlying disc degeneration. It is difficult to define sensitivity and specificity for the procedure as there is no other gold standard for comparison. Due to variability in technique and interpretation, there is no consensus in regards to the false-positive rate. However, systematic review and meta-analysis suggest a rate of about 9.3% per patient.
