Rosacea is a clinical diagnosis, and biopsy is not typically necessary. Histologic findings of rosacea can vary across different subtypes. Solar elastosis, telangiectasia, edema, and perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltration can be seen in the erythematotelangiectatic subtype. Papulopustular rosacea presents with neutrophilic infiltration in hair follicles. Hyperplasia of sebaceous glands, fibrosis, and dilation of hair follicles are observed in phymatous rosacea. Granuloma formation is seen in the granulomatous rosacea subtype.
