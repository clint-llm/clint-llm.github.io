Studies show that intense physical exertion, such as extreme sports or alteration of gravity (space), reduces the amount of type B lymphocytes. This decline could be the cause of a physiological alteration of the immune response. Furthermore, it is necessary to consider the circadian rhythms of the production of these cells; external stress that alters the body's circadian status could negatively affect the immune response.
