Peripheral ulcerative keratitis can be a diagnostic challenge. PUK patients can exhibit no systemic symptoms or signs which point to the underlying cause and require an interprofessional team consisting of an ophthalmologist, rheumatologist, dermatologist, internist, neurologist, pharmacist, nursing staff, and technicians. If there is significant visual loss, coordination with the eye clinic liaison staff and sight impairment registration will need to be undertaken. The etiology of PUK requires meticulous clinical investigation. Patient education is necessary on treatment compliance and the potential side effects of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant agents. During prolonged treatment and monitoring disease activity, shared care with internists and rheumatologists can last for years after the initial diagnosis.
