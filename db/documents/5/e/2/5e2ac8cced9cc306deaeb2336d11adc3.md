- BPF is most commonly encountered after pulmonary resection (pneumonectomy, lobectomy, segmentectomy) with a frequency ranging from 4.5% to 20% after pneumonectomy and 0.5% to 1% after lobectomy.

- Patients with BPF can present with symptoms that range from acute symptoms of tension pneumothorax to subacute symptoms of empyema or a new or persistent air leak via a chest tube.

- Clinical, radiographic, and bronchoscopic findings that confirm an air leak from a bronchus to the pleural space are used to diagnose a BPF.

- BPFs do not typically spontaneously undergo closure and almost always require some surgical or bronchoscopic intervention.

- All patients with a BPF should have a chest tube placed to drain air. In cases of an empyema, infected pleural fluid should be drained, and antibiotics should be initiated. In all cases, a patient's comorbidities and nutritional status should be optimized.

- For most postoperative lung resection patients with BPF who are good surgical candidates, surgical repair is a definitive therapy with excellent success if spontaneous closure is unlikely.

- Bronchoscopic fistula closure is appropriate for patients with BPF who are poor surgical candidates, those who need a bridge to surgery, or patients with BPF due to advanced malignancy.

- Bronchoscopic approaches have variable success rates but are typically more successful in those with small fistulas of less than 8 mm.

- Following fistula closure, patients should be monitored for clinical symptoms of recurrence with chest tube output and chest imaging.

- For patients who fail surgical or bronchoscopic intervention, options include repeat surgery, an alternate bronchoscopic method, or an open window thoracostomy such as Eloesser flap thoracostomy or a Claggett window.
