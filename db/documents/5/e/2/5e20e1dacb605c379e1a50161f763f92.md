The diagnosis and management of WEE are with an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, internist, infectious disease expert, primary care provider, and nurse practitioner. The diagnosis of WEE is not easy, and there is no specific treatment. The majority of patients are managed with supportive care, and symptoms are treated with pharmacological therapy.

The primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and nurse play a vital role in the prevention of WEE. The key is to educate the patient against mosquito bites. TheseÂ protective measures include wearing long sleeves, long pants, socks, and closed-toe shoes. Pant legs can be tucked into socks to prevent bites to exposed ankles. One may also use DEET to repel mosquitoes. Travelers should sleep in air-conditioned spaces or use mosquito nets or screens to prevent bites during sleep. Standing water is a breeding ground for mosquitoes, so flower pots, buckets, and other containers should be drained. When symptoms develop, prompt treatment should be sought.
