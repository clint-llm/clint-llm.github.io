Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has many uses. It is indicated for certain soft tissue conditions including compromised and ischemic skin grafts. The treating surgeon and wound care specialist must be aware of these indications in order to make the appropriate and timely referral for hyperbaric therapy. This will add to a better outcome and flap salvage for a certain percentage of patients who would otherwise be victims of failed grafts and poor outcomes.
