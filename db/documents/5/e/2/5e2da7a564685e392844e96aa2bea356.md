History and physical are the key aspects of clinical evaluation that help in establishing the chronology of symptoms. They aid in selecting the relevant diagnostic testing and prevent unnecessary work up in the patient. According to American Academy of Family Physician (AAFP) guidelines, important elements of patient history includes age, gender, recent trauma, family history of joint diseases, review of systems, medication use, illnesses, travel history, tick bites, diet, alcohol use, occupational assessment, and intravenous drug use require careful consideration when suspecting monoarticular arthritis.

The presence or absence of effusion or synovitis can be helpful to narrow the diagnosis to inflammatory arthritis and systemic rheumatic diseases. Warmth and swelling over a joint can be palpated through a physical exam and are hallmark signs of synovitis.
