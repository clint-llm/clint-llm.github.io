The extrinsic muscles, of which the genioglossus muscle is part of it, determine the movement of the tongue, while the intrinsic muscles determine the shape of the tongue.

Checking the shape of the tongue and its movement can give many clinical signals during the evaluation.

The ability to lower the tongue correctly allows better use of the vocal cords, for example, when using a wind instrument (clarinet).The color of the tongue requires evaluation. According to recent studies, for example, a yellow or bluish tongue may indicate the presence of type II diabetes mellitus.

The genioglossus muscle will be negatively affected by the presence of pathologies, both of the oral cavity, and systemic diseases. For example, constant hypoxia (during sleep) can alter muscle metabolism. Type 17 microRNAs (miRNAs-17) helps the genioglossus muscle satellite cells repair muscle tissue and maintain an efficient mitochondrial membrane potential. Overnight hypoxia due to airway obstruction (COPD or OSAS, or CHF) causes a decline in miRNAs-17, leading to functional muscle weakness.
