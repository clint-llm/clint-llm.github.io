Genetic counseling plays a pivotal role in Refsum disease by educating patients and their family members through an in-depth discussion of the inheritance, to help them make informed medical and personal decisions, such as having children.

1. Parents

- The parents of an affected individual are obligate heterozygotes (carriers of one PEX7 or PHYH pathogenic variant).

- Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic and are not at risk of developing the disorder.

2. Siblings

- Each sibling of the patient has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% likelihood of being an asymptomatic carrier (a heterozygote), and a 25% likelihood of being one of the unaffected non-carriers.

- Once an at-risk sibling is known to be unaffected, there is a 2/3 risk of them being a carrier of a pathogenic PEX7 or PHYH.

3. Offspring

- The offspring of an individual with Refsum disease with a non-carrier partner, are obligate heterozygotes (carriers); therefore, they are not at risk for disease.

Dietary restriction is encouraged to eliminate phytol-containing foods, such as meat or fats, from ruminating animals (lamb, beef, and certain fish), baked goods containing animal fats, and dairy products such as butter and cheese.

The patient should avoid rapid weight loss or fasting because they cause a rapid mobilization of phytanic acid from hepatic lipid and body adipose stores.

Drugs like amiodarone and ibuprofen should not be used.
