Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is the organism responsible for CNS-TB. It is alcohol and acid-fast bacillus, stained using the Ziehl-Neelsen/Auramine-rhodamine/Kinyoun stains. The etiological contribution of the other four species of MTB-complex in causing CNS-TB is not determined. Humans are the only hostsÂ or reservoirs known for MTB. Infection is primarily acquired through airborne aerosols from infective individuals.
