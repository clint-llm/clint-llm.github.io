Muscles in the anterolateral abdominal wall include the transversus abdominis, internal oblique, external oblique, pyramidalis, and rectus abdominis muscles. The rectus abdominis muscle is enclosed by the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths formed by the transversus abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique aponeurosis. The linea alba separates the left and right rectus abdominis muscles as a combination of the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths. The linea semilunaris forms the lateral enclosure of theÂ rectus abdominis muscles formed by the aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique muscles. The transversus abdominis, external oblique, and internal oblique muscles are layered (deep to superficial, respectively) and extend from the lateral border of the rectus abdominis across the remainder of the abdominal wall. These muscles have attachments to the inguinal ligament and form the borders of the inguinal canal. The pyramidalis muscle is a physiological variant and is present in 80% of the population.
