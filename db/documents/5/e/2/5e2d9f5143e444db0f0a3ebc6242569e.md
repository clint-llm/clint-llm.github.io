There is no specific nerve supply to the prefrontal association cortex. Instead, the nerve supply to the prefrontal association cortex is explainable by numerous interconnections and projections to different parts of the brain. The PFC has reciprocal interconnections to various regions of the brain such as cortex, subcortical, and other brainstem regions through bundles of axons. Association fibers (short and long fibers) form connections between different areas of the PFC and other areas of the brain. Several fasciculi, including the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus and inferior longitudinal fasciculus form interconnections between the prefrontal association cortex and other brain areas. These fasciculi are involved in memory, languages, peripheral vision, object recognition, self-regulation, semantic processing, motivation, and emotion. These multi-synaptic connections between the prefrontal association cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus, amygdala, and mediodorsal thalamic nucleus mediate the inhibition of aggression and unwanted behavior.
