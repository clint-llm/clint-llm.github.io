A detailed history and complete physical examination are mandatory in the diagnosis of cases of SDRIFE.

Symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema is an uncommon drug reaction that can easily be misdiagnosed or undiagnosed unless the relationship between the history of drug intake and the nature of the skin eruption is well established; this may imply that the actual incidence of SDRIFE is higher than previously thought.

Clinicians including physicians,Â pharmacists, and nurse practitioners must work together in an interprofessional team approach to identify this rare disorder, and then provide treatment, primarily via the withdrawal of the offending agent. The clinician needs to collaborate with the pharmacist to determine which agent is causing the condition. Nursing can counsel the patient, administer supportive care, and answer patient questions, while also working with the pharmacist to determine the best means to withdraw the offending medication. The pharmacist can also vet the prescribing of symptomatic care (e.g., steroids, etc.0 and nursing can monitor both the withdrawal of the causative agent as well as the effectiveness of supportive care. This interprofessional approach will drive outcomes positively. [Level 5]
