Appropriate knowledge, training, and cooperation of all interprofessional healthcare team members are vital to patient safety during the administration of iron dextran preparations. Proper evaluation regarding the appropriateness for parenteral iron (i.e., iron dextran) is necessary from prescribing clinicians. Consultation with pharmacists may help prevent errors, including appropriateness of drug use, dosage calculations, interactions, and pertinent dosage modifications. Medical professionals with training in anaphylactoid-type reactions should also be present during the administration of parental iron. Additionally, patient monitoring by nurses following administration will allow for the evaluation of therapeutic response and early detection of adverse drug reactions. Through proper training, open interprofessional communication, and cooperation, healthcare teams will be better equipped to facilitate the delivery of quality patient-centered care and improve overall patient outcomes.
