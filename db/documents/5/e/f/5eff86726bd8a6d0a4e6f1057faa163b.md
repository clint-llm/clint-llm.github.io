Physiologic variants of the calcaneus include pseudofracture of the apophysis, nutrient foramen, pseudocyst, transient plantar bone spur, os sustentaculi, and os calcaneus secundarius. Pseudofracture of the apophysis is the term used for the fragmented appearance of a normally partially ossified calcaneal apophysis that mimics a fracture. A nutrient foramen that transmits blood vessels may sometimes be observed on the calcaneal plantar surface on foot radiography and misdiagnosed as a true lesion. A pseudocyst is a triangular ill-defined rarefaction area due to the deficiency of the normal spongy bone seen in the middle part of the calcaneus on the lateral foot radiograph. Transient plantar bone spurs are small spurs of the plantar calcaneal surfaces of infants. They are usually bilateral and symmetrical and disappear until the age of 1.
