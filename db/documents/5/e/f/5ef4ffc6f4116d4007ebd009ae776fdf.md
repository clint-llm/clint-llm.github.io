Canavan disease is one of the most prevalent degenerative cerebral diseases of infancy. It frequently affects Ashkenazi Jews but has been described in other populations as well. However, sufficient data is unavailable to calculate the prevalence. The carrier frequency among the Ashkenazi varies from 1:37 to 1:57 individuals, yielding approximate prevalence rates ranging from 1:6000 to 1:14,000.
