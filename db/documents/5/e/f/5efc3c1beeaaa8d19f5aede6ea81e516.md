Documentation of Mycoplasma infections exists worldwide. Overall, there is no evidence to suggest a difference in susceptibilities in sexes regardless of subspecies.  Mycoplasma pneumoniae is associated with up to 15-20% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia.M. pneumoniae, primarily occur in children ages 5 to 14 years old and young adults. Infants younger than 6 months are rarely infected; likely the result of residual maternal immunity. Carriers may not develop obvious symptoms, so the true prevalence of mycoplasmal infection is likely higher than reported.

Active M.
pneumoniae infection is most distinguishable for its gradual onset of symptoms and incubation period ranging from 2 to 3 weeks. In the United States, the increased frequency of M. pneumoniae diagnoses in the summer to early fall months is likely because there is a lower incidence of other respiratory infections during these months. Epidemics often occur in 3 to 5-year intervals.

Ureaplasma species, Mycoplasma genitalium, and Mycoplasma hominis may be isolated from up to 80% of sexually active females, but these organisms do not universally correlate with active infection. Mycoplasma genitalium may cause up to 20% of the cases of nongonococcal urethritis, cervicitis, and post-pregnancy PID noted.
