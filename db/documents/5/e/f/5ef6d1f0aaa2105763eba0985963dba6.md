Adverse effects of any fibrinolytic agents are almost similar, including, but not limited to, bleeding, hypotension, allergic reactions, angioedema, anaphylactic shock, and reperfusion arrhythmias (when used in acute MI).

Bleeding is the most frequent complication of thrombolytic therapy and can occur in puncture sites or spontaneously anywhere inside the body. Intracranial hemorrhage or hemorrhagic stroke is the greatest concern. Risk factors associated with hemorrhagic complications include elderly patients, uncontrolled hypertension, recent stroke or surgery, the presence of bleeding diathesis, and concurrent use of anticoagulants.

Overdose most often occurs when administered in a non-body-weight-adjusted manner and can cause severe hemorrhagic complications. Cholesterol embolism is reported in patients treated with thrombolytic agents. Cholesterol embolism may lead to cyanotic or "purple toe syndrome" and acute kidney injury.
