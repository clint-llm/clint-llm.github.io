Ultrasound protocols and technique depends upon the examination. For extremity arterial studies, one should perform an anatomical assessment from proximal to distal. Both longitudinal and transverse images in B-mode and doppler mode should be obtained. Waveform characteristics such as triphasic, biphasic, monophasic should be noted, along with the corresponding velocities. If an area of stenosis is identified, three sets of velocities should be obtained immediately before, within, and distal to the stenosis.

For extremity venous studies, one should also follow an anatomical assessment of the veins from proximal to distal. Calf veins need not be evaluated for deep venous thrombosis, according to the American College of Radiology, as these vessels have less of a propensity to cause clinically significant thrombosis.
