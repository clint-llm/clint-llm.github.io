Obtaining a thorough history is paramount when diagnosing magnesium toxicity as magnesium levels are not checked in a routine workup, and the symptoms that patients can present with tend to be nonspecific. As previously discussed, magnesium toxicity results from under-excretion, over-consumption, and storage displacement. The history should be focused on their etiology, such as a history of chronic kidney disease, the use of magnesium-containing medications such as antacids and laxatives, and recent chemotherapy treatment. Patients on dialysis who may have missed their treatments are also especially at risk. A physical exam is difficult as patients may present with nonspecific findings such as visual changes, flushing, muscle paralysis, and somnolence. However, loss of patellar reflexes should raise suspicion for magnesium toxicity. Patients receiving a magnesium infusion, such as those with preeclampsia, require a continuous reassessment of patellar reflexes.
