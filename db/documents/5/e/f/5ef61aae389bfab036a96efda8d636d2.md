An interprofessional team approach, consisting of clinicians, mid-level practitioners (PAs and NPs), nursing, and emergency medical staff, employing good preparation, preoxygenation, and recognizing difficult airway enhances airway management success. Changing the plan once the provider recognizes the difficulty is prudent and safe. This decreases the failed intubation rates and improves patient outcomes.

All the personnel involved should regularly sharpen their skills either in the field or in the simulation lab. Proper training of the personnel played a bigger role in improving the success rates of intubation, the decrease in mortality rate than the field of medicine they specialized in.

Emergency physicians use either length or weight-based estimation to select the correct endotracheal tube for intubation.

For difficult airways, a camera-based laryngoscopy is better than the direct laryngoscope for the first pass success of the intubation.
