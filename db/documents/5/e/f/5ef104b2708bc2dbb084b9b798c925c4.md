The goal of rhabdomyolysis management is to maintain adequate fluid resuscitation and prevent acute kidney injury. Identifying the underlying cause for rhabdomyolysis and its removal is the first step in managing patients with rhabdomyolysis. Management of rhabdomyolysis should include continuous assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation, frequent examinations, appropriate hydration to improve end-organ perfusion, close monitoring of urine output, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, identification of complications like compartment syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

**Management of Traumatic Rhabdomyolysis**

In patients with crush injury, the initiation of IV hydration/fluid resuscitation should begin as early as possible at the site of injury, even before relieving injury if possible. Hydration should be continued during the transport. Delay in fluid resuscitation may cause worsening hypovolemia secondary to third spacing. A liberal amount of fluids should be given up to 10 to 20 L to maintain adequate intravascular volume and adequate diuresis.

Multiple studies have shown the benefit of large volume resuscitation in patients with crush injury related to rhabdomyolysis to prevent acute kidney injury and the need for hemodialysis. For patients who were trapped for longer hours, appropriate fluid resuscitation might be challenging and are at risk for the development of AKI by the time they present to the hospital. With aggressive fluid resuscitation, patients who are already in acute kidney injury are prone to volume overload.

Once the patient is in the hospital set up, close monitoring of urine output is essential. After obtaining labs and confirming the absence of alkalosis, and confirming urine output, consideration should be given for alkalinization of urine to prevent precipitation of myoglobin in the distal convoluted tubule. Urine alkalinization also decreases precipitation of uric acid, corrects underlying metabolic acidosis, and reduces the risk of hyperkalemia. Most of the data from the alkalinization of the urine are from uncontrolled case series. Adding 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate to half-normal saline is traditionally used for the alkalinization of urine. Alkalinization with a bicarbonate infusion is associated with precipitation of hypocalcemia, can trigger tetany, seizures. The goal of alkaline fluid infusion is to maintain a serum pH not to exceed 7.5 and a urine pH just above 6.5. Prompt discontinuation of bicarbonate in IV fluids should be done When serum pH is at 7.5.

Mannitol is commonly used to improve the urine output in patients with a crush injury. This should be used only after the patient maintains adequate urine output of at least 20 mL/h. The renal Disaster Relief Task Force-European renal best practice has no specific conscientious guidelines regarding mannitol administration. A trial of intravenous infusion of 60 mL of 20% mannitol given over 5 minutes can be used to assess for increased urine output. If there is an increase in urine output of 30 to 50 mL/h compared to the baseline, more mannitol can continue.

Every attempt is made to prevent the development and further worsening of hyperkalemia. Avoid potassium-containing IV fluids like Ringer's lactate. A combination of oral sodium polystyrene sulfate and sorbitol is commonly given for crash victims with hyperkalemia. The role of new potassium binding agents is not very clear because of the lack of studies. Appropriate use of point-of-care devices and EKG should be utilized in patients with suspected hyperkalemia.

All patients with crush syndrome should have a Foley catheter placed; IV fluids should be given to maintain 200 to 300 ml urine output per hour. Adequate IV fluid resuscitation should be continued until myoglobinuria is wholly resolved and CPK levels are down-trending. Foley catheters should be used for the shortest duration of time to minimize complications like infection. Consideration should be given for loop diuretics in patients with volume overload states. Appropriate use of hemodialysis can be used with anuric acute kidney injury, hyperkalemia, volume overload state after conservative measures are failed. Peritoneal dialysis is not preferred because of trauma.

**Management of Nontraumatic Rhabdomyolysis**

Rhabdomyolysis from non-traumatic causes is managed similarly. Adequate and appropriate fluid resuscitation with normal isotonic saline should be provided depending on the underlying cause of rhabdomyolysis. Management includes removing the offending agent at the time of diagnosis and titration of IV fluids to maintain a urine output of 200 to 300 mL/h and serial monitoring of CPK levels daily to document downtrend levels. As mentioned earlier, CPK levels of more than 5,000 IU/L have increased the risk of the development of AKI. In patients with CPK levels, less than 5,000 IU/L extensive volume fluid resuscitation is discouraged as they are less likely to develop AKI.

**Management of Electrolytes Abnormalities in Rhabdomyolysis**

Rhabdomyolysis is associated with hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, hyperuricemia, and hyperphosphatemia. Hyperkalemia with potassium levels less than 6 mEq/L without EKG changes should be managed with potassium binders and avoiding potassium-containing IV fluids(lactated Ringer) and the use of bicarbonate in the fluids. Hyperkalemia with potassium levels 6 or above with or without EKG changes should be treated with an ampule of D50 followed by zero units of regular insulin, IV sodium bicarbonate. In general, calcium gluconate or calcium chloride is commonly used in the emergency room with hyperkalemia. However, rhabdomyolysis, especially from trauma, is associated with late occurrences of hypercalcemia, so calcium should be used with caution in the management of hyperkalemia.

Symptomatic hypocalcemia like tetany, seizures, arrhythmias should be treated with IV calcium gluconate. Excessive calcium replacement can precipitate hypercalcemia during the recovery phase. Hyperuricemia from rhabdomyolysis should be managed with allopurinol; it is only used if uric acid is more than 8 mg/dL. Patients with volume overload, severe acidosis, uremia, and refractory hyperkalemia need hemodialysis. Peritoneal dialysis may not be sufficient to correct the excess amount of electrolyte changes and rhabdomyolysis.

**Other Supportive Care**

Appropriate use of antibiotics, vasopressors are needed when concomitant sepsis present. Malignant hyperthermia should be treated with dantrolene sodium. Steroids are used in inflammatory myopathies. Emergent orthopedic consultation is required in the management of compartment syndrome. DIC is managed with fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, and platelet transfusion.

**Diet in Metabolic Myopathies**

Dietary changes may Improve symptoms associated with Hereditary myopathies. Pain and fatigue associated with phosphorylase deficiency can be decreased with glucose and fructose supplementation. Frequent meals with a high carb low-fat diet improve muscle pain and myoglobinuria from carnitine palmityl transferase deficiency. The dietary modifications Have no effect on symptoms of phosphofructokinase deficiency or phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency.
