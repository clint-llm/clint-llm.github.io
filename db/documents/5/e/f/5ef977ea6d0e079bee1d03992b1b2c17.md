Many analyzers cannot measure free digoxin concentrations, and in this setting, digoxin levels should not be followed after the administration of DSFab.

In patients with end-stage renal disease, dissociation of the DSFab-digoxin complex may occur and cause recurrent toxicity.

Calcium is traditionally considered contraindicated in hyperkalemic patients with digoxin toxicity for fear of 'stone heart syndrome,' an irreversible state of global myocardial contraction.   This is based on animal evidence and case report, but more recent literature found no evidence of increased mortality with calcium administration. In general, hyperkalemia in the setting of digoxin toxicity should be treated primarily with DSFab fragments if available.

A classic but uncommon side effect of digoxin is the appearance of yellow halos around lights, called xanthopsia, and altered color vision called chromatopsia. This may have influenced the work of Dutch impressionist painter Vincent Van Gogh in paintings such as "The Starry Night," as he reportedly used foxglove for the treatment of his 'dropsy,' which is an old term for edema due to CHF.
