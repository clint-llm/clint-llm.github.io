The etiology of air leaks and ALS is varied. The following are some causes of ALS.

**Iatrogenic**

- Mechanical ventilation and positive pressure ventilation - This is usually from barotrauma and polytrauma.

- Central venous catheterization - The insertion of a subclavian line might lead to the introduction of air into the pleural cavity. After placement of a subclavian line, a chest X-ray is necessary to confirm the proper position and also to check for the presence of pneumothorax.

- A surgical procedure in the thoracic cavity for example ligation of PDA or resection of a tumor in the thoracic cavity.

- Thoracoscopy either therapeutic or diagnostic has been linked to the development of air leaks.

- A laparoscopic procedure can cause the development of air leaks.

- Tracheostomy – If a false track is created with the insertion of a tracheostomy tube, subcutaneous emphysema can develop.

**Lung Diseases**

The following lung diseases can cause air leak and ALS:

**Restrictive lung diseases
**

- Adult respiratory distress syndrome

- Respiratory distress syndrome

- Cystic fibrosis

- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

**Obstructive lung diseases
**

- Asthma

- Bronchiolitis

- Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD)

**Other lung diseases
**

- Bronchopleural fistula

- Bullous lung diseased

- Necrotizing pneumonia
