Similar to other pediatric neurodegenerative disorders, there is no curative treatment for SSADH deficiency currently. However, there are some symptomatic and supportive management options

Anti-seizure medications: Broadspectrum anticonvulsants are advised though sodium valproate is contraindicated because of the inhibition of the SSADH enzyme.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms: Various antidepressants, anti-anxiety, and antipsychotic medications and cerebral stimulants have been used to treat behavioral symptoms in SSADH deficiency.

There are a number of pharmacological and enzyme replacement therapeutic options that are currently being evaluated, including GABA and GHB receptor antagonists and mTOR inhibitors.
