Myxedema coma: It is a medical emergency and is characterized by severe hypothyroidism with clinical features of hypothermia, hyponatremia, bradycardia. It is mostly seen in older patients. Treatment should be initiated on clinical suspicion without awaiting lab results. Steroids are given first followed by thyroxine replacement to prevent an adrenal crisis in the scenario of underlying adrenal insufficiency.

Thyroid storm is a life-threatening endocrine emergency often triggered by a metabolically stressful event in a patient with long-standing hyperthyroidism like Graves disease. It can present with hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, agitation, and psychosis with laboratory evidence of low TSH, high free T4, and T3. Prompt recognition and treatment of the condition are necessary as this condition is associated with high mortality. The Burch-Wartofsky diagnostic criteria can help with the timely detection of thyroid storm.

Infectious thyroiditis can lead to an abscess and septicemia if not treated promptly.

Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis are at risk of developing thyroid lymphoma and carcinoma; thus, a rapidly progressing thyroid nodule enlargement or development of new nodules should raise the suspicion.
