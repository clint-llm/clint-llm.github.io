It is important to note that there is poor epidemiological data on RLN injuries, and additional studies are needed to further elucidate this. This is likely secondary to the multiple causes of vocal cord palsy, with RLN injuries being only a portion of these as well as the relative difficulty in diagnosing RLN injuries. One study that followed a cohort of 325 patients found that males were twice as likely to present with laryngeal nerve palsy. They also found the mean age to be 55 years old.
