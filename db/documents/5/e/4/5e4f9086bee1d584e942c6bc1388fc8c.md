Mercury, in its various forms, has an affinity for the ubiquitous sulfhydryl groups in the tissues by forming covalent bonds. The interaction of mercury with many intracellular moieties results in the dysfunction of enzymes, membrane transportation, and structural proteins. Locally, mercury can produce corrosive actions due to its oxidizing and corrosive action. Mercury absorption can manifest in varied forms due to its vast systemic involvement. The involvement of the immune system in the form of delayed hypersensitivity has been proposed in the causation of acrodynia. There can be genetic variation in the idiosyncratic sensitivity of individuals due to the toxic effects of mercury.

The mechanism of acrodynia may also involve adrenocortical hyperfunction, sympathetic vasomotor dysfunction, and catecholamine dysfunction. The inactivation of  catecholamine-0-methyl transferase can explain arterial hypertension associated with mercury, which in turn increases serum and urinary epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.
