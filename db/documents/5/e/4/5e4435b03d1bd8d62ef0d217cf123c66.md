The lungs are pyramidal-shaped organs connected to the trachea through the right and left main bronchi. They are enclosed within the thoracic cage, bounded inferiorly by the diaphragm, and separated by the mediastinum. Two layers of serous membrane cover them, called pleura. The visceral pleura is superficial to the lungs, while the parietal pleura is the outer layer that connects to the thoracic wall, mediastinum, and diaphragm. An indentation is present on the surface of the left lung called the cardiac notch, which allows more space for the heart. The right lung is composed of 3 lobes (superior, middle, and inferior). The left lung is of smaller volume and is composed of only two lobes (superior and inferior). Each lobe is divided into smaller units called bronchopulmonary segments. Each of these units receives air from a smaller tertiary bronchus and is supplied with blood by its artery.

In contrast to other thoracic surgeries, a chest tube is not commonly inserted following pneumonectomy as suction on the tube may cause displacement of the heart or mediastinum into the pleural space. The space that was previously occupied by the lung becomes filled with air. Over time, this air gets absorbed, and space gets filled with fluid. Other compensatory changes also ensue, like hyperinflation of the other lung, a shift of mediastinum, and elevation of the diaphragm.
