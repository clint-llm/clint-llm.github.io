**Prevention of Pneumocephalus**

The following methods can help prevent the development of pneumocephalus during or after surgical procedures:

- Filling of the surgical site with saline at the time of closure of the dura

- Administering the Valsalva maneuver before taking the last bite of a suture through the dura during its closure to allow air to escape outside

- A smaller gauge spinal needle makes a smaller dural perforation and prevents cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Hence, such needles should be used while doing the lumbar puncture.

- Keeping the patient in the supine position with no head end of bed elevation following chronic subdural hematoma evacuation

- Positioning the head during dural closure in such a way that the last part of the dural defect becomes the highest point to facilitate the escape of residual air while filling the subdural space with saline

- Nitrous oxide (N2O), an anesthetic agent, had been previously proposed to cause pneumocephalus unless it is discontinued before the time of dural closure. But based on a randomized control trial, such an adverse effect of N2O on intracranial pressure was not noticed.

- The use of saline rather than air to identify the epidural space during epidural injections.

- Avoiding high airway pressure and hyperventilation during invasive ventilation.

Neurosurgical procedures can result in residual intracranial air and can also result in a continuous entry of air into the cranial cavity. Hence the patient is advised to wait for at least seven days before taking a flight as the cabin pressure changes can introduce air inside the skull.

There is no proper evidence to support the prophylactic administration of ceftriaxone for preventing meningitis in patients with traumatic pneumocephalus.

Air travel is not advisable for patients with an intracranial air volume of more than 30 ml. Intracranial air volume of 20 ml and initial intracranial pressure of 15 mmHg was identified as conservative thresholds for safe air travel among such patients.

**The following methods can be adopted to avoid complications from pneumocephalus during a flight:**

- A low-level flight or by maintaining ground-level cabin pressure during the flight

- Reduced rates of change in cabin pressure

- Positioning to reduce the CSF leak

- Administering supplementary oxygen

- Pre-flight decongestants

- Avoidance of Valsalva maneuvers

- If the patient is ventilated, hypoventilation and carbon dioxide should be prevented.

- Performing recent pre-flight imaging to assess the volume of pneumocephalus and to rule out an extracranial-intracranial fistulous process.

- Develop an understanding of the patient-specific pathophysiology and the time course of pneumocephalus.

- Reduce the stresses induced by accelerations (including changing g-forces), noises, or hypoxemia.

**It is usually recommended to avoid air travel for 2 to 8 weeks after intracranial surgery.**
