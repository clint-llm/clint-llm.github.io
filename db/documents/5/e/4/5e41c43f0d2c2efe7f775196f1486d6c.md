Given the high prevalence rate of GCBL among uncircumcised males, it is imperative to educate parents about the important role of newborn circumcision in preventing the development of GCBL and other penile lesions.

Patients should be counseled about condom use as it diminishes the transmission of HPV, which is associated with GCBL.

Similarly, the HPV vaccine should be given to individuals between nine and twenty-six years of age as it protects against infection with both HPV 9 and 11 â€“ strains most strongly associated with GCBL.
