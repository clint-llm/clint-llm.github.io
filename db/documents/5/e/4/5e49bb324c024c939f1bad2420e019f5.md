The true incidence and prevalence rates of cutaneous horns are not documented in the literature. However, it is well known that they are more commonly found in the elderly population between 60 to 80 years of age. They are also more likely to be premalignant or malignant in geriatric populations. The mean age of patients with a benign cutaneous horn base pathology is 8.9 years less than those with premalignant or malignant base pathologies.

The sex distribution of benign lesions is equal among males and females; however, there is a greater incidence of premalignant or malignant cutaneous horns in males.

Regardless of whether it is benign, premalignant, or malignant, the lesion is most commonly located inÂ areas most vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation, such as the head, neck, and upper extremities.
