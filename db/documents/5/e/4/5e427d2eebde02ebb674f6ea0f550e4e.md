Volkmann ischemic contracture is classically associated with a supracondylar fracture of the humerus. However, any fracture of the arm or elbow may result in this deformity. The key precipitating event in supracondylar fractures of the humerus is ischemia of the forearm due to acute compartment syndrome.

- Tight bandages and dressings

- Animal bites

- Burns

- Intensive and excessive exercises

- Muscle hypertrophy

- Neoplasms

- Bleeding into a closed compartment (injury to a vessel, congenital or acquired disorder)

- Injections in the forearm

- Surgery on the forearm

Volkmann ischemic contracture is also described as a sequela of acute arterial insufficiency of the limbs. Emboli lodging in the arterial vasculature can also result in ischemia of the muscles resulting in limb contractures.
