CNCP can arise from many different stressors such as physical or psychological trauma(accident, death of a loved one), an infectious process such as Ebstein Barr virus (EBV), chronic underlying diseases such as sickle cell anemia or autoimmune conditions, or it can occur in the setting of multiple episodes of acute pain.Â  Risk factors for CNCP include a patient's depression, anxiety, substance dependency, disability, lower socioeconomic level, and low job satisfaction

Chronic pain can come from repetitive acute insults but also can develop as its own distinct disease state
