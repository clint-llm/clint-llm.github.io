Absolute contraindications such as anaphylaxis to the radiotracer are very few and rare.

Relative contraindications mainly concern patient preparation. Various drugs may modulate the biliary system.

Opiates must be withheld for at least 6 hours before scanning because they cause a functional obstruction at the sphincter of Oddi which can be indistinguishable from a true obstruction. Severe pain requiring control with frequent opiate administration is suboptimal and may prevent evaluation with hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Increased intracranial pressure in children is an absolute contraindication to morphine administration, as is respiratory depression in a nonventilated patient. If a patientÂ has a history of anaphylaxis to morphine and the HIDA was ordered to evaluate for acute cholecystitis, delaying imaging at 4 hours is the recommendation.

Other medications associated with poor gallbladder contractility require an evaluation of the benefit of diagnostic evaluation with scintigraphy versus the risk of medication modification or cessation. These medications include

- Atropine

- Benzodiazepines

- Ethanol

- Indomethacin

- Nicotine

- Nifedipine

- Oral contraceptives

- Octreotide

- Theophylline

Conditions that decrease gallbladder contractility include

- Achalasia

- Celiac disease

- Crohn's

- Diabetes mellitus

- Irritable bowel syndrome

- Pancreatic insufficiency

- Pregnancy

- Sickle-cell disease
