The anterior pituitary gland is composed of cell clusters that produce six anterior pituitary hormones and release them into the circulation. Corticotrophs produce the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), thyrotrophs produce the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), somatotrophs produce the growth hormone (GH), gonadotrophs produce both follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), and lactotrophs produce prolactin (PRL). The clusters of cells that produce the six anterior pituitary hormones are under hypothalamic control. Unlike the posterior pituitary which basically stores hormones produced by the hypothalamus, the hypothalamus regulates the anterior pituitary via secreting â€œreleasing hormones," somatostatin and dopamine. These hormones are secreted directly into the hypophyseal portal circulation that supplies blood to the anterior pituitary. Once reaching their target cell cluster in the anterior pituitary, the releasing hormones either stimulate or inhibit the synthesis and secretion of anterior pituitary hormones.
