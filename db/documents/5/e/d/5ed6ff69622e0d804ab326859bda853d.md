Monitoring cerebral perfusion pressure requires measuring both the MAP and the ICP. The MAP can be measured directly through invasive hemodynamic means, most often cannulation of a peripheral artery such as the radial or femoral artery. The MAP can also be measured indirectly with a noninvasive blood pressure cuff and applying the previously mentioned formula using the systolic and diastolic blood pressures.

Intracranial pressure is usually measured invasively through an intracranial pressure transduction device. The most common and most accurate method is with an intraventricular monitor. As such, intraventricular measurement of ICP is the current gold standard.

ICP can be measured non-invasively by several methods, including, most commonly, transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). TCD utilizes a temporal window to measure the velocity of blood flow through the middle cerebral artery. Systolic and diastolic flow velocity and mean flow velocity are used to calculate a pulsatility index. The pulsatility index has been reported to correlate strongly with ICP in some studies and poorly correlate with ICP in other studies. Therefore, it is not recommended to use TCD alone as a substitute for direct ICP measurement.

Ideally, invasive monitoring of the MAP through an arterial cannula and invasive monitoring of the ICP through an intraventricular catheter will give a continuous and accurate calculation of CPP.
