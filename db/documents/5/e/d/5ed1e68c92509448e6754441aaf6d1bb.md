Streptokinase can precipitate an allergic reaction. Symptoms include fever, shivering, and rash. Patients in rare instances have developed nonfatal anaphylactic reactions. In cases of anaphylaxis, patients should be administered epinephrine immediately and discontinue streptokinase therapy. The toxicity of streptokinase is believed to be because it is a polypeptide derivative of beta-hemolytic streptococci bacteria.
