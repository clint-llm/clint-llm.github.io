- Patients who are fluid-overloaded should not receive crystalloid fluids. Special care is prudent when administering fluids to patients with congestive heart failure or those with significant renal impairment (e.g., CKD-V dialysis-dependent patients).

- Hypertonic saline is contraindicated in all clinical settings except in patients with severe hyponatremia and neurologic sequelae. Rapid correction of hyponatremia may cause central pontine myelinolysis, a devastating neurologic condition.

- Hypotonic solutions are also contraindicated in patients with or at risk of developing cerebral edema.

- Crystalloids containing potassium (Lactate Ringer's solution, Hartman’s solution, etc.) are relatively contraindicated in patients with hyperkalemia since these may exacerbate their condition, which in turn can lead to ventricular dysrhythmias.

- Clinicians should avoid using crystalloids containing dextrose (D5%W, D10%W, D5% 0.45% NS, etc.) in patients with hyperglycemia.

- Ringer's lactate solution contains calcium ions. Calcium can induce coagulation of the blood products in the IV tubing and therefore inhibit their effective delivery. In patients who require a blood transfusion, blood products should utilize a separate IV setup.
