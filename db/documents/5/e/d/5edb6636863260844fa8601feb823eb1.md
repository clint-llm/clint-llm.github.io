The Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV strongly recommends initiation of ART on all pediatrics with HIV.

The goals of treatment for HIV-exposed neonates include a reduction in morbidity and mortality, suppression of viral replication, facilitation of HIV remission, viral control, prevention of disease progression, maintenance of immunologic function, reduction of opportunistic infections, and prevention of drug resistance.

There aren’t many randomized control trials that compare different regimens in pediatrics and neonates and the available literature is variable. Most of the data is extracted from non-randomized studies, pharmacokinetic trials, and phase 1 or 2 of drug trials. In general, the initiation of an antiretroviral regimen in pediatrics should include two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) with an additional drug from another class, including an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), a protease inhibitor (PI) with a booster, or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Factors to consider prior to initiation of a regimen include the patient’s age, weight, family preference, drug-resistance, genetic-testing, mutation testing, and sexual maturity rating (SMR). In children with other confections, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), the choice of agent should include coverage for HIV and the co-contagion.

There are three studies that compared the addition of a PI-boosted versus NNRTI to the two NRTI backbone. In the P1060 trial, a total of 288 children from six African countries and India with ages from 2-36 months were enrolled in a randomized trial. The children received zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine as the NRTI backbone and were randomized to either the PI with booster group (ritonavir booster (LPV/r)) or NNRTI group (nevirapine (NVP)). The data demonstrated that LPV/r is superior to NVP in children who were NVP-naive; however, there were limitations.

Data for the utilization of an INSTI-based regimen is extracted from safety trials and from adult comparative trials. Four INSTIs are approved for the treatment of ART-naïve children with HIV, which include: bictegravir (BID), dolutegrevir (DTG), Elvitegravir/cobicistat (EVG/c), and raltegravir (RAL).

Zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) are the preferred dual NRTI backbone in neonates and infants < 3 months. ZDV is FDA approved for prophylaxis and for HIV treatment initiation in infants ≥ 4 weeks of age.

- Age < 14 days: NVP

- Age < 14 days and a weight ≥ 2 kg: raltegravir (RAL)

- Age ≥ 14 days to < 3 years: LPV/r or RAL (alternative: NVP)
