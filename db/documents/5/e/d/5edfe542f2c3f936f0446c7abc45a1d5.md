The tensor fascia latae, along with the iliotibial tract, is innervated by the superior gluteal nerve and the inferior gluteal nerve. The ventral rami of the L4-S1 nerve roots supply motor innervation via the superior gluteal nerve to these structures. The superior gluteal nerve is also the major nerve that innervates the gluteus medius and minimus muscles. L5-S2 ventral rami supply motor innervation to the inferior gluteal nerve, which also innervates the TFL and ITB along with the gluteus maximus muscle.

The lumbosacral plexus also gives rise to multiple nerves that aid in the innervation of the fascia lata. The ilioinguinal nerve (L1), the femoral branch of the genitofemoral nerve (L1-L2), lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L2-L3), and the cutaneous branch of the obturator nerve (L2-L4) are all involved in the innervation of the fascia lata. These nerves that derive from the lumbosacral plexus are cutaneous nerves that innervate certain regions of skin, and in order for these nerves to traverse superficially to the skin, they must penetrate the fascia lata thus supplying innervation to this connective tissue.
