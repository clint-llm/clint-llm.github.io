The clinical course of follicular lymphoma is variable. Some patients can have waxing and waning disease for years without needing treatment. Others with more disseminated disease and rapid tumor growth require therapy due to organ dysfunction.

At the time of initial diagnosis, there are two widely used prognostic indices for follicular lymphoma: the follicular lymphoma international prognostic index (FLIPI) and the PRIMA prognostic index (PRIMA-PI).

At the time of relapse, the best predictor of tumor aggressiveness is the duration of remission following initial treatment. Early treatment failure is defined as patients with follicular lymphoma progressing within 24 months (POD24) of initial immunochemotherapy or within 12 months of single-agent rituximab.

In addition, a small group of follicular lymphoma patients will undergo histologic transformation to more aggressive lymphomas. Patients with histologic transformation generally have a worse prognosis and require more aggressive therapy.
