**Laboratories**

Elevation in inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are frequently seen in all inflammatory arthropathies. Thrombocytosis and anemia of chronic disease can be frequently seen. Leukocytosis usually accompanies infectious arthritis, while leukopenia might be a feature of infectious arthritis associated with underlying autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Renal function may be abnormal in patients with gout who are more likely to have associated chronic kidney disease. Hyperuricemia is frequently seen in patients with gout, although serum uric acid levels may be falsely low during an acute episode of gout. Patients with pseudogout secondary to underlying metabolic diseases such as hypercalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia, and hemochromatosis may have laboratory abnormalities associated with the underlying disorder. Specific serological workup should be pursued when autoimmune inflammatory arthritis is in the differential.  Patients with rheumatoid arthritis frequently have positive rheumatoid factor and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies. Patients with underlying connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease, inflammatory myopathies, and systemic sclerosis may have associated autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibody and more specific autoantibodies such as anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, anti-Smith antibody, anti-Ro antibody, Anti-La antibody, etc.

**Synovial Fluid Analysis**

Aspiration of the synovial fluid and detailed analysis is critical in the evaluation of inflammatory arthritis. Synovial fluid shall be analyzed for total cell counts and differential, polarized light microscopy, Gram stain and cultures, and fungal/AFB cultures when appropriate. Total cell counts are usually less than 2000 cells/mm3 in non-inflammatory arthritis and more than 5000 cells/mm^3 in inflammatory arthritis. A total cell count of more than 50,000 cells/mm^3 cells and/or more than 90% neutrophils have a strongly positive likelihood ratio of being associated with septic arthritis, although it can present in acute gout or pseudogout as well. Septic arthritis and crystalline arthropathies usually have neutrophilic predominance, while rheumatoid arthritis usually has lymphocytic predominance in the synovial fluid.  Monosodium urate crystals on polarized light microscopy are needle-shaped and strongly negatively birefringent. Calcium pyrophosphate crystals on polarized light microscopy or rhomboid-shaped and weakly positively birefringent. Basic calcium phosphate crystals are not visible on polarized light microscopy and need special staining for visualization.

**Imaging**

Plain radiographs may be initially normal in early inflammatory arthritis or may show periarticular osteopenia. As the disease progresses, periarticular erosions can be seen in inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis.
