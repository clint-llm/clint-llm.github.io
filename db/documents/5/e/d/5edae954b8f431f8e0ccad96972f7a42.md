Dronabinol is an orally active cannabinoid (a synthetic form of the active delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol). The majority of effects of cannabinoids and endocannabinoids (endogenous cannabinoids) appear to be carried out by two inhibitory G-protein coupled-receptors (GPCRs), CB1 (present in high levels in several brain regions, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, and the cerebellum) and CB2 (present in a restricted distribution in the brain stem and periphery including immune cells and neurons).

When activated, CB1 generally reduces neuronal excitation. Dronabinol, like THC, is a partial agonist at the CB1 receptor. Cannabinoid signaling carries implications in many pathways, including pain modulation, cognition, appetite stimulation, anti-nausea, among others. The anti-emetic and appetite stimulation effects of the CB1 receptor appear to mediate the therapeutic effects of dronabinol.
