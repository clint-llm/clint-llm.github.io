Lifestyle modifications are the first step in management. These include weight loss, decreased meal size, refraining from lying down within 3 hours after a meal, eating a low-fat and low-acid diet, avoiding carbonated or caffeinated beverages, stopping tobacco use, and reducing alcohol intake. If these measures fail to achieve symptomatic relief, medications such as histamine H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors can suppress acid production. Given that not all reflux is acidic, additional measures that protect the mucosa from alkaline or neutral refluxate, such as alginate and magaldrate, may also be effective.
