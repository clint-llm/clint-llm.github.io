Acetaminophen toxicity is the second most common cause of liver transplantation worldwide and the most common cause of liver transplantation in the US. It is responsible for 56,000 emergency department visits, 2,600 hospitalizations, and 500 deaths per year in the United States. Fifty percent of these are unintentional overdoses. More than 60 million Americans consume acetaminophen on a weekly basis, and many are unaware that it is contained in combined products. This activity reviews the etiology, evaluation, and treatment of acetaminophen overdose and highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in both managing and preventing this problem.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of acetaminophen toxicity.
- Describe the four clinical stages of acetaminophen toxicity.
- Identify the treatment strategies for an alert patient who presents within an hour of overdose versus a patient who presents after two hours.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for educating patients about acetaminophen toxicity with the goal of preventing overdose.
