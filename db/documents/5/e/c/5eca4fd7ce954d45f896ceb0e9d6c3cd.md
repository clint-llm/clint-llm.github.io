TJC aims to avoid medical errors and non-compliance in healthcare organizations by evaluating other factors that could affect patient safety and care. Such factors include, but are not limited to, multi-tasking, interruptions, worker fatigue, communication issues, and more.

TJC has specific standards and quality measures for holding healthcare organizations accountable to protect the public for safety in a standardized format:

- Standards are based on the reported adverse events by organizations that may or may not cause harm to patients, such as medication errors, incorrect site in surgical procedures, and miscommunication among healthcare providers.

- Quality measures have their basis on health-related population-focused commonalities, such as congestive heart failure patients with frequent readmissions and pressure ulcers acquired by patients while being hospitalized.
