Carbon dioxide is an important side product of both glycolysis and the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle). This oxidized carbon represents an end product of metabolism that, ultimately, needs to be removed using transport to the lungs and subsequent expiration out into the surrounding environment. Together with renal regulation, this complex process of carbon dioxide production, transport, and elimination is the principal means by which the body regulates the bloodâ€™s pH. Disorders in this delicate process can result in acid-base derangements and may be acute or chronic.
