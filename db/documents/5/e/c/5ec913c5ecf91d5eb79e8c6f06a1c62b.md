Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic granulomatous infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by several different dematiaceous fungi and resulting in the formation of slow-growing warty plaques and cauliflower-like lesions which may ulcerate. The fungi produce thick-walled, single or multicellular clusters called sclerotic or muriform bodies, respectively. The fungi are usually introduced into the body by trauma, and the lesions are mostly found on exposed regions of the body. The disease runs a chronic course and most cases can be cured. This activity reviews the clinical evaluation of chromoblastomycosis and the role of the health professional team in providing appropriate care to affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation typically seen in patients with chromoblastomycosis, including history and physical exam findings.
- Summarize the clinical evaluation of chromoblastomycosis.
- Outline management options for patients affected by chromoblastomycosis.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination to enhance outcomes for patients affected by chromoblastomycosis.
