Maintaining homeostatic balance in appetite and satiety control via hormones such as ghrelin and leptin would not be possible without the hypothalamus coordinating the various hormonal inputs. The three zones of the hypothalamus divide into periventricular, medial, and lateral.Â The majority of the hypothalamic nuclei are located in the medial region leading to further subdivisions such as the preoptic area, anterior (supraoptic) region, the middle (tuberal) region, and the posterior (mamillary) region.

The development of the hypothalamus and its regions is critical in maintaining homeostasis. Morphogens such as Wnt8 are responsible for the anterior-posterior patterning of the induced neural plate.
