Treatment of eumycetoma remains challenging. There are no definitive treatment protocol guidelines that have been established. Established treatment protocols are largely based on published case reports and case series.

**Antifungals Used for the Treatment of Eumycetoma**

Various classes of antifungals have been used in the treatment of eumycetoma, including azoles, amphotericin B, and terbinafine.

- Azoles: The azole antifungals are considered the "gold standard" for treatment.

- Itraconazole is most frequently used. The dosage of itraconazole for the treatment of eumycetoma is 400 mg per day, divided into two doses for 12 months duration. Hepatoxicity is the principal chronic adverse effect.
- Newer azoles, such as voriconazole (400 mg to 600 mg per day) and posaconazole (800 mg per day), have also been trialed with good clinical outcomes.

- Amphotericin B: Toxicity and need for hospitalization have greatly limited the use of amphotericin B. Liposomal amphotericin B has been used in select cases in endemic countries but lacks adequate response and the adverse effect of severe nephrotoxicity limits its use.

- Terbinafine: 500 mg twice a day for 24Â to 48 weeks can also cause significant clinical improvement in 80% of cases.

**Surgical Therapy of Eumycetoma**

Authors of one study recommend a stepwise procedure, starting with initial preoperative treatment of eumycetomas with Itraconazole. It is thought that encapsulation of eumycetoma is promoted by therapy with antifungals. Thereby, the eumycetomas are better localized, and surgical debridement will be facilitated. Wide, extensive, disfiguring procedures can thus be avoided.
