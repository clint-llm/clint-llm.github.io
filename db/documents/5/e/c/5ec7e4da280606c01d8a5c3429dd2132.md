To support the diagnosis, muscle tissue is biopsied and examined under a microscope. The hallmark findings suggestive of McArdle disease are glycogen deposits and absence of the enzyme myophosphorylase.

Glycogen deposits appear under the sarcolemmal membrane at the periphery of myofibers. The collection of glycogen between myofibrils makes the myofibers look like vacuoles. The glycogen takes up periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). The absence of glycogen accumulation in muscle biopsy should not be taken as proof for the absence of McArdle disease as the glycogen could be washed out in tissue processing.

Myophosphorylase histochemistry is easier to perform and has a good negative predictive value. Its absence is diagnostic for McArdle disease. However, providers must specifically request the testing of myophosphorylase.
