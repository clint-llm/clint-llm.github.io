Thoracic aortic aneurysms require a prompt diagnosis as most patients are asymptomatic until dissection or rupture of the aorta occurs, leading to worsened patient morbidity and mortality. Improving the interprofessional teamâ€™s vigilance during the patient evaluation, keeping thoracic aortic aneurysm as a differential diagnosis, and understanding the findings to look forward to during testing can lead to timely diagnosis and management.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of thoracic aortic aneurysms. 
- Summarize the evaluation findings in a patient with a thoracic aortic aneurysm.
- Review the management options available for thoracic aortic aneurysms. 
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional teams to improve outcomes for patients presenting with thoracic aortic aneurysms.
