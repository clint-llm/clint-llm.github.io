The primary source of innervation of the posterior longitudinal ligament is the meningeal branch derived from the spinal nerve. It gives ascending and descending branches in the vertebral column.

There is no innervation of the deep layer of the nucleus pulposus or annulus fibrosus because they lack nerve fibers and nerve terminals. Few nerve terminals are present in the central part of the nucleus pulposus, but in the peripheral zone, there are abundant nerve fibers. These nerve fibers in the peripheral zone play an important role in the regulation of movement and posture in the vertebral column.
