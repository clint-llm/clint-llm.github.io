Bagassosis belongs to the group of respiratory conditions classified as interstitial lung diseases or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. It presents similarly to other extrinsic allergic alveolitis, such as farmer's lung. It develops in a patient due to exposure and inhalation of bagasse - the residual fibrous material after sugar is extracted from sugar cane. This activity describes the etiology, pathophysiology, and management of bagassosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the prevention and treatment of the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of bagassosis.
- Review the clinical features of bagassosis.
- Discuss the treatment options for bagassosis.
- Summarize the role of the interprofessional team consisting of clinicians, occupational health physicians, and public health officers in the prevention and treatment of patients with bagassosis.
