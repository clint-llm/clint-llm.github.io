The Achilles tendon ranks as the strongest tendon in the human body. This tendon connects the plantaris, gastrocnemius, and soleus to the calcaneus bone. A sheath-like structure comprised of a single layer of cells surrounds the tendon; this is called the paratenon. The paratenon supplies a significant portion of the blood supply to the tendon. Studies have shown an area of hypovascularity 2 to 6 cm proximal to calcaneal insertion; this is a common area of injury. The Achilles tendon allows the calf muscles to act on the heel, which is necessary for walking or running. The tendon has several causes of injury as well as several locations that are the most commonly injured. In this review, we will discuss insertional tendinitis, mid-body Achilles tendonitis, paratenonitis, and tendon rupture. Please refer to the tendinosis chapter for more information regarding the histological differences between tendinitis and tendinosis.
