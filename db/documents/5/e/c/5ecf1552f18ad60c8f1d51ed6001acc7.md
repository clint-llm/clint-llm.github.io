Surgical complications can happen after EA/TEF repair. The most dreaded complication is an esophageal anastomotic leak.

Another potential complication is an esophageal anastomotic stricture. These are typically managed with serial endoscopic esophageal dilations.

Non-surgical complications of having EA/TEF are common. Proton pump inhibitor use is recommended for a minimum of one year after EA/TEF repair due to esophageal dysmotility that leads to increased gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and risk of aspiration.

Due to the increased GER throughout childhood into adulthood, these children have increased rates of Barrett's esophagus and have a higher risk of esophageal cancer compared to the general population.
