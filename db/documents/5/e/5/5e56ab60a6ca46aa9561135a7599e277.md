Despite meticulous harvesting, processing, and grafting techniques, there exist several complications associated with fat grafting:

- Bruising, edema, and ecchymosis are the most common sequelae

- Overcorrection due to the transfer of excess fat

- Undercorrection due to transfer of an insufficient volume of fat or excessive resorption of grafted fat

- Pyogenic granulomas and cellulitis secondary to infection and/or prolonged inflammation

- Blistering

- Scarring

- Tissue bunching or palpable deformities from injections placed too superficially

- Contour irregularities and nodules or calcifications

- Pain at the donor site due to inadequate anesthesia

- Deformity at the donor site due to excessive or unequal fat harvesting or violation of a zone of adherence

- Blindness due to occlusion of the ophthalmic artery

- Stroke due to occlusion of the internal carotid artery

- Fat embolism

Graft loss and bruising can be minimized by employing atraumatic technique, which minimizes hematoma formation. Cool compresses may be helpful in the first three days after treatment to reduce ecchymosis; excessive icing can lead to vasoconstriction and risk of graft loss. Vigorous activity should be avoided for two to three weeks after the procedure.

Blindness is a rare complication of fat grafting. High-pressure injection into the supratrochlear artery may cause the fat to reach the ophthalmic artery. Once the pressure is released, the fat can then embolize in an anterograde direction, and subsequent occlusion of the central retinal artery can cause blindness. Blindness resulting from fat grafting requires urgent intervention; the patient should immediately be transferred to the hospital. Timolol 0.5% drops, aspirin 325 mg, and acetazolamide 500 mg should be administered while awaiting transfer. In addition to blindness, fat embolism may cause stroke, including headaches, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, numbness, weakness, and vital sign instability.

Facial swelling and bruises are also quite common after fat grafting. It is important to distinguish expected edema from cellulitis, which presents with fever, warmth, erythema, and tenderness. In contrast to cellulitis, edema is self-limited but may be prolonged due to the rich vascularity of the face. Prolonged edema is treated with facial lymphatic massage, therapeutic ultrasound, explaining to the patient the protracted nature of symptoms, and offering reassurance. In cases of overcorrection with fat injections that do not resorb sufficiently, the excess volume may be addressed with deoxycholic acid injection.
