Diagnosis of spontaneous intestinal perforation is based on the characteristic clinical presentation.

Laboratory findings are usually non-specific and may include:

- Leukocytosis

- Anemia

- Thrombocytopenia

- Elevated liver function tests, including serum alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels

Diagnosis of spontaneous intestinal perforation can be confirmed by the typical radiographic findings of pneumoperitoneum. Supine and lateral decubitus or cross-table lateral views must be obtained.
