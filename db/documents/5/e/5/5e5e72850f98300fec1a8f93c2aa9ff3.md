Osteoblastomas generally grow slowly with minimal or no symptomatology. In these patients, the lesions are incidentally found during imaging for the evaluation of other disease processes. This lack of symptomatology is in contradistinction from osteoid osteoma, which generally presents in slightly younger patients with night-time pain relieved by salicylates.

When patients are symptomatic, they most commonly experience dull, localized pain. In some cases, the lesions are tender to palpation and present with associated soft tissue swelling, particularly when the lesion is close to the surface.

Osteoblastomas of the spine have similar symptoms to that of osteoid osteoma, namely back pain, scoliosis, and nerve root compression.

Osteoblastomas rarely extend into the surrounding soft tissues and generally do not illicit surrounding soft tissue edema or inflammatory response.Â Osteoblastomas generally have a favorable prognosis, although local recurrence has been reported to be as high as 25%.
