A follow-up of a patient with renal calculi should include imaging studies to evaluate for stone progression and activity. Though 80% to 90% of stones pass spontaneously if 4 mm in size or less, in the remaining cases immobile calculi canÂ lead to obstruction, infection, pyonephroisis, caliceal rupture, urinomas, loss of renal parenchyma and ureteral strictures. Uric acid stones are well managed by alkalinization therapy, but surgery can be performed in the case of calculi >10 mm. The underlying etiology also determines the prognosis of uric acid calculi.
