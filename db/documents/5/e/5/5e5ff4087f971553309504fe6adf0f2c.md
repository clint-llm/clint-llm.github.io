Intuitively, pain is a subjective experience, and thus many elements of the biopsychosocial components during history taking are critical. A stoic patient with acute pancreatitis may rate their pain severity a four out of ten, while a more histrionic patient with wrist strain could state their pain is an eight out of ten. Neither patient is wrong, and it is a subjective measurement.

An essential first step in the pain assessment is distinguishing nociceptive pain from neuropathic. A sharpÂ or throbbing pain is more likely to be acute nociceptive pain. Pain characterized as burning, shooting, pins, and needles, or electric shock-like point the differential towards a neuropathic origin of the patient's pain.
