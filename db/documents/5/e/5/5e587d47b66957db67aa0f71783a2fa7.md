A number of features have been identified on microscopic examination of aneurysm walls. There is noted to be fragmentation of the internal elastic membrane, with decreased elastin and increased collagen. In addition, there is noted to be a loss of muscle cells in the medial wall layer. Inflammatory findings associated with aneurysms include increased microvascular infiltration within the wall as well a predominance of T-cell inflammation present within the media and adventitial layers.
