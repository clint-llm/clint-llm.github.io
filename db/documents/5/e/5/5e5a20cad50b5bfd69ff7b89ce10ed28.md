A Marjolin ulcer is a cutaneous malignancy that arises in the setting of previously injured skin, longstanding scars, and chronic wounds. Historically, Marjolin ulcers are named for French surgeon Jean Nicolas Marjolin and first described as ulcerations with dense villi arising within a burn cicatrix. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most frequent malignancy identified, although other cell types have been described (i.e., basal cell carcinoma). Lesions are aggressive and carry a poor prognosis with a high rate of recurrence. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of Marjolin ulcer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of Marjolin ulcer.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with Marjolin ulcer.
- Summarize the treatment options for Marjolin ulcer.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Marjolin ulcers.
