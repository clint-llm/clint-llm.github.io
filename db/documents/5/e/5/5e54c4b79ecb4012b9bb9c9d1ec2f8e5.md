Itching of the eyelids is the main symptom in phthiriasis palpebrarum. Persistent scratching, rubbing the eyelashes, and pruritis may lead to diffuse inflammation. A gritty sensation, redness, hyperemia, swollen eyelids, reddish-brown crusts, watering, whitish discharge, burning sensation, irritation, and pain are less commonly observed.

Careful examination with slit lamp shows translucent nits, which appear as oval structures located at the emergence of the eyelashes. Lice appear as moving and semi-transparent structures. The number of lice is variable (one louse to dozens). Dermatoscopy may lead to similar findings.
