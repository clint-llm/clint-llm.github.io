Diverticulosis usually remains asymptomatic or causes bleeding through the rectum. The symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease presents with constant abdominal pain attributed to diverticula in the absence of colitis or diverticulitis. Segmental colitis is the inflammation in the diverticular mucosa without the involvement of the diverticular orifices. Diverticulitis is defined as the inflammation of a diverticulum. It can be acute or chronic, uncomplicated, or complicated. Diverticulitis is complicated by an abscess, fistula, bowel obstruction, or free perforation. Inflammation within the diverticula may result in the formation of a fistula between the colon and adjacent viscera. Fistulas most commonly involve the bladder resulting in a colovesical fistula, or vagina causing a colovaginal fistula. Colovesical fistula presents with pneumaturia, fecaluria, or dysuria. Patients with a colovaginal fistula may experience the vaginal passage of feces or flatus.
