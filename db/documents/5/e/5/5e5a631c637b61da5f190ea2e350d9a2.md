The original approach focused on pain relief for patients with unilateral malignancies, lower extremity pathologies, failed back syndrome, chronic nociceptive painful conditions, and cancer patients. On the other hand, bilateral cordotomies for visceral or bilateral pain are also an option. In the more recent percutaneous approach, the destruction of the lateral spinothalamic tract at the level of C1-C2 results in a contralateral disruption of painful sensations beyond C4. Today, this latter approach is most commonly used in patients with limited life expectancy and suffering from opioid-resistant cancer pain. Irrespective of the procedure or technique, one uniform indication for this intervention is having severely intractable pain which has not responded to conventional therapies. Cancer-related pain is an indication but not a requirement as it can be done in populations suffering other irreversible painful conditions. The pain severity level is essential when considering appropriate indications. The patient's pain must have advanced to level 3 of the World Health Organization (WHO) pain ladder before considering this invasive procedure.

The cordotomy has been documented as particularly impactful for pain secondary to mesothelioma, Pancoast syndrome, and lung cancer.
