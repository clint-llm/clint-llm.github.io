A significant component of cardiac risk assessment is preoperative testing. There are specific evidence-based guidelines regarding when to obtain non-invasive testing in patients before undergoing surgery.

**Electrocardiogram**

A preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) is a valuable tool to assess for the possibility of myocardial ischemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, conduction blocks or other arrhythmias.

According to the 2009 ACC/AHA guidelines, an ECG should/should not be obtained in the following situations

- Pre-operative ECG should be obtained in patients who have risk factors and are scheduled for intermediate- or high-risk surgery

- Pre-operative ECG should be considered for patients who have risk factor(s) and are scheduled for low-risk surgery

- Pre-operative ECG may be considered for patients who have no risk factors and are scheduled for intermediate-risk surgery

- Pre-operative ECG is not recommended for patients who have no risk factor and are scheduled for low-risk surgery

**Echocardiography**

Echocardiography is not a routine recommendation for all patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. The current ACCF/AHA guidelinesÂ recommend a preoperative echocardiogram in patients with dyspnea of unknown origin or recent exacerbation of heart failure, as well as to assess valvular function in patients with a murmur,

An echocardiogram is also recommended in patients with a known severe valvular disorder to assess severity and in patients with valvular disorders undergoing intermediate high-risk surgery. It is a consideration in patients undergoing high-risk surgery but is not a recommendation for patients undergoing low to intermediate-risk surgery or in asymptomatic patients.

**Non-invasive Stress Testing**

Although moderate to large areas of inducible ischemia on noninvasive stress testing have been shown to be a predictor of a major adverse cardiac event,
