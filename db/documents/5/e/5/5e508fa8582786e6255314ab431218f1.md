The diagnosis of cutaneous IH and CH may be made on clinical grounds. However, hepatic lesions may not be fully assessed with physical exam alone. Definitive diagnosis of IH and CH may be made with biopsy and subsequent histopathological examination; however, this is often difficult as lesions are highly vascular and represent a bleeding risk. Therefore, clinical course, classic radiographic findings, and exclusion of malignant processes with laboratory studies can be used to make the diagnosis.

Diagnosis of IH and CH may be based on their clinical course. Both lesions should be monitored with serial ultrasounds. A lesion that grows rapidly from birth until about eight months of age then begins to regress is consistent with IH, whereas a lesion that is fully formed at birth and slowly regresses is consistent with CH.

Distinctive characteristics on imaging may be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of either CH or IH. In the case of CH, the lesion may appear strikingly heterogeneous on US, CT, or MRI, with a peripheral rim of contrast enhancement and minimal central enhancement.

In both cases, documentation of a falling serum AFP and negative urine catecholamines may be helpful in excluding hepatoblastoma or neuroblastoma.
