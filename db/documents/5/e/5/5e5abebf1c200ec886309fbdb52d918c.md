A growing body of evidence demonstrates the use of epidural anesthesia/analgesia techniques has positive effects like faster return in bowel function, a decrease of the hormonal stress response to pain, and decreased postoperative pulmonary complications shortening in the length of in-hospital stay and patient satisfaction.

- Close monitoring of the patient by nurses in the postoperative period is key to safety.

- Adequate consideration of risks and benefits is necessary on a case-by-case basis.

- Safe and effective use of epidural anesthesia requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
