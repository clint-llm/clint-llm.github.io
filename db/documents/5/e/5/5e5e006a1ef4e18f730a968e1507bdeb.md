Often, Diamond Blackfan anemia occurs as a result of a genetic mutation. The most common mutation involves a ribosomal protein on chromosome 11. However, research has also noted mutations of transcription factor GATA1 in newer studies.

Defective ribosomal protein biosynthesis initiates apoptosis of erythroid progenitor cells through p53 activation and stabilization, leading to erythroid failure. This mechanism is known as ‘ribosomal stress.'
