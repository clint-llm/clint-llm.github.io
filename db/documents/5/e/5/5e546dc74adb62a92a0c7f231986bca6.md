The squamous epithelium of the uterine cervix proliferates, covering the columnar epithelium of the endocervical glands; this takes place when it gets chronically inflamed as a result of the healing process of chronic cervicitis, or as part of the physiological metaplasia. The columnar epithelium secrets mucous, which then forms retention cysts, which are the nabothian cysts. Although the cysts are often small, only a few millimeters in diameter, they sometimes may reach 4 cm or more.
