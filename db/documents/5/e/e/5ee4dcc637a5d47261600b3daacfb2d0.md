Tetrahydrofolate (THF) or tetrahydrofolic acid is a derivative of vitamin B9 (folic acid or pteroyl-L-glutamic acid). This water-soluble vitamin is a coenzyme for metabolic reactions involving amino acid and nucleic acid formations. It participates in important single-carbon transfer reactions often referred to as one-carbon metabolism and in synthesizing several amino acids such as serine and methionine, purines and thymine, a pyrimidine. The single carbon transfer reactions are essential in the metabolism and regulation of gene expression.

Chemically folic acid consists of three structural components- para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a bicyclic pteridine ring, and glutamic acid. The active form of folic acid is known as tetrahydrofolic acid or tetrahydrofolate (THF or FH4), which is a result of the addition of four hydrogen atoms to 5,6,7 and 8 positions in the pteridine ring.
