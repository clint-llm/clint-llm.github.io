Tuberculosis is a disease that results from infection with the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It most commonly affects the lungs but can also affect other areas of the body. The infection can be active or latent, with approximately 10% of latent infections progressing to active status. The disease is spread by droplets from speaking, coughing, and sneezing. In the past, the disease was colloquially known by the name consumption. Diagnosis is via chest X-ray, microbacterial cultures, and tuberculin skin test.
