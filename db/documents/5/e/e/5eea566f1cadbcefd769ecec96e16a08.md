Laryngeal papillomatosis is a chronic condition of the respiratory tract that can affect both adults and children. It is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes primary clinicians, emergency department clinicians, and otolaryngologists. Attempts at treating or eradicating the condition through multiple management options, surgical and adjuvant have been implemented without a consistent outcome. A hypothesis of a multigene-disease theory has been proposed. This consists of innate and adaptive immunity disruption, as well as HLA alleles absence.

The HPV vaccine, which has been historically used to prevent cervical cancer and genital warts associated with HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18, has been approved for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. The CDC has recommended that all boys and girls between the ages of 11 to 26 years be vaccinated. Recently the quadrivalent HPV vaccine has been replaced with the 9-valent HPV vaccine for prevention. Often overlooked, the role that primary clinicians and obstetric and gynecologists play in eradicating LP is fundamental. These subspecialties have the highest contact with the most evident mode of transmission and can recommend the use of the vaccine. Additionally, concurrent research has been focusing on further developing genetic and immunologic tools for the treatment of patients with the condition through gene mutations or through T-cell restoration.
