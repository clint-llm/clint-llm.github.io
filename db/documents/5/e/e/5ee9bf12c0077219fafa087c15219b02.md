An interprofessional team approach yields the highest chance of success in treating cases of refractory coccydynia. This team can include primary clinicians, orthopedic surgeons, physiatrists, sports medicine clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, physical therapists, and psychotherapists.Â Improvement of patient outcomes can be achieved by making rational use of medications, injections, pelvic floor physical therapy, surgery, and psychotherapy.
