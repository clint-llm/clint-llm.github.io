Patients with coronary cameral fistulae should be managed by an interprofessional team that includes an interventional cardiologist, a cardiac surgeon, an echocardiographer, a radiologist, a pharmacist, and a nurse practitioner. The cardiologist or the cardiac surgeon will typically be leading the team of healthcare professionals to ensure the delivery of optimal care to the patient. They will be the ones to carry out the gold standard test for the diagnosis of coronal cameral fistula, i.e., coronary angiography. They will also be the ones to manage the condition with either transcatheter or surgical closure. The echocardiographer and the radiologist will help provide noninvasive means by which the disease can be diagnosed, particularly via color doppler echocardiography and computed tomography. The pharmacist will help the team decide about the choice and appropriate dose of the antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant that most suits the patient's needs. Nursing staff will coordinate care between different members of the team and will be providing direct patient care by checking vitals signs, administering medications, and attending to patients' needs. An interprofessional team approach will lead to the best outcomes. [Level 5]
