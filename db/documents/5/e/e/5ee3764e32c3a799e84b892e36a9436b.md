The diagnosis of Werdnig-Hoffmann disease can be stressful and overwhelming for the families. Patient education must be an important part of the clinical management of patients with this condition. Counseling must be given about prognosis, complications, and outcomes. Support groups can help with the management of issues like anxiety, frustration, loneliness, and depression. The patientâ€™s families should be counseled about the diagnosis and the prognosis. Clinicians and family members should also establish medical and psychosocial treatment plans.
