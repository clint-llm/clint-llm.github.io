Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the formation or presence of a thrombus in the deep veins. DVT occurs mostly in the lower extremities and, to a lesser extent, in the upper extremities. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is an obstruction of the pulmonary artery or its branches by a thrombus (sometimes due to fat or air). The most likely source of thrombus in pulmonary arteries is an embolization from deep veins in the legs. This activity reviews the causes of DVT and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the prophylaxis against DVT.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the cause of DVT.
- Develop strategies to increase compliance with the use of DVT prophylaxis. 
- Apply best practices when emergent and ongoing management in prophylaxis is unsuccessful.
- Coordinate with the interprofessional team to enhance prophylaxis against DVT and improve patient outcomes.
