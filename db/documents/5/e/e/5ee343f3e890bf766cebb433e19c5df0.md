Lower blepharoplasty with canthal support can be done either as a well-equipped surgical theatre or in an office-based setting. It can be done under general anesthesia or local anesthesia with sedation. It should be done by a board-certified plastic surgeon or an oculoplastic surgeon. The operating surgeon must choose his preferred method of anesthesia and which theatre setting he would prefer to give the patient the best outcome. The team should also include a scrub nurse familiar with the used surgical set, a surgical assistant to help with retraction and stitch cutting, and an anesthetist in cases that need general anesthesia.
