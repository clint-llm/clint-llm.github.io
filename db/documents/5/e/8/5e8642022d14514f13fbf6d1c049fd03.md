The phakic intraocular lens (IOLs) is a technology that expands the range of refractive surgery to cover higher degrees of myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism that were previously not possible to treat. It provides an effective solution to high refractive errors in candidates who are not suited for corneal refractive treatments. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with high myopia undergoing treatment with phakic IOLs and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of myopia and the evolution of phakic IOLs.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with high myopia using phakic IOLs.
- Review the common complications of phakic IOLs used in high myopia.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by high myopia with phakic IOLs.
