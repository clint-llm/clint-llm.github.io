Clear communication with the patient and treatment team relieves distress and improves outcomes when a difficult catheterization is encountered.

A two-person indwelling urinary catheterization team was found to decrease the incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in a 2017 study.

The "flipped classroom" approach to nursing education, where students view online lectures and read current review articles before class, has proven successful in improving nursing knowledge and skills regarding Foley catheterization.

Prospective analyses looking at Foley placement problems reported that urologic consultations for difficult Foley catheterizations were unnecessary in 41% to 70% of cases as no specialized urological instrumentation was required for successful placement.

Even physicians do not always receive adequate training or supervision for Foley catheterization. In a study done at a tertiary care academic teaching center, 76% of the interns indicated that their practical training in Foley placement was either inadequate or non-existent, and over half were not supervised during their first attempt at catheter placement in an actual patient.

Successful programs to improve successful urinary catheterizations with fewer injuries and reduced catheter-related urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) included general nursing, medical student, and resident education in urethral anatomy and proper Foley placement techniques.
