Diagnosis and management of patients diagnosed with bullous myringitis require an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that include a nurse, a pharmacist, and several physicians in different specialties. This approach is necessary to reduce both morbidity and mortality of bullous myringitis sequela. The moment there is a diagnosis of bullous myringitis, the provider needs to provide proper analgesia orders for the nurse to administer, as well as systemic antibiotics. There also may be a need for referral to otolaryngology for further evaluation and management, which includes auditory testing for the assessment of hearing loss.
