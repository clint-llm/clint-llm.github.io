Penile prosthesis implantation is performed for erectile dysfunction refractory to conservative therapy. Inflatable and malleable devices are available options for patients. Multiple implantation approaches can be used successfully depending on patient anatomy and preference. This activity reviews the best practices for implantation of penile prosthesis in patients who have failed more conservative measures. Further, this activity reviews the technique for penile prosthesis placement and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients requiring a prosthesis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the contraindications of penile prosthesis implantation.
- Describe the technique employed for penile prosthesis implantation.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications with penile prosthesis implantation.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance penile prosthesis implantation and improve outcomes.
