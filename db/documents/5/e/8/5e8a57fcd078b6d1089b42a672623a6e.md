Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous disease that results from the deposition of toxic insoluble beta-sheet fibrillar protein aggregates in different tissues. Amyloidosis can be acquired or hereditary. The disease can be localized or systemic. Thus, it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an oncologist, hematologist, internist, nephrologist, and a neurologist. Amyloid can accumulate in the liver, spleen, kidney, heart, nerves, and blood vessels causing different clinical syndromes including cardiomyopathy, hepatomegaly, proteinuria, macroglossia, autonomic dysfunction, ecchymoses, neuropathy, renal failure, hypertension, and corneal and vitreous abnormalities. This disease is treated most likely in the framework of clinical trials and depending on the risk stratification according to the Standard Mayo Clinic staging system.
