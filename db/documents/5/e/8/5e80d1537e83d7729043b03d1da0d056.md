**Current Evidence of BIS Monitoring**

BIS is in current use in the operating rooms, ICUs, and some emergency departments. In 2007, Carlos et al. found that time to extubation and discharge from the operating room and PACU is reduced with the use of BIS monitoring.Â The risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting was decreased by 12% in patients monitored with BIS.

So far, there is no gold standard to span the entire spectrum of anesthetic effect on the central nervous system. BIS is one of the most studied monitors derived from EEG used nowadays. BIS has been shown to have a positive cost-benefit ratio and lower morbidity than more invasive monitoring methods.
