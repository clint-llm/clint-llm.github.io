Research has shown that respiratory variation of heart rate at the time of beta-blockade, which is a metric of cardiac PNS activity, decreases with age. Additionally, latency for the pupillary response to light, a metric of iris PNS activity, increases with age.Â  Therefore, both studies have given a quantitative measure of the decrease in PNS activity with age.
