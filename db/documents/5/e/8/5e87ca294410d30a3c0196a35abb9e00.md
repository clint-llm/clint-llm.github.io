Osteoma cutis accounts for 14% of all cutaneous ossifications.

The most common locations of osteoma cutis are the face in females and the scalp in males. Other sites of involvement include the breasts, the buttocks, and the extremities. Rarely, osteoma cutis has been seen in mucosae such as the tongue, which is also called osteoma mucosae or osseous choristoma.
