The prognosis of cinchonism is generally favorable and depends on the offending drug used and the serum level of the drug. Cinchonism itself is not a life-limiting sequela of quinoline derivatives; however, ventricular tachyarrhythmias associated with similar offending medications may cause life-limiting outcomes. This outcome is not discussed in detail in this article, as it does not fall under the term “cinchonism.”
