After TBI, whether mild or moderate/severe, patients should be evaluated and questioned about headaches. Per ICHD-3, post-traumatic headaches should occur within 7 days of acute insult. Patients with PTHA lasting more than 3 months are considered to have persistent PTHA. PTHA does not have a specific phenotype, and TBI patients report symptoms that bear similar characteristics to different primary and secondary headaches.
