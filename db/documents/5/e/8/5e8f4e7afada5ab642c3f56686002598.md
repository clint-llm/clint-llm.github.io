The use of anticholinergics requires caution, particularly with the elderly, those with a high anticholinergic burden, and those with conditions susceptible to increased anticholinergic activity such as dementia.

Patients with high anticholinergic burdens are at higher risk for adverse effects and anticholinergic toxicity; providers need to consider the total anticholinergic burden when prescribing new medications. Patients with dementia also have a relative contraindication to the use of anticholinergics. Dementia correlates with reduced acetylcholine in the brain and thus can become worse with the use of anticholinergics.
