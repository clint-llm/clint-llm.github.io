Pediatric nuclear medicine is a niche field and requires expertise for optimal outcomes. Appropriate use of nuclear medicine exams and their impact on clinical management obviates concerns about radiation exposure. Highly skilled experts such as child life specialists, pediatric anesthesia technologists, pediatric anesthesiologists, pediatric nuclear medicine technologists, pediatric nurses, and pediatric nuclear medicine physicians are needed.

Proper communication and planning are essential. Following best medical practice and society guidelines is paramount. Standardized, harmonized protocols must be followed. An integrated simple and advanced collaborative pathway and constant case discussions between the nuclear medicine team and referring pediatricians and pediatric subspecialists (in oncology, surgery, neurology, neurosurgery, urology, nephrology, rheumatology, gastroenterology, and orthopedics) will deliver optimized outcomes.
