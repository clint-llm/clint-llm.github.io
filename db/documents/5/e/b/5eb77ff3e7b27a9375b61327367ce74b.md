SPB presents with pain in the bones containing red bone marrow, e.g., ribs, vertebrae(thoracic more than lumber and cervical), femur, and pelvis.

EMP can occur anywhere in the body with 80% to 90% in the head and neck region and aerodigestive tract, mainly in the oral cavity, tonsillar fossa, nasal cavity, and paranasal sinuses, which may present with headache, nasal discharge, dysphagia, sore throat, epistaxis, and nasal obstruction.

Uncommon presentations include involvement of the larynx causing hoarseness, dysphonia, dyspnea, airway obstruction, and wheezing.

Gastrointestinal involvement is rare and presents with epigastric pain, hemoptysis, loss of appetite, bleeding, and abdominal discomfort. Involvement of mesentery is also seen, with only 10 cases reported.

Plasmacytoma may mimic a pulmonary tumor and present as a nodular parenchymal or perihilar opacity, associated with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, rarely alveolar interstitial or endobronchial damage.
