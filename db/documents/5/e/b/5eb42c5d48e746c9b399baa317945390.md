There are multiple clinical indications for TEE.  It typically provides superior imaging versus transthoracic echocardiography. It is an invasive test, however, and its use in patients should be warranted.  Indications for TEE include:

- Evaluation of acute aortic pathology (dissection, transection)

- Evaluation of prosthetic heart valves

- Evaluation of paravalvular abscess

- Evaluation of patients where TTE imaging is inadequate and the information obtained would change management

- All open heart valvular and thoracic aortic surgical procedures

- Coronary artery bypass surgeries (CABG): Its use should be considered to confirm the preoperative diagnosis, detect new pathology, to adjust the surgical plan, or to assess surgical intervention

- Catheter-based cardiac procedures (i.e., TAVR, left atrial appendage device implantation, or atrial septal defect closure)

- Non-cardiac surgery where known or suspected cardiovascular disease may result in hemodynamic compromise

- The unexplained life-threatening circulatory instability that is not corrected by usual therapy (rescue TEE)

- Diagnosis of suspected pulmonary embolism

- Confirmation and diagnosis of air embolism, particularly in neurosurgical procedures

- Evaluation of pericardial effusion

- Evaluation of congenital cardiac disease in the intraoperative period
