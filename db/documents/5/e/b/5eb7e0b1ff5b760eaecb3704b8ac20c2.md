Adenosine can serve as a diagnostic or therapeutic agent. Diagnostically, adenosine is one pharmaceutical agent used in a myocardial perfusion stress imaging study for its vasodilatory effects. Therapeutically, adenosine is used for its antiarrhythmic properties in supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and can function as a diagnostic tool, depending on the type ofÂ SVT.

Worldwide, glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness. Endogenous adenosine appears to play a role in the pathophysiology of glaucoma. The experimental adenosine A1 receptor agonist, trabodenoson

The European Society of Cardiology guidelines advocates using vagal maneuvers and adenosine as first-line therapies in diagnosing and treating supraventricular tachycardia.

Pediatric supraventricular tachycardia is a common arrhythmia with great clinical significance. If not promptly treated, it can cause cardiogenic shock and heart failure. An infant presented with unstable supraventricular tachycardia.

The 2020 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care (pediatric life support) gives adenosine a class I recommendation for hemodynamically stable supraventricular tachycardia.

Adenosine triphosphate is metabolized into adenosine when given intravenously was used to treat arrhythmias, and it has similar clinical efficacy to intravenous adenosine. However, adenosine is more stable at room temperature than adenosine triphosphate.
