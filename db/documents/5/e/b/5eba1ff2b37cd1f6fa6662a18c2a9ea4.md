The initial diagnosis of thyroid cancer is based on ultrasound and cytology findings. In low-risk patients with differentiated localized or regional disease and no evidence of metastasis, surgical intervention is curative.

ATA guidelines favored the specificity of molecular cytological testing over PET/CT for these cases. Hence, individualized interprofessional management with endocrine, pathology, radiology, and surgery departments is necessary to provide optimal patient care and minimize healthcare expenses. This interprofessional team includes specialists, clinicians, mid-level providers, nurses, and radiology technicians, working collaboratively to obtain optimal diagnostic information.
