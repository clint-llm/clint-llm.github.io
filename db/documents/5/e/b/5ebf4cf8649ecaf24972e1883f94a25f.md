Monitor vital signs and cardiac function. Blood pressure, pulse, breathing, and oxygen saturation always need to be monitored when using ketamine.

Be prepared for intubation when administering ketamine.

Neuropsychiatric function always requires monitoring, and a patient must be at baseline before discharge from care. Even after a patient's return to baseline, the patient's discharge should be under the supervision of another responsible adult. Patients should not drive, use heavy machinery, or perform other potentially hazardous activities for up to 24 hours following ketamine administration.
