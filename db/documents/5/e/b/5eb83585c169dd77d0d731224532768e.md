If there is a suspicion of vascular dementia, then patients should undergo cognitive testing. A variety of cognitive performance tests enable the practitioner to assess for cognitive domain deficits. Rule-out secondary etiologies of cognitive decline, including depression, thyroid disorder, medications (e.g., benzodiazepines or anticholinergics), alcohol abuse, or infectious causes (e.g., neurosyphilis or human immunodeficiency virus-associated dementia). Recommended laboratory studies include complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, rapid plasma regain (RPR), and vitamin B12. For depression assessment, practitioners can utilize the Geriatric Depression Scale (validated in mild dementia) or PHQ-9. If warranted, practitioners should obtain imaging studies. For example, if the patient demonstrates focal neurologic deficits, then MRI without contrast would be the preferred imaging modality.

Today vascular dementia also is diagnosed using the DSM 5 criteria,Â  the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition criteria, the Alzheimer's Disease Diagnostic and Treatment criteria, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Association Internationale pour la Recherche at L'Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-AIREN) criteria and the Hachinski ischemic score.
