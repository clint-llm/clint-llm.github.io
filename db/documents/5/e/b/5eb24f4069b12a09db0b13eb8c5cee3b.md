The histopathology of the components of the TFCC can be broken downÂ as follows

- Triangular fibrocartilage disc: fibrocartilage with blood vessels on the ulnar aspect; otherwise, this structure is avascular

- Extensor carpi ulnaris tendon sub-sheath: a combination of loose and tight parallel collagen

- Ulnotriquetral and ulnolunate ligaments: a combination of loose and tight parallel collagen. The ulnolunate has less elastic fibers than the ulnotriquetral

- Dorsal and volar distal radioulnar ligaments: parallel collagen bundles

- Meniscal homolog: the majority is composed of loose connective tissue
