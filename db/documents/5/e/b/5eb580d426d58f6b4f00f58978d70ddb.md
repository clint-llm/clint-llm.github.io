Several diseases or conditions can be mistaken for intellectual disability:

- Child abuse: childhood abuse may cause developmental delays in language and socialization, causing a defect in adaptive function. The child may have difficulty communicating her needs and developing trust and social responsibility. Unlike intellectual disability, symptoms are often reversible when the environment improves.

- Debilitating medical disease: Individuals with normal intelligence may experience depression and delay in the development of chronic, debilitating medical illnesses.

- Cerebral palsy: poor muscle coordination, problems with vision, hearing, and speaking may imitate symptoms of intellectual disability.

- Sensory disability: deafness or blindness may lead to a flaw in diagnostic testing, causing a false-positive diagnosis of intellectual disability.

- Speech disorder: expressive and receptive aphasia may be mistaken for intellectual disability.
