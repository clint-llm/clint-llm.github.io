Viral infections are presumed as a cause of subacute thyroiditis. Many patients may have a history of viral upper respiratory infection 2 to 8 weeks before developing thyroiditis. De Quervain thyroiditis is the most common cause of thyroid/neck pain. Some studies have suggested that the seasonal distribution of thyroiditis coincides with the peak incidences of coxsackievirus (groups A & B) and echovirus infections. It is also associated with mumps, measles, influenza,Â SARS-CoV-2, and other viruses.

Autoimmunity is not significant in subacute thyroiditis, unlike other thyroiditis, but it is commonly associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)- B35.
