Vincristine belongs to a group of drugs known as the vinca alkaloids. Vinca alkaloids are organic compounds made up of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen derived from the periwinkle plant. These drugs block cell growth by stopping mitosis by interfering with microtubule polymerization. The FDA-approved indications of vincristine are acute lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia, and Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Vincristine also has several off-label uses that include central nervous system (CNS) tumors, Ewing sarcoma, gestational trophoblastic tumors, multiple myeloma, ovarian cancer, primary CNS lymphoma, small cell lung cancer, and advanced thymoma in adult patients. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of vincristine so providers can direct patient therapy in cancer treatment where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of vinca alkaloids like vincristine.
- Summarize the indicated cancers for which vincristine is a therapeutic option.
- Review the adverse event profile for vincristine.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team and how it can enhance patient care with vincristine therapy to improve patient outcomes for patients who have cancers for which it is indicated.
