The histology is typical but depends on the age of the lesion. Early lesionsÂ reveal a decrease in the granular layer with confluent parakeratosis. There is also an infiltrate of PMNs and mild spongiosis. With age, there is significant ballooning and reticular degeneration, with necrosis of keratinocytes. In the end stage of disease, one may see psoriasiform hyperplasia of the epidermis.
