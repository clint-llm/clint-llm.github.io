All interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, PAs, NPs), specialists (cardiologists, internists, hospitalists, hematologists, and others), primary care providers, nursing staff, and pharmacists who treat patients with atrial fibrillation should be well informed regarding pharmacotherapy with apixaban. This novel oral anticoagulant was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 for use in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots. Later, in 2014, it was approved to treat deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). In 2014, it was also approved for use to reduce the risk of blood clots (DVT and PE) in patients following knee and hip replacement surgery.

Unlike warfarin, the drug is relatively safe and does not need INR monitoring. However, ongoing close monitoring of patients taking apixaban is necessary to prevent bleeding; to this end, all providers, including clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists, should counsel the patient so they are aware of the early signs of potential bleeding that could lead to more severe events. If any team member notices signs of bleeding, they must promptly communicate this to the prescriber for therapeutic intervention. The interprofessional team needs to work as a cohesive unit to ensure that apixaban treatment is safe and effective for their patients, resulting in optimal patient outcomes with minimal adverse events.
