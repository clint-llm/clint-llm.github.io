This activity reviews lumbar provocative discography and highlights the role of the interventionalist and healthcare team in interpreting and using the results as part of a multimodal model for caring for and identifying patients who are candidates for provocative discography.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the rationale behind selecting provocative discography for a patient.
- Explain the anatomy and patho-anatomy of the IVD and posterior annular tears that are often not seen on MRI.
- Review the risks and alternatives and appropriate medical considerations before performing provocative discograms.
- Outline the role of provocative discography in surgical planning, including minimally invasive techniques or regenerative injections.
