Microscopic evaluation with the Tzanck smear technique can be performed on the fluid obtained from the vesicles. This should reveal multinucleated giant cells using a Giemsa stain, methylene blue, or Wright's stain. The sensitivity of the test is low, but it has a high specificity when pre-test clinical suspicion is high. DistinguishingÂ between herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, and cytomegalovirus infections can be challenging because they are all herpesviruses; the Tzanck smear is also used to identify pemphigus vulgaris, leprosy, and leishmaniasis.
