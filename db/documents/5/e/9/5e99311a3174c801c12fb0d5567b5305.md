Small subsets of patients experience a malignant transformation of multiple biliary duct hamartomas to either intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (more common) or hepatocellular carcinoma. Risk factors for possible malignant transformation include long-term tobacco use, large biliary duct hamartomas (> 2 cm), and bile stasis.

It is essential to have periodic long-term follow-ups with these patients with a definitive diagnosis of multiple biliary duct hamartomas. Patients require a baseline CA 19-9 level, which can be slightly elevated with multiple biliary duct hamartomas. Any changes to MRI/MRCP imaging, in addition to elevations in tumor markers, warrants further evaluation with liver lesion biopsy and possible resection of lesions if operable with a definitive diagnosis.
