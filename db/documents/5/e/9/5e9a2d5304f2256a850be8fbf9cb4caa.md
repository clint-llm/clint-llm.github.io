AKA should be diagnosed clinically. The patients need fluid resuscitation, close monitoring of electrolytes, and treatment to prevent alcohol withdrawal. They also need to have a complete history and physical for a complete differential diagnosis.

The diagnosis of AKA is the first step in treatment. The patient should have blood glucose checked on the initial presentation. The next important step in the management of AKA is to give isotonic fluid resuscitation. The usual choice of fluid is normal saline with dextrose. Dextrose is required to break the cycle of ketogenesis and increase insulin secretion. The dextrose will also increase glycogen stores and diminish counterregulatory hormone levels. It is essential to administer thiamine before any glucose administration to avoid Wernicke's encephalopathy preci[itation. If severe hypokalemia is present dextrose containing fluids can be held until potassium levels are normalized. Other electrolyte abnormalities concomitantly present with alcohol abuse and poor oral intake include hypomagnesemia and hypophosphatemia. Magnesium and phosphate levels should be measured and repleted if the serum levels are found low.

Intravenous benzodiazepines can be administered based on the risk of seizures from impending alcohol withdrawal. Antiemetics such as ondansetron or metoclopramide may also be given to control nausea and vomiting.
