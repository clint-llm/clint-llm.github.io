The management of E Coli 015: H7 infection is by an interprofessional team that includes an emergency department physician, an infectious disease consultant, a nephrologist, an internist. The majority of patients are treated with supportive measures that include hydration. Antibiotics are not beneficial in most cases. However, patients with severe manifestations of HUS may benefit from hemodialysis to treat volume, electrolyte, and uremia issues related to acute renal failure. Limited data suggest that the monoclonal antibody eculizumab may expedite recovery from E. coli 0157: H7 HUS. The outcome in healthy patients is good, but in those patients with suppression of immunity, the prognosis is guarded. (Level V)
