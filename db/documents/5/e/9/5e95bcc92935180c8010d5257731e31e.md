Many interventions and treatments have been proven so far to improve outcomes in patients with ACS. Still, given the emerging new evidence, heterogeneity in the population of patients with ACS, and complexity in optimal decision-making in managing these patients, a robust interprofessional and streamlined system is necessary to keep improving outcomes. The highly coordinated care ofÂ patients with ACS, especially those with STEMI, starts early, with the first contact with emergency medical services (EMS) or the first contact with the emergency department. It is crucial that regardless of the type of initial medical contact, an electrocardiogram (ECG) needs to take place in less than 10 minutes, and the initial diagnosis is made.

It is essential to create a geographic area of responsibility to transport patients to a PCI-capable center in a timely fashion, where the cardiac catheterization lab is available 24 hours a day, seven days per week, and where healthcare personnel has clear written protocols that facilitate risk stratification and management.

ACS therapy modality selection requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
