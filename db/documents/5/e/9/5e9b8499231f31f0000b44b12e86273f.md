The incidence of hepatorenal syndrome in patients with decompensated liver disease is approximately 4%. Most of these patients have portal hypertension from alcoholic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or metastatic cancers.Â The cumulative probability of developing HRS at 1 year is 18% and at 5 years is 39% in patients with decompensated liver disease. The highest risk patients were those with hyponatremia and high plasma renin activity. One third of patients that have spontenous bacterial pertionitis can go on to develop HRS.
