The preferred management of clear cell acanthomas is complete removal, which can be done by a variety of different methods. The location, size, and the number of lesions should be considerations when deciding on aÂ treatment method. Shave removal or curettage followed by electrofulguration is a common approach. Other treatment options include cryotherapy, electrofulguration alone, standard surgical excision, and carbon dioxide laser.
