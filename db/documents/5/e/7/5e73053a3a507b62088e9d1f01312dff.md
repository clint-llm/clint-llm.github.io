Signs and symptoms of malignant hyperthermia include tachycardia, tachypnea, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, metabolic and respiratory acidosis, hyperkalemia, cardiac dysrhythmias, hypotension, skeletal muscle rigidity, and hyperthermia. The earliest signs of malignant hyperthermia are usually hypercarbia and tachycardia due to elevated carbon dioxide production. Fulminant malignant hyperthermia reactions may have only a few of the usual signs. It requires a high index of suspicion of malignant hyperthermia to effect a timely and correct diagnosis and treatment. Malignant hyperthermia can occur at any time during the intraoperative and postoperative periods.

Susceptible patients can exhibit masseter muscle spasm. If signs of hypermetabolism such as metabolic and respiratory acidosis or an elevation in body temperature accompany the muscle spasm, a diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia must be considered.
