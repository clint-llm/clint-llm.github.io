Sinus tachycardia is a regular cardiac rhythm in which the heart beats faster than normal. While it is common to have tachycardia as a physiological response to exercise or stress, it causes concern when it occurs at rest. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of sinus tachycardia and highlights the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology and epidemiology of sinus tachycardia. 
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of sinus tachycardia. 
- Outline the treatment and management options available for sinus tachycardia. 
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation of sinus tachycardia and improve outcomes.
