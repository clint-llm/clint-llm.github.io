Gastric ultrasound provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment of gastric contents. Gastric ultrasound is most useful when fasting status is uncertain (e.g., unreliable historian, cognitive dysfunction, language barriers) or in physiologic states associated with delayed gastric emptying (e.g., diabetes mellitus, acute or chronic opioid use, pregnancy, abdominal infection).

Information obtained from gastric ultrasound is used by anesthesia providers to determine if elective surgical cases should be postponed and to select the optimal induction and airway management technique for urgent or emergent procedures.
