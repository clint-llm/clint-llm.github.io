Staphylococcus epidermidis, a common bacterium found on the human flora, are innocuous species that can become virulent once inside the host. This species of bacteria can have different consequences in an infected individual, and it requires a great deal of coordination between various medical staff to treat the infection.

Early consult with the infectious disease team will aid in starting the patient on the initial treatment. If the clinical picture is concerning for endocarditis, a cardiologist can provide a further evaluation with imaging such as TTE or TEE.  Also, it is useful to have a pharmacist specializing in infectious disease to overlook the type and dosage of the medication based on the patient’s comorbidities.

Because one of the main methods of invasion for Staphylococcus epidermidis is through prosthetic and medical devices, following strict aseptic techniques during a procedure is necessary.  A systemic review showed that an effective infection control team requires a multi-disciplinary team consisting of nurses, physicians trained in infection control, microbiologist, and data manager.  For an institution to implement an efficacious protocol and system, it requires constant training in frontline staff with education, surveillance, and feedback.
