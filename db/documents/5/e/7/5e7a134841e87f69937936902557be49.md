As previously mentioned, maternal sensitization occurs in Rh-negative mothers due to exposure to the Rh D antigen. This typically occurs when the Rh-negative mother is carrying an Rh-positive fetus or has been exposed to Rh-positive blood differently. However, if the exposure to the Rh D antigen occurs during the mother’s first pregnancy, the adverse consequences of Rh incompatibility do not typically affect that initial pregnancy because the fetus often is delivered before the development of the anti-D antibodies. Once the mother has been sensitized, future pregnancies are at risk for the development of HDN secondary to Rh incompatibility if the fetus is Rh-positive.
