Discharge planning for the GBS patient should begin at the point of hospital admission for the acute phase of GBS with an emphasis on providing continuing care for the patient in acute rehabilitation, long-term care, or home care settings. Discharge planning is coordinated by members of the interprofessional care team and specific discharge plans determined for each individual patient. The focus of discharge planning should be on how best to return the patient to complete recovery.Â As the GBS patient begins the recovery process from the acute phase of GBS, plans should focus on transitioning the patient from the ICU. This may require plans to wean the patient from mechanical ventilation, the introduction of food following use and removal of IVs, parenteral nutrition or feeding tube, the introduction of sitting and standing activities, and introduction of ambulation. Discharge planning should also include specific recommendations from individual team members. For example, the physical therapist should recommend specific plans to promote muscle strength in extremities and assistance in ambulation. The occupational therapist should recommend specific plans to promote activities of daily living including feeding, bathing, and dressing. The nurse should plan to provide care coordination and health education for patients and family members to ensure that the patient makes as smooth a transition from acute illness to recovery as possible.
