Therapeutic index for topical and oral capsaicin has not been well studied; however, it is known that exposure to high doses, above 100 mg per kg body weight, of capsaicin for a prolonged time can cause peptic ulcers, enhance breast cancer metastasis, and accelerate the development of prostate, stomach, duodenal, and liver cancer. Also, it is advised to not apply it immediately before or after activities such as bathing, swimming, sunbathing, or strenuous exercise and to avoid getting it on mucous membranes or eyes.
