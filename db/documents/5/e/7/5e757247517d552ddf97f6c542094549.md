Patients with monostotic fibrous dysplasia are often asymptomatic.  Occasionally patients may present with bone pain. Pathologic fracture with minor inciting trauma can also be a first presentation.

Physical exam has a minor role in evaluating lesions. In the setting of pain, focal palpation may increase pain with fractures. Visual inspection for skeletal deformities and asymmetries can provide clues to sites of involvement. Leg length discrepancy may indicate disease such as the classic shepherd’s crook deformity at the proximal femur.

Common sites of involvement subject to deformity are the ribs, long bones, and craniofacial structures. Less common sites include the hands, sternum, and spine.
