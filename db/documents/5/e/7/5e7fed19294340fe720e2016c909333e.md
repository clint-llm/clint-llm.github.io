Tetracyclines can commonly cause GI distress, including abdominal discomfort, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. While taking tetracyclines, discoloration of teeth and inhibition of bone growth in children may occur. Some patients experience photosensitivity, which can manifest as a red rash or skin blistering. Photosensitivity reactions can be lessened by avoiding direct sunlight and tanning equipment or wearing sunscreen and protective clothing when outdoors.

More rarely, tetracyclines can cause hepatotoxicity and might exacerbate preexisting renal failure. Further, there have been reports of esophageal ulceration and strictures from tetracycline use, which can typically be avoided by taking the drugs with adequate water and staying upright following usage. Further, intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) correlates with tetracycline use.

Lastly, all antibiotics have implications in the development of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea, including the tetracycline class of antibiotics.
