Stroke mimics should be considered when evaluating patients with suspected embolic strokes in the Emergency department.

A brain CT scan should be considered to exclude intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) in patients presenting with focal neurological symptoms. ICH include intraparenchymal hemorrhage secondary to hypertension or amyloid angiopathy in addition to a subarachnoid and subdural hematomas.

Seizures with unilateral postictal weakness (Todd paralysis) should be considered. They're usually short in duration with, at times, prolonged postictal states. Migraine aura may manifest as positive or negative neurological symptoms, including visual and sensory symptoms, which are usually gradual and slower in onset. Another important differential diagnosis to consider with focal neurological deficits is hypoglycemia. Therefore the mandatory check of blood sugar level prior to the administration of IV TPA. Psychogenic causes should be considered when the exam is inconsistent; however, in an acute setting, it may be difficult to distinguish. Still, IV TPA should be administered if no contraindications are found.

Other less frequent differential diagnoses to consider include multiple sclerosis, brain tumors, compressive myelopathy, pressure or position related peripheral nerve or nerve root compression, toxic metabolic encephalopathy, especially in patients with previous strokes who may develop recrudescence of old symptoms.
