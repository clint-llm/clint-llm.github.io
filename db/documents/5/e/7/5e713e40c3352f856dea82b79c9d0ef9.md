An individual is more likely to reinjure the same ankle after sustaining an initial ankle sprain. As a result of recurrent injury, an individual can develop chronic pain or instability, documented in 20 to 50% of these cases.

Chronic ankle instability (CAI) is a well-documented complication of recurrent ankle sprains. CAI theoretically results from the impairments from proprioceptive deficits and increased ligamentous laxity secondary to recurrent ankle sprains.
