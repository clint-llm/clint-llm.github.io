The workup of leukemia is very involved, and multiple tests are needed to confirm a diagnosis and, subsequently, to stage the disease. Helpful initial studies include a CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, liver function tests (LFT), and coagulation panel, which are often followed by a peripheral blood smear evaluation and a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration.

On rare occasions, leukemia can be diagnosed on histology alone. For example, AML is characterized by the presence of Auer rods (red-staining, needle-like bodies seen in the cytoplasm of myeloblasts) on a peripheral smear. In most other cases, more detailed analyses with flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and FISH testing are required to distinguish between subtypes.

A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are often required for the diagnosis of acute leukemias. For chronic leukemias, peripheral blood evaluation is often enough, and an invasive bone marrow biopsy may not be needed. For example, CML can be diagnosed by looking for BCR-ABL fusion protein on peripheral blood FISH analysis. CLL can be diagnosed by looking for a monoclonal B-cell population through peripheral blood flow cytometry.
