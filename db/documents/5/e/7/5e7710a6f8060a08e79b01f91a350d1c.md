History and physical (H&P) is an essential part of the evaluation as it might reveal the underlying etiology, or may help to point out the need for an expedited evaluation. Some of the critical points in H&P include:

- The clinical setting is crucial as it occurs in patients presenting to the emergency department following seizures, trauma, or cardiac events.

- The patient has a personal or family history of a lymphoproliferative disorder.

- The patient has a history of B-symptoms (fever, weight loss, and night sweats) that could point out a clonal process.

- Demographics: age is an important feature, as some cases occur in specific populations (e.g., CLL is mainly a disease of the elderly), while others are more common in certain groups (for example, AIM is common in young adults).

- Surgical history: Splenectomy is associated with lymphocytosis.

- Medications review.

- History for methods of transmissions if certain viral infections are suspected (e.g., sexual history in HIV).

- The physical exam findings should be interpreted in the clinical context as rash, lymphadenopathy, or splenomegaly can occur in different malignant or reactive disorders.
