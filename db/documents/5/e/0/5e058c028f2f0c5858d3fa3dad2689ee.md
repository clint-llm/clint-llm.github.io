Patients should be educated about the possible presentations of Horner syndrome. Parents of babies born with congenital Horner syndrome should be aware of the management options and follow-ups. Patients of Horner syndrome should be informed that it will not damage the eye or cause vision loss, but it could be a sign of damage to structures along the nerve. It is essential to explore where the damage is and its cause because sometimes the underlying cause can be severe. For example, ptosis predisposes eyes to overexposure which makes them red. In addition, patients may complain of a gritty sensation and are prone to infection. Artificial tears and ointment are often enough; however, surgery may be needed in severe or more complicated cases.
