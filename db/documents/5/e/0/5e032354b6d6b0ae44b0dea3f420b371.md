The gastrocolic reflex is multisystemic in origin. The reflex involves the autonomic nervous system, the enteric nervous system, and cells of the GI tract that regulate endocrine functions. Signals from the central nervous system communicate with the enteric nervous system and vice versa controlling peristalsis. The enteric nervous system proves to be paramount and is demonstrated by the morbid effects of enteric nervous system neuropathies; this is in contrast with the importance of vagal and sympathetic inputs, which have shown not to carry as much of an effect if these connections become interrupted.
