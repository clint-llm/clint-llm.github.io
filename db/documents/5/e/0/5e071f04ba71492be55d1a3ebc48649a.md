Patients who chronically consume opioids who have an opioid toxicity event are at risk for a repeat opioid toxicity event and must have proper management of that risk. Consultation with a chronic pain management doctor is advised whenever and wherever possible to optimize care, even if the primary doctor wishes to keep managing the prescription opioids. As of 2019, there has been a move away from the abrupt cessation of opioids in this setting and a move toward gradually decreased dosing until completion of the chronic pain doctor consultation to provide additional guidance to the primary care physician.
