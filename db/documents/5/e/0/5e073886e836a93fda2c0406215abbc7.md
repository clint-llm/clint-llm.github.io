Phenol is a disinfectant and chemical precursor with a variety of uses and indications. Joseph Lister introduced the concept of antiseptic surgeryÂ using phenol, then known as carbolic acid. Reports of toxicity were not far behind.

Phenol is still occasionally a component in some household disinfectants and a variety of gargles and ointments. Phenol-containing solutions are also home remedies for head lice.

Phenol is a common laboratory chemical used in the extraction of nucleic acid material from biological specimens. It also serves as a chemical precursor to many pharmaceuticals and chemicals, including acetaminophen, aspirin, levodopa, propofol, and some herbicides.
