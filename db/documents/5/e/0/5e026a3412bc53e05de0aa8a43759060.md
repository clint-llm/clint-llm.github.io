Estimates are that about 15% of patients referred to a specialist due to short stature have constitutional growth delay. It is twice as common in boys compared to girls; although some of the male referrals may be just concerns regarding their height compared to their peers rather than an actual delay.

The disease of constitutional growth delay is a diagnosis of exclusion. Therefore the proper way to assess this medical diagnosis is by short stature, which by definition affects about 3% of the population — defined as a growth velocity below 5cm a year (in the childhood age). This linear velocity change depends on the age group, that’s why it is also necessary to assess short stature and growth delay at different stages in life as it presents differently in a toddler (6  to 7cm), vs. childhood (5.5cm) and adolescence (girls 8 to 12cm boys 10 to 14cm).
