Pinguecula is a benign, common degeneration of the conjunctiva. Pinguecula has originated from the Latin word "pinguis," which means fat or grease. It is usually bilateral but can be unilateral also. It appears as a grey white-yellow mass on the bulbar conjunctiva. It presents in people exposed to wind, dust, ultraviolet light, and working outdoors for a long duration. Usually, it causes cosmetic complaints. Mild symptoms such as foreign body sensation and itching are treated with artificial tears. Surgical excision may be rarely considered for cosmetic reasons.
