Congenital syphilis (CS) is caused by transmission of the spirochete Treponema pallidum from mother to fetus, resulting in diverse clinical presentations. Congenital syphilis in a fetus is sometimes associated with a full term, seemingly healthy infant but can also be associated with premature birth or stillbirth Rates of CS are increasing, and 2017 had the greatest number of cases since 1997. CS is a nationally notifiable disease, meaning each case in each state must be reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). This activity reviews the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of congenital syphilis and the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain when congenital syphilis should be suspected.
- Explain how to manage congenital syphilis.
- Explain how to prevent congenital syphilis. 
- Explain how an interprofessional approach is imperative to the effective management of congenital syphilis.
