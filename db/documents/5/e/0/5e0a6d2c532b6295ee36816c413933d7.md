Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) results from genetic mutations in the cardiac sarcomereÂ gene, which in turn, codes for integral components of the contractile apparatus of the heart muscle. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with variable expressivity and penetrance. HCM is defined by an increase in the left ventricular wall thickness that is not completely explained by abnormal loading conditions. Various morphological variants of HCM are known, and present with different hemodynamic and clinical manifestations. These HCM variants include apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, sigmoid septal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, symmetric septal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and asymmetric septal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
