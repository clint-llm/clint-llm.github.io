Cardiovascular disease and diabetes are among the most common morbidities in the US. They share many common risk factors, and management of one depends on the presence/absence of the other. The prevalence of CVD (meaning hypertension, coronary heart disease, heart failure, and stroke) is 49% overall in US adults age 20 years or older, and 40% of these are isolated hypertension.

Similarly, the prevalence of diabetes is 12% among US adults aged 18 years or older. Metabolic syndrome, which is a risk factor for both diabetes and cardiovascular disease, is 34% prevalent in US adults. Overweight and obesity (defined as BMI ≥ 25kg/m^2) are 71% prevalent in US adults. National attention from the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institute of Health, and the Department of Health and Human Services are engaged in efforts to reduce the burden of these diseases.
