# Continuing Education Activity

Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) is a laser refractive surgery that has become increasingly popular for the correction of myopia and myopic astigmatism. SMILE has been associated with similar safety, efficacy, and predictability outcomes as laser in situ keratomileuses (LASIK), with the advantages of increased patient satisfaction and decreased postoperative dry eye. This article reviews the surgical technique, complications, and visual outcomes associated with SMILE, and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo SMILE.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications and contraindications for small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE).
- Describe intraoperative techniques during small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) that may reduce the likelihood of postoperative complications.
- Review the various enhancement procedures available following small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE).
- Identify the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to maximize visual outcomes and satisfaction of patients undergoing small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE).

# Introduction

The emergence of the femtosecond laser has revolutionized the field of laser refractive surgery. Since its creation in 2003, the femtosecond laser has been widely adopted in procedures such as laser in situ keratomileuses (LASIK) and has allowed for the creation of newer refractive surgeries such as femtosecond lenticule extraction (FLEx). FLEx, first performed in 2007, was unique in that it only required the use of a single platform, the femtosecond laser, rather than the two platforms as are necessary for LASIK.

Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE), a newer laser refractive procedure, avoids flap creation and instead forms a small peripheral corneal incision through which the lenticule gets extracted. By avoiding corneal flap formation, SMILE was hypothesized to improve corneal biomechanical stability compared to LASIK or FLEX due to minimal disruption of the peripheral collagen networks in the anterior stroma that account for approximately 60% of the total corneal tensile strength.

# Anatomy and Physiology

Laser refractive surgeries such as SMILE act upon the cornea, the transparent, dome-shaped layer that covers the front of the eye. The femtosecond laser forms an intrastromal lenticule through various photoablative incisions. A further incision for lenticule extraction follows on the peripheral cornea, most often along the superior or superotemporal aspect.

# Indications

SMILE was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 for the treatment of myopia from -1 diopter (D) to -8 D and astigmatism up to -0.5 D in patients 22 years or older.

There are many considerations when deciding whether a patient would be a better fit for SMILE or LASIK. Because there is no flap creation, SMILE may be preferable for patients who engage in contact sports, which carry a risk for traumatic flap dislocation.

# Contraindications

Contraindications for SMILE are largely similar to those of other laser refractive surgeries.

- SMILE should is not an option in patients with known corneal thinning disorders such as keratoconus or central corneal thickness (CCT) less than 475 micrometers to minimize the risk of postoperative ectasia.

- SMILE is not approved for patients with uncontrolled glaucoma or uveitis, significant cataract, corneal scarring, functional monocularity, active eye inflammation or infection, and severe dry eye or ocular allergy.

- Due to hormonal changes that may alter visual refraction, laser refractive procedures are not recommended in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

- History of herpes simplex keratitis may be considered a relative contraindication for SMILE, though the risk for reactivation may be minimized with preoperative and postoperative antiviral treatment.

- Other relative contraindications include irregular cornea or irregular corneal astigmatism, immunodeficiency, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, history of autoimmune disorders, and mild dry eye or ocular allergy.

- Caution should be taken in patients with uncontrolled diabetes, as this has been demonstrated to delay corneal wound healing.

# Equipment

Currently, a commercially available femtosecond laser is the only laser available for the creation of the intrastromal refractive lenticule.

# Preparation

Careful patient selection, combined with the management of patient expectations is essential to maximizing visual outcomes and patient satisfaction. Patients should receive information regarding the risks and benefits of SMILE, and informed consent is necessary. Providing patients information on what they might expect to hear, feel, see, and smell during the procedure may serve to reduce patients’ anxiety. Patients’ medical history should be screened for any contraindications, as listed above. Most importantly, patients should only be selected if they have realistic expectations of postoperative visual outcomes. It should be made clear to patients that the goal of laser refractive surgery is not to obtain the complete absence of refractive error but rather lessen one’s reliance on glasses and contacts.

An extensive preoperative evaluation is necessary to identify potential contraindications to laser refractive surgery. Eyelids and tear film require an examination for signs of dry eye or blepharitis. The patient’s refraction, including refractive stability, degree of refractive error, and astigmatism, should be obtained. Both manifest and cycloplegic refraction are necessary; disparities between these two values greater than 1 D of sphere warrants reevaluation. The clinician should inspect the cornea for scars, vessels, or signs of inflammation. Pupil size requires measurement with the commercial pupillometer. The slit-lamp examination allows for the identification of corneal abnormalities such as keratoconus, neovascularization, scarring, or the presence of a cataract. Corneal pachymetry is an excellent screening tool for patients with corneal thinning disorders. Computed corneal topography additionally allows for the detection of keratoconus and irregular astigmatism. Intraocular pressure should be obtained to identify uncontrolled glaucoma. Fundoscopy rules out the presence of retinal holes, degenerative retina, and other types of macular disease. Computed videokeratography identifies early keratoconus, corneal warpage, and asymmetrical or irregular astigmatism.

Immediately before SMILE, topical antibiotics, and topical proparacaine, 0.5% gets instilled in both eyes. Excessive instillation of topical anesthetic should be avoided as this may loosen the corneal epithelium and increase the risk for the formation of black spots and epithelial defects.

# Technique or Treatment

Patient positioning should be such that they are comfortable throughout the procedure. The patient’s neck should not be in a twisted posture, and their legs should remain uncrossed. The patient should be advised to take shallow breaths to reduce movement of the head. Proper orientation of the head is crucial to guaranteeing correct docking and centration. The patient should be advised to stay calm, maintain fixation, and avoid squeezing the eye. Patient cooperation through the procedure is of the utmost importance.

Initial docking requires the use of a disposable curved contact glass. The surgeon should verify that proper docking has occurred before initiating corneal contact with the contact glass interface. The patient is then instructed to fixate on a green blinking light to achieve centration. After that, suction is initiated and maintained throughout the procedure. The femtosecond laser generates four sequential photoablative incisions that form an intrastromal lenticule, as well as a small 2.5 mm incision along the superior or superotemporal aspect of the cornea for lenticule access and extraction. The total time for the formation of all incisions by the femtosecond laser ranges between 20 and 35 seconds regardless of the magnitude of refractive error. The surgeon may then use a manual spatula to separate the residual lenticular appendages along the anterior and posterior plane and forceps to extract the lenticule.

Lenticule extraction is often the most challenging step for inexperienced surgeons. Incorrect identification of the tissue plane may result in adherence of the posterior lenticule surface to the stromal surface of the cap.

Occasionally, the lenticule may be retained in the stromal bed. This intraoperative complication can be addressed immediately by conversion to a FLEx procedure if the entire lenticule remains intact. Alternatively, customized surface ablation is a surgical option, though this has limitations with postoperative haze, which may cause poor visual outcomes.

Medications typically administered during the postoperative period include topical steroids (dexamethasone 0.1%) and topical fluoroquinolone eye drops (moxifloxacin 0.5%) several times daily. These medications, as well as lubricating eye drops, may be recommended for one to two weeks postoperatively. Patients should be closely followed by their ophthalmologist in the weeks to months immediately following SMILE.

# Complications

Most intraoperative complications associated with SMILE are related to the steep learning curve and relative complexity of the procedure.

Intraoperative complications may be broadly categorized as related to

- Lenticule creation

- Lenticule dissection

- Lenticule extraction.

**Lenticule Creation**: complications from lenticule creation include suction loss, the formation of an opaque bubble layer (OBL), subconjunctival hemorrhage, incisional bleeding, and black spots. Loss of suction occurs in approximately 6% of cases and is typically due to patient eye contraction or sudden patient movement.

**Lenticule Dissection or**lenticule**Extraction:**common complications that occur secondary to lenticule dissection or extraction include lenticule remnant, corneal abrasion, lenticule adhesions, and incisional tears. Lenticule remnant and lenticule adhesions may be addressed intraoperatively or postoperatively, as described above. Peripheral corneal abrasions occur in 5.5% of cases and are typically due to excessive manipulation.

Primary complications experienced after SMILE include

- Dry eye

- Corneal abrasion

- Infectious keratitis.

Postoperative dry eye occurs in approximately 3% of patients and is likely multifactorial, attributable to decreased trophic influence in the corneal epithelium, inflammation, damage to limbal goblet cells during suction, and impaired corneal sensation to blink.

# Clinical Significance

Numerous meta-analyses have demonstrated that long-term efficacy, predictability, and safety outcomes of SMILE are comparable to those of femtosecond-LASIK.

Current research has suggested numerous benefits of SMILE over femtosecond LASIK. Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated reduced postoperative dry eye associated with SMILE than LASIK.

There are some drawbacks with the use of SMILE as compared to femtosecond LASIK. Patient-reported discomfort is often higher during tissue manipulation in SMILE than flap lifting in LASIK; for this reason, inexperienced surgeons should consider administering more topical anesthesia or prescribing anxiolytics or sedatives before surgery.

Notably, SMILE has shown slightly worse outcomes for the treatment of low-to-moderate astigmatism than LASIK, but comparable results in the correction of high astigmatism.

Though most SMILE patients are satisfied with their long-term visual outcomes, approximately 3% undergo enhancement procedures within two years of their initial procedure.

Of note, there remains no consensus on the best procedure for retreatment after SMILE. Among the numerous options proposed include repeat SMILE below the cap, surface ablation (PRK) augmented by mitomycin-C (MMC), thin-flap LASIK in the cap, or cap-to-flap (also known as the CIRCLE approach).

Some emerging developments include the potential use of SMILE or lenticule implantation procedures for the treatment of hyperopia. Limited research has suggested that SMILE results in similar visual outcomes, recovery rate, and safety outcomes as hyperopic LASIK.

Another area of ongoing research is the combination of SMILE with accelerated corneal cross-linking (CXL), also known as SMILE XTRA. This procedure requires the intraoperative injection and application of 0.25% riboflavin in the stromal interface for 1 minute, following by 75 second of UV-A radiation exposure. This procedure is hypothesized to improve the accessibility of laser refractive surgery to individuals with thin corneas at baseline by minimizing the risk of postoperative ectasia. Recent trials on SMILE XTRA have shown promise, but the long-term effects still need to be evaluated.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

An interprofessional team of ophthalmic surgeons, nurses, optometrists, and technicians may be involved in the preoperative evaluation, surgery, and postoperative management of patients who undergo SMILE. Ensuring appropriate patient selection per established guidelines and maintaining adequate follow-up are essential for maximizing long-term visual outcomes and patient satisfaction. Nursing should assist during the surgery, and provide post-operative care following. They can also ensure patient compliance and be available for questions in the time after the procedure. All interprofessional healthcare team members should be aware of clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of major postoperative complications, and prompt referral to a cornea specialist is warranted should any of these complications arise.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Nurses should ensure that the patient has signed the consent. Even though the procedure is of relatively short duration, the patient requires monitoring by a nurse. During the procedure, the patient must remain still, and the nurse should take measures to avoid unnecessary anxiety. After the procedure, the patient is monitored by the nurse for a few hours before discharge.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring

Prior to discharge, the nurse should again emphasize the post-operative instructions. The patient should return to see the ophthalmologist as scheduled. The patient should not scratch the eyes and wear an eye covering when sleeping. During the first week, the recommendation is for the patient to wear eyeglasses when going outdoors.
