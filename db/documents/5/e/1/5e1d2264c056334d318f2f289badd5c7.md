The global SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 pandemic, highly contagious virus, and public emergency underlined healthcare workers' occupational risks. In particular, the availability and severe shortage of basic PPE, including masks, gloves, and gowns, challenged the adherence to standards and the workers' personal well-being. International recommendations for PPE usage during the COVID-19 pandemic were variable, underscoring the need to develop and follow standards such as the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard to uniformly guide populations and those at risk.

Occupational blood exposure is common and of great concern in resource-poor countries.
