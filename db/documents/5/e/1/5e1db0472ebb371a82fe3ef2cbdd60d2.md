An interprofessional approach is required for the management of fungal endocarditis. Early valve replacement surgery of the infected valve (natural or prosthetic) should be recommended (class I indication) in almost all patients with fungal endocarditis, and a long course of anti-fungal medication should be initiated.

The initial antifungal treatment for Candida spp. endocarditis should be lipid formulation of amphotericin B with or without flucytosine or a high-dose echinocandin (caspofungin or micafungin or anidulafungin). Once the patient has stabilized, and follow-up blood cultures are negative, step-down therapy with oral fluconazole (if susceptible) is recommended. If candida isolate is not susceptible to fluconazole, oral voriconazole or posaconazole can be considered.

Infected pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators should be removed, and anti-fungal therapy should be initiated. For ventricular assist devices that cannot be removed, the antifungal regimen should be started, and chronic suppressive therapy with fluconazole (if susceptible) should be continued as long as the device is in place.

The endocarditis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum is managed with the lipid formulation of amphotericin B, followed by oral itraconazole for at least 12 months.Aspergillus endocarditis, voriconazole is used for both induction and long-term suppression.
