The pectoralis muscle is a thick, broad, fan-shaped muscle situated on the chest underneath the breast. The primary function of this muscle is adduction, internal rotation, and flexion of the humerus. It originates on the medial half of the clavicle, the anterior surface of the sternum, and the superior six costal cartilages, and inserts on the bicipital groove of the humerus. The pectoralis major muscle receives innervation from the lateral and the medial pectoral nerves, while the medial pectoral nerve innervates the pectoralis minor muscle.

In two-thirds of patients, the medial pectoral nerve courses through the pectoralis minor to innervate the lower portion of the pectoralis major, while in one-third of patients, this nerve courses along the lateral aspect of the pectoralis minor. The lateral pectoral nerve runs under the pectoralis major muscle to innervate the proximal portion of this muscle. Given these anatomic relationships, dissection between the two pectoralis muscles can cause partial denervation of the pectoralis major.

Poland Syndrome is a condition in which some or all of the pectoralis muscle is absent on one side. Other causes of a deformed pectoralis muscle include denervation injury or muscle tears after excessive training.
