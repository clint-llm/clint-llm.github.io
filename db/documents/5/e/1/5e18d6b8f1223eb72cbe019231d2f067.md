**Surgical valvotomy:**

There are two types of pulmonary valve valvotomies: closed and open valvotomy. The surgeon performs a closed valvotomy by making an incision at the right ventricular outflow tract, and introducing a cutting valvulotome is introduced. This process allows one to cut the valvar diaphragm transversely, and the stenosed pulmonary valve gets converted into a bicuspid valve. The open valvotomy is done through the pulmonary artery and aided by hypothermia or by cardiopulmonary bypass. The main indication for this surgery is a relief of right ventricular obstruction.

**Ross procedure:**

The pulmonary valve is usable as a replacementÂ for the diseased mitral or aortic valve.
