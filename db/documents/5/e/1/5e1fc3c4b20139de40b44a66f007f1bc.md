In 2000, the Surgeon General proclaimed that the United States was in a silent epidemic of dental disease.

Primary care providers, dentists, oral surgeons, and otolaryngologists regularly evaluate and treat oral and dental pathologies, providing ample opportunities for primary prevention and early recognition of poor hygiene and infection.

Odontogenic infections can often be evaluated and managed at the bedside with a clinical exam alone. Many equivocal exams can be further clarified using POCUS to assess for the presence of an abscess and guide surgical intervention.

CT scan with contrast is often not indicated and can expose patients to unnecessary neck radiation, risk contrast-associated complications, and unveil incidental findings that prompt unnecessary, costly workup.

Close collaboration with the emergency department, urgent care, and primary care providers, operating as an interprofessional team, can improve diagnostic accuracy and minimize physical and financial harm to the patient.
