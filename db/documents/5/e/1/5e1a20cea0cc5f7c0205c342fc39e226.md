Most complications associated with ITP in children and adults are correlated to the bleeding risk associated with low platelet counts, specifically when the platelet count is less than 20,000/microL. Most people affected with ITP will have bruising and petechiae.

The most feared complication of ITP is intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). In newly diagnosed children, the risk of ICH is about 0.5% and is slightly increased in those children with chronic ITP, but still less than 1%. Most cases of ICH occur at platelet levels less than 10,000/microL.

Urgent evaluation, including neuroimaging and treatment, is imperative should a patient have an ICH. Risk factors for ICH include very low platelet counts (< 10,000/microL), head trauma, use of antiplatelet medications, and severe bleeding.
