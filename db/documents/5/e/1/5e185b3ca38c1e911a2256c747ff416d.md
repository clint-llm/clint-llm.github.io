In general, both collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis present with inflammation within the mucosa. Specifically, in the lamina propria, there is mononuclear cell predominance, with few neutrophils and eosinophils. There are, however, other histological differences that are worth noting between the two types of microscopic colitis.

**Collagenous colitis –**A collagen band greater than 10 micrometers in diameter in the subepithelial layer defines this type of microscopic colitis.

**Lymphocytic colitis –**20 or more intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells, typically without crypt distortion, defines lymphocytic colitis

**Microscopic colitis not otherwise specified –**This terminology is used to describe a subgroup of patients with typical symptoms such as diarrhea, increased cellular infiltrate, and either an abnormal collagenous layer or increased intraepithelial lymphocytes that do not match the above criteria.
