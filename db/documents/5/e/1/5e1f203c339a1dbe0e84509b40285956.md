- Heterotopic ossification (HO) is the abnormal formation of bone in soft tissues where bone does not normally exist.

- HO is most commonly seen following trauma or surgical intervention in periarticular soft tissue and is commonly associated with injury to the hip.

- The use of radiation to the peri-articular joint prescribed to 7 to 8 Gy in 1 fraction given less than 24 hours preoperatively or less than 72 hours postoperatively can decrease the risk of HO development.

- Prophylactic RT for HO is safe and has been shown to be more efficacious compared to NSAIDs.
