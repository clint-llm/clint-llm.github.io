The mandibular foramen will house and protect the inferior alveolar nerve. This nerve provides innervation to the gums, dental sockets, and teeth. The inferior alveolar nerve innervates the anterior chin and lower lip via the mental nerve. The inferior alveolar nerve also innervates the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior muscle belly of the digastric muscle via the mylohyoid nerve. The mylohyoid nerve travels in the mylohyoid fossa on the medial surface of the mandibular foramen.
