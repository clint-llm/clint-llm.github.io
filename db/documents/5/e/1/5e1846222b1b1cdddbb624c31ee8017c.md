There is an extensive network of nerves that both pass through and supply the retroperitoneum and its associated structures. Six named pairs of parietal nerves branch from the lumbar plexus bilaterally. They are the iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, genitofemoral, lateral femoral cutaneous, obturator, and femoral nerves. The lumbosacral trunk and ventral rami of S1-S3 and part of S4 come together to form the sacral plexus, which gives rise to many of the nerves found within the retroperitoneum. The superior and inferior gluteal nerves form from the sacral plexus bilaterally. Also arising from the sacral plexus are right and left lumbar sympathetic trunks, as well as the greater, lesser, and least thoracic splanchnic nerves and four lumbar splanchnic nerves. All of these provide sympathetic innervation to abdominal and pelvic viscera. The pelvic splanchnic nerves provide parasympathetic innervation to structures of the peritoneal cavity. The vagus and splanchnic nerves, along with celiac, superior mesenteric, and aorticorenal ganglia form the autonomic plexuses. These carry sympathetic, parasympathetic, and sensory (predominantly pain) fibers.
