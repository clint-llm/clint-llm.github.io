A multidisciplinary team is needed for the TAVR procedure as well as follow up care.  The procedural team typically consists of an interventional cardiologist specially trained in TAVR, a cardiac surgeon, an echocardiographic imaging specialist, skilled nurses and a cardiac anesthesiologist if more than conscious sedation is to be administered.  Cardiac electrophysiologists, neurologists, nephrologists and vascular surgeons must be readily available if complications from the procedure arise.
