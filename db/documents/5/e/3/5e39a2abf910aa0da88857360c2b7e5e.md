- Place the patient in prone, reverse Trendelenburg position and place monitors for EKG and pulse oximetry. Identify cannulation access site on the leg, usually below the knee. Prep with antiseptic

- Drape patient and cover ultrasound probe with a sterile sheath

- Gently sedate the patient.

- Inject local 1% lidocaine superficial to the access site under US guidance. Access the vein with a needle. Thread the guidewire through the needle and advance to the saphenofemoral junction.

- Remove the needle and replace it with a dilator. Using a scalpel, make an incision at the junction of guidewire and skin that allows the dilator to pass smoothly.

- Replace dilator with catheter and advance to SFJ. Replace the guidewire with a laser fiber. Using the US in longitudinal view, advance the laser tip up until 2 cm distal to the SFJ, ensure that the IEV is visualized.

- Place the patient in Trendelenburg position and inject tumescent anesthesia using an injection pump into the perivenous fascia beginning from the access site to SFJ. Typically, injections are spaced 3-5 cm apart.

- Visualize under the US using transverse view the GSV with the catheter at the center surrounded by hypoechoic tumescent anesthesia. Activate the laser.

- Withdraw fiber optic laser and catheter at a rate of 1-2 mm/s while confirming ablation with the US in the longitudinal view. Take care not to heavily compress the area superficial to the catheter.

- Close percutaneous skin incision.

- Return table to the neutral position. Monitor for any perioperative complications.
