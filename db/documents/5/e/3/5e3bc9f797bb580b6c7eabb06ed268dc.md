Femoral pseudoaneurysms after percutaneous access can occur due to

- Failures of closure devices

- Laceration of the artery or branches of the common femoral artery by access needle

- Inadequate pressure or length of time holding pressure post-procedure

- Inadvertent access and/or dilation of the artery during venous procedures

Femoral graft anastomosis can also break down over time due to suture failure, or likely more commonly due to infection of the graft material.

Visceral pseudoaneurysms are very rare and are related to iatrogenic injury from surgery or endovascular procedures, or pancreatitis, which typically presents as a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm, which is due to the digestive action of pancreatic enzymes on the artery.

Aortic pseudoaneurysms due to blunt trauma are theorized to be caused in large part by deceleration forces between the relatively free aortic arch against the relatively fixed descending aorta, especially at the point where the ligamentum arteriosum anchors the aorta to the pulmonary artery. This fact, in combination with the pinching effect between the sternum and the spine, and the water hammer effect caused by squeeze forces can cause partial to total rupture of the thoracic aorta.
