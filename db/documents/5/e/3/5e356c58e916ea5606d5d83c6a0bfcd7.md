Posterior nasal packing should only be performed by those familiar and experienced with the procedure, given the risk of causing airway obstruction and/or hemodynamic instability. Patients with posterior epistaxis are likely to require referral to an otolaryngologist and need hospital admission with cardiorespiratory monitoring while the packs are in place.
