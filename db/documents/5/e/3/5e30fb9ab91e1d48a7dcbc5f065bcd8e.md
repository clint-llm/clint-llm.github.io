The goal of radiotherapy is to deliver radiation to the tumor and to a margin of radiographically normal tissue to limit the recurrence. The radiation dose is 50-60 Gy delivered over a period of six weeks in fractions of 2 Gy.

According to NCCN guidelines, hypofractionated radiotherapy can be recommended in patients with poor performance status or Age >70 irrespective of performance status or methylated status of MGMT promoter either with or without chemotherapy.

Clinical trials are ongoing regarding the role of irradiation in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. More evidence is needed regarding dose, frequency, fractionation, and prior treatments, etc.
