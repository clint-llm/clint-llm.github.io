There is no pathognomonic endoscopic feature for CMV esophagitis, and definitive diagnosis depends heavily on biopsy findings. Histopathological diagnosis can be made by identifying CMV inclusion bodies with standard H&E staining, called a cytomegalic cell. These cells appear 25 to 35 micrometers with basophilic intranuclear inclusion, occasionally surrounded by a clear halo. There can also be intracytoplasmic inclusions.
