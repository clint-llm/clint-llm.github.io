Sebaceous gland carcinoma is a rare tumor that masquerades as benign ocular conditions and hence requires the clinicians to work in a multidisciplinary team to identify the tumor, make a correct pathological diagnosis, and perform an early surgical therapy trying to cure the disease. Delayed management of these cases might be fatal due to the aggressive nature of the tumor. Whenever sebaceous tumors are identified, clinicians should consider internal malignancies.

Early recognition aids in the prompt treatment of patients and screening of family members for early intervention. Many health professionals may be involved in the care of patients affected with SC, such as physicians and surgeons of different specialties (depending on the location of the tumor), radiologists, pathologists, and nurses.
