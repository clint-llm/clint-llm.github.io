Patients with pituitary apoplexy may have a long residual endocrine deficiency and should have an assessment of pituitary function at 4 to 8 weeks after the event. Assessment of visual acuity, eye movements, and visual fields is mandatory. An MRI scan is recommended at 3 to 6 months after an episode to evaluate for residual tumor, and thereafter an annual MRI scan should be considered for the next 5 years.

Those patients with a known tumor should be educated about the possibility of hemorrhage. They should be encouraged to attend their endocrinologist and neurosurgeon scheduled visits. Any acute visual change or significant headache should alert them to seek immediate medical evaluation.
