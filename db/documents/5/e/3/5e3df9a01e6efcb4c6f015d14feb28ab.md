GCTB commonly presents with swelling, limited range of motion, and pain because of the tumorâ€™s proximity to the joint space. Patients often describe the pain as a persistent, deep pain that is not related to an injury. These symptoms commonly arise in the knee since the epiphysis of the distal femur or proximal tibia is the site of the tumor in over 50% of cases. GCTB less commonly affects craniofacial bones, vertebral body, sacrum, and the small hand and feet bones. Interestingly, some patients have no symptoms, often being found incidentally or as a result of a pathological fracture. These fractures occur in approximately 12% of patients diagnosed with GCTB. Rarely GCTB can present with metastatic disease, usually to the lungs.
