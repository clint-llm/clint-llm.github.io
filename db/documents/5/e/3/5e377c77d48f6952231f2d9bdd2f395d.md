The PEG tube track takes about four weeks to mature.Â PEG tube can be removed when it is no longer needed or deemed medically necessary. The method of removal of the tube depends on the type of PEG tube. In cases where the type of PEG tube inserted cannot be ascertained, or there is a concern for potentially serious complications during removal, upper endoscopy should be performed for removal. After removal, the site should be cleaned and covered with gauze, and monitored. The track usually closes within 24-48 hours. Non-closure might require further investigation and surgical closure.
