Biopsy specimens reveal a dense neutrophilic infiltrate surrounding and infiltrating within and around eccrine glands, with necrotic eccrine epithelial cells. Intraductal abscess formation may be seen as well. Neutropenic patients may have sparse or absence of neutrophils in the dermal layer, but eccrine gland necrosis is evident. Thus, the hallmark histological finding in neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is necrosis of the eccrine unit. Moreover, the following histological changes may also be evident in neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis: apocrine gland necrosis, squamous syringometaplasia, dermal hemorrhage, epidermal spongiosis, basilar vacuolization, focal keratinocyte necrosis, mucin deposition, and panniculitis.
