The ribs receive their blood supply anteriorly; by the anterior intercostal arteries. However, they are supplied posteriorly; by the posterior intercostal arteries. Good to know, that the anterior intercostal arteries of the first seven ribs are branches of the internal thoracic artery. By contrast, the anterior intercostal arteries of the eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs are branches from the musculophrenic artery. All ten of these ribs are supplied posteriorly by the posterior intercostal arteries. Good to mention, that the first two posterior intercostal arteries are branches of the superior intercostal artery, a subsidiary of the costocervical trunk that arises from the left subclavian artery. Anyhow, the lower nine arteries are branches of the descending thoracic aorta. The floating ribs receive vascular supply differently since they are short and have no sternal articulation, only receiving supply posteriorly by the posterior intercostal arteries. The eleventh rib receives vascular supply by the posterior intercostal artery and the twelfth rib by the subcostal artery.

The nomenclature of the costal veins is the same as the arteries; they differ as to where they drain blood. The anterior intercostal veins drain blood into the internal thoracic and musculophrenic veins. The posterior intercostal veins drain blood into the azygos and hemiazygos system. The subcostal vein drains the blood of the twelfth rib.

Note: all arteries and veins run in the costal groove of each rib.
