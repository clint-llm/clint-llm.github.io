- **Inhibition of sodium channels:**carbamazepine, lacosamide, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, topiramate, zonisamide

- **Inhibition of calcium conductance:**ethosuximide, zonisamide, valproic acid (VPA), pregabalin, gabapentin

- **Inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitters (NMDA):**perampanel, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate

- **Stimulation of Inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA):**benzodiazepines, phenobarbital, tiagabine, vigabatrin

- **Interaction with SV2A proteins:**levetiracetam
