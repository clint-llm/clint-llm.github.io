Nitrofurantoin's mechanism of action has remained poorly understood since its discovery in the 1940s. Nitrofurantoin uses several mechanisms to achieve an antimicrobial effect. Nitrofurantoin is taken up by bacterial intracellular flavoproteins that reduce nitrofurantoin to reactive intermediates. Intermediate metabolites resulting from this reduction then bind to bacterial ribosomes and inhibit bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of DNA, RNA, cell wall protein synthesis, and other metabolic enzymes.nfsA and nfsB are potential causes of nitrofurantoin resistance in E. coli.

**Pharmacokinetics**

Nitrofurantoin (monohydrate/macrocrystals) includes two forms of nitrofurantoin. According to the Manufacturer's labeling, twenty-five percent is macrocrystalline nitrofurantoin, which is gradually dissolved and absorbed. The remaining 75% is nitrofurantoin in a powder form that forms a gel matrix that releases nitrofurantoin over time upon exposure to gastric and intestinal fluids. The bioavailability of nitrofurantoin is 80% in healthy patients. Nitrofurantoin is well absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, with most absorption occurring in the proximal small bowel. Studies have shown that therapeutic urinary concentrations of the drug are increased by 40% if nitrofurantoin is taken with food. Serum concentrations are typically undetectable, although they may increase in severe renal failure. Nitrofurantoin attains bactericidal effects in the lower urinary tract. Based on pharmacokinetic data, approximately 20% to 25% of nitrofurantoin is retrieved from the urine in unchanged form over 24 hours. Nitrofurantoin is soluble in urine, imparting a brown color to urine.
