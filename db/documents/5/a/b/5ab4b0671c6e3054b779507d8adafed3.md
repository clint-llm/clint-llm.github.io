Vericiguat is a medication used to manage and treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). It is useful for chronic worsening heart failure and recently decompensated heart failure, high-risk heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, especially for patients who had been rehospitalized or are on intravenous diuretic therapy, or patients requiring urgent treatment for heart failure. Vericiguat does not prolong survival but prevents rehospitalization. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, dose, and mode of administration by the interprofessional team, adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring parameters, and several trials to support the evidence of the drug's usefulness in HFrEF. It also highlights the role of an interprofessional team in managing patients with heart failure using vericiguat.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications of vericiguat as a novel agent for heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction.
- Review the potential adverse effects associated with the use of vericiguat.
- Explain the mechanism of action of vericiguat.
- Outline the dose of administering vericiguat and explain the importance of monitoring vitals after administration of the drug by the interprofessional team to help titration and decide the dose.
