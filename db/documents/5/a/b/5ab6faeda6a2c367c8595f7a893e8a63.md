Clinicians must educate patients to comply with taking PPIs to control the symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Patients must not only take medications as instructed but follow up for laboratory tests to assess the effectiveness of the medications. This is very important to reduce the recurrence and complications from ZES. Although the cure rate, especially with MEN1, is low, patients need to be encouraged to follow up with their clinicians and seek help if needed.
