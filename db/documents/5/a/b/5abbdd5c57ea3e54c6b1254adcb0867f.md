Pathogenic bacteria ascend from the perineum and rectum, predisposing women to urinary tract infections. Women also have shorter urethras than men, whichÂ further contributes to their increased susceptibility to UTIs. Blood-borne bacteria cause very few uncomplicated UTIs. Escherichia coli is the most common organism in uncomplicated UTIs by a large margin, followed by Klebsiella.

A major risk factor for UTIs is the use of a urinary catheter. Manipulation of the urethra is also a risk factor. Sexual intercourse and the use of spermicides and diaphragms are also risk factors for UTIs. Frequent pelvic exams and the presence of anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract can also predispose one to a UTI.

UTIs are very common after a kidney transplant. The two triggers include the use of immunosuppressive drugs and vesicoureteral reflux. Other risk factors include the use of antibiotics and diabetes mellitus.
