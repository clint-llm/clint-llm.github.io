One of the benefits of BTMs supporting their increased implementation in the clinical setting is the relatively non-invasive nature of specimen (serum or urine) collection. CTX-1 exhibits circadian rhythm fluctuation augmented by food intake, whereas P1NP is minimally affected by food and circadian rhythm.

Of note, non-fasting samples may be effectively used to monitor CTX-1 levels if there are multiple samples from the same patient, with the serial samples occurring in consistent temporal settings (both time of day and time between last meal and sampling). This will only allow for detecting relative fluctuations in levels, however, as they cannot be compared to reference ranges that are determined using fasting samples.

The currently recommended specimen for measuring CTX-1 and P1NP levels is ethylenediaminetetraaceticÂ acid (EDTA) plasma and serum, respectively.
