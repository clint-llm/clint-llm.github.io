Patients will report hair shedding, usually without other symptoms, with a relatively abrupt onset. By definition, in acute telogen effluvium, shedding lasts less than six months; often the period of shedding is much shorter. A careful history will identify a causative event (see etiology section) occurring approximately three months before the onset of the shedding (range from 1 to 6 months). Quite often the patient has fully recovered from the acute illness and fails to see the connection between the illness with the hair loss.

The physical examination is grossly normal, as it is difficult for the casual observer to appreciate the loss of hair volume. It can be helpful to compare the patient's current appearance with old pictures. If the patient presents during the acute shedding, a gentle pull test yields at least four hairs removed with each pull. However, if the patient presents after the acute shedding has passed, the pull test may be normal. Careful examination of the scalp will show an increased percentage of short anagen hairs growing close to the scalp.
