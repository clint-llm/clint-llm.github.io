The radial nerve exits the axilla with the axillary artery and follows it posteriorly with the brachial artery. It then continues with the deep brachial artery into the posterior compartment via the triangular interval. The radial nerve follows the radial collateral artery until it wraps anteriorly over the cubital fossa. At this point, the radial nerve branches into the superficial branch of the radial nerve, which passes with the radial artery,Â the deep branch of the radial artery, and the posterior interosseous artery.
