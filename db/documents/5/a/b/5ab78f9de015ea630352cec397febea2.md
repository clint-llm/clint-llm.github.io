Monilethrix is a hair-shaft disease resulting in hair fragility and causing cosmetic issues. The physicians and nurse practitioners need to identify this congenital alopecia to avoid unnecessary scalp biopsies and treatment modalities. Since it typically appears in early childhood, pediatricians and pediatric nurse practitioners are likely to be the first to encounter such cases. These patients should obtain a referral to dermatologists to provide the best patient care. The key to the management of this disorder is patient education. Discussion with parents is based on lifestyle modification and minimizing damage to hair with avoidance of excessive combing, washing, and styling. This can often be accomplished by nursing staff with specialty training in dermatology, in conjunction with the providers already mentioned above, in an interprofessional healthcare team approach to rendering the optimal patient care.
