Care for patients with KSS is primarily supportive. Folic acid supplementation in patients with low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is highly recommended as is hormonal replacement therapy in endocrinopathies and cardiac pacemaker placement for patients with cardiac conduction blocks. Some patients with diplopia and prisms may benefit from strabismus surgery, and frontalis slings placement surgery may also treat ptosis. Cochlear implants can be used for patients with sensorineural hearing loss.

Surveillance includes yearly ECG, echocardiography, and 24-hour Holter monitoring (regardless of patient's age), audiometry and endocrinologic evaluation.

**Future and Experimental Therapy**

Since most patients with mtDNA disease harbor both mutated and wild-type mtDNA (heteroplasmy), the possibility of enhancing mitochondrial function by causing shifts in heteroplasmy through selective degradation of mutant DNA is one of the promising emerging therapies for mitochondrial disorders. Endonuclease ZFN, for instance, can reduce mutation load in a cytoplasmic hybrid model of KSS.

Zinc-finger nuclease (ZNF) binds specifically to the mutant form of mtDNA, and the FOK1 endonuclease domain cleaves the DNA molecule, which is then degraded, manipulating the ratio of mutant to a wild type of mtDNA.

The most frequently used mitochondrial antioxidant that is used for patients with KSS is CoQ 10, also known as ubiquinone.

EPI-743 is a synthetic structurally modified analog of CoQ 10 in which the bis(methoxy) groups of the quinone have been replaced with bis-methyl groups, and the tail has three rather than ten isoprenyl units. Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of EPI-743 are currently in progress for KSS.
