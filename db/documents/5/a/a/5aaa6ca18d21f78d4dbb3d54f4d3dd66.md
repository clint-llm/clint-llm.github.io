The management of Boerhaave syndrome is via an interprofessional team approach. The patient needs immediate hydration, antibiotics, and a surgery consult. Treatment is typically tailored to the patient’s presentation, the type, and extent of the rupture, the time to diagnosis, and the viability of the esophageal wall. Early perforations, those diagnosed within 12 to 24 hours, have the best outcomes. Three common treatment options include conservative, endoscopic, or surgical. The mainstay of treatment includes volume replacement, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, and surgical evaluation. Surgical intervention includes primary esophageal repair through open thoracotomy vs. VATS with fundic reinforcement, which is the gold standard within the first twenty-four hours.  Endoscopic placement of stents has been used to prevent fistula formations or seal esophageal leaks in both patients with delayed diagnoses and those with the early diagnosis without widespread contamination. Conservative measurements are usually reserved for small or contained ruptures. The outlook for patients with Boerhaave syndrome is guarded. Those who present late usually develop multiple organ failure and death. Those treated early usually have a favorable prognosis but the recovery can take months. [Level 5]
