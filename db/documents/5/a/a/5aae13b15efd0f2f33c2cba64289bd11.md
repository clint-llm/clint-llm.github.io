Evaluation of failure to thrive should include confirmation of poor weight gain over time (depending on the severity of weight loss/clinical status at initial presentation). If possible, an observation of feeding, especially in younger infants can be very informative. If truly failure to thrive, an initial laboratory evaluation can be helpful to rule out common organic causes and guide the provider to more specific tests if needed. Initial labs should include a complete blood count (CBC) to assess for anemia, iron panel because the most common type of anemia in this age group is iron deficiency, and a metabolic panel to assess electrolyte and hydration status, liver, and kidney function. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can be useful to identify nonspecific underlying inflammation. Prealbumin can assess overall nutritional status and if low initially can be used to trend treatment response later on. Send screening thyroid function studies including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and Free T4. A normal newborn metabolic screen should be documented; if not, sending one can provide clues to less common organic causes of failure to thrive. A urinalysis is also important to assess kidney function. If there is a prominent history of abnormal stooling, stool studies including culture, guiac, and reducing substances may be helpful. Pending results of the first set of basic labs, more specific labs may be indicated such as a chloride sweat test, pancreatic function testing, or other metabolic-specific testing. While imaging is not routinely indicated initially, chest x-ray, ECG/echocardiogram, and endoscopy may be useful to determine certain conditions if there is a concern for an anatomic abnormality.
