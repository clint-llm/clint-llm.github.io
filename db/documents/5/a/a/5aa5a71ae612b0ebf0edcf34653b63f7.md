Like other JAK inhibitors, tofacitinib is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, mainly the CYP3A4 enzyme, in the liver (70%) and eliminated by renal clearance (30%).

Tofacitinib therapy in females of reproductive age may cause a possible risk to a developing fetus during pregnancy and may also impair infertility in women of reproductive potential. Females who are lactating and receiving treatment are advised not to breastfeed 18 to 36 hours following the last dosage.
