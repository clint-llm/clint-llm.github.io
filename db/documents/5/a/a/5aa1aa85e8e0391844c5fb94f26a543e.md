Early mortality reports were greater than 30% for NMS; however, increased awareness, earlier detection, and better supportive care have reduced mortality to less than 10%. With early recognition and aggressive treatment, most patients will fully recover in 2 to 14 days. Delayed treatment may result in significant morbidity such as residual catatonia, parkinsonism, renal, or cardiopulmonary complications. When fatal, deaths are usually due to cardiac arrhythmias, disseminated intravascular coagulation, respiratory failure, or renal failure. Many patients may be successfully restarted on neuroleptic medications, but some will develop recurrent symptoms. Guidelines for re-initiation of neuroleptic therapy recommend waiting at least two weeks after resolution of symptoms, using lower-potency agents, starting with low doses and slowly titrating to effect, and avoiding lithium in conjunction with neuroleptics. Patients should be instructed to avoid dehydration and should be carefully monitored for any symptoms of recurrent NMS.
