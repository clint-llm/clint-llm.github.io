The epidemiology of tarsal fractures is as follows:

- Tarsal fractures account for 2% of all fractures.

- Calcaneal fractures account for 50-60% of all fractured tarsal bones.

- Less than 10% present as open fractures.

- Traditionally, there is a male predominance of injuries due to the industrial nature of the accidents. Recent studies suggest regional variation in male/female predominance due to disparities in the types of regional accident occurrence.

- Most patients with calcaneus fractures are young, with the 20-39 age group the most common.

- Comorbidities such as diabetes and osteoporosis may increase the risk of all types of fractures.

- Calcaneal fractures are rare in children.
