Reported calcium levels can be influenced by many factors, such as the patient's age, comorbidities, lifestyle, gender, medical therapies, and conditions during specimen retrieval. For example, if the sample was poor quality due to it being lipemic or hemolyzed, then calcium levels can be inaccurate.

Certain medications may precipitate inaccurate measurements of calcium levels. Perchlorate has been reported to cause discrepancies in ionized calcium measurements, leading to false diagnoses of hypo or hypercalcemia.

Urine calcium excretion is highly related to sodium excretion; as such dietary sodium can influence reported levels. Diets high in sodium yield higher calcium excretion; similarly, low-sodium diets equal lower calcium excretion.

Albumin is a carrier protein for calcium and can result in an inaccurately reported serum calcium level. Evaluating albumin levels to correct for total calcium and differentiate true versus factitious calcium dysregulation is important.

**Albumin Correction**

- True Calcium (mg/dL) = reported total calcium (mg/dL) + 0.8 (4.0 – serum albumin (g/dL))

If the corrected serum total calcium levels are between the normal levels of 8.8 mg/dL to 10.4 mg/dL, then the laboratory-reported calcium is fictitious due to impaired serum albumin levels.
