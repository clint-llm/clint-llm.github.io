The 2 basic principles of treatment are to reduce the chance of local recurrence and the risk of metastatic spread. Surgery with or without radiotherapy achieves local control of cancer. When there is a risk for metastatic relapse, systemic therapy is indicated in the form of hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or any combination of these. In locally advanced disease, systemic therapy is used as a palliative therapy with a small or no role for surgery.
