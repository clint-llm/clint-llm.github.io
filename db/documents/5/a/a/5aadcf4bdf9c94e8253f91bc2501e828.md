A thorough history and physical exam in patients with GLPLS is a core component of a satisfactory diagnosis. Determining if a patient has experienced significant hair loss, psychosocial stress, or endocrinological abnormalities can lead you to other potential causations of alopecia that may exclude GLPLS as a final diagnosis. Physical examination should include a full body skin check with additional attention paid towards the perineum and axillae for signs of non-cicatricial alopecia. Examination of the trunk and extremities for signs of hyperkeratotic papules with surrounding perifollicular erythema also is a key component of GLPLS. Investigation of the scalp in GLPLS should reveal a multifocal, patchy, and cicatricial alopecia of the scalp. In addition, an anagen hair pull is often positive in GLPLS because of the relatively weak stabilization of the hair follicles of affected individuals.
