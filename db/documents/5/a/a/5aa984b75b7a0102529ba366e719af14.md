Platelets, otherwise known as thrombocytes, are blood components derived from megakaryocytes originating within the bone marrow. Contained within the cytoplasm of platelets are alpha and dense granules that each release specific mediators necessary for efficient hemostasis, while the exterior of a platelet has a coating of receptors targeted by various activating proteins. Naturally, the average lifespan of a platelet is approximately 8 to 10 days. Under normal, healthy circumstances, platelets do not aggregate with one another to form plugs as the endothelial surface of intact blood vessels expresses glycoproteins such as thrombomodulin and releases prostacyclins.
