The specificity of the probe used in FISH is critical to avoid its hybridization with genes other than the target. Some FISH preparations have autofluorescence; thus, an adequate wash of cells to remove any fluorescent buffer or medium is recommended to eliminate the chances of background fluorescence.

MPLA has some general limitations. The mutations to be detected have to be known to include them in the design of the probes, and gene rearrangements like inversions and translocations are not detectable by the method. The samples have to be free of impurities. The presence of some contaminants in the sample, like phenol, can interfere with the ligation step. False positive or negative results may occur due to rare sequence variants in target regions detected by MLPA probes.

Melting temperature is critical for the sensitivity of DHPLC. Computational algorithms can predict this temperature, and usually, the experimental procedure is made with at least two different melting temperatures to increase the sensitivity of the test.

NGS technologies remain evolving to circumvent every challenge; large insertions, duplications, and deletions are detected only by some massive sequencers that can support long reads. Long homopolymers are also problematic regions for sequencing.

Despite automation, Sanger-based sequencing is still relatively labor-intensive, time-consuming, expensive, and requires specialized equipment.
