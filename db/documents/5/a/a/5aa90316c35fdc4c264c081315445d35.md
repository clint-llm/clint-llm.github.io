Most patients who have acute rejection episodes are asymptomatic and have abnormal allograft dysfunction, as evidenced by routine blood evaluation. When there is a sudden rise of serum creatinine to more than 25% of the baseline value, the clinician should suspect allograft rejection. Even when the creatinine is not trending down as expected in the early post-transplant phase, the possibility of rejection should be a consideration. Any new-onset or worsening proteinuria and new-onset or worsening hypertension should raise the suspicion for rejection.

Sometimes a rejecting graft may present with fever, pain at the graft site, hematuria, dysuria, hypertension, fluid retention, and decreased urine output.
