**Cardiovascular System**

The first organ system to develop during organogenesis is the cardiovascular system. The heart has established its four chambers by four weeks of development, whereas week six involves cardiac outflow separation and descent of the heart (and lungs) into the thorax. The separation divides the truncus arteriosus into the ascending aorta and pulmonary artery; this occurs via spiraling of the aorticopulmonary septum. Anatomically, the aorta and pulmonary appear to wrap around each other superior to the heart. That appearance is the result of embryologic spiraling. The aorticopulmonary septum may also be referred to as the spiral or conotruncal septum.

**Lung Development**

Lung development occurs from the embryonic period through the fetal period and continues up to birth. In particular, lung growth begins in early embryonic development when right and left lung buds are formed from an initial outpouching, the respiratory diverticulum. The buds enlarge and branch to form the respiratory tree. The appearance of the visceral and parietal pleura takes place during weeks five through seven.  Both types of pleura arise from mesoderm. The visceral pleura covers the developing bronchial tree, and the parietal pleura covers the internal chest wall. Pleuroperitoneal membranes form and fuse with the diaphragm, which separates the pleural and peritoneal body cavities. Closure of the pleuroperitoneal canal by these membranes takes place by approximately week seven.

**Gastrointestinal System**

Weeks six through eight are also critical for the development of the gastrointestinal system. The midgut undergoes physiologic herniation through the umbilicus around week six, but this event may be delayed up until week ten. This physiologic process happens because the size of the abdominal cavity is too small to accommodate the enlarging gastrointestinal tract. Herniation provides ample space for the rapidly enlarging midgut. After herniation, the midgut undergoes three rotational events totaling 270 degrees of rotation. The first rotation consists of 90 degrees in a counterclockwise direction around the superior mesenteric artery. This helps establish the appropriate arrangement and placement of the bowel; the ileum is brought to the right side of the body. The second rotation occurs during 10 weeks of gestation and consists of 180 degrees in a counterclockwise direction. The midgut returns to the body cavity at the end of 10 weeks. Finally, the third rotation of 180 degrees in a counterclockwise direction places the cecum on the right side.

In early embryonic development, the lumen of the duodenum is occluded by epithelium. Weeks six through eight are important for establishing the lumen's patency as the duodenum expands in size.

The pancreas is endodermal in origin and develops by growing dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds. The buds begin as outgrowths of the duodenum. Week seven is significant because the dorsal and ventral buds fuse at this time.

Furthermore, the liver undergoes rapid growth during this time. Its first appearance is during the third week of gestation; it undergoes rapid growth during weeks five through ten. The hepatic artery appears at week eight. The liver is endodermal in origin.

**Central Nervous System**

The neural tube closes around week four and is the early derivative of the brain and spinal cord.  During weeks five through eight, the CNS undergoes the development of its vesicles, which are embryologic precursors to different structures of the brain. The forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain all develop from vesicles. These three structures are also known as the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, respectively. The prosencephalon later develops into the diencephalon and telencephalon. The diencephalon gives rise to the thalami, hypothalamus, optic cups, and neurohypophysis, while the telencephalon grows to surround the diencephalon, midbrain, and hindbrain. The mesencephalon forms the aqueduct of Sylvius, superior and inferior colliculi, and tegmentum. The rhombencephalon gives rise to the fourth ventricle as well as the metencephalon, a structure that eventually develops into the pons and cerebellum.

**Other Organs**

Many other organs develop during weeks six through eight, including the pituitary gland, thymus, and adrenal cortex. At week seven, the embryo assumes a characteristic C-shape. At week seven, the ocular retina also begins to develop. The upper and lower limbs continue to grow. Also, facial structures such as the nostrils, eyelids, outer ears, lip, and palate develop, and at week seven, the head and face contours begin to emerge.
