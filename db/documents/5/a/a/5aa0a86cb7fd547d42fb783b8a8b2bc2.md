Patients should know the symptoms associated with severe MR and when to seek medical attention. Patients with MR should also be aware of the indications for surgery and treatment. While patients diagnosed with moderate or severe secondary mitral regurgitation may benefit from surgery, leading to improved symptoms and quality of life, there has been no survival benefit from the surgery. In most cases, it is not indicated or performed.

- In the elderly population (defined as over 60-years-old), studies have shown that surgeons opt not to perform surgery due to no survival benefit. Several factors affect treatment decisions; in a study of 1741 MR patients, only 60.31% received surgical treatment. This number decreased to 54.71% in the greater than 60-year-old age group.

- Another study of 396 patients diagnosed with severe MR, 49% were not operated on due to comorbid conditions.

- Factors such as impaired left-ventricular ejection fraction, older age, and comorbid conditions should factor into the surgical decision-making process.

It is essential to consult with a cardiologist regarding MR management as patient treatment options can vary depending on several factors discussed.
