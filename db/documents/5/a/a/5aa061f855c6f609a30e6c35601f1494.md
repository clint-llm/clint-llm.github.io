EntomophthoromycosisÂ is a rare fungal infection predominant in tropical and subtropical regions. In Greek, "Entomon" means insect, reflecting that these fungi were identified originally as parasites infecting insects. It is a diagnosis that is usually not thought of, and more awareness is needed, especially with the rise in global travel.

Infection may affect immunocompetent hosts, and a disseminated disease can be seen in immunocompromised hosts. The gold standard for diagnosis is histopathologic exam and cultures. The Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon can be observed histologically. Molecular diagnosis using DNA probe and PCR are also available. Treatment includes prolonged antifungal therapy and surgical debridement if needed.
