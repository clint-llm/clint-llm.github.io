The occipital bone is a very complex bone that serves primarily to protect the cerebellum and the occipital lobes of the cerebrum and to provide attachment to several muscles and ligaments described below. It is trapezoidal and shallowly curved on itself. It consists of outer and inner layers of cortical bone that sandwich cancellous bone, or diploe. It borders the parietal bones on either side superiorly to form the lambdoid suture, and the mastoid portion of the temporal bone to form the occipitomastoid suture on either side inferolaterally. The sphenoid bone articulates with it anteriorly via the inferior angle, and with the atlas inferiorly. The foramen magnum is part of the occipital bone, through which the medulla oblongata, the accessory nerves, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, the vertebral arteries, the alar ligaments, and the tectorial membranes passes. It consists of three parts, including the basilar, condylar, and squamous parts, all of which have outer (facing the outside) and inner (facing the brain) parts.

The squamous part of the occipital bone is the most posterior and largest portion. It is the part of the bone that borders the parietal and temporal bone, and the posterior part of the foramen magnum. The outer squamous part contains several ridges or lines, crests, and prominences. There are three horizontal so-called nuchal lines. Superiorly to inferiorly, they are the supreme (also known as the highest), superior, and inferior nuchal lines. The supreme nuchal line begins about where the skull starts to curve inward to make the inferior surface and extends from midline to the lambdoid sutures on either side, curving slightly downward as it moves laterally. The superior nuchal line is larger than the supreme nuchal line, and it also extends from midline to the lambdoid sutures, curving slightly more than the supreme nuchal line laterally. At its midline is a prominence called the external occipital protuberance, with its highest point termed the inion. The superior nuchal line makes an intersection with a vertical midline ridge of bone called the medial nuchal line, which is also known as the external occipital crest, forming an uppercase “T” on the surface of the occipital bone. The superior nuchal line provides an attachment surface on its inferomedial side for the semispinalis capitis muscle, and on its inferolateral side for the obliquus capitis superior. The medial nuchal line extends caudally in a straight line to the foramen magnum, and with the inion, serves as the attachment for the nuchal ligament and the trapezius muscle. The inferior nuchal line transects the medial nuchal line approximately at its midpoint, curving more downward than the supreme or superior nuchal lines.

The cranial, or inner surface of the occipital bone makes up the base of the posterior cranial fossa. On the squamous part of the inner surface is a midline vertical ridge called the median internal occipital crest that runs from a median prominence called the internal occipital protuberance to the foramen magnum. The median internal occipital crest provides attachment for the falx cerebri and contains a groove for the occipital sinus. Running from the internal occipital protuberance to the superior border is the groove for the superior sagittal sinus. On each side of the internal occipital protuberance is a groove for the transverse sinus. The meeting point of the superior sagittal sinus, the straight sinus, and the occipital sinus is called the confluence of the sinuses, which drains the venous blood into the right and left transverse sinuses. These internal structures form a lower case “t”: the top of the “t” is comprised of the superior sagittal sinus groove, the intersection of the lines making the “t” is the internal occipital protuberance, the horizontal line of the “t” are the grooves for the transverse sinus, and the lower part of the “t” is the median internal occipital crest. This lower case “t” is also known as the cruciform eminence, due to its cross, or crucifix-like structure. Therefore, this structure divides the concave internal surface of the occipital bone to make four distinct fossae: two upper fossae, and two lower fossae. The upper fossae are called the cerebral fossa and hold the occipital lobes of the cerebrum. The lower fossae are called the cerebellar fossae and hold the hemispheres of the cerebellum. The inferior edge of the squamous part of the inner occipital bone makes up the posterior part of the foramen magnum. It contains a landmark called the opisthion, the midpoint of the posterior margin of the foramen magnum. It has a twin at the midpoint of the most anterior margin of the foramen magnum called the basion, located on the basilar part of the occipital bone, that lines up with the dens of the atlas.

The condylar part makes up the lateral edges of the foramen magnum on the undersurface of the occipital bone and is also known as the exoccipitals. It is made up of protuberances on either side of the foramen magnum called the occipital condyles, serving as an articular surface to the superior facets of the atlas. At the base of the condyles on the cranial (inner) side is the hypoglossal canal where the hypoglossal nerve exits, and a branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery enters. Posterior to the condyles is the condyloid fossa, a depression that articulates with the superior facet of the atlas during neck extension. Within the fossa is the condylar canal, where there may be an occipital emissary vein that perforates the bone to connect the occipital sinus, sigmoid sinus, and suboccipital venous plexus. The capsules of the atlantooccipital articulation attach to the margins, and medial to these is a tubercle where the alar ligament attaches. The jugular process comprises the anterolateral part of the bone on either side, on which the rectus capitis lateralis muscle inserts. Anterior to these processes is the jugular notch, forming the posterior portion of the jugular foramen.

The inner surface of the condylar part makes up the sides of the foramen magnum and contains the hypoglossal canals, as previously mentioned. More lateral to the hypoglossal canal is the jugular foramen, located at the junction of the occipital bone and the petrous portion of the temporal bone.

The basilar part makes up the anterior portion of the foramen magnum on the undersurface of the occipital bone and connects to the sphenoid bone. It is thick and quadrilateral in shape. The anterior atlantooccipital membrane attaches to its inferior surface immediately anterior to the foramen magnum. Even more anterior to the foramen magnum is the pharyngeal tubercle, the attachment site of the fibrous raphe of the pharynx. On either side of the midline of its inferior surface, the basilar part provides muscular attachment of the longus capitis and rectus capitis anterior muscles. The upper surface of the basilar part supports the medulla oblongata with its broad, shallow groove called the clivus, where the abducens nerve also runs nearby. It also provides attachment to the tectorial membrane near the foramen magnum. The lateral surface of the basilar part forms a junction with the petrous portion of the temporal bone to form the inferior petrosal sulcus, in which the inferior petrosal sinus lies. The inferior petrosal sinus receives veins from the medulla, pons, the inferior surface of the cerebellum, and the internal auditory veins and drains into the internal jugular vein. The inner basilar part contains the basion, as previously mentioned.
