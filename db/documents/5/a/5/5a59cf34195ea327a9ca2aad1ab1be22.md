In the absence of other pathology, ectopic kidneys are rarely associated with disordered renal function or hypertension. Van den Bosch et al. (2010) published a series of 41 patients, all of whom underwent VCUG with 13 demonstrating vesicoureteric reflux. The relative function of the ectopic kidney was 38% on DMSA scanning, and 88% had an eGFR >90. These findings were consistent in both simple and crossed renal ectopia.

However, when there is malrotation and associated extrarenal calyces, these patients are at increased risk of recurrent urinary tract infection and hydronephrosis.

Pancake kidneys, like other ectopic kidneys, are usually asymptomatic but are also associated with an increased risk of recurrent urinary tract infection and stone formation.

A review of crossed fused renal ectopia published in 2019 found only 35 reported cases of stones and 30 cases of malignancy associated with the condition.

Therefore, while renal ectopia is not an entirely harmless condition, the overall prognosis is generally good.
