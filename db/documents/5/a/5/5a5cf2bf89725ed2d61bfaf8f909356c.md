As previously discussed, the LES is comprised of an intrinsic and an extrinsic component. Any malfunction in either of these components can lead to pathologies such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with its associated symptoms and mucosal changes. Additionally, a structurally defective LES and a hiatal hernia are important factors in the pathogenesis of reflux disease.
