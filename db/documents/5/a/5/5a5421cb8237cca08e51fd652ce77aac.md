It is imperative to rule out the reversible causes of polydipsia while evaluating the causes of water toxicity. Diabetes can be prevalent in patients with psychogenic polydipsia especially due to the tendency of antipsychotics to cause metabolic syndrome. In chronically mentally ill patients, anticholinergic induced dry mouth may play a measurable, but clinically insignificant, role in the disorder. Patients with primary polydipsia are frequently misdiagnosed as diabetes insipidus (low level or deficient activity of ADH) as polydipsia itself reduces the renal response to ADH due to the down-regulation of aquaporin-2 channels.
