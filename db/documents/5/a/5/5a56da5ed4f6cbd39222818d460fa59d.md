PHFs are commonly managed nonoperatively although referral to an orthopedic surgeon should be considered in all of these injuries given the wide variation in treatment strategies.  Active and open communication should be considered standard of care as discussions between the nursing staff, therapists, physicians, and surgeons is required to ensure an ideal outcome for all patients being managed with these injuries.  Finally, follow-up with a bone density specialist should be ensured when patients present with a PHF in the setting of a low-energy injury as these presentations are considered to be, by definition, an instant diagnosis of bone mineral density compromise.
