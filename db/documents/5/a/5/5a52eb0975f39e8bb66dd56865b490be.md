The ulnar and radial arteries comprise the primary blood supply of the forearm. They are terminal branches of the brachial artery arising at the inferior aspect of the cubital fossa.

In one study of cadaveric samples, the most common origin for the nutrient artery to the radius was the anterior interosseous artery (56%), followed by the median artery (25%). In this same study, the most common origin of the ulnar nutrient artery was the ulnar artery (40%) and the anterior interosseous artery (31%).

Classically, lymphatic vessels are thought to be absent within bone. This idea gained recent support from a study that failed to identify immunohistochemical markers of lymphatic vessels within cortical or cancellous bone.
