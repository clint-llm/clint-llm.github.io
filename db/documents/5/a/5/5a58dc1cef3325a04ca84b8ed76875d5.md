MODY is caused by defects in pancreatic islet cell development and insulin secretion. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and the patients generally have heterozygote mutations. Penetrance and expressivity can vary immensely, even among family members. MODY genes affect insulin secretion via impairment of insulin sensing, glucose metabolism in beta cells, or activation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent potassium channels. The disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a diabetic nurse, endocrinologist, internist, geneticist, dietitian, ophthalmologist, nephrologist, occasionally gynecologist (MODY 5), and a cardiologist. These patients are prone to the same complications as other diabetics except for patients with the GCK mutation, and early referral to a specialist is highly recommended. [Level 5]
