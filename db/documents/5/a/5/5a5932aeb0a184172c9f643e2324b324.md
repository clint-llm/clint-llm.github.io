Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is the most common of the urea cycle disorders. It is an X-linked genetic disorder that prevents the breakdown and excretion of ammonia. This allows ammonia to accumulate, rising to toxic levels where it affects the central nervous system. This activity describes the evaluation and management of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and examines the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the typical presentations of ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency 
- Review the typical laboratory and imaging findings in ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. 
- Describe the treatment strategy for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. 
- Explain why careful planning and discussion amongst interprofessional team members involved in the management of patients with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency will improve outcomes.
