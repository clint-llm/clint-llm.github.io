The penicillin component of procaine penicillin is a beta-lactam, exerting its bactericidal effects via the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. This activity results from the drug’s binding to naturally occurring proteins in the target organism described as penicillin-binding proteins. Once occupied, these proteins are prevented from allowing the completion of the peptidoglycan synthesis essential to the building of the bacterial cell wall. This halting of cell wall production combined with the ongoing activity of native cell wall autolytic enzymes eventually results in cell lysis and subsequent bacterial cell death. Resistance to penicillin primarily occurs in bacteria-produced penicillinase. While this resistance phenomenon exists in numerous organisms, it is noteworthy that there is as yet no report of any resistance by Streptococcus pyogenes, in particular.

The procaine component is an amino ester local anesthetic acting on the fast sodium channel to produce local anesthesia. The intent of this anesthetic addition is primarily to ease the pain of IM injection in large enough doses to reach therapeutic concentrations of penicillin.
