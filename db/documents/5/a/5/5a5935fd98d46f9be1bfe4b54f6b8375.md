Human immunoglobulin products are available as intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), Subcutaneous immune globulin (SCIG), and intramuscular immune globulin (IMIG). Varicella-zoster immune globulin is available only as Intramuscular immune globulin (IMIG) in the United States. The FDA approved it in December 2012.

Varicella-zoster immune globulin comes in 125-IU vials, and administration should only be intramuscular and as directed by the manufacturer. No dose adjustments are recommended for renal or hepatic impairment. Individuals who later become eligible for vaccination should receive varicella vaccine ≥five months after varicella-zoster immune globulin administration.
