The deep shoulder girdle muscles (i.e., rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, and serratus anterior) are derived from thoracic somitic cells, unlike other muscles of the shoulder and upper limb, which develop from the lateral plate mesoderm and limb bud.

Despite these differences, the embryonic origin of the rhomboids correlates to their respective nerve supply, as is the caseÂ with other muscles of the shoulder and upper limb.
