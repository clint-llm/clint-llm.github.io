Catecholamines function in several vital neurological and physiological systems. The proper functioning of these systems requires an appropriate balance in synthesis and degradation. When degradation is impaired, this leads to the hyperfunctioning of these systems.

In the central nervous system, dopamine is the principal activator of four major pathways in the brain. The nigrostriatal pathway starts from the substantia nigra and connects to the basal ganglia. Activation of the neurons in this pathway is responsible for movement and sensory stimuli. The mesolimbic pathway starts in the ventral tegmental area and goes to the amygdala, pyriform cortex, and nucleus accumbens. Neurons in this pathway are responsible for emotion, pleasure and reward-seeking, addiction, and perception. The mesocortical pathway starts in the ventral tegmental area and goes to the frontal cortex and hippocampus. This pathway is responsible for cognition, memory, and attention. Finally, the tuberoinfundibular system starts in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and goes to the median eminence of the pituitary gland. This pathway functions to inhibit prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland. In the periphery, dopamine functions as a vasodilator that mainly affects the kidney, promoting diuresis and natriuresis.

Epinephrine and norepinephrine have similar functions as part of the sympathetic nervous system. They differ slightly in that norepinephrine exclusively acts on arteries, whereas epinephrine can bind to receptors on arteries, the heart, lungs, and skeletal muscles. Together, these hormones mediate the sympathetic nervous response leading to tachycardia, increased cardiac contractility, hyperglycemia, and relaxation of smooth muscle in the lungs.
