Absolute contraindications include a history of anaphylactic reaction to amphotericin B.

Before potential administration, drug-drug interactions require a thorough review. Concomitant steroid use should be reconsidered to reduce the risk of hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can also potentiate digoxin toxicity and can cause rhabdomyolysis. Simultaneous infusion of amphotericin B and granulocytes has correlations with acute pulmonary reactions, and clinicians should avoid the combination.
