Appropriate patient selection and care should be established to help obviate common complications associated with neuraxial anesthesia. While many of the complications are of very low incidence, it’s worth being aware of them. Severe complications are believed to be extremely rare, but the frequency is probably underestimated.

- Backache (more common with epidural anesthesia)

- Postdural puncture headache (as high as 25% in some studies). A non-cutting needle should be utilized for patients with high risk for PDPH, and the smallest gauge needle available is the recommendation for all patients

- Nausea, vomiting

- Hypotension

- Low-frequency hearing loss

- Total spinal anesthesia (most feared complication)

- Neurological injury

- Spinal hematoma

- Arachnoiditis

- Transient neurological syndrome (especially with lidocaine)
