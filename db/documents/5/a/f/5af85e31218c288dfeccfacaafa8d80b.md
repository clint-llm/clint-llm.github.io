The elbow joint is considered relatively stable; however, elbow dislocations are a fairly common occurrence. This injury frequently occurs during sporting activities when a person falls on an extended elbow. In most instances, the semilunar notch of the ulna is dislocated posteriorly from the distal humerus. If there is no fracture associated with the dislocation, it is described as simple, and the injury is often closed with no bony protrusion through the skin.

The stability of the elbow joint due to its bony structure means that significant force is required to disrupt the joint. Therefore, an associated fracture may be found along with the elbow dislocation thus classifying the dislocation as complex. Neurovascular complications are rare from a simple, closed, posterior dislocation. The less encountered anterior elbow dislocation requires much more force and concern for neurovascular compromise should be greater. A dislocated elbow necessitates immediate closed reduction to prevent complications.Â  Recurrent elbow dislocations suggest chronic joint instability and may require operative fixation.
