The majority of the complications from insulin resistance is related to the development of vascular complications. The microvascular disease manifests as retinopathy, nephropathy, and peripheral neuropathy. In the central nervous system, dementia, stroke, mood disturbance, and gait instability may occur. Cardiac microvascular disease can manifest as angina, coronary artery spasm, and cardiomyopathy. Renal microvascular disease is a significant cause of chronic renal failure and dialysis. Ophthalmological small vessel disease is a leading cause of loss of visual acuity. Macrovascular disease, secondary to insulin resistance, causes PAD, CAD, and CVA.
