Histological examination typically shows thinning of the epithelium overlying a nodule. Disruption of the Bowman layer may be seen with duplication of the epithelial basement membrane.

The mechanism underlying the development of SND and subepithelial matrix deposition appears to involve the function of the corneal epithelium itself. The cells of the limbus differ from cells of the central cornea in structure as well as function. The limbal epithelium contains stem cells and transient amplifying cells (TAC), cells that are not completely differentiated but have a high potential for proliferation. Usually, the central cornea contains completely differentiated epithelium and should not contain stem cells. Immunohistochemical analysis has shown that the epithelium in SND shows similar markers as the undifferentiated TACs of the limbus.

High levels of staining for CK19 and enolase, markers of the metabolically more active migrating epithelium, suggests that the epithelium that overlies SND nodules is composed of cells that are not terminally differentiated and are more comparable to limbal TACs than the surrounding corneal epithelium. Healthy central corneal cells stain strongly for CK3/12, a marker for terminally differentiated corneal epithelium. Only the superficial epithelial layers overlying Salzmann nodules stain positive for CK3/12. The cellular elements of the Salzmann nodules stain positively for matrix-metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), which is characteristically expressed in the central corneal epithelium only during the remodeling phase of wound repair.

MMP-2 functions to break down type 4 collagen, the primary component of the corneal epithelial basement membrane. The expression of MMP-2 by the basal epithelial cells in Salzmann nodules appears to contribute to the destruction of the Bowman layer in an ongoing wound remodeling process.
