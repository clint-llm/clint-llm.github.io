Enteroviruses are ubiquitous, circulating year-round and worldwide. Healthcare providers may encounter them at all levels and in all specialties. As they may present numerous forms, providers of all levels need to recognize "red flags" concerning for more serious disease progression. Enteroviral diseases are best managed with an interprofessional team approach.

Primary care clinicians, especially those who come into contact with pediatric populations, should educate patients and their caregivers on disease transmission prevention, such as hand hygiene and social distancing.

Pharmacists and prescribers should be knowledgeable about supportive care measures and drugs and refrain from recommending unproven products. Patient education may also be required regarding the ineffectiveness of antibiotics or other prescriptions to treat these illnesses.

Primary care clinicians, emergency clinicians, and intensivists play key roles in determining screening or testing requirements. Use care to balance the need for specific diagnosis and surveillance with the increased healthcare costs of extensive testing in self-limited diseases.

Providers at every level prevent viral transmission by utilizing standard, contact, and droplet precautions as appropriate, encouraging childhood vaccinations and taking steps to prevent disease transmission from provider to patient.
