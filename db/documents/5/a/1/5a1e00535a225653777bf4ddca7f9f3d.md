Sufferers of blepharoconjunctivitis describe a typical blepharitic picture of eye irritation with foreign body sensation and crusting of the eyelids along with reports of red eyes. Symptoms are generally worse in the morning, and patients may report eyelids being stuck shut upon waking. Usually, both eyes are affected, and symptoms can fluctuate.

With regards to signs on examination, the patient will likely exhibit a rapid tear film break up time (<10 seconds) when visualized with fluorescein under blue light, and there may be corneal erosions or ulceration. Inspection of the sclera and conjunctivae will show varying degrees of conjunctival injection.

If the underlying blepharitis is anterior in origin, the eyelid margin will appear edematous. The eyelid margin will be erythematous, and telangiectasia may be seen. There may be crusting on the eyelid margin with the formation of collarettes at the base of the lashes. In chronic cases, there may be changes in the eyelashes themselves, such as poliosis (depigmentation), trichiasis (change in direction), or madarosis (reduction in the number of eyelashes). The eyelid may be distorted, and ectropion or entropion may be visible.

If the underlying blepharitis is posterior in origin, the Meibomian glands will be dilated, and the aperture clogged with a visible 'head' or 'cap' of thick oil. On slit-lamp examination, these 'heads' appear like a string of pearls lying on the eyelid margin. The eyelid immediately surrounding the glands may be scarred or visibly inflamed.
