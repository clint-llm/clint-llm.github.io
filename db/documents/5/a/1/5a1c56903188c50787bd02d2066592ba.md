Before jumping to the conclusion of nerve agent exposure, one should consider other common diagnoses. For instance,Â organophosphate-based and carbamate pesticides still exist and can cause similar, though typically less pronounced effects. Type IV pyrethrins have some overlap symptoms. Other considerations should be for an overdose of either direct or indirect cholinergic drugs such as bethanechol, neostigmine, and pyridostigmine.
