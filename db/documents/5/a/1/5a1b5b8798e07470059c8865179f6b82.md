A diagnosis of corneal laceration by slit-lamp examination is an indication for repair. Signs and symptoms of a corneal laceration after trauma are decreased vision, ocular pain, a positive Seidel test, irregular pupil such as a peaked or teardrop pupil, intraocular foreign body, and prolapse of intraocular contents. If a corneal laceration is suspected, but the view on examination is limited due to an uncooperative patient or eyelid edema, the patient should go to the operating for an exam under anesthesia and globe exploration. A corneal laceration repair should occur urgently to reduce the risks of infection, tissue necrosis, peripheral anterior synechiae formation and alleviate patient discomfort. No specific time for repair is published in the literature, but the standard preferred practice is within 24 hours.
