Jumper's knee is an overuse injury of the knee extensor mechanism due to repetitive mechanical stress from athletic activities requiring movements such as jumping, landing, acceleration, deceleration, and cutting.

There are several intrinsic factors of the knee that predispose to this pathology. These include ligamentous laxity, quadriceps and hamstring tightness, excessive Q-angle of the knee, abnormal patellar height, previous, ongoing inflammation of the knee, and excessive force generation on the knee. Other factors can also lead to the development of the jumper's knee, such as excessive volume and frequency of training, the athlete's performance level, and the hardness of the ground where the sport is practiced.
