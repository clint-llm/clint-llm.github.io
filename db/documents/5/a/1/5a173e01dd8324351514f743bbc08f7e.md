Normal findings of spirometry are an FEV1/FVC ratio of greater than 0.70 and both FEV1 and FVC above 80% of the predicted value. If lung volumes are performed, TLC above 80% of the predictive value is normal. Diffusion capacity above 75% of the predicted value is also considered normal.

The natural changes in lung function over time are an important indicator of the health status of the lungs. In non-smokers, FEV1 typically decreases by approximately 30 mL per year. Traditionally a 10% change in FEV1 from baseline over a year duration in healthy individuals is considered significant clinically.
