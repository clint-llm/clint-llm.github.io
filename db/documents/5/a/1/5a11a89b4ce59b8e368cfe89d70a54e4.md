Endoscopic variceal ligation should be repeated every 1 to 4 weeks until varices are eradicated. If TIPS is done, repeat endoscopy to assess rebleeding. Endoscopic screening should be done in patients with known cirrhosis every two to three years and yearly in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Patients with liver stiffness less than 20 kPa and with platelets greater than 150,000 can avoid endoscopic screening and may follow up by annual TE and platelet count.

Prognosis

- In cirrhosis, one-year survival is 50% for those surviving two weeks following a variceal bleed.

- In-hospital mortality remains high related to the severity of underlying cirrhosis, ranging from 0% in Child A to 32% in Child C disease.

- Prognosis in noncirrhotic portal fibrosis is better than for cirrhotics.

Complications

- Formation of gastric varices after eradication of esophageal varices

- Esophageal varices can recur.

- Hepatic encephalopathy, renal dysfunction, hepatorenal syndrome

- Infections after banding/ligation of varices
