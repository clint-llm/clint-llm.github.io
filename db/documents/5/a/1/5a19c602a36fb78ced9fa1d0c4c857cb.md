Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the mitochondrial DNA genome in peripheral blood leukocyte samples to identify deletions is the preferred diagnostic modality in cases of clinically suspected KSS. If blood tests for KSS are negative in patients who have a strong pretest probability of having KSS based on their phenotype, their muscle mtDNA should be sequenced as sometimes tissue-specific mutations can be missed and low levels of heteroplasmy in the blood can lead to false-negative results.

In many patients with KSS, there is an elevation of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid thus lumbar puncture with the analysis of its content should be performed.

As cerebral folate deficiency can develop in KSS and may contribute to the leukoencephalopathy as well as cognitive symptoms, measurements of spinal fluid 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate should be obtained in all patients.

Neuroimaging cannot be used in isolation as a diagnostic modality since the findings are neither sensitive or specific enough to be considered part of the diagnostic criteria. However, as some patients develop a leukoencephalopathy, an MRI of the brain should be performed.

The central nervous system (CNS) involvement is reflected by the extent of MRI abnormalities which can include hyperintensities on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences in the brain stem, globus pallidus, thalamus, and white matter of the cerebrum and cerebellum.

In addition, regional abnormalities of brain metabolism can be demonstrated in patients with KSS using MR spectroscopy (MRS). These could include an increase in the lactate/creatine resonance intensity ratio (an index of impairment of oxidative metabolism) in the resting occipital cortex, as well as a significant decrease in N-acetylaspartate/creatine (a measure of neuron loss or dysfunction) in the cerebral cortex.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) demonstrating concentric remodeling or left ventricular hypertrophy with intramural late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) in the inferolateral wall may assist in the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy in patients with KSS.
