Patients suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome should be educated about the nature of the disease, precautions that they need to take, and rehabilitative activities. These include:

- Avoid repetitive hand motions, holding onto vibrating tools, heavy grasping and positioning, or working with your wrist bent down and out.

- Quit smoking

- Lose weight if overweight

- Reduce caffeine intake

- A wrist braceÂ will sometimes decrease the symptoms. A brace keeps the wrist in a resting position, not bent back or bent down too far. A brace can be especially helpful for relieving the numbness and pain felt at night because it can keep your hand from curling under as you sleep. The wrist brace can also be worn during the day.

- Consult with a physical or occupational therapist. Therapist may check the workstation and the way the patient does his/her work tasks. Therapist would give suggestions regarding the use of healthy body alignment and wrist positions, helpful exercises, and tips on how to prevent future problems.
