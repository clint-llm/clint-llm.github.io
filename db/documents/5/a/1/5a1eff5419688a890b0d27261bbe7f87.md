Blunt or penetrating chest injury often has a lethal effect on the patient in the pre-hospital setting. If the patient arrives at the hospital, they still have a high rate of mortality and morbidity, especially if they have other associated injuries. The exact morbidity and mortality range depends on the associate repairs and injuries that the patient has obtained. A review of the literature shows mortality of more than 30% even with hospital arrival.
