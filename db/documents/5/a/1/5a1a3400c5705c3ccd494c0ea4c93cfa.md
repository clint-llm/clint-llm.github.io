Catheter management of mitral valve regurgitation is a serious procedure and can carry some potentially serious complications. Fortunately, most complications are rare, but the procedure should be taken seriously and performed by a highly trained cardiovascular interventionalist working with an interprofessional team. [Level 1] In addition to being a highly trained physician, it is important to have a team approach when assessing these patients. Before the intervention, the following should take place:

- Explanation of the risks and benefits of catheter management of mitral valve regurgitation as pertains to the specific intervention

- Evaluation by the pulmonary and cardiologist to optimize lung and heart function

- Obtain imaging such as an echocardiogram to assess the function and structure of the heart before planning the procedure

- Consult by a cardiovascular imaging specialist or structuralist

- Pharmaceutical consultation for post-op pain management, antiemetics, and use of blood thinners

- Consult by the anesthesiologist to ensure that the patient is optimized for general anesthesia

- Specialty-trained cardiology nurse to assist with the pre-operative, operative, and post-operative monitoring and education of the patient and coordination of follow-up care with the team

An interprofessional team approach that includes clinicians, nurses, and other ancillary support personnel will lead to the best outcomes. [Level 5]
