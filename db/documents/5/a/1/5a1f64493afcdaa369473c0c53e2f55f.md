The conjoint tendon, also known as the inguinal aponeurotic falx or Henle's ligament, is a condensation of tissue that runs through the lateral edge of the lower rectus sheath. It is located in the inferior abdomen and is formed from the common aponeurosis of the internal oblique muscle and transverse abdominis muscle, although they can be separated.
