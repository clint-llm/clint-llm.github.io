The initial evaluation of hyperhomocysteinemia includes a thorough history and physical exam to look for any signs and symptoms of homocystinuria, a rare but deadly disease.

In patients who do not have signs and symptoms of homocystinuria, the decision to measure homocysteine levels and pursue treatment remains controversial. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), homocysteine levels do not predict cardiovascular disease development. Lowering homocysteine levels does not improve clinical outcomes, nor does it prevent future cardiovascular and thromboembolic diseases with treatment.

On the other hand, some studies showed that lowering the homocysteine level was beneficial. One study was able to show that lowering hyperhomocysteinemia through folic acid supplementation would reduce carotid atherosclerosis progression.
