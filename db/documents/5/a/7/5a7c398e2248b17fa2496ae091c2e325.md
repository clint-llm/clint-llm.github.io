Trigger thumb is a simple term for stenosing flexor tenosynovitis of the thumb. This is a narrowing of the flexor tendon sheath which causes a clicking or popping sensation on attempted extension of the thumb. Flexion is normally facilitated by the extrinsic flexor pollicis longus (FPL) and intrinsic flexor pollicis brevis (FPB). The FPL tendon runs in its tendon sheath through three pulleys (A1, oblique, and A2) located proximal to distal. The A1 pulley is located distally on the metacarpal bone overlapping the MCP joint and the base of the proximal phalanx. Trigger thumb is most commonly due to thickening of the A1 pulley which causes pain and decreased function. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of trigger thumb and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the examination steps for diagnosing trigger thumb. 
- Summarize differential diagnosis for trigger thumb. 
- Outline treatment considerations for trigger thumb. 
- Review the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of trigger thumb.
