Solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs) are generally nonmalignant though there is always the concern for malignant neoplasms. Differential diagnoses for benign SPN include infectious, inflammatory, congenital nodules of the lung. Granulomatous infections like tuberculosis, fungal infections including Histoplasmosis, Cocciodiomycosis, parasites like Echinococcus causing pulmonary hydatid cyst, Paragonimus westermani, also known as Chinese lung fluke, cause solitary lung opacities. Bacterial pneumonia is a rare cause of solitary lung opacities and can represent an abscess. Scars as a sequela of previous infections could cause an SPN. Noninfectious granulomas like sarcoidosis, other inflammatory disorders like rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) are examples of inflammatory etiologies for SPN. Bronchogenic cysts and arteriovenous malformation are present since birth and would be incidentally found even in asymptomatic individuals. Other benign causes that could present as solitary pulmonary nodule would also include mucus plugging, rounded atelectasis, pulmonary infarction, fibromas, and hamartomas. On the other hand, SPNs may present as a wide variety of malignant neoplasms, including bronchogenic carcinoma (both small cell and non-small cell carcinomas), metastatic cancers, carcinoids, lymphomas, and sarcomas.
