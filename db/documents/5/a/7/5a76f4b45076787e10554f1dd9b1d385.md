Physical rehabilitation assists inÂ faster recovery and improves outcome following acute stroke. Most recovery happens within the first 6 months following the stroke onset.

All embolic stroke patients should be evaluated for potential rehabilitation by the rehabilitation team. Depression screening is essential for all stroke patients. According to the FLAME trial, starting fluoxetine early on following the stroke onset in patients with moderate to severe motor deficits lead to an improved outcome at 3 months.
