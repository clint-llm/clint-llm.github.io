Contraindications to glipizide include patients with hypersensitivity to sulfa drugs and patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS).

The administration of sulfonylureas reportedly correlates with a slight increase in adverse cardiac events as compared to patients treated with insulin and diet. This caution is not unique to glipizide, but also several classes of oral hypoglycemic agents (e.g., tolbutamide) studied in the University Group Diabetes Program. If a patient is to initiate glipizide therapy, they should receive information regarding the potential risks, benefits, and possibleÂ complications.

Glipizide and sulfonylureas cross the placenta and have correlations in some cases with neonatal hypoglycemia. It is suggested to discontinue this drug two weeks before expected delivery.

Limited information suggests that levels of glipizide are low in lactation; results are not conclusive. In some instances, an alternative drug may be preferable, particularly while nursing preterm or a newborn. The recommendation is to monitor for hypoglycemia symptoms in breastfed infants whose mother is taking glipizide or other sulfonylureas. In some cases, a newborn with clinical symptoms of hypoglycemia needs the supervision of blood glucose during the time the mother is taking sulfonylureas.
