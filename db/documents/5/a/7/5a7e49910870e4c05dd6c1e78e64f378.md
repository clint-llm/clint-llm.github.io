Marburg virus disease, caused by the Marburg virus in the Filoviridae family, is a rare, severe viral hemorrhagic fever. It is a severe disease with a high case-fatality rate that occurs in humans who travel to endemic areas and have contact with infected bodily fluids or contact with infected animals, such as the host Rousettus fruit bat fruit. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed, and supportive treatment must be initiated. This activity reviews the epidemiology and clinical findings of Marburg virus disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and evaluating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify individual risk factors and populations at risk for acquiring Marburg disease.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Marburg virus disease, including the route of infection, known reservoirs, and most important virulent components of the virus.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with Marburg virus disease and the typical clinical course.
- Summarize the epidemiology of Marburg virus disease, including previous locations of disease outbreaks and regions at risk for future outbreaks.
