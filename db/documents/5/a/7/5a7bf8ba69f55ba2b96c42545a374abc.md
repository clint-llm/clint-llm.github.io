The prognosis of insulin resistance is dependent on the subset of the disease, the severity of the disease, pancreatic beta-cell function, the heritable susceptibility of the patient to the secondary complications from insulin resistance, and individual response to appropriate therapy.

Statistically, coronary artery disease is the leading cause of mortality in the United States, withÂ diabetes as the seventh. The common basis for diabetes and much of the resultant vascular disease (CAD, cerebrovascular disease, and PAD) is insulin resistance. Additional mortality from insulin resistance occurs in the less common manifestations of the disease, including the genetic syndromes and the fatty deposition diseases. Finally, substantial morbidity manifests with the loss of reproductive function and associated stigmata of PCOS.

Mitigation for the disease exists. Increased clinical awareness enables early diagnosis and treatment. Improved understanding of the disease process has resulted in more targeted, multi-faceted treatments. Sustained efforts to attain and maintain a healthy weight through improved dietary intake and increased physical activity can reduce insulin resistance and prevent associated complications. More generalized lay recognition can increase the efficacy of preventative care, with the hope of an eventual downturn in epidemic obesity and resultant insulin resistance.
