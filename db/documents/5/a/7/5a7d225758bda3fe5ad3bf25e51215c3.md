All cases of blunt eye trauma presenting to the clinic or casualty should be evaluated in detail by the ophthalmologist. Patients requiring surgical intervention or expert opinion should be referred to corneal, external disease, trauma specialist, and a retina specialist for targeted management and good visual outcome. Non-resolving glaucoma cases will need expert inputs from glaucoma surgeons. Patients with traumatic cataract subluxated or dislocated nucleus should be managed by a cataract and IOL surgeon.
