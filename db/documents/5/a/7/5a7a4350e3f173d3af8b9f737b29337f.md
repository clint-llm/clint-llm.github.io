The alpha IIb beta3 integrin, formerly known as GPIIb-IIIa, is the platelet’s fibrinogen receptor. When platelets are activated, the alpha IIb beta3 integrin shifts into its active configuration to allow fibrinogen binding. As platelets bind the fibrinogen, they aggregate and provide primary hemostasis. Without functioning fibrinogen receptors, or without enough of them, bleeding can be spontaneous or occur with an injury.
