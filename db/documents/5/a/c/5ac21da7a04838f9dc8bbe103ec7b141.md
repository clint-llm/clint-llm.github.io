The tear film is heterogeneous and is classically divided into three distinct layers â€“ inner mucin, middle aqueous, and outer lipid layer. Though more practically, there is overlap and mixing between layers. The vast majority of the tear film is an aqueous phase containing various mucin concentrations depending on the layer and a thin superficial lipid layer 50-100 nm in thickness.

The inner layer is formed by mucins secreted mostly by the goblet cells in the conjunctival epithelium, and to a lesser extent, by the acinar cells of the lacrimal gland, epithelial cells in the cornea and conjunctiva.

The aqueous layer is essential for maintaining lubrication and protection of the ocular surface. It contains proteins, metabolites, inorganic salts, glucose, oxygen, and electrolytes (magnesium, bicarbonate, calcium, urea) essential for maintaining the health of the ocular surface as well as flushing away debris and toxins.

The lipid layer exists at the environmental-tear interface and essential for delaying the rate of tear evaporation. This superficial lipid layer contains cholesterol, wax esters, fatty acids, and phospholipids. Over 600 unique lipids from 17 different lipid classes have been identified in tears.
