Shoulder arthrocentesis is a useful diagnostic and therapeutic technique. However, as with any medical procedure, the keys to success often lie in thorough preparation. Since there are no hyperacute indications for arthrocentesis of the shoulder, adequate preparation time should always be taken to maximize success and minimize risk. While the radiologist or orthopedic surgeon may do the procedure, the nurse should monitor the patient during the procedure.
