Hemolysed specimen contains many substances with absorbance at 340 nm, which interfere with the plasma glucose results. Enzymes released from hemolysis red blood cells also alter enzymatic reactions during the assay. The hemolyzed specimen having more than 0.5 g of hemoglobin is unsuitable for analysis by the hexokinase method. Hypertriglyceridemia and hyperbilirubinemia also create interference and provides falsely elevated value of plasma glucose. Sample blanking should be done to nullify the effect of triglyceride and bilirubin in the plasma glucose result.
