Several mechanical complications can occur with the ETT resulting in a loss of function. A defective balloon will result in a loss of ability to protect the airway from aspirate and may make mechanical ventilation difficult. The loss of the universal 15 mm connector (either missing or defective)  essentially makes the ETT nonfunctional as the mechanical ventilator or bag-valve-mask cannot interface with it.  Some complications from the physical placement of the tube include bleeding, infection, perforation of the oropharynx (especially with the use a rigid stylet), hoarseness (vocal cord injury), damage to teeth/lips, or esophageal placement.
