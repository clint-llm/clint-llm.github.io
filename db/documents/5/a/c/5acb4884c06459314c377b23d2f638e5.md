Cosmesis and recurrent bleeding are common indications for the intervention of angiokeratoma circumscriptum. Diathermy, curettage and electrocautery, cryosurgery, and surgical excision may be an option for smaller papules or plaques.

Non-ablative laser systems like a pulsed-dye laser, Cooper vapor laser, pulsed argon laser, and Nd:YAG laser typically require several treatment sessions to achieve full eradication of involved areas of skin. These lasers have difficulty accessing the superficial dermis due to the hyperkeratotic epidermis that overlies angiokeratoma circumscriptum lesions. Ablative laser systems, including carbon dioxide and continuous-wave argon lasers, can reach the superficial dermis in one pass.
