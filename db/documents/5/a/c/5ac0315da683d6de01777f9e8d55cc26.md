It is important to consider environmental disparities in the process of identifying high-risk patients in a screening evaluation for exposure to environmental toxins. Studies in the United States have shown that the presence of various toxins such as air pollutants, lead, and pesticides are increased in communities with a lower socioeconomic status.

For patients identified as high risk based on their community, socioeconomic status, or occupation, it is necessary to include a comprehensive screening evaluation of environmental exposures when evaluating for etiologies of infertility if it is not already routine.
