Four walls create the inguinal canal, but the most pertinent portion is the posterior wall, as the conjoint tendon contributes most to this structure. The posterior wall forms from the transversalis fascia, conjoint tendon, and deep inguinal ring. The conjoint tendon derives from a common aponeurosis of the internal oblique and the transverse abdominalis muscles. Its insertion is into the crest of the pubis and pectineal line deep to the superficial inguinal ring medial to the crural fibers. On imaging, the resting conjoint tendon is more vertical than horizontal. The distal tendon can be seen posterior to the pyramidalis muscle, and the conjoint tendon is seen crossing the junction of the middle and outer third of the pubic crest.
