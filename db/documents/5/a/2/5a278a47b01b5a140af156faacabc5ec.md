The prognosis for patients with valproate toxicity will depend on the total amount ingested, the decontamination and elimination strategies, and the supportive care given. Severe ingestions may resolve without any sequelae after aggressive decontamination, elimination, and adequate supportive care.

In one observational retrospective study involving 316 patients, theÂ prognosis of patients with acute valproate toxicity was good with supportive care. According to multivariate analysis in this study, a coma on the initial presentation was the main poor prognostic factor. Other poor prognostic factors include older age, metabolic derangements, and higher amounts of valproate ingestion.
