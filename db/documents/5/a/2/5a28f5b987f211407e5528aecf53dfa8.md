Clotrimazole exerts its action primarily by damaging the permeability barrier in the fungal cytoplasmic membrane.

Though clotrimazole exerts its anti-fungal action by decreasing ergosterol biosynthesis, clotrimazole exerts other pharmacological actions. These include the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum ca2+ ATPase, depletion of intracellular calcium, and blocking of calcium-dependent potassium channels and voltage-dependent calcium channels.
