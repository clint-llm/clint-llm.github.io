Obesity in the United States has been increasing at an alarming rate in the past 50 years, and presently over 98.7 million US residents are affected. In 2014, obesity and its related co-morbidities accounted for 14.3% of U.S. heal care expenditure.

Sleeve gastrectomy, one of the most popular bariatric surgeries in the modern era, was first performed in 1990 as the first of a two-stage operation for biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS). The first laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy was performed in 1999. The original indication for a sleeve gastrectomy was in patients with super obesity (BMI>60) to induce weight loss to more safely undergo the second stage BPD-DS.
