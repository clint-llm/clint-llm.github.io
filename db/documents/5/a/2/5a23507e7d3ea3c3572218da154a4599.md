The diagnosis of Kaposi varicelliform eruption is mainly made on the basis of a clinical examination although several laboratory tests can be helpful.

A Tzanck smear is performed by scraping the floor of an opened vesicle and staining the material with Wright-Giemsa stain which will demonstrate multinucleated giant cells. It is inexpensive, easily applicable, and quick to perform. However, this method suffers from low sensitivity and does not differentiate between herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, or between herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus.

Viral culture and direct fluorescence antibody staining on Tzanck smear are the most reliable techniques for herpes simplex virus detection.

In case of atypical, equivocal, or old lesions, a skin biopsy or polymerase chain reaction may be performed. In fact, a histological examination may confirm a diagnosis that may not have been thought of clinically, whereas polymerase chain reaction will detect viral DNA by Polymerase Chain Reaction.
