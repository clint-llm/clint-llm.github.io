More and more individuals from all age groups are learning and continuing to dive. Barotrauma is the most commonly reported diving-related injury, with arterial gas embolism-related pulmonary barotrauma being the second most common diving-related cause of death. Divers that suffer any form of pulmonary barotrauma need to be medically evaluated before returning to diving. Health care providers need to be aware of the recommendations for fitness to dive.
