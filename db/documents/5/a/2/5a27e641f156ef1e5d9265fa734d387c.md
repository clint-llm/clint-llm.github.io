**Follow Up and Medication Compliance**

Follow-up rates in sexual assault survivors have historically been between 10Â and 31%. Though the minority of victims complete the recommended follow-up medical care, this should be offered and discussed with the victims verbally and reiterated with explicit written instructions. Most recommend follow-up in 1 to 2 weeks for repeat STI testing if not completely treated during the initial examination, and at 4 to 6 weeks and 3 to 6 months for HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and syphilis serology testing.

Adherence to PEP is lower for victims of sexual assault compared to other exposures, highlighting a need for increased attention and guidelines concerning the treatment of sexual assault survivors.

**Guidelines**

Guidelines set forth by the CDC for the evaluation and treatment of sexual assault victims are limited to female and pediatric patients, a few of the guidelines apply to male victims.
