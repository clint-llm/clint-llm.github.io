Due to a lack of biomarkers, epidemiological studies to discover the incidence of aspiration pneumonia have been difficult. Several studies revealed that aspiration pneumonia contributes 5% to 15% of all community-acquired pneumonia. A retrospective study performed on 628 patients with aspiration pneumonia showed 30-day mortality of 21%. The study also showed that CURB 65, which is a predictor of mortality in community-acquired pneumonia, is not a reliable indicator for aspiration pneumonia. This pneumonia remains one of the common complications following general anesthesia and occurs in one in every 2000 to 30000 cases. A study conducted on individuals older than 65 who underwent cardiovascular surgery showed the incidence of aspiration pneumonia to be 9.8%, with 12 out of 123 patients developing aspiration pneumonia after extubation. A case-control study showed that the incidence of aspiration pneumonia was 18% in nursing home patients and 15% in community-acquired aspiration pneumonia. Since most cases of aspiration pneumonia are silent or unwitnessed, the true incidence rate is difficult to ascertain.
