There is the utmost need of large multicentric randomized controlled trials to evaluate the efficacy of currently available radiological and biochemical armamentariums aimed at early diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in vivo. Furthermore, research is underway in evaluating newer frontiers in targeting critical steps such as oligomerization and propagation of tau proteins to halt the disease process in the early stages itself. The belief is that cognitive training might offer some way of reducing possible symptoms. The use of these mental exercises in a professional athlete's career or earlier in their life may prove more effective.

The primary provider, nurse practitioner, sports physician, neurologist, and specialty-trained nursing staff need to work together in a collaborative, interprofessional team approach to chronic traumatic encephalopathy. As prevention is the optimal management strategy, this includes educating the patient on sports safety, and that means wearing a helmet during contact sports, bicycling and ice hockey.
