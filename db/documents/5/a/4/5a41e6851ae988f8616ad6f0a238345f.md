Gyromitra poisoning is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes medical toxicologists and neurology nurses. The key is to start treatment immediately once CNS toxicity occurs, with close attention to liver function, electrolyte balance, fluid status, and neurological status.

Specific treatment for any CNS symptoms is the replacement of the vitamin B6 depleted by MMH. Pyridoxine at 25 mg/kg IV can be given either to control or prevent seizures. Benzodiazepines are also suggested if a patient is seizing despite administration of pyridoxine. Other first-line anticonvulsants such as phenytoin are usually ineffective. Most patients recover uneventfully withinÂ 6 days with good supportive care and pyridoxine.

Patient education is key. The primary care provider and pharmacist should educate the patient on the potential toxicity of wild mushrooms.
