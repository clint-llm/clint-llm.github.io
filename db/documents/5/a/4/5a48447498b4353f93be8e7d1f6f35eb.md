In a 2011 study by Tubbs RS et al., the authors dissected 20 adult cadavers and five fetuses looking for the presence ofÂ adductor minimus. The study revealed that approximately half of the adult (52.5%) and all fetal dissected limbs demonstrated an adductor minimus muscle separate from the adductor magnus muscle and five others where the adductor minimus was partially fused to the adductor magnus muscle. This study also determined that when the adductor minimus was absent or underdeveloped, the quadratus femoris muscle extended more inferiorly, but a fascial layer maintained the separation of the two muscles.

As previously indicated, a study by Takizawa et al. found that the adductor portion of the muscle that inserts most distally on the femur obtains innervation from the posterior division of the obturator nerve and the tibial portion of the sciatic nerve.
