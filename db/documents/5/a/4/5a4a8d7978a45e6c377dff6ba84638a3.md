The median survival is of 3 to 5 years; however, around 30% of patients are alive after five years of diagnosis and 10% to 20% after ten years.Â Factors associated with better survival include increased weight at diagnosis (mild obesity by BMI), younger age at onset, higher ALS functional rating scale score, FVC at presentation, and limb rather than bulbar symptoms.
