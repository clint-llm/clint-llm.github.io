The etiology of bullous systemic lupus erythematosus is unknown. It is an uncommon complication of SLE with autoantibodies to the dermo-epidermal junction of type VII collagen. Most patients with BSLE have an existing diagnosis of SLE, although there are several reports of BSLE as an initial presentation of SLE.
