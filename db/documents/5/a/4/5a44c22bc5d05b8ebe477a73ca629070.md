Patients with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis typically present on a spectrum of severity, ranging from mild symptoms in primary care to fulminant abdominal sepsis in the emergency department. Patients most often present with acute cholangitis, the symptoms of which include fevers, rigors, jaundice, vomiting, generalized abdominal pain, malaise, and pruritus. Charcotâ€™s triad of fever, jaundice, and right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain is common but not always seen in its entirety. Recurrent similar presentations of acute cholangitis may be apparent, and patients may report a history of past biliary drainage procedures or ERCPs. Patients may also report being from or having lived in endemic regions in Southeast and East Asia such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, or Japan, and it is therefore important to take a careful social history.

During later stages of the disease, patients may present with symptoms associated with complications of pyogenic cholangitis. For example, acute pancreatitis will result in central rather than RUQ pain, and bile duct perforation may result in an acute, peritonitic abdomen. In the case of cholangiocarcinoma, patients might present cachectic and malaised, reporting a history of weight loss and other constitutional symptoms.
