Fibrates are usually safe drugs that do not need routine monitoring except in the following cases:

- Co-administration with statins increases the risk for myopathy. Monitor these patients for serum CPK levels, especially if they have diabetes, hypothyroidism, or renal failure.

- Monitor renal function tests in patients with pre-existing deranged renal function.

- Monitor serum transaminases since fibrates can sometimes elevateÂ these levels.

- Conduct gallbladder studies in patients with pre-existing gallbladder disease or if cholelithiasis is suspected.

- Monitor PT/INR levels at least thrice a week when co-administering with coumarin anti-coagulants to prevent bleeding complications as fibrates are known to potentiate the effects of the former.
