Brain imaging like computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) head, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and electroencephalogram (EEG) may be required to rule out other pathologies, especially if the attacks are new in onset, have prolonged symptoms, and have no family history.

Brain imaging (CT or MRI head) during attacks is usually normal. In very few cases, cortical edema and cortical or meningeal enhancement may be seen in the hemisphere contralateral to the hemiparesis.

Patients with FHM1 can have cerebellar atrophy. MRI head may show cortical hemispheric atrophy and cortical laminar necrosis in severe hemiplegic migraine cases.

Electroencephalography (EEG) is performed when there is a suspicion of alternate diagnoses like seizures.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may show nonspecific CSF pleocytosis in a few cases.

Genetic testing is not recommended in all cases. It may be useful for patients with early-onset FHM associated with atypical neurologic manifestations and in patients with FHM when attack severity and neurologic manifestations diverge from other affected relatives.

**Diagnostic Criteria**

Diagnostic criteria for a hemiplegic migraine as per the International Classification of Headache Disorders-3 are as follows:

At least two attacks fulfilling the criteria fulfilling criteria for migraine with aura

The aura consists of both of the following:

- Fully reversible motor weakness

- Fully reversible visual, sensory, and/or speech/language symptoms 
Following are certain criteria specified by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3), which can help in diagnosing migraine with aura
- A. At least two attacks that fulfill criteria B and C
- B. One or more of the following aura symptoms that are reversible: Visual, retinal, sensory, brainstem, motor, speech, or language
- C. At least 3 of the six characteristics below:

- At least one aura symptom that spreads gradually over greater than 5 minutes
- Two or more symptoms in succession
- At least one unilateral aura symptom
- At least one positive aura symptom
- Each aura symptom lasting 5 to 60 minutes
- Aura accompanied by or followed by headache within 60 minutes


- D. No other ICHD-3 diagnosis accounting for the symptoms
