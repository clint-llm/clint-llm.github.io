Because RPR is utilized as a first-line test to screen for syphilis infection, its use is significant in preventing the progression and sequelae of syphilis in its early stages. These sequelae include cardiac and neurologic conditions that may be fatal as a consequence of this disease. Additionally, the use of RPR in pregnant women is important in detecting and treating syphilis before transmission to the fetus occurs, resulting in congenital syphilis.

There is a high prevalence of coinfection with syphilis in those infected with HIV in certain populations. Additionally, syphilis infection may facilitate the transmission of HIV. Thus, using RPR to screen for syphilis, especially in the primary and secondary stages, allows for public health officials and clinical providers to protect those who are HIV negative from acquiring HIV and to also identify and help those already infected with HIV living without medical care.
