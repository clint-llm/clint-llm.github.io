Liver transplantation is a very complex procedure and requires an extremely high level of interprofessional coordination between all medical team members. Healthcare team members, including surgeons, hepatologists, OR and floor nurses, nutritionists, therapists, and social workers, all contribute majorly to the outcomes of liver transplantation. Attention should be given to prevent and minimize the long-term effects related to immunosuppression, manage early and late complications and disease recurrence that lead to patients' deterioration, and may require re-transplantation. With open communication and coordination of effort across disciplines,Â liver transplantation can have a much greater chance of success with reduced morbidity and mortality. [Level 5]
