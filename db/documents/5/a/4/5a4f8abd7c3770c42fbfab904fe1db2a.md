ALCL (ALK-positive) shows a diverse morphologic spectrum. Most cases show infiltration of interfollicular T zones and nodal sinuses by anaplastic large cells that have horseshoe ("hallmark") cells, wreath-like or multiple nuclei, multiple nucleoli, perinuclear eosinophilic region, occasional nuclear pseudoinclusions ("doughnut" cells), and rare mitotic activity. These cells have been referred to as hallmark cells because they are present in all morphological variants. The anaplastic large cells can sometimes mimic Reed-Sternberg cells, metastatic carcinoma cells, or megakaryocytes. Bone marrow forms of infiltration vary from extensive involvement by anaplastic large cells to only rare scattered anaplastic large cells that may elude detection. The classic ALCL (ALK-positive) is known as a common pattern, and this pattern presents in up to 60% of cases. The following morphologic variants haveÂ been described: Lymphohistiocytic, small cell, Hodgkin-like, hypocellular, neutrophil-rich cutaneous T cell, sarcomatoid, and composite pattern.
