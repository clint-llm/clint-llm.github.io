Catecholamines are produced in the chromaffin cells starting with the rate-limiting step of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), regulating the conversion of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA). Di-hydroxyphenylalanine is subsequently converted into dopamine by the action of dopa decarboxylase, which is further converted into norepinephrine by the action of dopamine Î²-hydroxylase. PNMT(phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase) enzyme methylates the norepinephrine to epinephrine. These catecholamines are sequestered in storage vesicles and released into circulation, and cardiac manifestations are mediated through the adrenoreceptors.

Pheochromocytomas release these catecholamines in various patterns ranging from paroxysmal, continuous, and mixed patterns. Norepinephrine is released continuously and can result in persistent hypertension, while epinephrine is released in a paroxysmal pattern resulting in tachyarrhythmias.

The heart has Beta-1 adrenoceptors, and stimulation of these receptors leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase through the guanine triphosphate protein-coupled receptor(Gs). Activating adenylate cyclase (AC) can convert adenosine triphosphate to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This results in the activation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated(HCN) channels and protein kinase (PKA). This cascade of activities can result in increased ionotropy in SA nodal cells and increased dromotropy in AV nodal cells.

Ryanodine-2 receptors (RyR2) present on the sarcoplasmic reticulum of cardiac myocytes are also phosphorylated by protein kinase A and cause calcium efflux into the cytosol.

Beta-2 adrenoceptors are present in the peripheral blood vessels and can cause vaso-dilation when activated by epinephrine and norepinephrine. Alpha(1)-adrenoreceptors are present in the vascular smooth muscle cells and can lead to hypertension induced by vasoconstriction after being activated by norepinephrine and epinephrine. Synaptic nerve terminals have Alpha-2 adrenoceptors which inhibit the release of norepinephrine.
