Being aware of physeal injuries and appropriate treatment is vital to avoid complications. Emergency room providers, as well as primary care clinicians, need to be mindful of proper treatment and follow up to give patients the best care with the lowest risk of complications.  Referral to an orthopedic surgeon for further management/surgical intervention and follow up is important to assess for the development of complications.  Interprofessional communication is important so that patients with physeal injuries can be appropriately identified and treated.
