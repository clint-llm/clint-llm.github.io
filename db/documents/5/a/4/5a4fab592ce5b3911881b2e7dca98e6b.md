Classic Krukenberg tumors (i.e., tumors with signet ring cells that lack tubular formation) must be distinguished from ovarian tumors that contain signet ring cells with mucinous or nonmucinous material.

Ovarian tumors with mucin stain are similar to Krukenberg tumors, but they also stain positive for chromogranin and synaptophysin, which can differentiate them from Krukenberg tumors.

Ovarian tumor with signet ring cell without mucin is divided into a signet-ring stromal tumor (benign, unilateral, devoid of epithelial differentiation, stain positive for vimentin, and negative for cytokeratin), sclerosing stromal cell tumor (containing lipid with no reactivity to periodic acid-Schiff stain and stain positive for inhibin stain), and clear cell adenocarcinoma of the ovary (contains glycogen that stains with periodic acid-Schiff, papillary and tubulocystic pattern with hobnail cells).

Tubular Krukenberg tumors (i.e., cells arranged in tubules) must be distinguished from ovarian tumors with an annular or tubular pattern, including Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors (lack of signet-ring cells, stain positive for inhibin and negative to cytokeratin), endometrioid carcinoma, and tumor of Wolffian origin.

One recent comparative study revealed several factors that can be key in helping to differentiate primary ovarian from Krukekenberg tumors.

The CA125 level is more pronounced in primary ovarian cancer than the Krukenberg tumor, with median values of 652 u/ml for the former and 43 u/ml for the latter. Both CEA and CA19-9 are greater in Krukenberg patients than in primary ovarian malignancy patients at values of 5.4 ng/ml (CEA)/65.9 u/ml (CA19-9) and 1.4 ng/ml (CEA)/18.0 u/ml (CA19-9) respectively. There was considerable overlap in the value range, however. Krukenberg tumors were likely to manifest peritoneal metastases, while ovarian cancers would, additionally, have tumors at distant sites.
