Liver trauma patients are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes ICU nurses. The key to the management of liver trauma is hemodynamic stability and the absence of another abdominal organ injury. For stable patients, observation is now the routine; Unstable patients usually require surgery. The outlook for liver trauma patients has improved significantly over the past 3 decades primarily because of the availability of imaging studies that can help determine the mode of treatment.
