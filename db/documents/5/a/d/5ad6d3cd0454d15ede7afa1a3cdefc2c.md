Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by a gastrinoma, which causes trophic effects of gastrin hypersecreting gastric acid. It can cause severe abdominal pain from multiple ulcers in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, diarrhea, and heartburn. PPIs have been the main therapy to control the symptoms. MEN1 is associated with ZES due to gastrinoma being a part of MEN1. However, the cure rate is low, and surgical resection is not an ideal option. If surgical exploration is indicated, managing hyperparathyroidism, including subtotal parathyroidectomy, must precede actual gastrinoma resection to control symptoms. There is a high propensity of sporadic gastrinoma metastasizing to the liver and lymph nodes, and a surgeon must evaluate distant organs and those found to have sporadic gastrinoma for surgery. If the disease has already metastasized and the patient is not a surgical candidate, there are multiple options, including embolizations and chemotherapy.
