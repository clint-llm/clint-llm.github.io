Under physiological conditions, platelets are activated by a series of intracellular signals when vascular endothelium is damaged. Underlying collagen interacts with tissue factor (TF) to trigger the clotting cascade, activating thrombin, which contributes to platelet adhesion at the injury site. Simultaneously, collagen also binds von Willebrand factor (vWF) to activate platelets via glycoprotein (GP) Ia/IIa and GP IV receptors. Mediators including thromboxane A2, adenosine diphosphate (ADP), thromboxane A2 (TXA2), and cAMP activate platelets, and activation of GPIIb/IIIa receptors promote platelet aggregation.

The most widely used antiplatelet drugs are cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, such as aspirin. This class irreversibly inhibits COX-1 preventing TXA2, which is essential for platelet aggregation.

Clopidogrel and prasugrel are prodrugs that irreversibly block P2Y12 receptors on platelets after undergoing conversion to their respective active metabolites.

Abciximab and eptifibatide are GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors that elicit their effects by blocking the GPIIb/IIIa receptors on the platelet surface to prevent aggregation.

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as cilostazol and dipyridamole exert their antiplatelet effects by increasing cAMP levels in platelets. As cAMP levels rise inside the platelets, TXA2 levels decrease, effectively hindering aggregation abilities.
