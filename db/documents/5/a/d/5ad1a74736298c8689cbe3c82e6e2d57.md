PLP1 is a membrane protein that is folded with disulfide bonds. Point mutations of PLP1 lead to misfolding of the protein, the fact that hinders its transport through the Golgi apparatus for modification. It then accumulates inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The result would be decreased functional protein and toxicity to oligodendrocytes, thereby reducing myelin synthesis.

On the other hand, patients with null mutations that render truncated gene copies do not have accumulations in the ER. Toxicity towards oligodendrocytes is significantly less; hence, patients with PLP1 null mutations, exhibit a mild phenotype.

Duplication mutations at PLP1 lead to overexpression of PLP1 and DM 20, its accompanying protein. This leads to absent or decreased myelination and oligodendrocyte dysfunction; consequently, the classic PMD phenotype. Missense mutations result in connatal PMD, where there are oligodendrocyte apoptosis and axonal injury, which explains the severity of this phenotype. Deletion or null mutations lead to milder phenotypes like SPG2 and PLP-1 null syndrome. Here, oligodendrocytes survive with mildly decreased myelin synthesis and axonal injury.
