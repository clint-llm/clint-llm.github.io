Corticosteroid-induced myopathy is a highly prevalent toxic noninflammatory myopathy, which occurs as an adverse effect of prolonged oral or intravenous glucocorticoid use. It was first described in 1932 by Harvey Cushing, as part of a constellation of symptoms seen in Cushing syndrome. With the broader use of corticosteroids as therapeutic tools in the 1950s, corticosteroid-induced myopathy became a more well-known entity.
