Preparation for this procedure begins with obtaining informed consent from the patient.  The patient’s anatomy is assessed using ultrasound, and the desired location for lead placement is determined. The skin is prepped with alcohol containing solution, ideally chlorhexidine unless a contraindication to its use is present. Personnel will don personal protective equipment, sterile gloves and place sterile drapes to expose the insertion site.
