The life expectancy in sickle cell disease is overall reduced (perhaps by 20 to 30 years) compared to normal adults, but advances in therapy are prolonging survival. Factors that predict poor prognosis include dactylitis in infancy, hemoglobin level less than 7 g/dL, and higher white cell count in the absence of infection.
