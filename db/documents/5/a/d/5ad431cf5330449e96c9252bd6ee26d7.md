Hemifacial microsomia is a continuum of congenital deformities involving genetic disruption of the first and second branchial arches.

Hemifacial microsomia is the second most common birth defect of the head and neck, second only to cleft lip/cleft palate, with an incidence of 1:3500 to 1:4000.

It is critical to understand the pathogenesis of hemifacial microsomia to understand the surgical therapies (generally) and what will be asked of the anesthesia team to best anticipate potential issues and difficulties, especially with airway concerns. A 2020 retrospective review looked at the anesthetic management of 311 hemifacial microsomia pediatric cases to better elucidate these issues. They found that facemask was possible for all except one child, a bilateral case, that required a two-handed mask technique. The success of intubation with video laryngoscopy and fiberoptic techniques was 100%, but the success of direct laryngoscopy was only 79.5%.
