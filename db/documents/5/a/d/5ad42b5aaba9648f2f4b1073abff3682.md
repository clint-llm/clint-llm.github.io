It is essential to inform patients that MAC is a slow-growing, relentless tumor that is often difficult to recognize early. It is imperative to educate patients treated for MAC that follow-up examinations are important and that recurrence can happen decades later in some cases. Education on photoprotection, periodic self-skin examination, postoperative wound healing, and expected changes in sensation should be considered to promote early detection of both primary tumors and recurrence.
