Gray-baby syndrome usually begins between 2 to 9 days after chloramphenicol therapy is initiated. The relative hepatic and renal dysfunction in neonates (especially in premature infants) result in elevated serum levels of chloramphenicol. This impairs electron transport within the mitochondrial and consequently cellular respiration, leading to direct cellular toxicity. The chloramphenicol parent moleculeÂ also displaces unconjugated bilirubin from albumin, giving way to kernicterus and eventually death or permanent neurological sequelae if left untreated.
