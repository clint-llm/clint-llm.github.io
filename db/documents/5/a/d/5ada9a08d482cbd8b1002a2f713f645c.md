Historically, patients most commonly present for evaluation after a fall off of a bicycle onto the involved knee. Patients will present to their primary care physician, pediatrician, or at the emergency department after having trouble with ambulation secondary to pain and knee effusion. As with any injury or fracture, the skin should first be assessed to ensure there is no evidence of open fractures. If there are associated ligamentous injuries, a knee effusion from a hemarthrosis will not be present as there will be a disruption in the capsule, which allows the effusion to dissipate out of the joint.
