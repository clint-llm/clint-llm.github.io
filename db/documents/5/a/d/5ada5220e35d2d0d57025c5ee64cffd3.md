Patients with congenital poikiloderma need to understand that sun exposure increased their risk of skin cancer. Therefore sun exposure protection is crucial, including remaining in full shade, wearing clothing that covers the exposed skin, and broad-spectrum sunscreens. Blindness secondary to cataract development is another potential complication.

Genetic counseling is alsoÂ a consideration for family members.
