Sharks may attack if they perceive humans as food; although, this is thought to be uncommon and generally a case of mistaken identity, for example, mistaking a thrashing limb or reflection from diving or snorkeling gear for a smaller fish. Attacks may be provoked if a human appears to be a threat or a competitor for food (and possibly mistaken as a mating competitor). Unnecessarily touching a shark is never recommended. Many bites occur when sharks are handled after being caught in nets or on fishing lines. Sharks may also attack to protect their territory. Although menstrual blood from a female swimmer could theoretically attract sharks, there is no evidence that this actually increases the incidence of shark attacks. However, some organizations still recommend for females to avoid swimming in waters where one could potentially be attacked by a shark during menstruation.
