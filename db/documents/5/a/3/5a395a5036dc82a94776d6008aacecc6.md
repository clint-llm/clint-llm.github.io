Lorazepam binds to benzodiazepine receptors on the postsynaptic GABA-A ligand-gated chloride channel neuron at several sites within the central nervous system (CNS). It enhances the inhibitory effects of GABA, which increases the conductance of chloride ions in the cell. This shift in chloride ions results in hyperpolarization and stabilization of the cellular plasma membrane.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**lorazepam is well absorbed after oral administration. Peak concentrations are attained two hours following oral administration. The bioavailability of lorazepam is approximately 90%. Lorazepam crosses the blood/brain barrier freely by passive diffusion.

**Distribution:**The volume of distribution is 1.3 L/kg. Lorazepam has approximately 90% plasma protein binding. Lorazepam crosses the blood/brain barrier freely by passive diffusion.

**Metabolism:**Lorazepam is metabolized by conjugation in the liver and undergoes enterohepatic recirculation. Lorazepam glucuronide is an inactive metabolite. Lorazepam undergoes direct glucuronidation without prior cytochrome p450 metabolism; consequently, lorazepam can be used in patients with hepatic dysfunction with insignificant effects on the pharmacokinetics.

**Excretion:**The elimination half-life is 14±5 hours, and clearance is 1.1±0.4 mL/min/kg. Lorazepam is excreted primarily in the urine.
