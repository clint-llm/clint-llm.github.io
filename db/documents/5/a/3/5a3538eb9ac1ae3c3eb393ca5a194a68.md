Breast infections are divided into lactational and non-lactational, or puerperal and nonpuerperal categories. They can be associated with superficial skin or an underlying lesion. Breast abscesses are more common in lactating women but do occur in nonlactating women as well. It is important to rule out more serious pathology like breast cancer when a non-lactational patient presents with signs and symptoms of breast abscess. The vast majority of these infections occur in females, but they can occur in males as well. Diagnosis and treatment for breast abscesses are not difficult, but there is a high rate of recurrence.
