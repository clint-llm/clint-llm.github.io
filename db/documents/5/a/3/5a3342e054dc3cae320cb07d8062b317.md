Some studies suggest that activation of the locus coeruleus may lead to increased cerebral blood flow to certain areas of the brain. Norepinephrine (NE) released from the locus coeruleus helps maintain the blood-brain barrier; it leads to vasoconstriction of vessels and may have a role in redistributing blood flow to more active areas of the brain. The brain receives blood supply from arteries that branch from the circle of Willis. The circle of Willis is comprised of anastomoses of arteries located at the base of the brain. The internal carotid artery and basilar artery are two vessels that are part of the circle of Willis. Branches of the internal carotid artery (anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries) supply most of the brain except for the cerebellum, brainstem, and medial occipital lobe, which are supplied by the basilar artery. There has been a long-held belief that the brain does not have lymphatic vasculature. RecentlyÂ research has determined that the central nervous system undergoes immune regulation that may take place within the meninges. The discovery of lymphatic vessels or structures within the brain is limited; therefore, further research is necessary.
