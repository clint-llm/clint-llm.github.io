KSS is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes pharmacists, geneticists, nurses, and therapists. There is no cure for this rare disorder and all treatments are supportive. Folic acid supplementation in patients with low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is highly recommended as is hormonal replacement therapy in endocrinopathies and cardiac pacemaker placement for patients with cardiac conduction blocks. Some patients with diplopia and prisms may benefit from strabismus surgery, and frontalis slings placement surgery may also treat ptosis. Cochlear implants can be used for patients with sensorineural hearing loss.

Surveillance includes yearly ECG, echocardiography, and 24-hour Holter monitoring (regardless of patient's age), audiometry and endocrinologic evaluation.
