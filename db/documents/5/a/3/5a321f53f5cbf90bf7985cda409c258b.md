Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated for bacterial infections as their anti-inflammatory and vasoconstrictive effect will mask the infection, ultimately delaying diagnosis and treatment. Topical steroids should also be avoided in impetigo, furuncles and carbuncles, cellulitis, erysipelas, lymphangitis, and erythrasma. Relative contraindications include candida and dermatophytes.
