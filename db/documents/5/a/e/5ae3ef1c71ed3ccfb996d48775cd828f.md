A patient with suspected primary hyperaldosteronism will present with uncontrolled hypertension and will typically be young. These patients will require up to three antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, to maintain suboptimal blood pressure control. They can also have a family history of early-onset hypertension or cerebral vascular disease at a younger age. Patients may have severe muscle weakness, palpitations, fatigue, or muscle cramps due to symptoms related to hypokalemia. Polydipsia and polyuria are present due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, likely secondary to hypokalemia.

Hypokalemia has been considered one of the hallmark signs in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism; however, estimates are now that less than 37 percent of patients who have primary hyperaldosteronism will present with hypokalemia.

There are no physical exam characteristics that will lead to a diagnosis of primary hyperaldosteronism. However, due to excessive hypertension and stress on the heart, left ventricular hypertrophy can occur, leading to an S4 heart sound secondary to blood trying to enter a noncompliant stiff ventricle during atrial contraction. Other findings related to longstanding hypertension can arise throughout the body affecting the heart (heart failure), kidneys (proteinuria), eyes (hypertensive retinal changes), vasculature (carotid bruits/stroke symptoms), muscle weakness, and mental status changes secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy.
