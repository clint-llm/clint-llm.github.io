There are seven known genogroups of norovirus, but only genogroups I and II are responsible for the vast majority of human cases. An extremely small number of cases are attributed to norovirus GIV. While both genogroups I and II are both clinically relevant, a specific strain from genogroup II, norovirus GII.4, is responsible for the majority of human outbreaks. Additionally, illness produced by GII.4 strains tends to be more severe and is associated with higher mortality than illness from other strains. Studies have shown that waterborne outbreaks tend to be associated with genogroup I strains, while healthcare-related and winter outbreaks are more likely to have genogroup II strains as a causative agent. Noroviruses are classified into genogroups and genotypes based on amino acid diversity in VP1 and ORF1 proteins. The primary mode of transmission is fecal-oral. Sources include ingestion of contaminated water or food or direct transmission from a contaminated surface or infected person. The virus is resistant and can stay on surfaces even after disinfecting. The virus also has a low viral inoculum to cause infection. As few as ten viral particles are needed to cause infection.
