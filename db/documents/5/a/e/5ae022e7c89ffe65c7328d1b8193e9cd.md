With age, the number of health-related comorbidities also increases. As the number of comorbidities increases, so does the number of medications. This complex relation leads to polypharmacy, a geriatric syndrome. With age elderly become frail, characterized by diminished strength and endurance, falls, increased functional dependence. Increased interleukin-6, low vitamin D levels, anemia, and abnormal brain imaging are associated with cognitive decline in the elderly. With age, people become physiologically and functionally very different due to their underlying comorbid conditions. These changes lead to varied life expectancies in older adults.

The risk factors mentioned above, along with the use of multiple medications, make cognitive impairment more severe and pronounced when compared to healthy adults who are not taking any medicines.
