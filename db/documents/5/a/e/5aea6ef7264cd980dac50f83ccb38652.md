The interprofessional healthcare team must communicate to the patient, parent, or caregiver and provide the fact sheet copy before administering the combination therapy (bamlanivimab and etesevimab). The fact sheet includes the following information:

- The FDA has approved both etesevimab and bamlanivimab for emergency use to treat mild to moderate SARS CoV-2.

- It can be used in adults and pediatrics if they are 12 years old and above or weighing 40 kg or more and are at high risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 or hospitalization.

- The patient or parent/caregiver has the option to accept or refuse.

- The potential risks and benefits of medications are unknown.

- Patients treated with bamlanivimab and etesevimab should continue following the CDC guidelines (wear a mask, social distance, avoid sharing personal items, and frequent handwashing).

Etesevimab and bamlanivimab infusion should be given only by a qualified healthcare professional, and the patient should be monitored for anaphylaxis for at least 1 hour after completing the infusion. The health care team comprising the physician, nurse practitioner, and nurse are jointly responsible for reporting the medication errors and serious adverse events related to etesevimab and bamlanivimab treatment within seven days from the onset of the event.

The Secretary of the HHS (Department of Health and Human Services) has announced a public health emergency that justifies the EUA of etesevimab and bamlanivimab during the SARS CoV-2 pandemic. This EUA will be terminated when the HHS secretary finds that the situation justifying the EUA no longer exists.

When administering this novel therapy, all interprofessional team members must be in constant communication and operate as a functional unit, collaborating and coordinating their activities and information collection. This includes clinicians (including mid-level practitioners), specialists, nurses, and pharmacists, all operating as a cohesive unit to optimize patient outcomes. [Level 5]
