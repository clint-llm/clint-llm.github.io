Femoral PSA can typically be caused by any form of percutaneous intervention that uses the femoral artery as their entry point. Classically, interventions after cardiac catheterization for coronary stenting have been implicated as the culprit. However, any form of femoral artery cannulation and sheath introduction can potentially cause arterial wall dissection with resultant PSA. Hence, ultrasound-guided cannulation with a Seldinger technique under fluoroscopic guidance becomes of paramount importance in any endovascular intervention. Certain risk factors may contribute to PSA formation, for example, the use of large sheath size, poor technique, patient body habitus, and obesity, need for anticoagulation, female gender, and patient on hemodialysis. It is also implicated that interventions that are performed for therapeutic reasons are associated with a higher number of PSA formation compared to diagnostic ones as the former typically require a larger size sheath.

True femoral artery aneurysms are very rare and have mostly found in individuals over the age of 65. They are usually unilateral but may be bilateral in 10% of cases. In at least 30% of cases, the true femoral artery aneurysm is associated with an aneurysm elsewhere in the body. Unlike pseudoaneurysms, the risk of rupture is low; however, these aneurysms can form thrombosis and cause limb ischemia.
