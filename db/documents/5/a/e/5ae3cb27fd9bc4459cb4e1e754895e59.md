The nursing staff has a crucial role during the procedure preparation, procedure, and post-procedure monitoring. Before block placement, nursing staff should assist in the procedural timeout, which includes verifying allergies, procedure, laterality, and contraindications to the procedure. During the procedure, nursing staff should monitor the patientâ€™s vital signs along with the level of sedation, if utilized. The nurse can assist with the patient position before and throughout the procedure. After the procedure, the nurse should watch for complications such as local anesthetic toxicity, pneumothorax, and bleeding. Nurses can also monitor the analgesia provided by the block and catheter if utilized.
