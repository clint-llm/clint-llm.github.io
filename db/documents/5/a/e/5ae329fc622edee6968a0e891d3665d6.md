The only curative potential treatment modality for ampullary cancer is surgical resection with pancreaticoduodenectomy/Whipple with or without preserving the pylorus. Surgical outcomes are better in high volume centers. The perioperative mortality is less than 5%; however, the perioperative morbidity is 20 to 40 percent with anastomotic leak and delayed gastric emptying as a common source.
