The main complication of CKTR is allograft loss, which leads to kidney failure and possibly death, especially in patients who are poor candidates for repeat kidney transplantation. Patient complications include anxiety and depression, with an increased risk of mortality and worse quality of life with dialysis re-initiation. Kaplan et al. reported a less than 40% chance of at least 10-year survival in patients with kidney allograft failure.
