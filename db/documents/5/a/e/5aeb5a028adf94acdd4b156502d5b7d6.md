Duplication cysts, also known as alimentary tract duplications, are congenital lesions of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the exact cause still eludes us, multiple theories have been put forward to explain its occurrence.

A diverse clinical presentation due to variations in location, size, presence of heterotopic mucosa, etc. makes the clinical diagnosis of these cysts challenging. Ultrasound showing the gut signature sign is pathognomonic of a duplication cyst. The definitive treatment modality for children with a duplication cyst is surgery. Excellent long-term outcomes are reported after optimal surgery.
