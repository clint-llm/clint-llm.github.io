The dermatologist primarily manages IgA pemphigus. However, the disorder may be initially encountered by the primary care clinician. Hence, an appropriate referral is necessary. Because these patients are treated with corticosteroids, healthcare workers, including the pharmacist, must observe the patient for adverse effects likes osteoporosis, diabetes, cataracts, and infection. However, unlike IgG pemphigus, IgA pemphigus is often not controlled by steroids alone. Many studies have found the addition of dapsone to the treatment regimen to be far superior to just steroids.
