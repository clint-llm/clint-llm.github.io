The etiology of the myopathies is usually caused by a disruption in the muscle tissue integrity, and the metabolic stability which may be triggered by inherited genetic diseases, or metabolic errors, certain drugs and toxins, bacterial or viral infections, inflammation, besides minerals, electrolytes, and hormonal irregularities:

**Inherited Myopathies**

- Mitochondrial Myopathies
- Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike syndrome (MELAS)
- Kearns-Sayre syndrome
- Others (Leber hereditary optic neuropathy; Myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers; Leigh syndrome and neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa; mtDNA deletion and depletion syndromes; Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia; etc.)

- Congenital Myopathies

- Nemaline myopathies
- Core myopathies
- Centronuclear myopathies
- Others

- Metabolic Myopathies
- Lipid myopathies (most common are carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency, very-long-chain-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, trifunctional protein deficiency)
- Glycogen storage disease myopathy (Acid maltase deficiency - Pompe disease, Debrancher deficiency - Cori disease - and muscle phosphorylase deficiency - McArdle disease - are the most frequently encountered)

- Channelopathies

- Periodic paralysis (Hypokalemic, hyperkalemic, Andersen-Tawil syndrome)
- Nondystrophic myotonias (p.e. paramyotonia congenita, Thomsen disease)

- Muscular Dystrophies
- Dystrophinopathies (Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Becker muscular dystrophy, Intermediate phenotype)
- Myotonic muscular dystrophies (type 1 and type 2)
- Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophies (type 1 and type 2)
- Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy
- Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies
- Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy
- Congenital muscular dystrophy (most common being LAMA2-related, collagen VI-related and alfa-dystroglycan-related)  
- Distal myopathies

**Acquired Myopathies**

- Toxic Myopathies

- Necrotizing myopathies (statins, fibrates, immune checkpoint inhibitors, labetalol, propofol, alcohol, cyclosporine)
- Mitochondrial myopathies (some antiretrovirals)
- Amphiphilic myopathies (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, amiodarone)
- Antimicrotubular myopathies  (vincristine)
- Hypokalemic myopathies (diuretics, steroids, laxatives, alcohol, etc.)
- Critical care-associated myopathies (corticosteroids, neuromuscular blockers)
- Inflammatory myopathy (tumor necrosis alfa inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, statins, IFN-alfa, D-penicillamine, L-tryptophan, hydroxyurea, imatinib lamotrigine, phenytoin)
- Unknown mechanism (finasteride, omeprazole, isotretinoin)

- Immune-mediated or Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies

- Dermatomyositis
- Antisynthetase syndrome
- Immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy
- Inclusion body myopathy
- Overlap myositis (association with other connective tissue diseases as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome, systemic sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis)
- Polymyositis

- Infectious Myopathies 

- Bacterial infections (Lyme disease, pyomyositis - Staphylococcus aureus)
- Viral infections (Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Coxsackie A and B viruses, Influenza)
- Parasitic infections (trichinosis, toxoplasmosis, cysticercosis)
- Fungal infection (Candida, Coccidiomycosis)

- Endocrine Myopathies 
- Thyroid and parathyroid dysfunction (hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism)
- Adrenal dysfunction (Addison's disease, Cushing syndrome)
- Diabetic muscle infarction

- Electrolyte-mediated Mopathies (hypo- and hyperkalemia, hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, hypophosphatemia)

- Myopathies associated with systemic disease (amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, vitamin D deficiency, critical care myopathy, idiopathic eosinophilic myopathy, paraneoplastic)

NOTE: Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome defined by skeletal muscle damage with CK elevation. It can occur with or without underlying muscle disease and should not be considered as a primary myopathy.
