Factors that suggest a favorable diagnosis include:

- Female gender

- Relapsing course

- Mild relapses

- Good recovery between exacerbations

- Primarily sensory symptoms

- Long interval between first and second relapses

- Low lesion load on MRI

- Presentation of optic neuritis

- Full recovery from exacerbations
