# Continuing Education Activity

Avulsion fractures can happen anywhere in the body where soft tissue attaches to the bone. The failure of bone most commonly results from an acute event with the application of usually sudden, tensile force to the bone through the soft tissue, or when chronic repetitive avulsive stresses lead to a piece of bone being pulled away by the soft tissue. They often present with distinct mechanisms of injury as well as concomitant soft tissue or intra-articular injuries. They can be difficult to recognize or appear insignificant, yet early diagnosis is key to directing appropriate work-up, referral, and treatment. This activity reviews the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and management of avulsion fractures.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of avulsion fractures in both the adult and adolescent patient populations.
- Describe the importance of recognizing concomitant soft tissue injuries that occur with avulsion fractures.
- Outline the management options available for avulsion fractures.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients who sustain avulsion fractures.

# Introduction

An avulsion fracture is a failure of bone in which a bone fragment is pulled away from its main body by soft tissue that is attached to it.

Soft tissue attachments to bone can include ligaments, tendons, sub tendon sheaths, joint capsule, labrum, retinaculum, meniscus, or syndesmosis.

Avulsion fractures, as a topic, is very broad, with diverse mechanisms, clinical scenarios, presentations, and a wide range of appropriate management depending on where it occurs. They can represent small or large fractures.

Avulsion fractures often happen near joints due to large numbers of supporting osseous, tendinous, and capsuloligamentous structures in a relatively close anatomic space, or at apophyseal myotendinous attachment sites.

Some types of avulsion fractures are quite common, and many others are very rare, but may remain clinically significant.

These injuries are important to recognize because they are frequently associated with other concomitant soft tissue, or osteocartilaginous injuries, or can indicate joint instability.

Fracture patterns, along with information such as patient age, can provide information for the injury mechanism as well as predict stability and predict associated soft tissue injuries.

In general, these fractures can occur in adult, adolescent, or pediatric populations, with common characteristics specific to each anatomic location.

# Etiology

Acute trauma is the most common cause of avulsion fractures. This can be direct or indirect trauma, with both high and low-energy mechanisms described.

# Epidemiology

Certain fracture types tend to be more common in adolescents, and tend to be associated with sports-related injuries.

Adults avulsion fractures, on the other hand, tend to have a higher association with traumatic injuries.

The true prevalence or incidence of many avulsion fractures is not known. Accurate incidence is difficult to know because most of the literature regarding avulsion fractures is comprised of case reports and case series.

Epidemiologic information varies entirely based on anatomic location and age. Avulsion fractures in certain anatomic areas can be quite common.

It is generally agreed that the prevalence may be increasing due to earlier and more frequent participation in sporting and other athletic activities in young people, with higher demands on growing body parts.

In pediatric and adolescent age groups, males are 3 to 5 times more likely than girls to sustain an avulsion fracture.

While the prevalence of avulsion fractures is difficult to know, avulsion fractures overall do have a very high prevalence of associated soft tissue injuries that occur in conjunction with them.

# Pathophysiology

**Pathophysiology**

An avulsion fracture occurs when a ligament or other soft tissue attachment to bone overcomes the stress capacity of the bony attachment and tears off a portion of the bone. This usually occurs with forces applied from trauma.

The anatomic position of some ligaments put them at risk with traumatic mechanisms involving external directional or rotational forces specific to that body part.

Some avulsion fractures can become quite displaced due to the distracting soft tissue forces, while the displacement of the avulsed fragment in other areas is prevented from migration by additional soft tissue attachments that remain intact; therefore, holding it relatively non-displaced, or very close to its attachment site.

The pathophysiology of sports-related injuries is often related to throwing, the eccentric phase of any sporting activity, rapid acceleration or deceleration, kicking, running, jumping, or abrupt changing of direction.

In the adolescent population, avulsion injuries are almost always the result of failure through the apophysis.

The described imbalance between muscle strength and the weaker unfused apophysis increases with continued growth and maturation until the physis fuses.

Bony avulsions are less common overall in adults because once the physis closes or ossifies, the connection between the apophysis and the body of bone becomes stronger, and is no longer the weakest structure in the transference of force between the soft tissue and the bone.

In some areas of the body, the pathophysiology of avulsion fractures is altogether unique. For example, in adolescent tibial tubercle avulsion fractures, the portion of the proximal tibial physis deep to the ossifying tibial tubercle apophysis is composed of fibrocartilage until just before physeal fusion. Close to the time of fusion, this fibrocartilage segment is replaced by weaker hyaline cartilage, which predisposes the tibial tubercle to avulsion fractures during this distinct age and timeframe of development.

The reason behind avulsion fractures in the post-surgical setting may be due to the weakening of bone from removal or alteration during surgery. For example, avulsions of the anterior superior iliac spine, commonly only seen in adolescents, is reported in adults after undergoing bone harvesting procedures from the iliac crest.

**Mechanisms**

The avulsion mechanism at a myotendinous attachment site involves an indirect muscle pull such as forceful flexion or extension of a joint against a myotendinous contraction attempting to move the joint in the opposite direction.

There are many cases with no external trauma, where a body part can be forced into extreme ranges of motion. In such scenarios, there is likely an associated protective forceful muscular contraction that leads to the avulsion of bone.

Dislocation of a joint can cause indirect forces from the distraction force resulting in capsular avulsion fractures, or Shear injury.

The most common mechanism of avulsion fracture in the adolescent population is sudden tension across an open apophysis from the forceful contraction of a large muscle. Often in an attempt to accelerate or decelerate a limb or the body mass.

Chronic mechanisms whereby avulsion fracture can be the result, stem from repetitive traction, microtrauma, and overuse traction-type injuries.

Along with avulsion fractures, the mechanism by which so many associated soft tissue injuries occur varies with each joint or body part. These additional soft tissue injuries which happen in concert with avulsion fractures may not be seen or apparent on imaging. Whether the visualized avulsion injury or its associated soft tissue injury occurred first, the general concept that stabilizing soft tissues each plays distinct and intertwined roles in physiologic movement and ranges of motion remains the same. Disruption of one stabilizing structure as a result of the injury force can drastically affect or cause injury to many other related stabilizing soft tissue structures or the cartilage. Without the protection of the normal physiologic restraints, the force and instability lead to additional unnatural forces and further potential destruction.

# History and Physical

**History**

Depending on the level of severity and institution, the initial assessment and management of a patient presenting from trauma may be overseen by the trauma service. Adhering to the principles and protocols of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) should always take precedence if indicated.

When obtaining a patient history upon initial presentation of an avulsion fracture, the provider must obtain information regarding inciting event. In the setting of trauma, one must determine if the patient sustained high versus low-energy trauma. Discerning the mechanism is important.

It can be helpful to find out if symptoms are worse with activity, improve with rest, if this has happened before, or if this is a recurrent issue or injury. Patients with continued pain and a preexisting diagnosis of muscle strain or apophysitis should raise concern for an avulsion fracture. Along the same lines, a history of an acute event without previous pain may help differentiate a minimally displaced acute avulsion fracture from the chronic avulsion changes that might appear similar.

Providers must also find out if the patient has a history of cancer or infection.

In many trauma scenarios, the patient can be unsure of their body position and mechanism of their injury; or there are conflicting stories from witnesses. Likewise, the patient may be unconscious or unable to communicate. Similar to forensic science, in the context of avulsion fractures, it is possible to make an accurate diagnosis as well as determine the mechanism, and find other associated occult injuries, even with very limited, or contradicting information. A thorough physical exam accompanied with the appropriate background knowledge and radiographs may be all that is needed to make the diagnoses to direct appropriate management and follow up.

**Physical Examination**

Patients may present with pain, swelling, a palpable gap, visible deformation, decreased range of motion, local tenderness, discomfort, guarding, weakness, bruising, inability to bear weight, mild limitation of activity, sudden loss of function, or possibly chronic pain preceding the injury.

Providers should attempt to observe the patient’s gait or active range of motion if possible, as well as look for skin tenting or dimpling.

Direct palpation of the injured area, specifically trying to derive the area of maximal point of tenderness, can be an essential diagnostic feature in distinguishing a peripheral fracture from an uncomplicated sprain.

Because avulsion fractures are often associated with instability or dislocation, altered function, loss of range of motion, and loss of normal mechanics may be encountered.

In general, one should always examine the joint above and below the injured body part.

During the physical exam addressing an avulsion fracture, the provider must check for associated injuries. For example, in many avulsion fractures about the shoulder, shoulder stability, as well as the biceps tendon, may need to be evaluated.

One point to consider is that it can be difficult to assess a patient with an acute swollen body part accurately; therefore, the patient may need to be reexamined 10 to 14 days after the injury.

Although rare, certain avulsion fractures have a high association with compartment syndrome even without high-energy trauma. Therefore compartments must always be assessed on presentation. In such fractures, even when presenting without signs or symptoms of compartment syndrome, the high association may justify the need to proceed acutely for surgical fixation. If it is determined that immediate surgery is not necessary, observation and serial compartment checks of the extremity may be warranted in these patients.

Lastly, if a patient does present with a fracture-dislocation with the joint still dislocated, the physical examination components discussed above, especially the neurovascular status should be assessed both before and after the reduction is performed.

# Evaluation

The combination of a good history and an awareness of the characteristic presentations of avulsion fractures should lead to consistent diagnostic accuracy.

Knowledge of developmental bone anatomy and physeal closure sequences is very important when evaluating bony injuries in the pediatric or adolescent population.

At the time of initial evaluation, the first imaging study should include plain radiographs.

In some circumstances, gravity-assisted, stress tests, or weight-bearing radiographs can help with a diagnosis of stability, or additional capsuloligamentous or muscle injuries.

Radiographic features alone can provide a wealth of knowledge in injuries involving avulsion fractures. By the anatomic location, fracture pattern, orientation, displacement, and amount of comminution, one can often derive the mechanism, as well as predict additional ligamentous or other common associated soft tissue injuries that are encountered with each avulsion injury.

General radiographic features of acute avulsion fractures often involve small bony fragments with irregular or sharply defined non-sclerotic, non-corticated edges, with the fragment in close proximity to a known soft tissue attachment site.

It is important to note that spontaneous reduction of a traumatically dislocated joint may occur in any joint. This must be taken into consideration whenever there is an avulsion fracture near a joint, which clinically and radiographically appears located on the initial presentation. In these patients, if there is a painful joint with a lack of complete congruity of the joint, spontaneous reduction with interposition within the joint should be suspected. There are certain common avulsion fracture injuries, such as the patella dislocation-relocation injury, in which the patella rarely remains dislocated at the time of initial imaging.

The only other radiographic finding, in addition to the avulsion fracture, is often a joint effusion or soft tissue swelling. Since these are common findings present after minor trauma,  this can wrongfully lead a provider to disregard the injury.

Many injuries may require an additional computed tomography (CT) scan to assess comminution, displacement, and assist with operative planning.

Each avulsion fracture site typically has a common fracture pattern, but also a common pattern of injury or associated injuries. Thus, identification is crucial so that patients may be worked up appropriately, including consultation with an orthopedic surgeon and additional imaging as circumstances dictate.

An example of how radiographic patterns can help determine the diagnosis or inciting factor is a radiographic clue sometimes seen with avulsion injuries associated with chronic overuse of calcifications within, or near attachment sites of a tendon.

The avulsion fracture itself can be subtle, and diagnosis may be difficult, missed, or delayed.

Clinical suspicion that an avulsion fracture is present but not visualized on plain radiograph should lead to further workup, including advanced imaging such as CT, MRI, or ultrasound.

Another scenario in which one should consider a more advanced workup is in the patient presentation with suggestive radiographs, but history and exam that does not match up with a clear mechanism or history of injury. In this case, one must rule out other bone lesions or underlying pathologies, including cancer and infection.

Lastly, if a patient presents with a grossly dislocated joint that requires reduction, post-reduction imaging must be obtained. Attention to any widening of the joint space, or a nonconcentric reduction may indicate a trapped osteochondral fragment or may indicate significant instability.

# Treatment / Management

The initial treatment of most acute avulsion fractures related to dislocations includes initial reduction attempt and stabilization.

Appropriate treatment modalities are very broad and tailored to each body part. There are many things to consider, which all factor into selecting the most appropriate treatment. Factors that may influence nonoperative treatment versus surgery can be the acuity, size of the avulsed segment, the anatomic site, displacement,  associated injuries, instability, high demand patients or high-level athletes, nerve dysfunction resulting from the fracture, hand dominance (when applicable), individual patient occupation or function, intra-articular fracture extension, degree of comminution, or the age of the patient and involvement or extension into an epiphyseal growth plate. Symptomatic malunions or nonunions may also require surgical correction or fixation.

With or without surgery, early motion may be the goal with some body parts, with or without bracing, while other avulsion injuries require longer periods of immobilization due to stronger distracting forces.

Avulsion fractures may require initial close follow up and even weekly radiographs to evaluate healing, and to monitor for displacement, inadequate reduction or redisplacement.

Similar to many acute musculoskeletal injuries, ice, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), rest, and a period of partial or non-weight bearing is often included in the first phase of nonoperative treatment.

Physical therapy, or a carefully directed rehabilitation program, usually with levels of progression, can be beneficial.

A common nonoperative treatment regimen described for patients involved in sporting activities include the following, or similar phases of physical therapy and rehab. Phase one consists of rest, ice, and protection. Phase two initiates a gradual increase in the excursion of the injured myotendinous unit. Phase three begins when 75% of motion is regained, or complete active range of motion without secondary resistance is achieved. In this phase, a patient may begin a guided, progressive resistance program. This phase ends when the involved muscles have reached 50% of their anticipated strength. Phase four is the integrated use of the injured musculotendinous unit with the use of other muscles of the surrounding area and limb. Full weight-bearing is initiated, leading to beginning simple patterns of activity and motion, such as gentle jogging. It is important to continue stretching and strengthening throughout all phases. Phase four is the most common phase at which reinjury occurs. Phase five is the preparation of the athlete for a full return to competitive status. Sufficient callus strength, muscular strength, and agility must be achieved before attempting a return.

Treatment in many scenarios, including avulsion injuries, may be controversial. In injuries where definitive treatment is less clear, it may be acceptable to undergo an initial trial of nonoperative management and guided therapy with close monitoring, with surgery as an option if the nonoperative trial is unsuccessful.

Common absolute indications for surgery include open fractures, fracture fragments incarcerated in a joint, gross instability,

Fracture blisters and soft tissue trauma may necessitate provisional fixation or delay in definitive surgery to avoid wound complications.

The basic goals of surgery most commonly include open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of large or displaced fragments, and to restore articular congruity and stability.

Despite a provider’s best efforts to avoid surgery, many avulsion fractures require surgical fixation based on the significance, location, and associated conditions or injuries.

The nature of avulsion fractures usually indicates that the ligaments which are attached to bone fragments remain intact; therefore, emphasis toward anatomic reduction and/or fixation is important for the restoration of stability and function.

In treating avulsion fractures, one must recognize that although bony fixation is important, soft tissue reconstruction can be of most importance in some regions such as the shoulder, elbow, knee, and ankle.

Many soft tissue injuries do occur in isolation without avulsion fractures such as ACL tears, but the addition of an avulsion fracture (such as the Segond fracture) in addition to the soft tissue injury may actually indicate more than usual instability and may need to be taken into consideration when fixing the ligamentous or soft tissue injury. Repairing the fracture or performing a reinforcement procedure may be needed to stabilize the joint during reconstruction fully.

With any treatment modality or surgery to address a particular issue regarding joint instability, high failure rates or chronic residual instability may be due to the presence of an undiagnosed, missed, or untreated avulsion fracture.

Intraoperative stress testing may need to be performed to assess the stability or soft tissue integrity after repair or fixation of the bone and soft tissues.

In some avulsion fracture cases, treatment is geared toward prophylaxis to prevent other known associated injuries or impending fractures from happening or worsening. One example includes surgical fixation of isolated greater trochanter avulsion fractures in the elderly due to the high rate of occult intertrochanteric fracture extension found on MRI. Prophylactic fixation prevents further displacement or completion of the occult fracture.

# Prognosis

When discussing avulsion fractures as a whole, there are many factors to consider when trying to determine prognosis. The topic is complicated by the fact that a certain side effect after treatment may translate into a poor prognosis in some body parts, yet seem to yield very few negative consequences in other anatomic locations.

In general, the severity of the injury and the speed of the healing process will help determine the prognosis.

Outcomes of avulsion fractures are largely dependent on the body part involved. While some avulsion fractures tend to be less disabling and less symptomatic, others are much more so.

Another prognostic indicator appears dependent on the optimization of stability and articular congruity. However, despite appropriate treatment, avulsion fractures still frequently result in residual stiffness and arthrosis.

Avulsion fractures that are stable injuries and considered insignificant do have better functional outcomes when treatment of early motion and progression of weight bearing is applied compared to patients with the same injury who are treated with a period of immobilization or non-weight bearing.

Early diagnosis may also be a key to obtaining the best outcomes, as it can carefully direct the appropriate treatment.

Knowledge of developmental bone anatomy, growth, and physeal closure sequences is very important to assist in predicting the prognosis of avulsion injuries in the pediatric or adolescent population. Nevertheless, the adolescent population seems to have a better overall prognosis and higher return to the previous level of sport or activity, while older age and osteoporosis may be associated with worse outcomes.

Long-term outcomes of many adolescent avulsion fractures have not been well studied.

Certain anatomic areas are more prone to recurrent instability or laxity.

One study found that an avulsion fracture associated with an intraarticular soft tissue injury in the knee may indicate more instability, but was not found to have a higher risk of revision surgery compared to those who sustained the same soft tissue injury without the accompanying avulsion fracture.

Lastly, in cases of avulsion fractures associated with pathologic lesions, such as metastatic cancer, the overall prognosis of the patient may not be affected, or dependent on the treatment and outcome of the avulsion fracture, but rather on the prognosis of the underlying pathologic disease.

# Complications

Some complications regarding avulsion fractures are directly related to the injury. The injury alone can lead to heterotrophic ossification, hematoma, cause neurovascular injury or irritation, and loss of proprioception.

Compartment syndrome from avulsion fractures is very rare, or not at all described in some body parts, while certain fractures such as pediatric tibial tubercle avulsion fractures are especially at risk for this complication. One must be extremely vigilant when addressing that injury.

In adolescent apophyseal avulsion fractures, the most common complications are painful nonunion and exostosis formation.

A missed injury or a delay in appropriate treatment has been reported to lead to complications such as pain, nonunion, malunion, recurrent injury or instability, bone loss, bone resorption, erosion, accelerated arthrosis, contracture, loss of function, irreversible injury, avascular necrosis, chronic pain, delayed return to sport, and pseudoarthrosis.

Even with prompt diagnosis, failure to treat an associated soft tissue injury at the time of fixing the fracture is an avoidable complication and, as discussed, can lead to many other complications.

Because avulsion fractures often involve joints and stabilizing structures, loss of motion should always be discussed with the patient as a possible complication. Some risk factors specific to joint rigidity include delayed treatment, prolonged operative time, malunion, prominent hardware, fracture displacement, reoperations, and prolonged immobilization.

Although necessary for many injuries, surgical intervention of any kind does not come without complications. Commonly discussed surgical complications include wound infection, wound dehiscence, septic arthritis, myositis ossificans, pin-tract infections, blood loss, osteonecrosis, heterotrophic ossification, and nerve injury, although the actual incidence of these complications is low.

Altogether, complications from surgery vary greatly, as the nature of some avulsion fractures require greater exposure with large incisions and more extensive dissections, while others can be adequately treated with minimally invasive, percutaneous, or arthroscopic techniques.

Perhaps most complications occur during the healing or rehabilitation phase after either operative or non-operative treatment has been administered. Inadequate protection or inadequately supervised rehabilitation programs can potentially lead to muscle contracture, nonunion, or weakness.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

With appropriate early diagnosis and treatment, many avulsion fracture injuries have satisfactory outcomes. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that regardless of which type of avulsion fracture a patient may sustain, the associated mechanism and additional injuries to surrounding soft tissues may lead to prolonged recovery or complications despite appropriate conservative or operative management of their injury.

In the setting of sports and exercise, it is extremely important to focus on pre-exercise warm-up activities and pre-season strengthening programs as much as possible as preventative mechanisms.

Chronic overuse can lead to significant symptoms of pain and weakness and produce swelling at soft tissue attachment sites to bone. This is due to repetitive microtrauma and avulsive forces, usually related to sports activities or repetitive actions that can be required in some occupations. This occasionally leads to inflammation, weakening, or fragmentation of the bone and can be a precursor or potential risk factor for an acute avulsion fracture in that area.

# Pearls and Other Issues

General pearls, as they relate to avulsion fractures, highlight why they may be clinically relevant compared to many other injuries. Depending on the body part, the pull of the soft tissue that is still attached to the fracture fragment can make reduction, and therefore healing more difficult. This may cause fractures to heal in the wrong anatomic location (malunion), commonly with distraction and rotational malalignment. This can lead to weakness, pain, and dysfunction.

Related injuries include entrapment of soft tissue structures, fracture extension, intra-articular loose bodies, ligament and supporting tendon, soft tissue, and retinacula injuries.

The rate of neurologic injury is higher in some avulsion fractures if they are associated with dislocation.

In cases of residual joint instability, displacement or dislocation, the pull of adjacent or surrounding soft tissue and the fracture itself be an obstruction to the reduction of the fracture and/or a dislocated joint.

In general, joints are responsible for varying degrees of complex ranges of motion between bones. Bones provide attachment sites for muscles via tendons, which facilitate movement. Together with ligaments, capsules, and other soft tissues, the muscles and tendons around a joint form a stable soft tissue envelope and allow a base of motion specific to each joint. There are often static and dynamic stabilizers of joints, and the motion and stability of many of these joints rely on coordinated sensorimotor systems. Coordinated muscle contractions in concert with biofeedback from capsuloligamentous structures result in normal motion and functional stability.

Prominent in the orthopedic surgery literature and training are certain avulsion fractures that, when recognized, are pathognomonic for other associated injuries or conditions. Displaced pediatric apophyseal avulsion fractures of the olecranon, isolated greater trochanter avulsion fractures in the elderly, adult lesser trochanter avulsion fractures, the Segond fracture, posterior proximal tibial avulsion in a “dashboard injury,” and the “fleck sign” in the foot are six such examples which are briefly discussed below.

It has been recommended that a diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta be considered when displaced apophyseal avulsion fractures of the olecranon are seen in the pediatric population with relatively low-energy trauma. This is especially true if the injury occurs bilaterally. In patients with osteogenesis imperfecta who sustain this fracture, they are generally more displaced than children without the disorder, and the risk of incurring the same fracture on the other side is around 70%.****

Approximately 90% of elderly adults with an isolated greater trochanter avulsion fracture on plain radiographs have been found to have occult intertrochanteric extension on MRI.

In adults, lesser trochanteric pathology in the setting of avulsion injury without a clear trauma history is virtually always secondary to metastatic disease in the trochanteric region. This should be regarded as secondary to metastatic neoplasm until proven otherwise.

The Segond fracture has been extensively documented in association with ACL disruption and meniscal tear that accompany it.

A small posterior tibial plateau avulsion fracture seen after a so-called “dashboard injury” in the setting of a motor vehicle accident with an anteroposterior force applied to the proximal tibia on a flexed knee is essentially pathognomonic for posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury. Additional physical exam tests to assess the integrity of the PCL and other soft tissues around the knee should be performed, such as assessing for posterior sag of the tibia. Likewise, an MRI must be obtained to assess the extent of internal derangement that is likely to be present in association with the fracture and mechanism of injury.

The “fleck sign” seen as a bony fragment in the basal first intermetatarsal space on an anterior-posterior view radiograph represents an avulsion of the Lisfranc ligament and is diagnostic of Lisfranc injury. The Lisfranc ligament is a plantar interosseous ligament spanning from the lateral zone of the medial cuneiform to the medial zone of the second metatarsal. Widening of the interval between the first and second metatarsal bases is often seen, as well as dorsal displacement of the proximal base of the first or second metatarsal on the lateral view. The Lisfranc injury is a tarsometatarsal fracture-dislocation with disruption of the articulation of the medial cuneiform and base of the second metatarsal, which is the unifying factor in the disruption of the tarsometatarsal joint complex. The severity of injuries range, and can be purely ligamentous. Regardless of the type of Lisfranc injury, they must be treated. Missed injuries result in chronic pain, instability, dysfunction, and often progressive foot deformities. Although not diagnostic, a common physical exam finding of plantar ecchymosis at the level of the midfoot is highly suggestive of a Lisfranc injury and has been described as a pathognomonic sign of Lisfranc injury.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Avulsion fractures may be small or have a relatively benign appearance to those unfamiliar with these injuries. The uninformed provider may be inclined to deem these injuries inconsequential, when in fact they are a sign of potentially more severe underlying damage to other major stabilizing structures of a joint.

Accurate diagnosis is paramount because treatments and potential additional workup differ between each type of avulsion fracture.

Patients with prior chronic apophysitis, or repetitive avulsion injury at the site of tendon insertions, may be at increased risk for acute avulsion injuries.

Avulsions are best cared for by an interprofessional team consisting of primary care providers, emergency medical personnel, radiologists, orthopedists, specialty trained nurses, physiatrists, and physical therapists. [Level 5]
