The palmar grasp reflex is a routine part of neurological examination done in neonates. Even with just a phylogenetic role to play, it can provide clues to diagnose certain pathologies like cerebral palsy or peripheral nerve injury.

The treatment of cerebral palsy requires a holistic approach by an occupational therapist, physical therapists, vocational therapists, pediatricians, pediatric surgeons, and nurses.

Peripheral nerve injury in a newborn occurs mainly during labor when the child has shoulder dystocia or is large for gestational age. Obstetricians should make sure to take care of high-risk pregnancies, counsel the mother about maintaining proper health, having regular check-ups with her doctor, etc. Fetal distress should undergo assessment efficiently, and timely surgical intervention should commence if necessary. Any suspected child abuse, which might cause peripheral injury, should be reported to child protective services.

A recent study has shown that a manual osteopathic treatment can improve cerebral oxygenation (in healthy subjects); children or adults affected by brain anoxia could derive benefit from osteopathic treatment.

Manual osteopathic treatment can increase the parasympathetic system. We can assume that, according to a study on spastic patients, an increase in vagal activity may help control the altered palmar reflex better.
