Fibula bone grafts are the gold standard in mandibular reconstructive surgeries. This is because removing the fibula from its anatomical location will not greatly impact weight bearing, as that is mainly the function of the tibia. Additionally, the fibula is thin and long while maintaining great vascularity. This allows for easy graft uptake and osseointegration of dental implants. When using the fibula as a graft, only the shaft is used, and two ends of the fibula are left intact.
