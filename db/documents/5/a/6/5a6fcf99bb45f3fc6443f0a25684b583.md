**Anatomy**

The teres major originates on the posterior surface of the inferior angle of the scapula and inserts on the medial lip of the intertubercular groove of the humerus.

The latissimus dorsi originates inferior to the teres major and travels along the inferior border of the teres major. The latissimus dorsi then travels superiorly to insert at the same site on the humeral head as the teres major, the lip of the intertubercular groove of the humerus. The latissimus dorsi and teres major tendons often join near the insertion site, with some studies illustrating that the tendons fused prior to their insertion on the humerus.

In addition to the teres major and latissimus dorsi both inserting on the lip of the intertubercular groove of the humerus, the pectoralis major also inserts at this same site except more laterally.

**Function**

The function of the teres major is to extend, medially rotate and adduct the humerus. It also plays a role in the stabilization of the humeral head. This muscle is not alone in these functions. The latissimus dorsi also aids in medial rotation and adduction of the humerus.

The pectoralis major also acts to adduct the humeral head. The rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) assist the teres major in stabilizing the humeral head.
