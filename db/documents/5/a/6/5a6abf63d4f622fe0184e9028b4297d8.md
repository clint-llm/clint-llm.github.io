Migraine is the most frequent primary headache disorder in children and adolescents. Up to 18% of patients in the pediatric emergency room are found to be migraine-related. The diagnosis of migraine in children and adolescents remains a clinical diagnosis. Acute treatment recommendations for children include using over-the-counter analgesics and triptan medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Preventive treatment strategies involve lifestyle modifications, behavioral approaches, and consideration of preventive medications with the lowest side effect profiles. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of pediatric migraine and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating children with migraine.
