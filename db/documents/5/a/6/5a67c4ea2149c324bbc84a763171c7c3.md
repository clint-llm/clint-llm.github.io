Clinically, a diagnosis should be considered in individuals that exhibit signs of immunodeficiency; pigment dilution of the skin, hair, or eyes; congenital or transient neutropenia; and signs of unexplained neurologic symptoms or neurodegeneration.

**Testing**

A diagnosis can be made based on the presence of abnormally large granules in cells such as melanocytes, leukocytes, and their bone marrow precursors, fibroblasts, the central and peripheral nervous tissue, and hair.

Molecular genetic testing also can be done to detect the biallelic variants in the LYST gene.

Once the diagnosis of Chediak Higashi has been confirmed, the following can be done to assess the extent of the disease:

**(a) Assess the presence of accelerated phase**

- Splenomegaly

- Any history of recurrent fever or unexplained fever

- Cytopenia affecting at least two cell lines

- Increased serum ferritin concentration

- Increased levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels

- Signs of hemophagocytosis in either the bone marrow or cerebrospinal fluid

- Evidence of liver dysfunction (hypertriglyceridemia or hypofibrinogenemia)

**(b) Complete a thorough neurological examination**

**(c) Screen for signs of lymphoma as the hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis that is associated with Chediak Higashi may have a similar clinical appearance.**

**(d) Genetic consultation**
