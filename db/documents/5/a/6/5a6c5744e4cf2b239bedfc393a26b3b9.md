In children with foreign body aspiration, the prognosis is good if removed early and without complications. Most patients who present responsive to an Emergency Department after foreign body aspiration have a good outcome. Acute aspiration of a larger object that obstructs the trachea or proximal airway can have very dire consequences.  In a study of 94 children who all presented three days after aspiration, all recovered fully from any complications aside from one who died of respiratory failure.
