As stated previously, Schatzki ring is associated with a hiatal hernia. Gastroesophageal reflux has been thought of as causing the ring. It has been postulated that the creation of a Schatzki ring is the body’s response to frequent acid exposure and a natural way of preventing the development of Barrett esophagus. Studies have shown that Barrett esophagus is less common when a Schatzki ring is present, especially long-segment Barrett’s esophagus.
