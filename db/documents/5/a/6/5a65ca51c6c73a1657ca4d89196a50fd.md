A thorough assessment of patients presenting with mental health symptoms involves ruling out medical and biological causes of symptomatology.  Current and past medical history, as well as current medications, should be part of the psychiatric evaluation to provide context to symptoms.  While routine laboratory screening of an otherwise healthy patient with symptoms of depression is of questionable diagnostic value, the following tests are commonly ordered to support medical decision-making: complete blood count, chemistry panels, urine pregnancy, urine toxicology, and TSH.  Symptoms and patient history often guide additional testing.
