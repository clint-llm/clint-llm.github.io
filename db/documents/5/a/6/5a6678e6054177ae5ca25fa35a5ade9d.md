Animal bites account for approximately one percent of all emergency department (ED) visits in the U.S. yearly and range from superficial injuries to disfiguring and even fatal wounds. Even relatively minor wounds can become infected, and therefore all bites should be evaluated carefully and thoroughly with a mind to potential complications.  This chapter will focus on dog and cat bites and the common sequelae as they are the most prevalent, and when considered with human bites (which will be a discussion topic in another chapter), account for over 95% of the total bite wounds seen in the ED.
