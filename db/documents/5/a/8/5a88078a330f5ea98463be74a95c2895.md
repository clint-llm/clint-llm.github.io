Initial assessment of an individual presenting with stroke symptoms should include blood pressure and heart rate measurement along with respiratory function assessment (respiratory rate and pulse oximetry). As pons houses the respiratory centers, large pontine infarctions can compromise respiratory function and may warrant intubation and mechanical ventilation. If hemodynamically stable, a complete neurological examination in addition to routine history taking and physical examination is conducted. While the neurological exam assists in localizing the anatomical region affected and the type of stroke (ischemic vs. hemorrhagic), relevant history and vitals can point to the predisposing conditions (e.g., hypertension). After proper stabilization, a complete neurological examination including an assessment of consciousness, cognition, gait, coordination, reflexes, cranial nerve examination, and sensory and motor system should be performed. Followed by physical examination, neuroimaging is urgently indicated in all suspected stroke cases, and the timing of the imaging determines the treatment modality and its success. Computed tomography (CT) scan due to its availability and ability to detect hemorrhages is used to triage a stroke patient. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains the mainstay of diagnosis for ischemic strokes due to its ability to detect acute ischemia within minutes of onset (diffusion-weighted MRI).
