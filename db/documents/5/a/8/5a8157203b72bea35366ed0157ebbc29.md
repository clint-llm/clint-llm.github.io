Pulmonary hypertension encompasses a heterogeneous group of disorders with the common feature of elevated pulmonary artery pressures. Patients often present with worsening dyspnea on exertion, with signs of right heart strain/failure. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and extensive testing to confirm the condition as well as to determine the underlying etiology. Treatment is based on the management of the underlying etiology as well as medical therapy. Interventional and surgical options are available for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. Lung transplantation can be considered for patients not responding to medical therapy. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of pulmonary hypertension and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the five groups of pulmonary hypertension. 
- Review the typical presentation of a patient with pulmonary hypertension. 
- Summarize diagnostic and management strategies according to the class of pulmonary hypertension.
- Describe how the coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to earlier diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, allowing for treatment aimed at minimizing comorbidities, treating symptoms, and identifying and treating underlying etiologies, leading to better patient outcomes.
