There is no definitive treatment for Kleine–Levin syndrome during either the acute episode or interepisodic period.

Antidepressants did not prevent relapse, except in a single case, in which a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (moclobemide) was utilized. Carbamazepine improved abnormal behavior. Lithium was found to significantly improve abnormal behavior, reduce the duration of episodes, and decrease relapses, improving recovery of symptoms.

Modafinil was shown to decrease the duration of the symptomatic periods but did affect the recidivism rate.
