Depending on the patient and operation, the bimalleolar fracture can have a poor prognosis. Those at higher risk are the elderly, persons with diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and tobacco users. In general, full weight-bearing takes time and can begin after 5 to 6 weeks of immobilization, but this is different for each patient depending on the severity of the injury, quality of bone, and stability of the reduction. With operative intervention, the mortality one year after the surgery is 12% in patients older than 65, increasing to 50% forÂ patients over 95.
