Approximately 50% of patients with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension suffer from supine hypertension. This association is due to side effects from antihypertensive medications and the common autonomic dysfunction seen in these patients due to comorbid conditions, such as diabetes mellitus. Unfortunately, no approved antihypertensive medication selectively targets the supine position. This complicates treatment because supine hypertension in patients with autonomic failure can result in end-organ damage. The treatment approach for these patients is currently being studied and might be an outlet for individualized medicine in the future.
