An acute mesenteric arterial embolism is often cardiogenic in origin and primarily affects the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Preceding events include atrial tachyarrhythmia, congestive heart failure, myocardial ischemia or infarction, cardiomyopathy, and ventricular aneurysm, which results in thrombus formation that later embolizes to cause ischemia. Patients with acute mesenteric arterial thrombosis commonly have a pre-existing atherosclerotic disease. Vasospasm in theÂ SMA often accompanies NOMI secondary to cardiac failure, peripheral hypoxemia, or reperfusion injury.
