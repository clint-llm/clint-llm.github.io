There are no absolute contraindications to phenylephrine aside from hypersensitivity to the drug or any of its components. Phenylephrine contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions, including anaphylactic symptoms or less severe asthmatic episodes in susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity is unknown and probably low. Phenylephrine use requires caution in patients with a history of bradycardia, autonomic dysfunction, severe cardiac dysfunction, and hypovolemia.
