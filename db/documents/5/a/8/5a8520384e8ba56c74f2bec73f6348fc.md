Patients usually have no clinical manifestations, and labial fusion is found incidentally on routine examination. A common location for the fusion of the labia is near the clitoris. The labial adhesion consists of thin fibrotic tissue, which can range from being a small partial fusion to a complete fusion occluding the vaginal orifice.

When clinical manifestations do occur, they usually consist of post-void dripping, hematuria, dysuria, and local inflammation in the labial area. These females may come in complaining of difficulty voiding and retention of urine. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) also may be associated with this condition, thus prompting treatment. Some studies have shown that a prepubertal female who has labial adhesion has a higher risk of having a urinary tract infection. It is of utmost importance to do a physical exam that includes evaluation of the genitourinary region. When the labial adhesions resolve successfully, the risk for an infection of the urinary tract decreases.
