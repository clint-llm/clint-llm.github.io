Patients with haemolacria may first encounter their primary care provider or an emergency department provider. An ophthalmology consult is recommended. Cross-consultations with other physicians may be required based on the etiology of hemolacria. The outcomes and treatment options for patients with haemolacria depend on the primary condition.
