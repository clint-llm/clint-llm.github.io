The most common etiology of abnormal pap smears is due to HPV infections. HPV is an enveloped, circular, double-stranded DNA virus. The High-Risk HPV (HR-HPV) serotypes areÂ 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68 because they make the oncoproteins, E6, and E7.

In non-infected cells, one of the ways the cell cycle becomes arrested in G1 is with the binding of Rb to E2F. E2F is a transcriptional activator needed to progress the cell into the S phase but cannot when bound to Rb. In the high-risk strains of HPV, E7 binds to Rb, causing E2F to be released.

Genetically, BRCA mutations play a role in the susceptibility of developing cervical cancer. BRCA stands for the breast cancer gene, and its translational product is a tumor suppressor protein. BRCA1/2 are integral in many pathways but are especially important for DNA repair. When there are double-stranded DNA breaks, these proteins help with homologous recombination repair. Without these proteins, there is genomic instability that can lead to neoplastic changes.
