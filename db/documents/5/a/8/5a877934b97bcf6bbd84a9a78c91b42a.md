M. Chelonae can cause infection of almost any organ in the body. The organism is often resistant to many antibiotics and is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a surgeon, infectious disease specialist, wound care nurse, an internist and an intensivist.Â Surgical debridement, removal of foreign body, and catheters are an important adjunct to successful therapy. In many cases, the treatment has to be continued for weeks or months. For patients who are immunocompromised, the prognosis is guarded.
