Motion sickness is a common condition that practitioners should be prepared to evaluate and treat.  Prevention of symptoms is more effective than treatment; therefore the primary care provider and nurse practitioner should provide education and emphasize behavioral countermeasures to minimize sensory conflict.

There are reports that bland diets that are high in carbohydrates and low in fats can diminish the symptoms of motion sickness.

Patients who intend to travel should acclimatize themselves to motion and minimize the motion stimuli by seating in the middle.
