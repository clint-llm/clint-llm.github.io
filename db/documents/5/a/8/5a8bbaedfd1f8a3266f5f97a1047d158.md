Non-small lung carcinoma (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% to 90% of all lung cancers. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) makes up the remainder. Three major histologic types of NSCLC are adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of NSCLC. It accounts for 50% of cases and has a high propensity to metastasize. Bronchoalveolar carcinoma is a subtype of adenocarcinoma which can present as a solitary nodule or multifocal disease. Typically, it is not associated with smoking.Â  Squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma comprise 35% and 15%, respectively.****
