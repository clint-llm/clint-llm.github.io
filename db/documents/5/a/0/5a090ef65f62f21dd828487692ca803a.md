Generally, there are atypical lymphocytes in a sparse dermal infiltrate along with epidermotropism (movement of the atypical lymphocytes into the epidermis), which is suggestive, but not diagnostic, of MF; epidermotropism may be completely absent in biopsies from SS patients. The more diagnostic intra-epidermal aggregates of atypical cells (ie, Pautrier's microabscesses) may or may not be present. Significant edema and a nonspecific infiltrate of inflammatory T cells may predominate, making diagnosis more difficult.
