TED has a self-limiting course owing to the absence of orbital lymphoid tissue.

Rundle explained the natural history of TED.

- Initial phase: A steep rise in disease severity, lasting six months – to 5 years (avg. two years)

- Inflammatory phase: Active TED duration

- Stable, inactive phase: TED stabilizes and regresses subsequently beyond 18 months of activity

The disease never returns to baseline. Residual fibrotic changes persist in the orbit. Aggressive immunosuppressive management during the initial active phase can limit the destructive and fibrotic consequences of the immune cascade. The inactive phase has little response to medical management and warrants surgical intervention.

The “Cone model” explains the disease progression by an expansion of the muscle cone against a rigid bony orbit into 3 phases:

- Circumferential cone expansion – displaces the extraconal fat outwards

- Axial elongation of cone – causes proptosis and muscle strain

- Cone hypertension and muscle stiffness – impede the orbital venous drainage
