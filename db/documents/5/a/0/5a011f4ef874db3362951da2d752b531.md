Two popular systems exist for the staging of bone tumors. The musculoskeletal tumor society's Enneking system is used primarily by orthopedic surgeons because it takes into account the anatomic location of the tumor: intracompartmental (completely contained within the bone) vs. extracompartmental (extension outside of the bone). The alternative system described by the American joint committee on cancer (AJCC) does not take anatomic location into account. However, it does account for the size of the tumor, which research has recognized as having significant prognostic value for predicting response to treatment and overall survival. Specifically, larger lesions have a propensity to metastasize, so these patients may benefit from chemotherapeutic intervention, making the AJCC system more popular with oncologists.

**Musculoskeletal Tumor Society/Enneking System for Staging of Malignant Musculoskeletal Tumors**

- Stage IA: Low grade, intracompartmental tumor location, no metastasis

- Stage IB: Low grade, extracompartmental tumor location, no metastasis

- Stage IIA: High grade, intracompartmental tumor location, no metastasis

- Stage IIB: High grade, extracompartmental tumor location, no metastasis

- Stage III: Any grade, any location, metastasis present

**American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) System for Staging of Primary Bone Sarcomas (8th Edition)**

- Stage IA: Low grade, less than 8 cm tumor size, no spread to regional lymph nodes, no distant metastasis

- Stage IB: Low grade, greater than 8 cm tumor size or skip lesions, no spread to regional lymph nodes, no distant metastasis

- Stage IIA: High grade, greater than 8 cm tumor size, no spread to regional lymph nodes, no distant metastasis

- Stage IIB: High grade, less than 8 cm tumor size, no spread to regional lymph nodes, no distant metastasis

- Stage III: High grade, discontinuous tumor involvement/"skip" lesions, no regional lymph nodes, no distant metastasis

- Stage IVA: Any grade, any size, no regional lymph node spread, lung metastasis

- Stage IVB: Any grade, any size, regional lymph node spread, lung or extrapulmonary metastasis
