Managing a patient with a perforated peptic ulcer can be challenging given the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. Hence it requires an interprofessional approach to maximize the chances of a favorable outcome. Diagnosis relies on suspicion of the underlying disorder. This treatment begins with the nurse triaging the patient and continues with the emergency medicine provider. Once suspected, resuscitative measures must be initiated while diagnostic studies are being obtained. This takes a coordinated effort between the ED provider and staff members of the nursing, pharmacy, and radiology departments. Once the diagnosis is made, further communication is required between the ED provider and the on-call surgeon. Interprofessional communication is central to an expedited workup and treatment with the ultimate goal of getting the appropriate patient to the operating room promptly as the surgical delay has been related to mortality.
