Pelvic sonography is a screening tool and an important diagnostic modality for various gynecological and obstetric pathologies. Patients with abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), postmenopausal bleeding, abdominal distension, palpable pelvic mass, abdominal pain, pelvic pain, infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and signs of infection should be evaluated by pelvic sonography.

**Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**

Heavy menstrual bleeding is one of the common presentations of structural uterine pathologies like leiomyoma, adenomyosis, and endometrial polyp detected by pelvic sonography. Patients with endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma present with heavy menstrual and postmenopausal bleeding and require ultrasound screening. Intermenstrual bleeding is frequently associated with an endocervical polyp, carcinoma cervix, estrogen-secreting ovarian tumors, and intrauterine devices.

The most common presentation of endometrial carcinoma and hyperplasia in postmenopausal females is postmenopausal bleeding. Screening such females with pelvic sonography followed by endometrial sampling is highly recommended. Senile vaginitis, urethritis, and endocervical polyp are frequent causes of postmenopausal bleeding.

**Abdominal Mass and Pelvic Mass**

Ascites and ovarian malignancy frequently present primarily with complaints of increased abdominal girth, abdominal distension, and/or palpable pelvic mass. Large subserosal broad ligament leiomyoma, multiple uterine leiomyomas, adenomyosis with more than 12-week pregnant uterine size, molar pregnancy, rudimentary horn ectopic pregnancy, hematometra, pyometra, choriocarcinoma, ovarian and tubo ovarian mass present as pelvic mass frequently extending up to abdominal cavity. All these mentioned pelvic pathologies can be screened by pelvic sonography.

**Pelvic Pain and Dysmenorrhea**

Endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian torsion, tubo ovarian mass, adenomyosis, degenerating leiomyoma, ectopic pregnancy, and cystitis are common pathologies presenting with lower abdominal and pelvic pain having an ultrasound diagnosis.

**Infertility,Â Amenorrhea, and Recurrent Pregnancy Loss**

Structural uterine anomalies in the case of the unicornuate uterus, bicornuate uterus, septate uterus, didelphys uterus, and cervical incompetence are associated with causing infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss.
