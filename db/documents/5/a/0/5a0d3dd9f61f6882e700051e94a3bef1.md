The lateral corticospinal tract is affected by a variety of pathologies. This includes strokes, poliomyelitis, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, vitamin B12 deficiency, Friedreich ataxia, and Brown-Sequard syndrome.

**Stroke**

Any ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke affecting an area of the brain that contains the lateral corticospinal tract will cause contralateral weakness of the extremities. When the language area of the dominant hemisphere is involved, the patient will present with aphasia. When the orolingual regions of the cortex are involved, the patient will present with dysarthria. Hemiparesis and aphasia are important disabilities that are often persistent after a stroke, and it is the leading reason for stroke-related disability. Stroke is now the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and the leading cause of disability.

Damage of the upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex leads to secondary axonal loss affecting the lateral corticospinal tract (Wallerian degeneration). Wallerian degeneration of the corticospinal tract can often be visualized in computed tomogram (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (see below).

**Poliomyelitis**

Although almost completely eradicated, poliomyelitis was a prevalent demonstration of damage to the lateral corticospinal tract. Poliovirus is a member of the Picornaviridae family and has a fecal-oral transmission. Once transmitted, it replicates in the oropharynx and small intestine before spreading via the bloodstream to the CNS. In the CNS poliovirus causes the destruction of the cell bodies in the anterior horn of the spinal cord.

**Spinal Muscular Atrophy**

Spinal muscular atrophy, also known as Werdnig-Hoffman disease in infants and Kugelberg-Welander disease in juveniles, is a congenital degeneration of the anterior horns of the spinal cord. Since this disease results in symmetric degeneration of the anterior horns, it results in symmetric weakness with lower motor neuron signs. Infants are characteristically described as "floppy babies" with associated tongue fasciculations. This disease carries an autosomal recessive inheritance with a mutation in the SMN1 gene.

**Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis**

There is a renewed awareness of ALS due to the 2014 social media "ice bucket challenge." Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) can be caused by a defect in superoxide dismutase 1. Commonly known as Lou Gehrig disease, it displays both UMN and LMN deficits. Upper motor neuron deficits may include, dysphagia, dysarthria, spastic gait, and clonus. As a result of damage to the anterior horn of the spinal cord, lower motor neuron signs include weakness (dysphagia), fasciculations, and muscle atrophy. Patients experience such severe dysphagia that a common cause of death is aspiration pneumonia. This disease is classically associated with Stephen Hawking. Riluzole is a pharmaceutical treatment utilized for this condition.

**Vitamin B12 Deficiency**

Deficiency of vitamin B12 most commonly occurs due to malabsorption (Chron's disease, gastric bypass surgery), malnutrition (vegans), pernicious anemia, or rarely due to Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm). Most commonly, it occurs due to malabsorption rather than malnutrition because the human liver has stores of vitamin B12 that may last up to 3 to 5 years. Malabsorption versus malnutrition has historically been distinguished via the Schilling test. Diagnosis of B12 deficiency may be done by labs illustrating an increase in both methylmalonic acid and homocysteine. As homocysteine is also elevated in folate deficiency, it is important to test for methylmalonic acid levels to distinguish the 2. Neurologic manifestations of this condition cause subacute combined degeneration of the cord.

**Friedreich Ataxia**

An autosomal recessive trinucleotide repeat disorder, Friedreich ataxia is due to a GAA repeat on chromosome 9 resulting in a defect in the frataxin gene (iron-binding protein). Defects in the frataxin gene cause impairment in mitochondria.

**Brown-Sequard Syndrome**

Brown-Sequard syndrome is due to a hemisection of the spinal cord. A perfect example of a variety of co-existing deficiencies, it is worth mentioning due to the encompassing involvement of the lateral corticospinal tract. Patients symptoms may include:

- Ipsilateral LMN signs (flaccid paralysis/fasciculations) at the level of the lesion due to damage of lateral corticospinal tracts

- Ipsilateral UMN signs below the level of the lesion (spastic paralysis) due to lateral corticospinal tract damage

- Ipsilateral loss of ALL sensation at the level of the lesion

- Ipsilateral loss of proprioception and vibration below the lesion due to dorsal column damage

- Contralateral loss of pain and temperature below the lesion due to damage to the spinothalamic tract

Clinicians should note that if the lesion occurs above T1, the patient may present with Horner syndrome (miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis) due to damage to the sympathetic chain.
