The specific cause of inflammatory bowel disease is not known. There seems to be a primary genetic component since the most important independent risk factor is a family history of the disease (8% to 14% of patients). A first-degree relative of a patient with ulcerative colitis has a four times higher risk of developing the disease. Additionally, ulcerative colitis has a higher incidence in Jewish populations than other ethnicities.

Although there is little evidence to support this, it has been postulated that alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota and defects in mucosal immunity could lead to ulcerative colitis. Autoimmunity may also play an important role in the etiology of ulcerative colitis.

Some evidence suggests that smoking may be protective but so far no one has been able to confirm a direct relationship between the two.
