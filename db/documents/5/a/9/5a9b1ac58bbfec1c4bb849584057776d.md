Glipizide is a sulfonylurea. It promotes insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells and reduces glucose output from the liver. It also improves insulin sensitivity at peripheral target sites. The extrapancreatic effect of sulfonylureas results from an increase in the deficient number of insulin receptors in the muscle, fat, or liver cells.

The molecular mechanisms of glipizide involve a partial block of the potassium channels in the beta cells of the pancreatic islets. This potassium channel blockade results in cell depolarization, which opens up the voltage-gated calcium channels, causing insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells.

The second-generation sulfonylureas have a more nonpolar side chain; this results in a higher potency hypoglycemic effect.

In comparison with the other sulfonylureas, glipizide has the fastest absorption and onset of action, as well as the shortest half-life and effect-duration. Thus the risk of long-lasting hypoglycemia is minute.

The initial onset effect takes around 30 minutes, and the duration is approximately 12 to 24 hours. 99% of the drug is protein bound. Glipizide undergoes hepatic metabolism and excretion is primarily in the urine with a small percentage in the feces.
