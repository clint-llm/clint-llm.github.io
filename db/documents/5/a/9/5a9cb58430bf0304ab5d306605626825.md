Patients should have counseling regarding the disorder and how to cope with binges. Awareness of binge episodes and knowledge of strategies for self-control help prevent the vicious cycle of binges-guilt-binges. Over-evaluating body shape and weight produce dysfunctional eating and dieting behavior, which causes physiological and psychological vulnerability to episodes of binge eating.

i) Monitor eating patterns and keep a record of each meal, snacks, and trigger of binge episodes

ii) Identify triggers, which include under-eating, ingesting disinhibiting substances, breaking self or clinician created dietary rule system, or becoming dysphoric

iii) Create a pattern of eating with only three to four hours gap between meals. The patient should gradually implement the pattern

iv) Avoid places, activities, and people that trigger binge eating

v) Learn to solve a problem if causing binges by identifying the problem, generating multiple solutions, thinking through each solution, and choosing one problem at a time upon which to act

vi) Recognize food that leads to binge episodes

vii) Identify the single event that leads to episodes

viii) Weigh himself or herself once per week to avoid excessive weight checking or avoidance of weighing at all
