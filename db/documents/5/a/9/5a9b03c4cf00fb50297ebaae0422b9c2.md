The prognosis for patients who undergo cataract surgery is favorable, with an overall 85% success rate defined as 20/40 or better visual acuity.

In a report by La Hey et al., as many as 73% of patients failed maximal medical therapy for glaucoma.

In a retrospective study by Al-Mansour et al., patients diagnosed with FUS showed worsening visual acuity in only 10% of the eyes in the follow-up period after being diagnosed with FUS, with most eyes having improved or unchanged visual acuity.
