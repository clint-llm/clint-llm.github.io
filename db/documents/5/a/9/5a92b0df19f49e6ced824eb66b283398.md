The device stays in a pocket outside of the body close to patients chest, usually in the form of a neck sling or in the patient's vest pocket. So theoretically there aren't any complications, but the surface electrodes can irritate the underlying skin and if left in place can cause skin ulceration, but this rarely ever happens as the device technicians remove them when they take the machine off the patient.
