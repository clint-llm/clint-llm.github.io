Although PTC frequently metastasizes to regional lymph nodes, it still generally carries an excellent prognosis. There are, however, several clinicopathological and background features that can lead to a poor prognosis.

Poor prognostic factors of PTC include:

- Older age at diagnosis

- Large tumor size

- Extra-thyroidal growth

- Male sex

- Less differentiated or solid areas, vascular invasion, and aneuploid cell population

- Subtypes of PTC that are associated with a more aggressive clinical behavior like the tall cell variant, a diffuse sclerosis variant, the solid variant, and the follicular variant
