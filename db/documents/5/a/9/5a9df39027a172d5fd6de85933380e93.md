The management of swan neck deformity requires anÂ interprofessional team. While the primary care provider and nurse practitioner may follow the patient is conservative management is undertaken, patients who undergo surgery need to be followed by a hand or orthopedic surgeon. The outlook for patients with swan neck deformity is guarded. Complete recovery is not possible, and some degree of deformity or limitations in range of motion are common. The key is to enroll the patient in a physical therapy program.
