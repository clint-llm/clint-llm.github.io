# Continuing Education Activity

Medication-overuse headaches (MOH), also known as analgesic rebound headaches, drug-induced headaches, or medication-misuse headaches, are a common neurologic disorder that results in enormous disability and suffering and plays a significant role in the transformation from episodic to chronic headache disorders. These headaches typically develop in patients with established primary headache disorders like migraine or tension-type headaches who overuse medication in an attempt to alleviate the symptoms of their primary headache. An unfortunate cycle of medication overuse results in increased headache frequency, whereby the medication indicated for the treatment of the primary headache becomes the cause of headaches. Patients prone to headaches who take analgesics for other conditions can also develop MOH. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of medication-overuse headaches and highlights the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the medications typically associated with medication-overuse headaches.
- Describe the exam findings typically seen in patients with medication-overuse headaches.
- Explain the management considerations for medication-overuse headaches. 
- Discuss the modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by medication-overuse headaches.

# Introduction

**Medication-overuse headache (MOH)**is a common neurologic disorder with enormous disability and suffering and plays a significant role in the transformation from episodic to chronic headache disorders. Multiple terms have been used to describe MOH, such as analgesic rebound headache, drug-induced headache, or medication-misuse headache. Patients with established primary headache disorders like migraine or tension-type headaches overuse medication for their acute headaches and inadvertently increase the frequency and intensity of their headaches. In this manner, a vicious cycle of further drug consumption and increased headache frequency develops, transforming the treatment for their headache to the actual cause of their disease (MOH). Patients prone to headaches who take analgesics for other conditions can also develop MOH.

Recognition of MOH was as early as in the 1930s when physicians observed prolongation of headaches associated with ergotamine-overuse.evolutive migraine.

# Etiology

Medication overuse headache is classified as a secondary headache or chronic headache syndrome in the latest version of ICHD-3 (2018) under subsection 8.2 as a chronic headache disorder secondary to a pre-existing headache syndrome.

As the name implies, chronic medication overuse is the most significant risk factor for the development of MOH, with each class of analgesics carrying a different risk profile.  The risk from lowest to highest is: triptans/ergotamine, single analgesic agents (NSAIDs, acetaminophen), and combination analgesics containing opiates or barbiturates. There have been observations that combination analgesics, particularly those containing opioids and/or barbiturates, have a two-fold increase in relative risk for MOH.

Some studies suggest that NSAIDs may have a protective effect from MOH in patients with ten headache days or less per month.

# Epidemiology

Medication overuse headache has a true prevalence that is unknown, partly resulting from various changes in diagnostic criteria, but estimates are in the range of 0.5 to 2.6% in the general population. Higher rates have been reported in Russia (7.6%) and Iran (4.6%), places where it is felt that medication overuse is more prevalent.

**Main Risk Factors for MOH with Odds Ratio (OR):**

- Demographic

- Age (less than 50 years)--1.8
- Female--1.9
- Low educational level--1.9

- Self-reported complaints

- Chronic musculoskeletal complaints--1.9
- Gastrointestinal complaints--1.6
- Anxiety or depression--4.7

- Lifestyle

- Smoking--1.8
- Physical inactivity--2.7
- Metabolic syndrome--5.3
- High daily caffeine intake (greater than 540mg versus less than 240mg)--1.4

- Medication

- Tranquilizers--5.2
- Aspirin--0.5
- Ibuprofen--0.7
- Opioids--2.3

Of those patients with MOH, dependency-like behavior presented more often in those who overuse opioids and triptans than aspirin or ibuprofen. MOH can be associated with the substance-related disorder spectrum as it is believed they share common neurobiological pathways.

In general, the following medicines can cause medication overuse headache, listed in highest to lowest incidence:

- Opioids, butalbital-containing combination analgesics, and acetaminophen-aspirin-caffeine combinations

- Triptans

- NSAIDs

- Calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists

# Pathophysiology

The pathophysiology of MOH is not well understood, but studies have demonstrated that central sensitization likely plays a major role.

The thinking is that the insertion/deletion polymorphism in the gene that encodes an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) increases an individual’s susceptibility to MOH. ACE is a key enzyme in regulating blood pressure, but in the brain, it interacts with monoaminergic synaptic transmission, thereby contributing to dependence behavior. ACE polymorphisms seen in MOH patients have been demonstrated to influence sensitization and habituation patterns. Other potential polymorphisms are a brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and serotonin transporter (SERT).

Animal studies have also demonstrated that pain medications alone can cause altered neurotransmitter metabolism, especially serotoninergic and endocannabinoid systems.

# History and Physical

As always, detailed history with particular emphasis on evaluating headaches is essential. Equally important is the detailed medication history and history of substance abuse. To be considered for a diagnosis of MOH, a patient must have a headache for 15 or more days monthly in a patient with an established diagnosis of a headache disorder such as migraine or tension-type. Additionally, they must be utilizing one or more symptomatic medications regularly (10 to 15 days per month, depending on the type of drug consumed) for over three months. The headache characteristics are usually typical for their primary headache types, such as migraine or tension, although they are often more intense and frequent. Evolution towards MOH is substance-specific, occurring faster in those that overuse triptans, opiates, and combination analgesics than those that overuse simple analgesics.

The most common headache diagnoses before the evolution of MOH are migraines (65%), tension-type headaches (27%), and mixed/other headaches (8%).

The central sensitization caused by MOH can lead to skin hypersensitivity and the expansion of their headache. Autonomic and gastrointestinal symptoms such as a runny nose, tearing, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea can accompany their headache. Physical examination is typically nonfocal with no neurologic deficits. A false-positive diagnosis must be excluded by obtaining a detailed history and physical examination, including headache type, frequency, and drug use, to rule out any secondary headache syndromes that may require different management.

# Evaluation

Remember, it is the frequency of a headache and not the quality or intensity that makes the diagnosis of MOH. Unless there are concerning clinical features in the patient's history or physical examination, there are no confirmatory nor necessary laboratory, radiographic or other tests required to diagnose MOH.

**Diagnosis of Medication-overuse Headache (MOH) According to ICHD-3**M**ust Meet Criteria A-C for the Diagnosis of MOH**

- Headache on 15 or more days per month AND a pre-existing headache disorder

- Overuse of acute and/or symptomatic headache drugs for over three months (Regular intake of drugs on greater than or equal to 10 days/month for ergotamines, triptans, opioids, and combination analgesics and on greater than or equal to 15 days per month for acetaminophen, ASA and NSAIDs)

- No better explanation by another ICHD-3 diagnosis

**Medication Overuse Headache by Drug Class****and Duration of Headache**

- Ergotamine-->10 days/month for over 3 months

- Triptan-->10 days/month for over 3 months

- ASA-->15 days/month for over 3 months

- NSAIDs-->15 days/month for >3 months

- Acetaminophen/paracetamol-->15 days/month for over 3 months

- Opioids-->10 days/month for over 3 months

- Combination analgesics-->10 days/month for over 3 months

- Multiple drug classes-->10 days/month for over 3 months

# Treatment / Management

The management approach includes patient education, effective prophylaxis, discontinuation of the overused analgesic, and follow-up to prevent a recurrence.

**Prevention**

MOH is felt to be a preventable disease; therefore, the emphasis should be on educating patients on the importance of appropriate medication administration and the risks not only of its side effects but also the potential development of chronic headaches with excessive medication use is essential.

Specific transitional strategies can be used to help discontinue the overused medication and hence reduce MOH.

**Replacing the overused medication with an alternative symptomatic therapy:**The overused magic medication is stopped,  preventive therapy is started or optimized, and alternative symptomatic medication is used for less than or equal to 2 days a week. This is particularly helpful for patients who have a higher risk of drug toxicity from overused medication than experiencing withdrawal symptoms. This approach is supported by evidence from open-labeled clinical trials.

**Continuing overused medication during initial treatment:**This approach is particularly beneficial for patients who are reluctant to stop the medication and are not at risk of toxicity.

**Using bridge therapy (temporary medication):**A transitional therapy is advised for the patients with severe or frequent headaches and who are more likely to experience headaches while discontinuing the overused medication with start of symptomatic and preventive therapy.

To help minimize a patient's withdrawal symptoms and maximize comfort during this phase several medication therapies have demonstrated usefulness.  Keep in mind that the offending drug should not be an option. Several NSAIDs have been trialed and demonstrated effective such as naproxen, indomethacin, and ketorolac.

The "Raskin protocol" is one such regimen that compared intravenous DHE and metoclopramide every 8 hours versus diazepam in patients with MOH and it demonstrated that DHE was beneficial (89% headache free in 48 hours and 71% at 16 months) during the detoxification phase of MOH, however it should not be utilized in patients with vascular disease.

**Discontinuing the overused medication before starting prophylactic therapy:**And alternative strategy includes stopping the overused medication for two months prior to the start of preventive medication.  However, patients may not tolerate this approach. Therefore,  this route is usually not advised.

**Treatment approach based on discontinuation of the specific offending drug:**

- Discontinuation of the drugs other than opioids, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines:

- Start or optimize preventive therapy
- Switch from overused medication to an alternative medication from a different class. The use of acute medication should be limited don’t know more than two days per week.OR Slowly taper the acute medication as the frequency of headaches decreases in response to preventive therapy. However, for patients who still experience headaches, bridge therapy with a long acting NSAID or steroid should be added.

- Discontinuation of opioids, barbiturates, or benzodiazepines: Drugs are gradually tapered (in 2-4 weeks) if used at higher dosages. However, they may be withdrawn abruptly if lesser dosages are taken.

- Treatment with once a week transdermal clonidine patch (0.1 to 0.2 mg/24 hours) may be advised for one to two weeks to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms.
- Phenobarbital is particularly recommended for patients discontinuing butalbital. A 30 mg of phenobarbital is equivalent to 100 mg of butalbital. Therefore, it corresponds with maximum dose of 90 mg of phenobarbitol with 300 mg of butabital.

# Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of MOH would include any form of chronic daily headache, whether it is a primary or secondary headache diagnosis, including migraine, tension-type headache, cluster headache, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT), hypnic headache, nummular headache, and chronic paroxysmal hemicrania. Always ask patients about a history of head trauma, and if a patient’s history or physical examination causes concern, then appropriate diagnostic testing should be performed to rule out the possibility of a severe medical or neurologic condition. Some differentials that should be under consideration are venous sinus thrombosis, subdural hematoma, carbon monoxide poisoning, brain tumors, hydrocephalus, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

# Prognosis

Overuse of acute therapy can lead to a poor prognosis of chronic headache and lower quality of life by itself.

# Complications

Side effects from the medication, including dependence and toxicity. Use of NSAIDs can cause upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

# Consultations

Patients are initially managed by internists and general physicians. Neurology and or psychiatry consultations can be sought when necessary.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients with MOH will fair better if their comorbidities such as mood disorders, obesity, smoking, or inactivity are also addressed, and continual support is offered in the form of education, patient monitoring, and behavioral therapies. MOH awareness in the general public should be a goal, as a study from 2014 demonstrated that 77% of undergraduate students were not aware of the existence of MOH, and after learning about MOH, 83% of the students felt there should be warnings about MOH on medication bottles and 80% after learning about MOH would reduce analgesic consumption.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

MOH is a common and worldwide problem with a prevalence of 1% in the general population but accounts for approximately 11 to 70% of those with chronic daily headaches. Often under-recognized and unfortunately correlate with a significant negative impact on the patient's quality of life. That opiates and combination analgesics carry an increased risk for MOH needs to be recognized. Among the multiple risk factors for the development of MOH, some are modifiable and require attention and action. Anxiety and depression are common comorbidities, and up to 50% of patients show dependence-type behaviors like tolerance or inability to control pain medication utilization.

Treatment trials are still needed to determine the best evidence-based approach for helping these patients break their vicious headache cycle, but intervention will require patient counseling, detoxification, and prevention therapy. The future needs to include a focus on increased awareness of MOH for the general population and primary prevention strategies for patients and providers.  To achieve treatment success, it is essential that the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, and internist openly communicate with the neurologist when MOH is suspected.
