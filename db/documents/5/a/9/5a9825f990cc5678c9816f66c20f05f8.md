- Any patient with chronic anemia with a rise in basophils for longer than 6 months should be worked up for an underlying cause.

- Patients with basophilia should be worked up for CML or AML when no other systemic infection or possible drug-related cause fits.

- Always rule out drug ingestion and parasitic infection.

- On a peripheral blood smear look for clues of underlying neoplasia (left shifted neutrophilia or circulating blasts).
