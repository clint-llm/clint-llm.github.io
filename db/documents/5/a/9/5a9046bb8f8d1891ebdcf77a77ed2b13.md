Because Zollinger-Ellison syndrome involves gastrinoma, one must evaluate the prognosis-based cancer stage. About 60% to 90% of gastrinomas are malignant with metastasis to the lymph nodes, liver, or distant organs. Fifty percent of pancreatic gastrinomas have a 50% incidence, and 10% of duodenal gastrinomas have a 10% incidence in the liver. Metastasis to the liver directly affects overall survival as pancreatic gastrinomas have lower long-term survival rates than duodenal gastrinomas. The patients with liver metastases have a 15% 10-year survival after the surgery, but those without liver metastases have a 95% 20-year survival which is a significant finding.

On the other hand, duodenal gastrinomas have a higher incidence of lymph node metastases than pancreatic gastrinomas, 70% versus 40%, respectively. However, lymph node involvement did not show a decrease in survival without liver metastases.
