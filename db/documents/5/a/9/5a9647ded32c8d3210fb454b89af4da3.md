The normal menstrual cycle divides into the follicular and luteal phases, with ovulation occurring between phases. The follicular phase begins with menstrual bleeding and ends right before the LH (luteinizing hormone) surge. The luteal phase begins with the LH surge and ends with the onset of menses. A typical cycle lasts approximately 28 days; the luteal phase lasts 14 days, while the follicular phase is more variable in its time course.

Low serum levels of estradiol and progesterone mark the beginning of the follicular phase. The lack of inhibitory feedback allows for an increase in pulsatile GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) levels, leading to elevations in FSH (follicular stimulating hormone) and LH.

When estradiol levels reach a critical level, the negative feedback effect of estradiol on LH becomes a positive feedback effect, resulting in a massive surge in LH concentration (and a smaller surge in FSH levels.)
