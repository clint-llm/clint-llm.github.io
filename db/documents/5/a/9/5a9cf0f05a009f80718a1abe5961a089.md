Cor triatriatum is a rare condition occurring when a child is born with a thin, fibro-muscular membrane subdividing either the left or the right atrium into 3 chambers. The condition is also classified as a congenital heart defect. Cor triatriatum sinister is the most common form. The left atrium divides via an atrial appendage into an upper and a lower chamber. The upper chamber receives blood from the pulmonary veins, while the lower chamber is attached to the left atrial appendage blocking the mitral valve orifice creating a significant left ventricular inflow obstruction. The presence of the left atrial appendage differentiates cor triatriatum from another congenital heart defect, supravalvular mitral stenosis.

Another, rarer form of cor triatriatum is cor triatriatum dextrum. With cor triatriatum dextrum the right valve of the sinus venosus persists dividing right atrium into 2 chambers. This form presents similarly to Ebstein's anomaly and is difficult to differentiate.
