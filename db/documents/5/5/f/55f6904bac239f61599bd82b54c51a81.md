Urethral injuries range from tissue contusions to complete open urethral transections. In the acute phase, local tissue swelling or urethral disruption can cause acute urinary retention. If not addressed, for instance, in an intubated patient, this retention can lead to hydronephrosis, acute kidney injury, or acute renal failure in extreme cases.
