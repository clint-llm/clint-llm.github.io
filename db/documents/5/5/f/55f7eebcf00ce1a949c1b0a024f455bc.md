Familial combined hyperlipidemiaÂ has a broad range of differential diagnoses, as many hereditary and non-genetic etiologies cause increases in serum lipids.

Genetic dyslipidemias include:

- Familial hypercholesterolemia

- Abetalipoproteinemia.

- Hypobetalipoproteinemia.

- Chylomicron retention disease

- Hypertriglyceridemia

FCH may present with more subordinate total serum cholesterol levels and LDL-C than familial hypercholesterolemia.
