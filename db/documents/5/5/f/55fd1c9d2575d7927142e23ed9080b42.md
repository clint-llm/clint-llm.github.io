Patients need to understand the surgery to be performed, and more importantly, the necessity for strict adherence to surgical follow-up processes, particularly physical therapy. Non-surgical cases will also require strict therapeutic adherence. Laxity in performing both scheduled and home therapeutic exercises can lead to lifelong loss of function. Expectations also need to be set depending on the patient's age, level of conditioning pre-injury, and both work and daily activities. With successful surgery and patient commitment to postsurgical care, the patient can achieve a good outcome.
