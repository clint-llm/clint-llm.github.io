Corneal endothelial pigment dispositions in PDS/PG are referred to as Krukenberg spindles. It has been shown in histological studies that the vertical pigmented pattern on the cornea is made up of melanin granules phagocytosed as opposed to simple deposits on the endothelium.

Pigment dispersion also reaches TM, which shows full circumference homogenous and increased pigmentation with gonioscopy. Histology studies have reported that pigment granules can also be phagocytosed by endothelial cells of the TM.

The overload and burden of pigment in these cells can lead to cell necrosis, apoptosis, anatomic alterations, and poor aqueous outflow mechanisms, which can explain the increases in IOP that can lead to compression and disfunction of axons in glaucomatous optic neuropathy.
