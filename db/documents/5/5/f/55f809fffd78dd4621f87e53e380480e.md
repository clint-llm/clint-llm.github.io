Leucovorin administration is by oral, intramuscular, or intravenous routes. Intravenous dosing is preferable in the presence of vomiting or malabsorption.

In the setting of methotrexate toxicity, intravenous dosing is preferred and should start immediately. Methotrexate becomes increasingly polyglutamated; the longer it stays in the cell, the polyglutamated methotrexate stays in the nucleus and is less susceptible to reversal with leucovorin.

When used as a part of chemotherapeutic regimens, leucovorin is not administered along with methotrexate. It is usually administered 24 hours after a course of methotrexate. Tissue toxicity may be permanent if leucovorin therapy gets delayed beyond 40 hours. It is not uncommon for methotrexate to be administered intrathecally, for example, in the presence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Leucovorin rescue must not be administered intrathecally and may be fatal if administered by this route.

Leucovorin enhances the binding of 5-fluorouracil, and when administering both together, a lower dosage of 5-fluorouracil is necessary. Leucovorin administration usually takes place in the middle of or after the dose of the fluorouracil regimen.
