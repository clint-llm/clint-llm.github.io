Monitoring for this drug should be done primarily by evaluating the patient to see if the therapy results in the desired effect and if there is a clinical improvement from the patient's baseline. Using assessments to assess a patient's cognition can see the patient's progression throughout the treatment. Clinical staff members should all be on the lookout for adverse reactions that can warrant discontinuation or alteration of the route of administration of the drug.

Side effects like gastrointestinal disturbances can warrant a switch to the transdermal form of the drug. Cutaneous side effects also warrant prompt evaluation. Clinical staff members should be aware of the difference between a contact dermatitis reaction and an allergic reaction to the transdermal patch. Contact dermatitis occurs in the spot where the patch was placed and usually resolves. A true allergic reaction to the patch will present as the typical contact dermatitis symptoms in addition to erythema past the boundaries of the patch, as well as the presence of vesicles and/or edema.
