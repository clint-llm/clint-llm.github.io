Many physiologic characteristics determine the degree of damage that alkali ingestion may cause.Â  These properties include the pH of the material, the duration of time in which the substance is in contact with the surface, the amount or volume ingested, as well as the amount of acid required to neutralize the substance.

The pH of the substance determines the type of damage in a caustic ingestion. Acids or substances with very low pH values cause coagulative necrosis resulting in an eschar formation. Alkalis or substances with high pH values will cause liquefactive necrosis. Alkalis with a pH above 11 tend to cause more significant injury. While the pH, concentration, and duration of contact with human tissue influence the extent of damage directly to GI tissue, irritation of the pulmonary tract may also occur. When a caustic agent mixes with other contents in the stomach, chlorine gas forms.
