There are several means of managing vestibular schwannomas. Small asymptomatic schwannomas may be observed. Surgical resection and radiotherapy may be used for progressive and/or symptomatic lesions. However, the ability to preserve hearing varies by treatment technique as well as the size of the tumor. Baseline audiometry and an MRI of the brain should be obtained regardless of the management strategy.

**Observation**

Vestibular schwannomas have an average growth rate of 1.4mm/year.****There is a lack of prospective data regarding the best approach. Large retrospective analysis suggests that tumor control with observation alone is 65%, and serviceable hearing is 71% at two years. It should be emphasized that neither surgical resection nor radiation restore lost hearing and carries the risk of further neurological dysfunction. Observation may be considered in patients with small tumors <1.5 cm, patients with multiple medical comorbidities, no growth, and stable symptoms.
