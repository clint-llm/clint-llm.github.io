Hypersensitivity to phenytoin or other hydantoins is a contraindication for using phenytoin. Pregnancy is another absolute contraindication for phenytoin use.

Hanson et al. reported a prevalence of fetal hydantoin syndrome (FHS) of 11% in pregnant women receiving treatment for epilepsy with phenytoin, with an additional 30% of the in utero-exposed children expressing some of the syndrome’s features such as epicanthic folds, hypertelorism, broad flat nasal bridges, an upturned nasal tip, wide prominent lips and, also, distal digital hypoplasia, intrauterine growth retardation, and diminished mental capacity.
