Common physical exam findings include erythema of the of the arm, inability to lift the arm due to pain, and holding onto the elbow of the injured arm for support. During the physical exam, neurovascular status pre- and postreduction is critical to identify any iatrogenic injury to neurovascular structures.Â In some instances, fracture reduction is necessary and is typically assisted by the influence of gravity with the arm in the anatomic position.
