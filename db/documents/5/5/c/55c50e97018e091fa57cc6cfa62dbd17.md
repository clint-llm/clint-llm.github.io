**Acute**

Acute beryllium exposure, typically via inhalation, can cause a diffuse inflammatory response involving the upper and lower airway. Acute beryllium disease is similar to other cases of chemical pneumonitis, and symptoms depend on the compound's solubility.

**Chronic**

Chronic beryllium disease (CBD), or berylliosis, is a granulomatous lung disease that results from beryllium exposure and sensitization and is due to an antigen-specific, cell-mediated immune response.

It is clinically indistinguishable from sarcoidosis and causes noncaseating granulomas in lung tissue and thoracic lymph nodes.****Chronic beryllium disease can remain stable for many years but rarely progresses into pulmonary fibrosis and is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.
