Teratoma, a histologic subtype of nonseminoma that represents terminally differentiated somatic tissue, is chemotherapy-resistant. When in the pure form, it is not associated with tumor marker production or FDG-avidity.However, about two-thirds of NSGCTs[including pure testicular teratomas]may present with advanced metastatic disease. This is generally due to the so-called "burnt out testicular NSGCT" and can present with elevated tumor markers and viable GCT (embryonal cell carcinoma or yolk sac tumor) in metastatic lesions. The patients would be managed initially with chemotherapy as per IGCCCG risk stratification followed by post-chemo RPLND. The final retroperitoneal specimen usually reveals fibrosis (44%) or teratoma (50%), or viable GCT (6%). The clinician might also encounter a poor response to induction chemotherapy in advanced NSGCT cases if teratomatous elements are present in the orchiectomy specimen.
