There are no known direct causes of ocular melanoma, though incidence is highest among people with lighter skin and blue eyes. Uveal melanoma affects about 6 to 8 persons per million each year in the western world. Less than 2% of patients show evidence of metastasis at presentation; over 40% of patients will die from widespread disease.
