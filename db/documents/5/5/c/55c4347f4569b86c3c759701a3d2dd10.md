Mitomycin administration is via the intravenous and intravesical routes. Subcutaneous or intramuscular administration is not advised or recommended. Close monitoring during intravenous infusions is advised due to the high likelihood of extravasation. Signs of extravasation include poor blood return, pain, and swelling.

Extreme caution is necessary to prevent extravasation as the drug is known to cause irritation, skin ulceration, and cellulitis. Given the cytotoxic nature of mitomycin, precautions and procedures for handling, reconstitution, and disposal require strict adherence. It can be diluted up to a concentration of 40 micrograms per milliliter at room temperature in 5% dextrose, 0.9% sodium chloride, or sodium lactate injection. These solutions are stable and should be used within 4 hours, 48 hours, or 24 hours, respectively.
