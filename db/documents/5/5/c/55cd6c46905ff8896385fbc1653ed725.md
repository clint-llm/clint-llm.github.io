The auditory system processes how we hear and understand sounds within the environment. It is made up of both peripheral structures (e.g., outer, middle, and inner ear) and brain regions (cochlear nuclei, superior olivary nuclei, lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate nuclei, and auditory cortex). Auditory brain circuits encode frequency, attenuation, location in space. Some circuits also process combinations of these properties to help individuals understand and correctly interpret sounds. Processing of auditory informationÂ changes continuously by descending feedback circuits based on altered environmental, attentional, and perceived importance of environmental cues. The following chapter provides a basic description of audition and auditory processing.
