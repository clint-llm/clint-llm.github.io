Patients with DTs or other severe withdrawal symptoms may require admission to the intensive care unit due to the risk of mortality.

Patients with chronic alcoholism or intravenous drug use should be evaluated for inpatient and outpatient treatment programs. Treatment programs are only successful if the patient is motivated. Often individuals dependent on opiates should be started on methadone or buprenorphine.

- Methadone, a long-acting opiate that prevents somatic withdrawal symptoms but does not cause euphoria equivalent to heroin, may be prescribed.

- Buprenorphine is a Mu-opioid agonist/antagonist prescribed similarly to methadone.

Psychiatric evaluation is strongly recommended to rule out mental health concerns such as suicidal ideation, major depression, and poly-substance abuse.
