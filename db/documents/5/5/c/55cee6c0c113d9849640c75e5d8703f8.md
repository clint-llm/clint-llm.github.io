A contemporary joint research statement of the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) proposed criteria for interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) as an opening move in a trial to uniformly describe and categorize a subset of patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia that exhibit evidence of autoimmunity without meeting criteria for a defined connective tissue disease.

The aforementioned joint consensus opinion was made possible via an international expert panel of thirteen pulmonologists, four rheumatologists, one thoracic radiologist, and one pulmonary pathologist.
