The World Bleeding Disorder Registry (WBDR) comprises a record of patients with bleeding disorders who receive care through the Hemophilia Treatment Centers throughout the world who have voluntarily allowed their identities and private healthcare information to be entered into a web-based platform. This global data collection aids the advancement of understanding the disease through evidence-based advocacy initiatives.  The WBDR is the only global registry of people with bleeding disorders around the world. The accessibility of the information collected in this database strengthens the ability to diagnose and treat people with hemophilia.

The management and treatment of bleeding disorders require the collaborative efforts of an interprofessional health team that includes physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all working and communicating across disciplines to bring about the most effective treatment and outcomes.
