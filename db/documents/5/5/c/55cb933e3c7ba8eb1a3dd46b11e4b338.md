The basic functioning of phacoemulsification depends on the irrigation and aspiration system.

**Irrigation**

Constant irrigation is an essential process in phacoemulsification by which fluid is passed through the sleeve of the phaco tip with minimal passage through the main incision; this helps maintain constant fluid dynamics inside the chamber. Coaxial irrigation helps cool down the ultrasound tip, minimize heat generation, and prevent tissue damage. Irrigation also helps to maintain a stable anterior chamber. The intraocular pressure and depth of the anterior chamber can be modified by changing the bottle height. Gravity plays a vital role in proving the force essential to maintain or increase irrigation. In some phaco machines, the irrigation pressure is supported by a collapsible saline bag. These bags are compressed with pressure plates, which help maintain a stable anterior chamber. Additionally, mydriatics can be instilled in the irrigation bottle to maintain pupillary dilatation during surgery.

**Aspiration**

A thorough understanding of the aspiration system of a phaco machine plays a crucial role in improving the performance of surgeons' phacoemulsification. It is vital for performing various maneuvers during the surgery. Aspiration flow rate is when the nuclear or cortical matter is attracted towards the phaco tip. The surgeon should use the active fluidics inside the chamber to improve the efficiency of the surgery and the machine without damaging the adjacent tissue like the iris and capsule. Vacuum is a process that determines how tightly the nuclear or cortical matter is held in the aspiration port.

**Aspiration Pumps**

**Peristaltic Pumps (Flow-Based)**

It employs flexible tubing mounted on a set of rollers that help push the fluid through the machine. The pressure difference is between the high-pressure chamber and low-pressure tubing build-up vacuum at the aspiration port of the ultrasound tip. The aspiration flow rate can also be linearly controlled by pressing the foot pedal to position 2, which increases the rollers' speed. A high AFR will result in nuclear pieces being attracted to phaco tip more readily. To prevent the collapse of the anterior chamber while surgery, the bottle height can be increased, and AFR can be reduced. The peristaltic flow system doesn't directly control the level of vacuum. Instead, the vacuum is dependent on AFR.

The vacuum is built by the resistance in the fluid circuit. When the tip is occluded by the nuclear material, in the absence of occlusion of the aspiration port, a high AFR will cause more nuclear material to be attracted to the port quickly. The vacuum rise time is defined as the time needed to achieve a particular vacuum level. A higher AFR will result in a faster vacuum rise time during occlusion. Modern phaco machines with peristaltic pumps do not have linear control of vacuum.

**Vacuum Pumps (Venturi Based)**

The advantage of a vacuum pump is that it directly controls the vacuum level in the aspiration tubing by indirectly controlling the AFR. The pump work on the principle of the venturi effect, which creates a vacuum proportional to the rate of flow of gases. The AFR is built up the resistance of the fluid circuit. Hence, a higher vacuum will produce a higher AFR, rapidly attracting nuclear material to the port even in occlusion. The vacuum can be linearly controlled in the venturi pump by depressing the foot pedal to position 2.

The following terminologies will help to understand pharmacodynamics in detail.

**Aspiration Flow Rate**

Aspiration flow rate is the fluid and lenticular material removal rate from the eye after passing through the tubing. AFR is quantified in mL/min. AFR occurs when the foot pedal is depressed from position 2 to 3. AFR determines how rapidly the lens fragments are attracted towards the aspiration port.

**Aspiration Port**

This is an opening in front of the phaco probe, which helps remove saline and lenticular material from the eye.****

**Compliance**

Compliance determines how easily the tubings can be deformed with the help of a vacuum. High compliance has the property that it collapses more readily with vacuum than low compliance tubing, leading to excessive surge when the occlusion is broken.

**Followability**

It determines how rapidly the lens material or fragments are attracted towards the aspiration port. Followability is dependent on AFR and can be made better by increasing the AFR and vacuum. It can be of two types- distal and proximal. Distal followability is the attraction of fragments towards the aspiration port, and proximal is how the port holds fragments.

**Infusion Pressure**

It is the fluid pressure inside the tubings. It is dependent on bottle height (gravity-dependent) or intraocular pressure.

**Irrigation**

It is the amount of fluid that is being influxed inside the eye, and it is governed by infusion pressure.

**Occlusion**

It means blockage of the aspiration tubing or port that results in the vacuum build-up. The occlusion is broken when the lens matter is dislodged from the tubing or when the vacuum reaches the machine's pre-set value.

**Rise Time**

It is time for the vacuum to rise once the aspiration port is occluded.

**Post-occlusion Surge**

This phenomenon occurs when the occlusion is broken, and fluid moves from the anterior chamber (high-pressure zone) to aspiration tubing (low pressure). Surge can also lead to anterior chamber collapse and cause the iris and posterior capsule to be aspirated towards the port. It can be prevented by increasing fluid influx, alleviating vacuum, small diameter coiled tubing, and occlusion mode software.

**Vacuum**

It is the amount of opposing suction force created in the tubing. It is measured in mmHg and is a determinant of how tightly the material will be held to the aspiration port.

The following terminologies will help to understand ultrasound technology.

**Cavitation**

It means the formation of gas bubbles in the anterior chamber secondary to pressure changes at the phaco tip. The contraction and expansion of bubbles cause heat generation at the phaco tip causing emulsification of lens matter. Transient cavitation is better than continuous cavitation, which intermittent phaco energy delivery.

**Chatter**

It is the repulsion of nuclear fragments at the phaco tip until the vacuum again reaches a level to neutralize the repulsive energy. Once the chatter is over, the vacuum similarly holds the nuclear material. A reduction in phaco power reduces the chatter.

**Duty Cycle**

It is the ratio of power-on time to total time. Energy is calculated as power multiplied by time. Hence, energy depends on two components and can be varied by altering the time or the power.

**Frequency**

It is the speed of movement of the phaco needle to and fro. The phaco ultrasound frequency is more than 20,000. The handpiece frequency is approximately 27000 to 60000 Hz.

**Power**

This is the ability of the phaco needle to vibrate and break down the lenticular material. Power is dependent on stroke length, and it is the linear percentage of stroke length of the phaco needle. Power is produced in position 3 of the foot pedal.

**Stroke Length**

It is the distance traveled by the phaco tip to cavitate the lens material. The normal stroke length is 0.05 to 0.10 mm (0.002 to 0.004).
