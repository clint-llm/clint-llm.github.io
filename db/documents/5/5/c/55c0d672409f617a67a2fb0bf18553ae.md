The exact etiology of vitiligo is unknown. It is frequently associated with multiple autoimmune diseases. There are various theories about its pathogenesis and the etiology is multifactorial. It is characterized by incomplete penetrance, genetic heterogeneity, and multiple susceptibility loci. Family and other twin studies have shown that inheritance is complex and also involves both environmental and genetic factors. Additionally, it is hypothesized that genetic factors can influence the age of onset of vitiligo. The inheritance of vitiligo may also include genes associated with the biosynthesis of melanin, regulation of autoantibodies, and response to oxidative stress.

Recent research studies have not highlighted any associations with any certain HLA type. There is a strong reason to believe that segmental and nonsegmental vitiligo have a unique genetic mechanism, which can account for variable treatment responses.
