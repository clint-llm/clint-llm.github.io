A transtentorial herniation is the movement of brain tissue from one intracranial compartment to another. This includes uncal, central, and upward herniation. These are life-threatening and time-critical pathologies that may be reversible with emergent surgical intervention and medical management. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of transtentorial herniation syndromes and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of transtentorial herniation and its causes.
- Summarize the evaluation of transtentorial herniation.
- Outline the management options available for transtentorial herniation.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis and management of transtentorial herniation and improve outcomes.
