Injury to the extensor tendon is the chief etiology for this flexion deformity of the PIP joint. The extensor tendon is disrupted and the lateral aspects of the tendon separate. The head of the proximal phalanx subsequently projects through the disrupted tendon elements. This deformity obtained its name presumably due to its appearance to a buttonhole on surgical exploration.
