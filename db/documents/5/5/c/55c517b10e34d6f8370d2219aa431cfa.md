Physiological and anatomical variants exist in the general population, and some can impair swallowing, while others do not affect the process at all. A congenital cleft lip and/or palate poses an issue early on in life and can impair the childâ€™s ability to produce a good seal for suckling, as well as impairing velopharyngeal closure which allows the potential for regurgitation into the nasopharynx. Abnormal development of dentition and parts of the oral cavity can make mastication much more difficult for these select patients, and thus swallowing is impaired because the food bolus cannot be effectively broken down. A tracheoesophageal fistula is a condition that can present in many different anatomical variations and can severely disrupt the outcome of what would be normal swallowing if found to be present at birth. Most of these require surgical interventions to correct their defect.
