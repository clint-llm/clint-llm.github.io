Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed a connection between genes encoding oxidase subunits with autoimmune and auto-inflammatory disorders. Variations of the NCF2 encoding p67phox and NCF4 encoding p40phox have been associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Crohn’s disease.

A substantial fraction of patients with CGD experiences a form of inflammatory disease that greatly resembles inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially Crohn's disease. Symptoms can range from mild to bloody diarrhea and malabsorption. Some patients also describe other chronic inflammatory symptoms, including non-infectious arthritis, gingivitis, chorioretinitis or uveitis, glomerulonephritis, and rarely white matter lesions in the brain. The CGD genotype seems to accentuate the standard genetic risk associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Granulomata in CGD colitis have sharply defined histiocyte aggregates with surrounding lymphocytic inflammation, unlike the poorly formed granulomata often seen in Crohn's disease. When staining for macrophage marker, CD68, CGD bowel disease had significantly lower levels than typical Crohn’s disease. While patients with CGD granulomatous colitis respond well to tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibition, such as infliximab, they often have significant infectious complications, sometimes fatal, than typical patients with Crohn's disease. Clinically it is important to note the relationship between Crohn's disease and CGD since this can affect patient diagnosis, morbidity, and treatment options.

There have also been reports of an association of discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) with female X-linked CGD carriers. It is believed that autoantibodies are formed from recurrent antigenic stimulation. Affected women can either have normal or impaired oxidative activity due to lyonization. Typically 15% to 20% of normal oxidase activity is enough to handle infections. However, females with less than 20% of normal oxidase activity can present with a severe CGD phenotype. Common findings include photosensitive skin rashes, oral ulcers, and joint pain. IBD has also been described in women with skewed X-inactivation. Their cutaneous lesions closely resemble discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), even though serologic markers for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are often negative. Female carriers with skin lesions and chronic diarrhea reportedly had a lower neutrophil respiratory oxidative burst than unaffected carriers. It is recommended that females with DLE who have experienced recurrent infections, especially suppurative, or have a family history of early childhood deaths be screened for CGD using the nitroblue tetrazolium test. However, even though immune-compromised, immunosuppressive drugs such as prednisone are often necessary for these autoimmune conditions in patients with CGD. Further studies are necessary to define the roles of X inactivation in the pathology of autoimmune and inflammatory manifestations in CGD carriers since the degree of lyonization can change over time.
