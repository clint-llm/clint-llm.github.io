Except for thyroid storm, hyperthyroidism in itself is rarely life-threatening but can pose a significant burden on a patient’s day-to-day routine. Inpatient management of a patient with hyperthyroidism does not always necessarily require consultation with an endocrinologist, but the presence of thyroid storm may warrant consultation with an endocrinologist and possible admission to the intensive care unit due to potentially life-threatening complications such as tachycardia and hypertensive crisis. Nurses involved with patient care should be vigilant about the signs and symptoms of thyroid storm.

As mentioned previously, any consideration of RAI therapy in a female of reproductive potential should follow a negative beta-hCG, as pregnancy is an absolute contraindication to RAI therapy. Incorporating a mandatory pregnancy test as part of an overall care plan would help avoid potentially damaging radiation exposure.
