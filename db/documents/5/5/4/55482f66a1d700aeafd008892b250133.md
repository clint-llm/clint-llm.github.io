The etiology of hidradenitis suppurativa appears to have genetic, environmental, and behavioral influences.

Thirty-three to 40% of individuals with hidradenitis suppurativa report an affected first-degree relative, suggesting a hereditary component with an autosomal dominant transmission pattern. In a small subset of affected families, researchers have identified a mutation of the gamma-secretase Notch signaling pathway.

Environmental and behavioral factors also contribute. Individuals with HS are more commonly overweight or obese. Obesity leads to greater intertriginous surface area and skin friction, increased sweat production and retention, and hormonal changes leading to relative androgen excess, all associated with HS. Metabolic syndrome is more common in obese individuals and thus is also seen more commonly in HS.

Smoking is also prevalent among those diagnosed with HS. Causation is unclear; however, nicotine may cause increased follicular plugging. As with obesity, disease progression and severity are worse in those who smoke.

The influence of hormones can be seen in HS. There is a greater prevalence in females than males, with the age of primary occurrence most commonly between puberty and menopause. In addition, there are fluctuations of acute symptomatic episodes and severity with menstrual cycles and exogenous hormones.
