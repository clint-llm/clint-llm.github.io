Surgery is the treatment of choice for lesions of the breast, ranging from lumpectomy to radical mastectomy. As mentioned earlier, malignancy of the breast metastasizes through lymphatics. Hence, the knowledge of lymphatic drainage of the mammary gland is essential for surgeons. Accordingly, all the lymph nodes draining the breasts can be identified and removed during surgical removal of malignant tumors from the breast through radical mastectomy surgeries.

In malignancy, recurrence is quite frequent, and hence adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary to reduce local recurrence. Patients with a higher risk of recurrence also receive adjuvant chemotherapy, which gives the patients a longer disease-free overall survival period. Hormonal therapy is useful in certain conditions where tumors are estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive. Estrogen positive patients who receive adjuvant hormonal therapy with tamoxifen have demonstrated to do very well after treatment.

With a global increase in breast carcinoma, there is a surge in surgical mastectomy, with a concurrent increase in the demand for surgical reconstructions of the breast, breast implants, and mammaplasty.
