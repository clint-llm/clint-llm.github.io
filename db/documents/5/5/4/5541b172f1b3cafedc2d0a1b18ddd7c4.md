Postoperative epilepsy:

- It is caused by local cortical dysfunction secondary to parenchymal transgression during the surgical approach to the ventricle.

If the tumor is approached via dominant parietal lobe:

- Gerstmann syndrome (inferior parietal lobule)

- Agraphia

- Acalculia

- Finger agnosia

- Left to right confusion

If the tumor is approached via non-dominant parietal lobe:

- Alexia without agraphia

Contralateral homonymous hemianopsia or quadrantanopia:

- It is caused by damage to the optic radiations, located on the lateral ventricle's floor and roof.

Additional complications include:

- Intracerebral hemorrhage

- Vascular injury and stroke

- Hydrocephalus

- Pulmonary embolism

- Surgical infection

- Coma

- Death
