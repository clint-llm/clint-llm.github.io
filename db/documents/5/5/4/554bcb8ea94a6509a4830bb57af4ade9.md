Holoprosencephaly (HPE) results from an incomplete midline cleavage of the forebrain (prosencephalon) and includes a wide spectrum of intracranial and craniofacial midline defects, along with a myriad of clinical manifestations, which consist of neurologic impairment and dysmorphism of the brain and face. Evidence suggests that holoprosencephaly can be present either sporadically or have a syndromic association. The defect associated with holoprosencephaly occurs at around two to three weeks after conception and is a disorder of gastrulation.
