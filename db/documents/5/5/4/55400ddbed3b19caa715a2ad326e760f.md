The scleredema of Buschke Type 1 has an abrupt onset. The occurrence of febrile illness in the past 2 to 3 weeks should guide the diagnosis. In contrast, type 2 and 3 have a progressive course and diagnosis delays in most cases for several years. Transient erythema or annular rash may precede skin induration. The scleredema may cause pruritus and less commonly, pain. Patients usually complain about the limited motion of the shoulders and the temporomandibular joint with difficulty of mastication.

Physical examination shows a poorly-defined woody and non-pitting induration of the skin, with inconstant overlying erythema or hyperpigmentation. It first involves the neck and then spreads to the shoulders, the upper trunk, and the arms symmetrically. It can reach the face, and rarely the buttocks and thighs. Interestingly, the swelling spares the hands and feet. The affected skin has a ‘peau d’orange’ appearance when pinched.

Extra-cutaneous involvement is exceptional, especially in types 2 and 3 scleredema. It affects mostly the tongue and the heart, but also the lungs, skeletal muscles, esophagus, parotid glands, liver, spleen, pleurae, and eyes. Complications include restricted motility, dysphagia, sicca syndrome, pleural or pericardial or peritoneal effusions. Symptoms of malignancies or complicated diabetes require careful vigilance.
