The American Cardiology Association/American Heart Association revised the previous JNC8 recommendations and released updated 2017 guidelines, classifying blood pressure into one of four categories: normal, elevated, stage 1 hypertension, or stage 2 hypertension.

- Normal blood pressure is defined as blood pressure as a systolic blood pressure under 120 mm Hg and a diastolic pressure less than 80mm Hg

- Elevated blood pressure occurs when systolic pressure ranges from 120-129mmHg with a diastolic pressure less than 80mm Hg

- Stage 1 hypertension is defined as systolic pressure ranges from 130-139mmHg or diastolic blood pressure between 80-89mmHg

- Stage 2 Hypertension has a systolic blood pressure greater than 140mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of 90mmHg or higher

The treatment of hypertension involves the use of antihypertensive medications:

- Thiazide diuretics especially chlorthalidone are the first line for hypertension - diuretics are necessary for patients with resistant hypertensive disease

- Angiotensin-convertingÂ enzyme inhibitors/ angiotensin receptor blockers are the first line for hypertension especially in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease

- Calcium channel blockers are the first line for hypertension

- Beta-blockers are not currently a recommendation for use in isolated hypertension - they are first-line for use in heart failure, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation

- Vasodilators such as hydralazine are not first-line and should only be added when a third or fourth medication is needed for difficult to control hypertension or when contraindications exist for first-line medications

Typically two or more antihypertensives for adequate control especially in patients with stage 2 hypertension. Patients with stage 2 hypertension should be started on two antihypertensives then reassessed within thirty days for a response to therapy. Two medications from the same class should not be used, such as the use of both an ACEI and ARB. As per JNC 8 guidelines.

Heart failure management should be as per goal-directed medical therapy.
