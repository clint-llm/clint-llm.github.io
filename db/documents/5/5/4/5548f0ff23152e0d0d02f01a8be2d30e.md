Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are acute, rare, and potentially fatal skin reactions involving loss of skin and, in some cases, mucosal membranes accompanied by systemic symptoms. Medications are causative in over 80 percent of cases. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are distinguished based on the extent of the detached skin surface area. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and of toxic epidermal necrolysis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing those with these conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the difference between Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. 
- Summarize differential diagnoses of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and of toxic epidermal necrolysis. 
- Review the treatment options for Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. 
- Explain the role of interprofessional team members in optimizing collaboration and communication to ensure patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis receive high-quality care, which will lead to enhanced outcomes.
