Capsule endoscopy is an important means of evaluating the gastrointestinal tract when traditional endoscopic techniques have failed. It is safe, painless, has no risk for infection and does not require sedation. It has a higher diagnostic yield than many other modalities for evaluating the intestinal lumen and can localize lesions. The shortcomings of capsule endoscopy are its lack of therapeutic capabilities. Its high diagnostic yield and low complication rate make it an appealing choice for evaluation of the intestinal lumen when indicated despite the inability to obtain tissue samples and provide therapy.

The cost-effectiveness of this study still remains to be determined. In an era where healthcare costs are increasing and patients forced to make large copayments, the decision to offer a patient this study should be done with thought.[15][16]

Overall, there is a lack of good clinical data on the benefits of capsule endoscopy. The yield in patients with bleeding depends on whether the patient is having an overt or occult bleed. In the latter cases, its effectiveness appears to be low. Further, some studies have shown that the technique may miss lesions in the small bowel. Capsule endoscopy is likely best used in combination with other imaging techniques and should not be the first diagnostic test to assess bleeding.[17][18][19]
