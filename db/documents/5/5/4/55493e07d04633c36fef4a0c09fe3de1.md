The mainstay for evaluation for pulmonary restriction is based on pulmonary function tests (PFTs). Initial results indicative of pulmonary restriction will be a decreased TLC with a preserved FEV1/FVC ratio (greater than 70%). Once restrictive, a restrictive pattern is suggested on spirometry; patients should be referred for full PFTs with DLCO measurement, which will be decreased on patients with intrinsic pulmonary restriction.

In the IPF, the high-resolution computerized tomography (HRTC) demonstrates the typical appearance with coarse crosslinking in the basal regions, posterior in the early stages, peripheral/sub-pleural. "Honeycomb" cystic alterations and bronchiectasis that become evident for traction fibrotic.

A special type among the ILDs is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Guidelines from the ATS suggests considering adult patients with newly detected bilateral fibrosis on a chest radiograph or chest CT, bibasilar inspiratory crackles, and an age typically older than 60 years of an unknown cause, to be clinically suspected for having IPF.
