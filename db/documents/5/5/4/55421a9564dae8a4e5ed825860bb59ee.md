Prognosis of strabismus is excellent if detected and managed early in life. Healthy neonates sometimes show intermittent deviation of the eyes, which should not be a concern. At about three months, normal binocular coordination sets in, and any strabismus persistent after this period should be considered abnormal and significant. Amblyopia sets in if the strabismus is not appropriately managed before 6-8 years leading to a permanent decrease in the vision. It is extremely important to know the indications for ophthalmologist referral.

Indications for ophthalmologist referral

- Altered pupillary reflex or leukocoria

- Constant esotropia

- Incomitant strabismus

- Persistent esotropia at four months of age
