The long-term outcomes of TTF are still not available, but the initial results have shown promise. TTF has been FDA approved for use in recurrent glioblastoma, and ongoing trials may establish its role in not only primary glioblastoma but other malignancies like pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and mesothelioma. It may also play a role in modulating the effect of currently accepted treatment modalities like chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy. The fine-tuning of physical parameters involved in TTF with further research on TTF dosimetry is likely to enhance the impact of this novel modality in cancer therapeutics.
