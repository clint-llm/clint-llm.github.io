Most small bowel cancers have similar clinical presentations except for neuroendocrine tumors, which can present with symptoms specific to the products secreted from the neurosecretory granules contained within the malignant cells. Nonspecific mid abdominal pain, unexplained weight loss, and gastrointestinal bleeding are three of the most common clinical symptoms. The abdominal pain is generally described as intermittent and crampy, with a small percentage of cases associated with nausea and vomiting. Larger neoplastic lesions can present with more severe conditions such as acute small bowel obstruction or perforation, with obstruction presenting more commonly than perforation.

Neuroendocrine tumors that have metastasized to the liver can present with a constellation of symptoms due to the secretion of bioactive products from the primary tumor. Therefore, the workup of such lesions includes testing biomarkers to confirm the etiology of the patientâ€™s nonspecific symptoms. The most common symptoms associated with carcinoid syndrome include cutaneous flushing, diarrhea (which carries a broad differential diagnosis), and less common symptoms such as venous telangiectasias and recurrent respiratory symptoms due to bronchospasms.
