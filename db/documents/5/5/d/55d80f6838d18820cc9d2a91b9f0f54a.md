Hemophilia, an x-linked heredity disorder, is diagnosed by an abnormal concentration of Factor VIII or IX.  Approximately one-third of cases arise from a spontaneous mutation.   Von Willebrand disease, with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, has variable penetrance and clinical symptoms can vary from person to person.  The most severe pathology occurs in homozygotes.
