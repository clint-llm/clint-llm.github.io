Both PMCA and SERCA are P-type ATPases. All P-type ATPases exhibit a similar structure and mechanism of action. Both of these pumps use the energy derived from ATP to pump calcium against their concentration gradients.)

VGCCs are located on the plasma membrane and open in response to a change in voltage across the plasma membrane. Currently, there are ten known subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels, each with a different molecular structure and variations in subunit composition.

The a1 subunit contains the channel gate, which controls ion flow, the voltage sensor which controls channel activation, and the ion-conducting pore for calcium ions to flow through.

L-Type VGCCs are found in both excitable and non-excitable cells and are present throughout the body.****family of a1 subunits. They are distinguished by their voltages of activation, which occur at negative membrane potential.****Cav2.2 subtype.****Cav2.3 a1 subunit.

Most subtypes of voltage-gated calcium channels contain some combination of auxiliary subunits, principally the beta and A2sd subunits. All of the subunits take part in modifying channel gating, assembly, and insertion of the channels into the plasma membrane, among other functions.

The beta subunit can be found in both the Cav1 (L-type) and Cav2 (P/Q, N, and R-type) families of voltage-gated calcium channels.

IP3 channels are consist of four subunits that make up a tetrameric channel embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum.

The ryanodine receptor displays some structural similarities to the IP3 receptors. It is also composed of four subunits, which form a homotetrameric channel.

Finally, The Orai subunit of store-operated calcium channels is a four transmembrane-domain spanning protein containing two extracellular loops, one intracellular loop, and cytosolic N and C-terminals.
