Clinical outcomes of classic Hodgkin lymphoma have been improving with the advancement of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapies.

**1. Risk Stratification**

Patients are generally classified into 3 groups: early-stage favorable (stage I–II without unfavorable factors), early-stage unfavorable (stage I–II with any of the unfavorable factors), and advanced-stage disease (stage III-IV). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network defines unfavorable factors for early-stage disease as the presence of B symptoms, erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≥ 50 millimeters per hour, bulky mediastinal disease (mediastinal mass ratio > 0.33, or adenopathy > 10 centimeters), and > 3 sites of disease.

The International Prognostic Score (IPS) helps determine the clinical management and predict prognosis for those with advanced-stage disease.

**2. Risk-Adapted Initial Therapy**

**2.1. Early-Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma**

Two cycles of ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) chemotherapy followed by 20 Gy of involved-field radiation therapy (IFRT) is generally considered as the standard therapy for early-stage favorable Hodgkin lymphoma.

**2.2. Advanced-Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma**

Six cycles of ABVD is a preferred therapeutic approach for adult patients with advanced-stage Hodgkin lymphoma.

**3. Response-Adapted Therapy**

After 2 cycles of ABVD, patients typically undergo the first interim response assessment using PET/CT scans.

- Score 1: no uptake

- Score 2: uptake is equal to or below mediastinum

- Score 3: uptake is above mediastinum but equal to or below the liver

- Score 4: uptake is moderately higher than liver

- Score 5: uptake is markedly higher than liver, any new lesions, or both

- Score X: new areas of uptake that are unlikely to be related to lymphoma

Depending on the Deauville score, further management is individualized for each patient.

**4. End-of-Treatment Assessment**

At the end of treatment, PET/CT scans help establish remission status using the Deauville criteria.

**5. Relapsed or Refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma**

A diagnosis of relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma must be confirmed histologically by biopsy.
