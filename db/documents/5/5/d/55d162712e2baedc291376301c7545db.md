Tissue effects of penetrating trauma vary greatly based upon the type and velocity of weapon/projectile. Stab-type trauma (knives, swords, etc.) lead to local tissue effects along the tract of penetration. High-velocity projectiles (bullets, shrapnel, etc.) result in wider tissue injury due to the effects of cavitation; in these injuries, the projectile itself causes tissue damage along the tract while energy transfer from deceleration leads to radial stretching (cavitation) and rapid collapse of tissue bordering the path of the projectile. Thus, while tissues or structures may not be directly transected as the projectile passes, significant injury can result from transferred ballistic forces. Delayed presentation of injury can take place, most notably in the form of pseudoaneurysms, arteriovenous fistulas, or peritonitis from spillage of GI contents or urine.
