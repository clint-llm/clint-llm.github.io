Lipoprotein (a), also known as Lp (a), is a form of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) that is an established and genetically determined risk factor for atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, stroke, thrombosis, and aortic stenosis.

There is an inverse relationship between plasma concentrations of Lp (a) and the apolipoprotein (a) isoform. The isoform variation is induced by the different number of kringle IV repeats in the LPA gene. The variation in kringle units leads to the variable levels of Lp(a) seen in the general population. In general, those with fewer kringle repeats will have smaller Lp(a) particles but have higher serum levels. Also, the larger the isoforms of apolipoprotein (a), the greater the accumulation of its precursor intracellularly within the endoplasmic reticulum.

Lp(a) levels above 50mg/dl are correlated to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.
