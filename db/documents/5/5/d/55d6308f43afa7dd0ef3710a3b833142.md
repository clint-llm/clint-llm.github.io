According to manufacturer labeling, overdoseÂ can occur from too rapid and repeated injections. In addition, the administration of rapid injections is followed by a fall in blood pressure. There is no antidote for etomidate. In a suspected case of overdosage, etomidate should be discontinued, a patent airway established (intubate, if necessary) or maintained, and oxygen administered with assisted ventilation.
