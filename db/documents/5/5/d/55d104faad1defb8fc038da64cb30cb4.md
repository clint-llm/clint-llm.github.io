Heterochromia is a sign and not by itself a disease. There is no specific treatment of heterochromia by itself. Treatment is directed at the underlying cause, including underlying eye diseases. If the heterochromia is associated with other signs of Horner syndrome such as miosis and partial ptosis, the most common cause is congenital Horner syndrome which does not require any treatment. On the other hand, congenital or early childhood onset Horner syndrome mayÂ result from an underlying tumor of the sympathetic chain, especially neuroblastoma which will need urgent workup, diagnosis, and treatment.
