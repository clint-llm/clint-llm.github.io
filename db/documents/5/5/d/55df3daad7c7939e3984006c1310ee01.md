Complications occur in approximately 9% of the patients, these include:

- Nasal septal perforation

- Meningitis

- Sinusitis

- Acute epiglottitis

- Respiratory arrest

- Acute otitis media

- Periorbital cellulitis

- Tetanus

Other complications include nose bleeds, nasal obstruction, and sinusitis.

Radiolucent bodies often go undetected for months or years because they are difficult to visualize. Small button batteries have high morbidity as they rapidly induce ulceration and necrosis leading to perforation of the nasal septum.Â  Failure to remove in the emergency department is higher with spherical or disk-shaped objects and more than one attempt or instrument is usually used.

If the object becomes displaced posteriorly, it can enter the respiratory tract leading to secondary morbidities.
