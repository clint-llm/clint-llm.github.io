The four main muscles of mastication are all innervated by the anterior trunk of the mandibular nerve, which is the third division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3).  The mandibular nerve (CN V3) is the largest and inferior-most division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). The trigeminal nerve (CN V) exits the skull via foramen ovale of the greater wing of the sphenoid bone.  The mandibular nerve contains both sensory and motor fibers.  The mandibular nerve is the only division of the trigeminal nerve that carries motor fibers. The mandibular nerve (CN V3) further subdivides as it innervates the four main muscles of mastication.  The temporalis muscle receives innervation by deep temporal branches of the mandibular nerve.  The medial pterygoid muscle receives innervation from the medial pterygoid nerve, a division of the mandibular nerve. The lateral pterygoid muscle gets its nerve supply from the lateral pterygoid nerves, divisions of the mandibular nerve. The masseter muscle receives nerve input from the masseteric nerve, a division of the mandibular nerve.
