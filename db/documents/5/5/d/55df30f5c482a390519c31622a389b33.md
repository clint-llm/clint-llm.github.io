Similar to other intracellular microorganisms like Mycobacterium leprae and Leishmania, the acute infection leads to antibody response against the phase II antigen, and the immunity is provided by the cellular response. In immunocompromised individuals, due to the lack of cellular immune response, chronic infection occurs where immune complexes form due to high levels of antibodies and are responsible for the majority of clinical signs and symptoms.
