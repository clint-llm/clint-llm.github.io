In the coagulation cascade, glycoprotein receptors have two subunits, α, and β, which are responsible for platelet aggregation and adhesion. They are present on the platelet plasma membrane and undergo a conformational change upon platelet activation, allowing them to adhere to each other. These GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors bind to the receptor and prevent fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor (vWF) from binding to the receptors.

Integrillin has a half-life, elimination of 2.5 hours, and the onset of action occurs in 1 hour with a duration of action of 4 hours. It is 25% protein-bound and has a Vd of 185 to 260 mL/kg. Its excretion is via the urinary system. It has a renal clearance of 55 to 58 mL/kg/hr.

Tirofiban has a half-life of 2 hours, and its duration of action is 4 hours. It is 65% protein-bound, and its Vd is 22 to 42. About 65% of tirofiban clearance is through urine and 25% through feces. Its clearance is 213 to 314 mL/min. It is dialyzable.
