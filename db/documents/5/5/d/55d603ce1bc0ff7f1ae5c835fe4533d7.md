The median age of onset of skin lesions is six to ten days; 92% develop lesions in the first 28 days of life (56% in the first week).

Of 126 studied infants, 51% developed hypercalcemia, more commonly identified in the neonatal period (57%), with 30% detected in the second month of life. Approximately half of the patients with hypercalcemia exhibited symptoms, including irritability, poor feeding, polyuria, polydipsia, constipation, hypotonia, failure to thrive, persistent nephrocalcinosis, and seizures.
