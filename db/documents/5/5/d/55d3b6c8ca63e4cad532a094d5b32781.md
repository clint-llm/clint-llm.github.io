Short-term complications include cerebral edema, status epilepticus, increased intracranial pressure, aspiration pneumonitis, cerebral venous thrombosis, cerebral infarction, and diabetes insipidus. Long-term sequelae include neurological deficits with varying severity (for example, aphasia, ataxia, dysphasia, amnesia) and cognitive, behavioral, physical, and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Autoimmune encephalitis with antibodies directed against the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor must be considered in any patient with a recent history of HSE presenting with recurrent neuro symptoms.
