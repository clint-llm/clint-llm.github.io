The mainstay of treatment for alternobaric vertigo is re-establishing the pressure equilibrium between the two middle ears. This is typically done by pinching one's nostrils closed and forcibly attempting to exhale with a closed mouth. This is meant to establish patency within the Eustachian tubes, allowing for equalization between each middle ear space and the oropharynx. It is important that those experiencing vertigo do not panic, as they are often in situations where poor judgment could put them at risk for personal injury from other causes. When diving, the individual should stop ascending or descending and maintain his or her position in the water. At this point, the diver may attempt equalization and expect to experience a gradual resolution of their symptoms.
