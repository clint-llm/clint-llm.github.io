Different imaging protocols are available for thallium-201 based myocardial perfusion imaging. The more common stress-rest protocols begin with stress imaging 15 minutes after injection of thallium-201, followed by rest imaging after 2.5 to 4 hours, and finally a redistribution imaging 24 hours later.

Dosing for MPI: In all MPI protocols, the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology recommends 2.5 to 3.5 mCi of thallium-201 for the initial dose (stress or rest imaging), while for the reinjections, if required in the protocol, an additional dose of 1 to 2 mCi of thallium-201 is recommended.

Dosing for olfacto-scintigraphy: 0.3 ml solution of thallium-201 (22MBq) is administered nasally into the olfactory clefts, and 24 hours later, uptake of thallium-201 is evaluated with SPECT Scan. This test may correlate with CT, MRI, and T & T olfactometry findings for further analysis.
