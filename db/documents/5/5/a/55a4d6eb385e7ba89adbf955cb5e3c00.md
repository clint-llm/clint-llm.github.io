Diagnosis of pityriasis versicolor is usually easily made on the basis of its characteristic clinical presentation (hyperpigmented or hypopigmented, finely scaling patches or plaques).

The ultraviolet black light (Wood lamp) may help to demonstrate the coppery-orange fluorescence of pityriasis versicolor.

The diagnosis is confirmed by microscopic examination of scales soaked in potassium hydroxide examination, which demonstrates the typical grape-like clusters of yeast cells and long hyphae. Since the standard potassium-hydroxide mount lacks a color contrast, methylene blue stain, ink blue stain, or Swartz-Medrik stain may be added to visualize better.

Malassezia species are known to be difficult to grow in the laboratory as they require fastidious culture conditions.
