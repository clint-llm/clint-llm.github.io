Acute laryngitis resolves within 2 weeks, and is due to local inflammation of the vocal folds and surrounding tissues in response to a trigger, whether that trigger is infectious or non-infectious. If symptoms persist beyond this timeframe it is either due to superinfection or due to a transition to chronic laryngitis.

**Acute laryngitis**is characterized by inflammation and congestion of the larynx in the early stages. This can encompass the supraglottic, glottic, or subglottic larynx (or any combination thereof), depending on the inciting organism. As the healing stage begins, white blood cells arrive at the site of infection to remove the pathogens. This process enhances vocal cord edema and affects vibration adversely, changing the amplitude, magnitude, and frequency of the normal vocal fold dynamic. As the edema progresses, the phonation threshold pressure can increase. The generation of adequate phonation pressure becomes more difficult, and the patient develops phonatory changes both as a result of the changing fluid-wave dynamics of the inflamed and edematous tissue, but also as a result of both conscious and unconscious adaptation to attempt to mitigate these altered tissue dynamics. Sometimes edema is so marked that it becomes impossible to generate adequate phonation pressure. In such a situation, the patient may develop frank aphonia. Such maladaptations may result in prolonged vocal symptoms after an episode of acute laryngitis that can persist long after the inciting event has resolved. In such situations, referral to an otolaryngologist and/or speech-language pathologist is warranted.
