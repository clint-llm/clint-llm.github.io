Antibiotic treatment has a 95% effectiveness rate for first-time therapy. The prognosis is excellent with prompt initiation of treatment early and with the completion of the entire course of antibiotics. Although treatment failures with primary therapies are quite rare, relapse may occur. Reinfection is common and is usually related to the nontreatment of infected sexual partners or acquisition from a new partner. Death is rare but can beÂ caused by progression to salpingitis and tubo-ovarian abscess with rupture and peritonitis. The most significant morbidity occurs with repetitive infection with chlamydiae, which leads to scarring of the fallopian tubes and subsequent sterility.
