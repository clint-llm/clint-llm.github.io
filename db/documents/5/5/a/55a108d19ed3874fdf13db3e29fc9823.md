Visual prognosis is usually poor. Up to 86% of patients with aniridia may have a visual acuity of 20/100 or worse in the better eye. The cause of visual decline include:

- Foveal hypoplasia

- Optic nerve head hypoplasia

- Glaucoma

- Cataract

- Keratopathy

However, members of some families with familial aniridia may have good vision of at least 20/30 in up to 61% of cases.
