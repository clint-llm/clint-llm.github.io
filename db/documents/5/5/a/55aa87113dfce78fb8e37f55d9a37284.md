Donovanosis is a sexually transmitted infection that can rarely have non-sexual modes of transmission. It is classically associated with genital ulcers that demonstrate Donovan bodies on tissue smear samples.

In endemic areas, extragenital donovanosis can be a significant cause of lymphadenopathy in HIV patients.
