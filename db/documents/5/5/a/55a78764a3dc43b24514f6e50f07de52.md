PCOS is a multifactorial disease. Several susceptible genes have been identified as contributors to the pathophysiology of the disease. These genes are involved in various levels of steroidogenesis and androgenic pathways. Twin studies have estimated about 70% heritability. Also, the environment is a fundamental component in the expression of these genes and the development and progression of the disease.

Two popular hypothesesÂ postulate that individuals with a genetic predisposition exposed to certain environmental factors lead to the expression of PCOS features. The most common environmental factors include obesity and insulin resistance. Some hypotheses also include fetal androgen exposure.
