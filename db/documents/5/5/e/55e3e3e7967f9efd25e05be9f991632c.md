An ectopic pregnancy results when a blastocyst implants in a site other than the uterus and accounts for approximately 2% of all pregnancies.

hCG is a glycoprotein comprised of alpha and beta subunits and is the principal marker used in home kits to test for pregnancy. It gets produced by the syncytiotrophoblast layer of the developing embryo; however, sufficient levels are not reached until at least two weeks after conception to be detectable via urine testing.
