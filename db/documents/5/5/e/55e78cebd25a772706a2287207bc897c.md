There are many factors that can contribute to placental insufficiency, and it is known that IUGR is a major downstream complication; however, it can be difficult at times to differentiate a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonate versus an IUGR neonate. One of the major benefits of doppler studies, especially of the umbilical artery, is that abnormal umbilical artery Dopplers can be used to differentiate between pathologic IUGR and a small-for-gestational-age neonate, thus guiding which pregnancy would require high-level surveillance versus routine monitoring.

When the mean estimated fetal weight is below the 10th percentile for a specific gestational age, that fetus is SGA. Conversely, a fetus that is IUGR will not be able to achieve normal growth usually secondary to placental insufficiency, a genetic disorder, or infection.

In considering differential diagnoses that contribute to placental insufficiency there are known associated diseases, including but not limited to preeclampsia, maternal hypertensive disorders as these both interfere with placental resistance and uteroplacental blood flow. Other illnesses to consider include oligohydramnios and maternal malnutrition or calorie restriction.
