Phantosmia is a relatively uncommon olfactory disorder, accounting for only 10-20% of olfactory complaints.

Further complicating the matter, and largely due to the plasticity of the olfactory neuroepithelium, olfactory dysfunction varies with age, thereby limiting epidemiologic comparisons. A recent self-reporting survey of 3606 United States adults aged 40 years or older suggested a phantosmia prevalence of 6%, disproportionately affecting females.

A similar study among Swedish adults aged 60 years or older suggested a prevalence of 4.9%.
