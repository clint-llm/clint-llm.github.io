Behcet disease has no cure and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Poor prognosis and higher mortality are related to the male sex and youngerÂ age of onset. Major causes of mortality include ruptured pulmonary and peripheral aneurysms and neurologic and gastrointestinal involvement. Renal involvement, especially amyloidosis, also carries a poor prognosis. However, more than 60% of patients go into remission after passing the initial years when the disease is most active. In addition, most patients eventually show improvement in disease flares, morbidity, and mortality.
