A bone marrow transplant is a complicated process that involves several tests and personnel. Routine labs including CBC, CMP, and 24-hour urine creatinine are performed.  A brain MRI/MRA inspects for the extension of brain infarcts and vascular abnormalities.  An echocardiogram is performed to estimate pulmonary pressures. Dental clearance and pulmonary function tests are also a part of pre-transplant testing. Most importantly, HLA- typing is performed to find a donor for the transplant. The red cell phenotype of both the recipients and the donor is obtained. Screening for donor-directed antibodies is also undertaken because of the risk of pure red cell aplasia post-transplant.
