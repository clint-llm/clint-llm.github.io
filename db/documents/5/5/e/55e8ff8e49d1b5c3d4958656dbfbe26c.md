Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a well-recognized phenomenon that may follow virtually any ischemic episode to tissues from interrupted blood flow, including direct traumatic tissue injuries, pressure-induced injuries, and cold injuries or burns, embolic, thrombotic, or localized inflammatory occlusion insults. It is also described following vascular or cardiovascular reperfusion procedures and post compartment syndrome fasciotomies. Tissue injury and/or death from this initial ischemic insult is determined by a combination of degree and duration of the occlusion and extent and type of tissue involved by the affected watershed area of capillary or arteriolar distribution. When circulation is restored, the occlusion is relieved, or the vessel is re-cannulated, a recurrent ischemic effect may occur within the following 4 to 8 hours, and cell death can continue for up to 3 days after the reperfusion. The release of endothelial chemotactic substances initiated by the original injury or insult creates an intravascular inflammatory response. This inflammatory response is at least partially responsible for further vascular occlusion of downstream tissues from edema. It is worsened by additional release from the second round of reactive oxygen species generated by the freshly oxygenated blood in an affected region depleted of protective free radical scavengers responding to the initial insult.

If initiated early, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been found to ameliorate the damaging effects of reperfusion by early modulation of inflammation, maintenance of metabolic function in downstream tissues, and reintroduction of oxidation scavengers.
