Pemphigus is a broad term used to describe a rare group of bullous autoimmune diseases that affect the skin and mucosal membranes. The hallmark presentation of pemphigus is the presence of widespread flaccid blisters and erosions erupting on the skin and oral mucosa. Drug-induced pemphigus is caused by a combination of biochemical interactions and aberrant stimulation of host B cells producing intracellular IgG antibodies. These autoantibodies attack the desmogleins, causing the cells within the epidermis to separate, a process called acantholysis. While there are several factors known to trigger the disease, drugs continue to be the leading cause of pemphigus.
