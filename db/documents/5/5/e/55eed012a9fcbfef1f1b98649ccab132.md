Infantile acne usually presents between 6 weeks and one year of life, is usually mild to moderate in course, and resolves within 6 to 12 months from diagnosis. The condition can be successfully managed by most primary care providers, nurse practitioners, pediatricians and internists with or without the involvement of treatment, and positive patient outcomes are possible with the following points:

- Establish an accurate and timely diagnosis by actively considering other possible differential diagnoses.

- Evaluate for any possible signs of an underlying endocrinopathy, both during the initial exam and continually.

- When warranted, initiate (and/or escalate) treatment to the appropriate level depending on the severity of lesions.

- Conduct close clinical follow-up to monitor the ongoing effectiveness of the current treatment regimen and to assess for any potential side-effects. This is where nursing can coordinate between pharmacy and the treating clinicians to ensure patient compliance, appropriate dosing, and vigilant monitoring for adverse drug events.

- Actively engage and educate the parent or caregiver regarding treatment side-effects and expectation management.

- When in doubt, consider consulting the appropriate specialist (pediatric dermatologist and pediatric endocrinologist) for further guidance.

Successful management of infantile acne involves physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nursing, and pharmacists, operating in an interprofessional team to ensure optimal patient outcomes. [Level V]
