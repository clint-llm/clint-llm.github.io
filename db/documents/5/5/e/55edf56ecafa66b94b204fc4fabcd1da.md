There are geographical variations in the incidence of individual subtypes, with follicular lymphoma being more common in Western countries and T cell lymphoma more common in Asia.

Overall, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is common in ages 65 to 74, the median age being 67 years.

Epstein-Barr virus-related (endemic) Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is more common in Africa. The endemic variant of Burkitt lymphoma is found in equatorial Africa and New Guinea. The incidence of Burkitt Lymphoma in Africa is approximately 50 times higher than in the United States.

Mantle Cell Lymphoma consists of about 7 percent of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas in the United States and Europe, with an incidence of approximately 4 to 8 cases per million persons per year.  Incidence is shown to increase with age and appears to be increasing overall in the United States. Approximately three-quarters of patients are male, and people of the White race are affected almost twice as frequently as African Americans. The median age at diagnosis is 68 years.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the fifth most common diagnosis of pediatric cancer in children under the age of 15 years, and it accounts for approximately 7 percent of childhood cancers in the developed world. In the United States, approximately 800 new pediatric NHL cases are diagnosed annually, with an incidence of 10 to 20 cases per million people per year. High-grade lymphomas, such as lymphoblastic and small noncleaved lymphomas, are the most common types of NHL observed in children and young adults.

Lymphomas are rare in infants (≤1 percent) and account for approximately 4, 14, 22, and 25 percent of neoplasms in children aged 1 to 4, 5 to 9, 10 to 14, and 15 to 19 years, respectively. There is a male predominance, and whites are more commonly affected than African Americans.
