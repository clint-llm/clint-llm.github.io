There is no cure for Angelman syndrome (AS), but only the management of the symptoms which requires a multidisciplinary team. Early diagnosis and early, consistent treatment using speech, physical, and occupational therapy has shown improvement in prognosis.

Parents must be educated on the requirement of constant care and support for their child and the need for early and regular therapy. Genetic counseling can be offered to parents of AS patients. Even though most cases of AS are sporadic, some are familial.Â  Genetic counseling can help determine recurrence risk and plan future pregnancies.
