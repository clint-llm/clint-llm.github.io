The accessory deep peroneal nerve may supply motor innervation to the extensor digitorum brevis and some sensory innervation to the lateral ankle and foot. However, this nerve is derived from the superficial peroneal nerve or its branches rather than the deep peroneal nerve which normally supplies the extensor digitorum brevis exclusively. The accessory deep peroneal nerve may develop in as many asÂ 28% of patients, and it has been suggested that this anomaly may be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.
