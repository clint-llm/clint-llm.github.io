- Medial epicondylitis is a common cause of medial elbow pain.

- It is associated with either sports (throwing, racquet sports, and golf) or occupation (plumbing, carpentry, or construction).

- Patients tend to have pain on the medial elbow worse with wrist flexion or pronation.

- Management is generally conservative and includes some combination of non-opiate analgesia, physical therapy, bracing, and injections.

- Refractory cases requiring surgical release are rare.
