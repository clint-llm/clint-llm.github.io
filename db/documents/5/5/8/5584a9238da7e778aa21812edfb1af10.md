The United States Government developed the Federal Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act (Controlled Substances Act) in 1970. One of the primary purposes of the act was to improve the development, distribution, and allocation of controlled medications. The Controlled Substances Act categorizes certain medications into five different schedules based on misuse potential. Schedule I medications have the highest misuse potential; schedule V medications have the lowest misuse potential.
