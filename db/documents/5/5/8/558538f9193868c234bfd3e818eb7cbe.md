Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a rare cutaneous adverse reaction in which tiny nonfollicular sterile pustules with underlying erythema develop and spread rapidly.

Most cases of AGEP occur as an adverse drug reaction, but cases have also been reported following infectious insults or contact with physical triggers.Â Although AGEP is often self-limited, it may lead to systemic complications; identification and discontinuation of the triggering agent is the mainstay of treatment.

Generally classified alongside other severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) as a type IV hypersensitivity reaction, confirmation of the full breadth of the pathophysiology of AGEP remains under investigation.
