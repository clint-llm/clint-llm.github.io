Posttraumatic stress disorder is a complex phenomenon, and it is necessary to evaluate for any co-existing psychiatric illness in the patient. After a detailed history is obtained, the next step is to have a thorough mental status examination, which helps confirm the behavioral, emotional, and cognitive aspects of PTSD. On the mental status examination, the patient would likely mention poor sleep and concentration, frequent nightmares and flashbacks related to the event, guilt or negative emotions associated with the reminder, avoidance, and increased vigilance.

The health-care providers can efficiently use self-report scales for screening or management such as PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Trauma Symptom Checklist - 40 (TSC-40).
