A chest X-ray will be useful to identify lung infiltrates or ARDS or a primary pneumonic process. An arterial blood gas will be useful to monitor the PaO2 to grade the severity of hypoxemia. Chest computed tomographic evaluation has proven to be more helpful and accurate than chest X-ray imaging in detecting the complications of ARDS.

A transthoracic echocardiogram might be needed to rule out cardiac etiology of hypoxemia, such as intracardiac shunting or congestive heart failure with pulmonary edema or pulmonary hypertension leading to cor pulmonale. In cases of massive bilateral pulmonary embolism causing refractory hypoxemia, echocardiography might reveal right ventricular strain.
