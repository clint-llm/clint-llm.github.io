A language or communication barrier generally occurs between patients and medical personnel when a difference in the native language is present, or the patient is hearing-impaired. Misinterpretation of patient complaints or presentation is a growing problem in the United States when English is not the native language of patients. Physicians, nurses, and admitting and laboratory personnel, and many others are involved with patient care throughout the patient's stay. Potentially, language or communication barriers may negatively impact medical care as well as any ongoing relationship between patients, providers, and facilities. Ongoing relationships include but are not limited to ethical and legal implications that may occur over time. Historically, three different types of medical interpretation have been utilized by providers to overcome language barriers, each with advantages and disadvantages. Despite the proven advantages and increasing ease of video interpretation services, medical personnel is reluctant to regularly utilize this solution to improve the language barrier. Although the cost is high, further research and implementation of positive practices could improve the issues created by language barriers in the medical field.
