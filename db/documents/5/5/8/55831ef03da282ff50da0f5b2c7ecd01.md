Sinusitis, also referred to as rhinosinusitis, is the symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity mucosa. This inflammation may be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, or allergens. Recurrent acute sinusitis (RARS) is defined as four or more rhinosinusitis episodes per year without persistent symptoms between episodes. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and management of patients with recurrent acute sinusitis.
