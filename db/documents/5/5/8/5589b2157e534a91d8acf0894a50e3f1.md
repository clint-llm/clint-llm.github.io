Osteitis condensans ilii (OCI) was named in 1926 by Sicard et al., as an exclusive entity used to describe a condition with characteristic sclerotic radiographic imaging findings localized to the periarticular (auricular) portion of the ileum at the sacroiliac joint without other joint space abnormalities such as erosions, effusion, or periarticular bone marrow or soft tissue edema.
