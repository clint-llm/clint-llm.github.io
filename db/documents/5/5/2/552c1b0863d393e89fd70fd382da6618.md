Naegleria fowleri has a 3 stage life cycle: amoeboid trophozoites, flagellate, and cysts. Hostile environmental changes can cause the trophozoites to change to the flagellated form, and the parasite will revert when conditions improve. Naegleria fowleri trophozoites are found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tissue, and occasionally, flagellated forms may be noted in the CSF. Cysts are not seen in brain tissue.

On the contrary, Acanthamoeba exists in only two forms, cysts and trophozoites. The trophozoites are the infective forms. Both Acanthamoeba spp. cysts and trophozoites are found in tissue.
