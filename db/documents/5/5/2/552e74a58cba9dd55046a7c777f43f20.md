The critical concept of nursing shared governance is shared decision making between the bedside nurses and nurse leaders, which includes areas such as resources, nursing research/evidence-based practice projects, new equipment purchases, and staffing.

Nursing Shared Governance is a pillar of the ANCC Magnet culture. Utilizing this approach in the hospital setting allows for better nurse satisfaction and improved patient outcomes. The process of building this type of structure and the related processes can be challenging among both nurse administrators and bedside nurses. Open communication and collaboration among team members are the best practices for overcoming these and other potential barriers.

A healthcare organization wishing to develop and implement a shared governance program should spend time in the literature identifying potential areas of vulnerability and known pitfall areas. Conducting a thorough self-assessment will lead to smoother planning, implementation, and evaluation of the new program. Omitting this step can lead to the issues discussed below, among others.
