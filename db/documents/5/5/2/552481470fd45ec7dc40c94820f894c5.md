Alteplase (tPA) is a powerful thrombolytic agent used in the lysis of acute thromboembolism.

FDA-approved indications for alteplase include pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation (STEMI), ischemic strokeÂ when given within 3 hours of the start of symptoms, and re-establishment of patency in occluded intravenous (IV) catheters.

Common off-label indications include:

- Treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and peripheral arterial thrombosis with local administration of a thrombolytic agent in catheter-directed thrombolysis

- Ischemic stroke when administered more than 3 hours, but no longer than 4.5 hours, after symptom onset

- Management of prosthetic valve thrombosis

- Adjunct treatment of a pediatric pleural effusion or empyema.
