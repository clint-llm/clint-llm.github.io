Education of the family coping with classic familial short stature (FSS) is extremely important to avoid unnecessary investigations and treatments. They should be made to understand why short parents have short children. Simple terminology to explain the genetic nature of the condition should be employed.

For children exhibiting combined FSS and CDGP, the SS may be more profound, and families should be counseled to engage in investigations to exclude pathological SS.

At the same time, if evaluation implicates monogenic disorders that warrant more extensive testing, the appropriate approach should be pursued.

The services of a clinical psychologist will sometimes be necessary. Such a professional can play a vital role in helping the child with FSS and the family cope with unforeseen life experiences.
