Heroin, also known as diacetylmorphine, is a very efficient prodrug and more potent than morphine. Many deaths are caused by heroin overdoses throughout the world each year. Heroin, which can be sniffed, smoked, or injected, is experiencing a rebound in usage, partially related to the efforts to reduce the abuse of prescription pain relievers. With increased usage, there has been a corresponding increase in overdose-related deaths. Heroin is one of the most commonly used drugs among those who misuse intravenous drugs. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of heroin toxicity and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the basic pharmacology of heroin in the human body.
- Review the signs and symptoms expected on examination and evaluation of a patient with suspected heroin toxicity.
- Outline the management options available for both acute heroin toxicity and long-term management following recovery from heroin toxicity.
- Explain possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of heroin toxicity and improve outcomes.
