Using National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines, treatment depends upon tumor staging for the feasibility of surgical resection with Stage III-IV malignant pleural mesothelioma being considered unresectable. Ultimately less than a third of patients are candidates for definitive resection. It is recommended that mesothelioma be treated by a multidisciplinary team at a high volume center.
