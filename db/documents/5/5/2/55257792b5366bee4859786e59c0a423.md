Patients with CON usually present with chronic progressive vision loss. It can be in one or both eyes. They can present with headaches, nausea, vomiting, diplopia, dyschromatopsia, exophthalmos, afferent pupillary defect, photophobia, red-eye, or unexplained weight loss. Sudden or rapid visual loss are rare except for traumatic cases. These cases usually have a blunt trauma or a penetrating injury. The nerve can be injured at any part, but the orbital apex and the optic canal are the most susceptible areas to damage.

It is imperative to obtain a good history and physical exam to help narrow the broad differential diagnosis.

- Vision loss: Symmetric or asymmetric

- Slow versus rapid onset

- Family history of cancer

- History of radiation

- Cardiovascular risk factors: hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, tobacco use

- Metabolic disease

- Autoimmune history

Physical Exam

- Snellen chart: Visual acuity

- Funduscopic exam

- Slit-lamp examination: Evaluate retina, retinal arteries and veins, cornea, fovea, optic cup

- Visual field test: Help differentiate central vs. peripheral visual loss

- Ishiharaâ€™s test: Evaluate if a color deficit is present

- Tonometry: Evaluate intraocular pressure

- Extraocular eye movements

- Proptosis
