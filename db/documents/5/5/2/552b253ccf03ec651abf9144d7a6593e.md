The spinal cord and brain are covered by three protective layers known as meninges. The innermost layer is the pia mater, which articulates directly with the surface of the spinal cord. The middle layer is known as the arachnoid mater. Lastly, the dura mater is the outermost and thus toughest protective layer of the spinal cord. It is separated from the vertebrae by the epidural space. The epidural space contains the dural sac, blood vessels, fat, connective tissue, and spinal nerves. The contents of the dural sac include the spinal cord (ending at L1/L2) and the cauda equina. The spinal dura mater is critical to the peripheral nervous system as it creates pathways (via dural sheaths) by surrounding exiting nerve roots from the spinal cord.

The vertebral column also acts to protect the spinal cord. It consists of 33 bones (vertebrae), many of which are separated by an intervertebral disc. This includes seven cervical, twelve thoracic, five lumbar, five sacral (fused), and four coccygealÂ (fused) vertebrae. Spinal nerve roots exit the spinal column via two lateral openings, called intervertebral foramina, formed between two contiguous vertebrae.
