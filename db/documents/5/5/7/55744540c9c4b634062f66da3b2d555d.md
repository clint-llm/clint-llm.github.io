Anyone who has been properly trained to complete the Gordon reflex can perform the test. Physicians, medical students, physician assistants, medical assistants, and nurses are a few medical staff capable of performing the test. An inexperienced medical staff member should first observe an experienced practitioner complete the reflex or view an online video of the proper technique of the Gordon reflex before attempting to perform it solo. Practice and experience increase the likelihood of accurately eliciting and recognizing the response.
