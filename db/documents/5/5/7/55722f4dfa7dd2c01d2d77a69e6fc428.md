**Atherosclerosis**

Familial combined hyperlipidemia is linked to a higher likelihood of developing atherosclerosis. While some patients may not experience any symptoms, evaluating the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery can serve as a means of estimating the risk.

**Coronary Artery Disease**

A significant association exists between familial combined hyperlipidemia and an elevated coronary artery disease (CAD) risk.

Familial combined hyperlipidemia ranks high among the common causes of myocardial infarction in young people. In a study by Wiesbauer et al, the prevalence of FCH was 38% among patientsÂ younger than 40.
