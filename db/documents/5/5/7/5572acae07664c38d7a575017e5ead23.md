Vitamin E deficiency is not common in North America, but when it occurs, healthcare workers, including the nurse practitioner, should work the patient up for additional mineral deficiencies. The goal is to address the underlying cause of the deficiency (fat malabsorption, fat metabolism disorders, among others) and then provide oral vitamin E supplementation. A dietary consult should be sought and theÂ patient educated about the foods that contain vitamin E. The outlook for patients treated for vitamin E deficiency is good, provided the patient is compliant with the dietary changes and/or supplements. [Level 5]
