- Discitis

- Meningitis

- Nerve root injury

- Superficial infection

- Skin irritation from prep solution

- Medication reaction

- Sequelae of the cardiovascular stress of the procedure

- Renal injury from contrast (late effect)

- Vascular injury

- Bleeding

- Increased pain

- Disc herniations

While the patient needs to be able to interact with the proceduralist, light sedation is commonly provided. However, it carries its own risks and complications of medication reaction and oversedation with respiratory and/or cardiac complications.
