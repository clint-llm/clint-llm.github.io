The exact role of the innervation of the ureter is unclear, but the innervation for ureteral peristalsis originates from the intrinsic smooth muscular pacemaker sites. Within the renal collecting system, the minor calyces are the location for the pacemaker sites.

There is preganglionic sympathetic input from T10 through L2

S2 through S4 provide parasympathetic innervation to the ureter.
