Primary structural abnormalities of the tricuspid valvular apparatus or secondary abnormalities due to myocardial dysfunction or dilatation are responsible for the structural incompetence of the tricuspid valve.

The severity of tricuspid regurgitation is increased during inspiration. The right ventricle widens during inspiration, which further enlarges the tricuspid valve annulus, hence increasing the effective regurgitant orifice area.
