The tumors are usually small, polypoid and solid, slow growing, often invading transmurally and spread to the lymphatics and adjacent mesentery. The tumor cells are arranged in nests or trabeculae and characterized by lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, variable nuclear grade and round to oval finely granular nuclei. Immunostaining for general markers of neuroendocrine tumors such as chromogranin A and synaptophysin are frequently done for diagnostic confirmation.The WHO (2010) classified all neuroendocrine tumors, including carcinoids into three grades based on the mitotic rate, or Ki-67 index:

- Low grade, well-differentiated endocrine tumors with benign or uncertain behavior at the time of diagnosis with a mitotic rate of less than 2 and Ki-67 index of less than 3% (10% to 30%)

- Well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas with low-grade malignant behavior with a mitotic rate of 2 to 20 and Ki-67 index of 3% to 20% (50% to 80%)

- High grade, poorly differentiated endocrine carcinomas with high-grade malignant behavior with a mitotic rate of more than 20 and Ki-67 index of more than 20% (1% to 3%).
