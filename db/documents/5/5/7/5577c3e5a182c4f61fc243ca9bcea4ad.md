The cause of HaNDL syndrome remains poorly understood, but there is various speculation about its etiology. Initially, the thinking was that it was secondary to inflammation/infection due to frequent viral prodrome, monophasic course, and the presence of CSF lymphocytosis. However, large scale viral serological examinations did not reveal particular association with any infectious agent except isolated reports of echovirus 30, HHV6 and 7, and borrelia infection. Based on sophisticated imaging studies(single-photon emission computed tomography, Head CT perfusion imaging, MRI perfusion techniques, transcranial Doppler) pathogenesis similar to migraine also has been suggested with decreased hypoperfusion linked with cortical spreading depression.

Despite the findings similar to migraine pathophysiology, symptomatic explanation secondary to aseptic meningitis due to viral/inflammatory etiology has been a target or research. For example,  investigation pertains to autoimmune cross-reactivity between any inflammatory or viral disease-causing autoantibodies against neuronal or vascular structures that induce an aseptic inflammation in leptomeningeal vasculature.CACNA1A pathogenic variants were not present in 8 patients with HaNDL. On the other hand, a minority of patients in HaDNL syndrome also had an antibody related to protein kinase with mitogen activity and another protein kinase with DNA dependent catalytic subunit (DPKCU).
