Significant pain is the common adverse effect of intramuscular vitamin B12, especially in thin people. Injectable cobalamin may also cause bleeding if the patient is taking anticoagulants. Although allergic reactions rarely happen, they can cause life-threatening anaphylaxis. Injections are more allergenic than pills, and hydroxocobalamin seems to be more allergenic than cyanocobalamin, although reactions can occur with all cobalamin forms. Management options for allergic reactions include desensitization, antihistamines, and steroids.

Other common adverse effects are fever, itching or rash, tingling or numbness of joint, shortness of breath, rapid weight gain, polycythemia, hypokalemia, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, and vascular thrombosis.
