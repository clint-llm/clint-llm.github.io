Once stabilized, or if the patient is initially stable on presentation, obtain a thorough history of the events that led up to and occurred during the shark encounter. Any current medical co-morbidities including those that may predispose to immunocompromised states such as diabetes, liver cirrhosis, alcohol use, or immunosuppressant medication, and any previously existing neurologic deficits is important to know and document. The history should also include the patient’s tetanus vaccination status. Injuries should be examined carefully to determine their extent, the degree of devitalized tissue, neurologic and vascular integrity, bony injury, and foreign bodies.
