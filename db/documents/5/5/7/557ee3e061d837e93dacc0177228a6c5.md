Plummer disease may lead to a variety of complications, including:

- Progression of hyperthyroidism with hyperthyroid signs and symptoms. Toxic MNG may cause osteoporosis, bone fractures, tachycardia, arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, or heart failure.

- A decrease in bone density, hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, and accelerated bone loss may occur. Studies show variable results regarding the reversibility of bone changes. Plummer disease also increases the risk of fractures.

- The thyroid gland in Plummer disease may harbor malignancy. Hyperthyroidism, along with malignancy, has been reported in 1.2% to 13.3% of surgeries for both causes.

- Pain over the thyroid area can occur if there is any hemorrhage, especially in one of the cystic nodules if coincidentally present in a toxic multinodular goiter.

- A thyroid storm may be precipitated by triggering factors like infection or stress, causing the worsening of symptoms, fever, abdominal pain, and decreased mental alertness. The frequency of thyroid storm is lower in toxic multinodular goiter than in Graves disease.

- An increase in the size of the thyroid gland due to Plummer disease may compress the trachea and esophagus, causing dyspnea, voice hoarseness (due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve), dysphagia, tracheomalacia, and asphyxiation.
