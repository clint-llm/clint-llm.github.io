The management of emphysema is by an interprofessional team that consists of a pulmonologist, internist, pharmacist, dietitian, social worker, respiratory therapist, primary care provider, and a thoracic surgeon. There is no cure for emphysema, and the primary cause needs to be treated. This means educating the patient about the harms of smoking and getting the annual influenza vaccine. The outlook for most patients is guarded, and the quality of life is poor, marked by frequent exacerbations and remissions of acute respiratory distress. Some may develop repeated pneumothoraces, which may need to be managed by a thoracic surgeon. Several types of lung volume reduction procedures are available, but they are high risk, associated with serious complications, and require prolonged intensive care. Pharmacists must review prescriptions, check for interactions, and stress the importance of compliance to patients and their families. Nurses should monitor and educate patients, reporting changes in status to the team.
