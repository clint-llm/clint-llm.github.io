The lingual artery correlates with several clinical scenarios where adverse outcomes or complications arise. The surgery section of this review discussed how the lingual artery could become ligated, either intraoperatively or via trauma, and lead to necrosis. Recent research has demonstrated that bilateral lingual artery stenosis can also lead to necrosis. In a recent case report, a 61-year-old male underwent chemoradiotherapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma that leads to tongue necrosis via radiation-induced lingual artery stenosis.

Pseudoaneurysms of the lingual artery can present with oral/nasal hemorrhage and may be mistaken for epistaxis.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA), a medium and large vessel vasculitis, can cause lingual manifestations. Inflammation of the lingual artery in GCA can lead to edema, pallor, pain, and intermittent claudication with tongue necrosis being an exceedingly rare complication.
