Lack of consistency in audiological testing is the mainstay of nonorganic functional hearing loss diagnosis.

An objective audiological assessment is necessary to establish a diagnosis. In the nonorganic functional hearing loss, the objective audiological tests show significantly better hearing thresholds than what would be expected from the subjective audiological assessment.

Subjective audiological tests include tuning fork tests (Rinne and Weber tests), pure tone audiometry (PTA), and speech audiometry.

**Rinne and Weber Tests**

Rinne and Weber tests may not align with the results obtained with PTA testing; i.e., a sensorineural hearing loss type curve may be seen on PTA with Rinne and Weber tests' findings suggesting conductive hearing loss and vice versa.

**Pure Tone Audiometry**

The test-retest variability of hearing thresholds determined by PTA is often greater than expected in cases of nonorganic functional hearing loss. Variability in excess of 15 dB HL is highly suspicious for a nonorganic etiology.

The lack of a shadow curve in the PTA of the normal ear, in the case of unilateral hearing loss, and the lack of occasional false-positive button presses by the patient during PTA are suggestive of nonorganic functional hearing loss.

Diagnosis is usually easier in children as they are likely to produce consistently inaccurate results on repeated testing.

**Speech Audiometry**

In cases of nonorganic functional hearing loss, speech audiometry usually shows better hearing thresholds than those predicted from PTA values.

Objective audiological tests used to confirm the diagnosis of nonorganic functional hearing loss include auditory brainstem responses (ABR), otoacoustic emissions (OAE), and auditory steady-state responses (ASSR).

**Auditory Brainstem Response**

In ABR testing, five electrical waves are produced by signal transmission through different anatomical structures within the auditory pathway:

- Waves I and II: proximal and distal cochlear nerve, respectively

- Wave III: second-order neurons near or in the cochlear nucleus

- Wave IV: third-order neurons near or in the superior olivary complex

- Wave V: termination of the lateral lemniscus in the inferior colliculus

The presence of these waves at normal auditory thresholds suggests that the corresponding structure is functioning adequately and, therefore, helps rule out organic pathology.

**Otoacoustic Emissions**

OAEs determine the integrity of the outer hair cells.

**Other Audiological Tests**

Auditory steady-state response (ASSR) is rarely used to diagnose nonorganic functional hearing loss.

Stapedial reflexes are generally elicited at values much higher than the threshold determined by PTA in cases of organic hearing loss. In the nonorganic functional hearing loss, stapedial reflexes are present within 10 dB of the patient's threshold or at values much lower than expected.

The Stenger test is also used to help diagnose unilateral nonorganic functional hearing loss, but it is of limited usefulness in children.

Because the auditory system is programmed to recognize only the louder of the two identical sounds, patients with nonorganic hearing loss will often fail to press the response button, while patients with organic unilateral hearing loss will still hear the sound in the normal ear and signal response. Other tests include the delayed auditory feedback speech test and Lombard reflex test.
