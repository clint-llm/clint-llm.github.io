Osteochondral allografts are commercially available from tissue banks with oversight by the Food and Drug Administration. All tissue is harvested within 24 hours of donor death, with ideal donors aging from 15 to 40 years old. Chondrocytes must remain viable for there to be any chance of successful transplantation. The clinical success of transplant is dependent on several factors, which ensure an intact extracellular matrix, viable chondrocytes, and incorporation of host bone.

Allografts can be stored fresh, frozen, or cryopreserved. Each storage technique has different effects on the biomechanical and biochemical properties of the cartilage graft. Fresh storage has been shown to have the highest level of chondrocyte viability,
