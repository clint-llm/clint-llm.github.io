Patients should be educated that dermatofibromas are benign entities and do not necessarily require excision. However, although the clinical history and exam and imaging studies may favor a dermatofibroma, a definitive diagnosis can only be made following pathologic examination. Patients may also influence the decision to excise versus choosing surveillance. Of course, if surveillance is opted for, any abrupt or unusual change in the behavior of any skin lesion should necessitate a referral to a competent dermatologist for evaluation. [Level 4]
