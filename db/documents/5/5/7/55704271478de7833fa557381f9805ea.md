A thorough history, physical, and basic laboratory studies help differentiate between EG and other causes of skin necrosis. Neutropenia and malignancy in a patient with typical skin lesions should raise suspicion for EG. Other conditions with similar macroscopic features include autoimmune vasculitides, vasopressor-induced necrosis, calciphylaxis, warfarin-induced necrosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), pyoderma gangrenosum, necrolytic migratory erythema, and livedoid vasculopathy.

In individuals with underlying malignancy and pancytopenia, fibrinogen levels and fibrin split products (d-dimer) can help differentiate DIC from EG. In individuals in the intensive care unit on vasopressors, the distribution of lesions can help differentiate between vasopressor-induced necrosis and EG. Vasopressor-induced necrosis affects the distal extremities, while EG affects the anogenital and axillary areas.
