The gallbladder receives most of its blood supply from the cystic artery. The cystic artery is a branch of the right hepatic artery which arises from the common hepatic artery. Anatomic variants of this vascular supply are also frequently encountered. The common bile duct receives blood from the proper hepatic, the right gastric, the gastroduodenal, and the posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries. These small vessels must be preserved during surgery to ensure adequate perfusion of the cystic and common bile ducts. Disruption of these vessels will increase rates of duct ischemia and leaks. There is no formal cystic vein. Venous drainage is by direct emptying into the gallbladder bed of the liver by short venules from the gallbladder into the liver parenchyma. Larger venous sinuses of the liver can also be encountered during cholecystectomy, and these can be problematic when trying to control bleeding. Subserosal and submucosal lymphatics drain the gallbladder to the cystic lymph node of Lund or node of Calot located in the Calot triangle. Cancer of the gallbladder often bypasses this lymph node and spreads directly to nodes located in the porta hepatis.
