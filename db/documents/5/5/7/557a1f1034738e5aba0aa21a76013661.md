The so-called occipital generator systems are different groups of specialized neurons located within the occipital lobe and involved in the visual system function. In EEG terms, the functioning of the occipital generators gets expressed by the production of different waveforms, including alpha rhythms, photic driving response, POSTS, and LWs.

In particular, LWs are positive transient waves with a triangular appearance. Of note, they are symmetric and appear in the occipital region while the individual is awake and fixes a uniform surface. The appearance has also been demonstrated when the subject watches TV.

Considering the clinical data published so far, the clinical significance of LWs could be to demonstrate the physiological functioning of the saccadic visual exploration processes. In other words, as LWs are probably related to an oculomotor visual integration mechanism, the failure to demonstrate LWs could be indicative of a specific dysfunction involving particular areas of the visual cortex. Clinically, the subject experiences difficulties in visually fixing what is of interest to him, while the EEG finding is the reduced or non-appearance of the LWs.
