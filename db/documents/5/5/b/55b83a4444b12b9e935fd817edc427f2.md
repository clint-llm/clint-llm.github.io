There are two known nerves that pass within the structures of the inguinal canal. These nerves are the ilioinguinal and the genitofemoral nerves.

The ilioinguinal nerve is a branch of L1. It passes through the deep inguinal orifice along with the cord structures. It provides sensation to the anterior perineum and medial and upper thigh. In males, it also provides sensation to the anterior scrotal area. In women, the nerve provides sensation to the labia majora and mons pubis.

The genitofemoral nerve is derived from the L1-L2 spinal nerve roots. It divided above the inguinal canal to the genital branch that passes through the deep inguinal ring with the cord structures, and the femoral branch that passes below the inguinal canal. It provides a motor function to the cremasteric muscle and sensory innervation to the scrotum (genital branch) and the upper thigh (femoral branch) in males, and labia in females.

The ilioinguinal and genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve pass with the cord structures close to the blood vessels course. Entrapment or injury is more likely to happen when wrapping the cord with the mesh or when dissecting the hernial sac. Iliohypogastric injury or entrapment is more likely to happen when suturing the mesh to the internal oblique/conjoint tendon or when closing the external oblique aponeurosis. The incidence of nerve injury after hernia repair is low but variable.
