Myelomeningocele, meningocele, encephalocele, and anencephaly comprise 80% of all NTDs. Encephaloceles represent 15%-20% of all NTDs. The incidence of congenital encephaloceles is estimated at 1 in 10,000 live births.

Many NTDs have sex predominance in females, but it is more pronounced for encephalocele (4.5:1).

Approximately 70% to 90% of encephaloceles involve the occipital area.
