Left atrial enlargement (LAE) is an anatomic variation of the left atria and is a result of increased left atrial pressure for a prolonged period. Left atrial size has prognostic implications, and studies reveal that LAE can independently predict the development of clinically significant cardiovascular diseases and heart failure. Underlying pathologies leading to LAE must be explored in a timely fashion to avoid life fatal consequences. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of LAE and highlights the significance of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of left atrial enlargement.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with left atrial enlargement.
- Review the treatment and management options for patients with left atrial enlargement.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with left atrial enlargement.
