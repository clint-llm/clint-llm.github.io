There is no antidote for GHB toxicity. The mainstay of treatment is airway protection and monitoring. Management should also include cardiorespiratory monitoring, pulse oximetry, and capnography if available. Patients may develop severe respiratory depression or apnea, and therefore immediate evaluation of the airway is paramount. In milder cases, supplemental oxygen with or without a nasopharyngeal airway is sufficient until the patient awakens. In more severe cases, endotracheal intubation may be necessary. GHB-intoxicated patients usually do not require any sedation while mechanically ventilated and will precipitously awaken and potentially extubate themselves or require sudden extubation. Severe bradycardia can be treated with atropine, and hypotension is often sufficiently managed with intravenous (IV) fluids. If there is any concern for opioid co-ingestion and toxicity, IV naloxone should be strongly considered. Patients can often be safely discharged home once they are awake, symptom-free, and all other co-intoxications or injuries are ruled out.
