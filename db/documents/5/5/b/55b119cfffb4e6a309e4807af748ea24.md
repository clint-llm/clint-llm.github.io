Healthcare workers, including family clinicians and various specialists, should be aware of euthyroid sick syndrome, which often presents in hospitalized patients, especially after major surgery or other serious illness. The key is to manage the primary illness and not the abnormalities seen in the thyroid hormone levels. The outlook for patients with euthyroid sick syndrome depends on the underlying primary condition; as long as the primary disorder is unresolved, patients will continue to show an aberration in the thyroid function tests until full resolution is achieved. This requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes all clinicians (including surgeons in those cases), and nursing staff, where everyone involved in the patient's care is in open communication with the rest of the team, leading to prompt recognition of the condition and appropriate management. This interprofessional approach will result in the best patient outcomes. [Level 5]
