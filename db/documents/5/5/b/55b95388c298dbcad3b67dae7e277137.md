Complications of HIV infection in neonates and pediatric populations occur as a result of their immunocompromised status. They are at greater risk for opportunistic infections, candida esophagitis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and cancers. Furthermore, complications are more likely to occur with antiretroviral (ARV) drug resistance. However, with careful monitoring and drug-resistance testing, the ability to select more optimized and effective regimens is possible.
