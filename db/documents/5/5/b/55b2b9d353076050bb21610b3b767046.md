Management of atypical moles is a controversial clinical topic requiring cooperation between different members of the healthcare team to achieve the best outcomes for affected patients. Although the management of atypical moles is primarily performed by dermatologists, primary care providers and nurse practitioners are often the first points of presentation for patients with an atypical lesion. It is therefore of utmost importance that healthcare providers consult with dermatologists when an atypical mole is suspected.

The relationship between the dermatologist and dermatopathologist is also paramount in optimizing patient outcomes. An understanding that suspicious lesions need to be completely excised (as opposed to incision biopsy) facilitates a full evaluation of the lesion and reduces the risk of missing histological changes associated with melanoma.

Dermatologists and pharmacists must cooperate to identify sun protection formulations acceptable to the patient, which provides high factor protection. [Level 1]
