While data on olmesartan's toxicity is limited, given the mechanism of action, the likely presenting toxic symptoms would include hypotension and tachycardia. The toxicity could also manifest with altered vision, angina, vertigo, lightheadedness, and diaphoresis. These possible toxicities mimic the side effect profile of the medication. While no antidote exists, activated charcoal may be appropriate if the consumption of olmesartan was within four hours of decontamination. Supportive measures include monitoring vital signs every six hours post-consumption to monitor for marked hypotension or hemodynamic instability. The patient should perform leg raising while lying supine to improve venous return to the heart.
