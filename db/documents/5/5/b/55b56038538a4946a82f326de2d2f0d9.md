**ACE Inhibitors:**angioedema, dry cough (due to increased bradykinin levels), teratogenicity, hyperkalemia, and hypotension.

**Angiotensin Receptor Blockers:**hyperkalemia, hypotension, decrease GFR, teratogenicity.

**Calcium Channel Blockers:**gingival hyperplasia, dizziness, flushing, peripheral edema, AV block (with Non-dihydropyridines), constipation.

**Nitrates:**reflex tachycardia, headache, flushing, and orthostatic hypotension.

**Hydralazine:**compensatory tachycardia, headache, angina, SLE-like symptoms (in slow acetylators), fluid retention.

**Nitroprusside:**Nitroprusside is metabolized to cyanide, and it can lead to cyanide toxicity. Toxicity can appear as little as four hours after initiation of infusion. Potential risk factors for the development of toxicity are underlying renal impairment, prolonged treatment period (over 48 hours), and the utilization of a higher dose.

**Minoxidil:**hypertrichosis, water retention, pericarditis that may progress to tamponade.

**Beta-Blockers:**bradycardia, dizziness, headaches, nausea, hypotension, metabolic abnormalities.

Americal Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommends not reducing blood pressure during the initial 24 hours of ischemic stroke unless it is over 220/120 mm Hg to prevent the worsening of ischemic injury. In the patient with ischemic stroke, BP requires lowering to less than 180/110 mm Hg before administering alteplase with intravenous labetalol/nicardipine.
