The number of new cases of multiple system atrophy overall has been approximated between 0.6Â to 0.7 per 100,000 people each year. Each subtype demonstrates a region-specific pattern. MSA-C is largely concentrated in Japan, while MSA-P tends to dominate new cases of MSA in Western countries. The clinical onset of MSA becomes apparently most often in the sixth decade of life.
