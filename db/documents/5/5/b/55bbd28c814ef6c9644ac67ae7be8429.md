Based on innervation, blood supply, and function, the laryngeal muscles separate into specific groups: extrinsic muscles, intrinsic muscles, and cricothyroid muscles. The respective primary actions offered by each of these muscle groups are elevation/depression of the larynx, abduction/adduction of the vocal folds, and stretch/tension of the vocal folds.

**Extrinsic Laryngeal muscles, Primary Actions******

- Stylopharyngeus, palatopharyngeal, thyrohyoid m. – elevate the larynx

- Sternohyoid, omohyoid, sternothyroid m. – depress the larynx

The extrinsic laryngeal muscles control the superior and inferior displacement of the larynx, most useful during the phases of swallowing.

**Intrinsic Laryngeal Muscles, Primary Actions:**

- Posterior cricoarytenoid m. – Abduction of vocal cords, opening of rima glottidis

- Lateral cricoarytenoid, interarytenoid, and thyroarytenoid m. – Adduction of vocal cords, closing of rima glottidis

- Cricothyroid, vocalis m. – tension of the vocal cords

- Thyroepiglottic m. – opening of the laryngeal inlet

- Aryepiglottic, oblique arytenoid m. – closing of the laryngeal inlet

The intrinsic laryngeal muscles are striated muscles that are classified based on action: abduction/adduction of the rima glottidis, tension of the vocal cords, and opening/closing of the laryngeal inlet.
