Indications for central venous access include:

- Inadequate peripheral venous access

- Administration of medications noxious to peripheral veins (chemotherapy, vasopressors, parental nutrition)

- Advanced hemodynamic monitoring (central venous pressure, venous oxyhemoglobin saturation, cardiac parameters via Swan-Ganz catheter)

- Cardiac access for temporary transvenous pacing

- Hemodialysis

- Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation
