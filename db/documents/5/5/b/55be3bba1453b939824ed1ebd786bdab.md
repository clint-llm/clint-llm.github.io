The foramen spinosum plays a role in connecting the infratemporal fossa with the middle cranial fossa along with other foramina like foramen ovale and foramen rotundum. The neurovasculature passing through the foramen spinosum includes the middle meningeal artery, the mandibular branch of the mandibular nerve or the nervus spinosus, and the middle meningeal vein. The middle meningeal artery, which is the largest of the three paired arteries that supply the meninges, supplies the dura mater and the calvaria, or skullcap. The anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery passes through the foramen spinosum, then runs underneath the pterion. The pterion is the region in which the frontal bone, parietal bone, and temporal bone along with the sphenoid bone meet. A blow to this region can cause a rupturing of the vessel causing an epidermal hematoma. This artery arises from the maxillary branch of the external carotid artery and will divide into anterior and posterior branches. Several smaller branches of this artery also appear around the foramen spinosum. The middle meningeal vein drains into the subclavian vein. The foramen spinosum is clinically significant since it is a comfortably identifiable anatomical landmark during neurosurgical and radiographic-based diagnostic procedures. In the adult population, the average diameter of the foramen spinosum is 2.63 mm.
