Gluteus minimus is the smallest muscle of the glutei. It shares many similar characteristics with the gluteus medius, including structure and function, blood supply, and innervation. It is located just beneath the gluteus medius muscle. The gluteus minimus predominantly acts as a hip stabilizer and abductor of the hip. The muscle’s blood supply and innervation are from the superior gluteal artery and superior gluteal nerve, respectively. Damage to the nerve or muscle may result in sagging of the pelvis, also known as the Trendelenburg sign. A total hip arthroplasty (THA) may indirectly or directly affect the gluteus minimus by damage to the superior gluteal nerve or by heterotopic ossification (HO). Other clinically significant conditions include greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), characterized by tendinopathy of the gluteus minimus. Patients will usually present with tenderness along the greater trochanter on the affected side.
