This is one condition where both laboratory and clinical personnel are of equal necessity and value.  Research into the predictive and protective nature of the Duffy entity is needed as new viral threats come to the forefront of global attention. The nursing team must check for Duffy antigen-negative blood units in addition to all the pretransfusion checks before the red blood cell transfusion in the patient known to have the Duffy antibody.

Staff must also be alert that, with the Duffy system, transfusion reactions can be delayed, sometimes upwards of two weeks later.
