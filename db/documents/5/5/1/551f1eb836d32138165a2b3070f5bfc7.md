The overall prognosis of patients with the peripheral vascular disease must take into account patient risk factors, cardiovascular health, and disease severity. In terms of limb health at 5 years, nearly 80% of patients will have stable claudication symptoms. Only 1% to 2% of patients will progress to critical limb ischemia in 5 years. 20% to 30% of patients with PAD will die within 5 years, with 75% of those deaths attributed to cardiovascular causes.
