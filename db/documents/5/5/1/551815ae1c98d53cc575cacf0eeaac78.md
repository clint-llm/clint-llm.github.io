The majority of patients with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21. There are different hypothesis related to genetic basis of Down syndrome and association of different genotypes with the phenotypes. Among them is gene dosage imbalance in which there is an increased dosage or number of genes of Hsa21, which results in increased gene expansion.

Critical region hypothesis is also well known in this list. Down syndrome critical regions (DSCR) are few chromosomal regions which are associated with partial trisomy for Has21. DSCR on 21q21.22 is responsible for many clinical features of Down syndrome.
