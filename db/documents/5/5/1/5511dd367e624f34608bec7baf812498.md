Patients with malignancy often experience increased risk of thrombosis, both venous and arterial. Clinical venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains one of the most common causes of mortality and morbidity among cancer patients. Pathophysiology of this disease stems from the hypercoagulable state related to the increasing production of substances like tissue factor that has high procoagulant activity. The thromboembolic disease can be the first manifestation of occult malignancy or more commonly occur within six months of a cancer diagnosis.
