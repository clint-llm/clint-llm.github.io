History regarding an unconscious patient is based on supplementary data. Questioning a person who has good knowledge of the recent history of the patient is preferable.

Abrupt onset of altered mental status points towards drug poisoning or acute structural lesions such as trauma or stroke. Most metabolic disorders and compressive structural injuries have a relatively gradual onset.

Neurological abnormalities or a headache in an unconscious patient point toward a structural lesion. Cranial nerve abnormalities can suggest brainstem involvement. Metabolic disturbances usually cause diffuse forebrain dysfunction manifesting as confusion, delirium, or encephalopathy before unconsciousness or coma.
