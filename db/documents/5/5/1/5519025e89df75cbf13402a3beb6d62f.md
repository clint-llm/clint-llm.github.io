**China**

The involvement of cardiac factors was recognized early in the pandemic in reports from China. A retrospective analysis of 187 patients treated in a Wuhan hospital between January 23 and February 23, 2020, found that 35% had existing cardiovascular comorbidities such as hypertension, coronary disease, and cardiomyopathy, and 28% exhibited myocardial injury indicated by elevated troponin T levels [9]. Other Chinese reports found rates of baseline cardiovascular disease ranging from 5% to 16%, hypertension ranging from 15% to 31%, coronary artery disease of 11%, and diabetes of 10%.

**World Scenario**

Beyond China, even higher rates of these comorbidities have been reported. A retrospective case series from Italy presented results from 1,591 critically ill patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU): 49% of patients had hypertension, 21% had cardiovascular disease, and 17% had diabetes.
