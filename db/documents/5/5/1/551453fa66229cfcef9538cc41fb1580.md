Gallbladder polyps are often found coincidentally with imaging such as an abdominal CT or an abdominal ultrasound. In cases of patients being worked up for gallbladder disease, the polyps are usually seen on abdominal ultrasound. They may present as a single lesion, or they may be multiple in nature. Polyps can occur in conjunction with gallstones but are often seen in the absence of stones. Differentiation must be made between gallstones and gallbladder polyps. Gallstones are usually mobile, and polyps are fixed to the wall of the gallbladder lumen. Most polyps are hypodense and smaller than 1 cm in diameter. They can appear polypoid or sessile. Singular polyps that have a tissue density and are larger than 1 cm in diameter carry a higher malignant potential.
