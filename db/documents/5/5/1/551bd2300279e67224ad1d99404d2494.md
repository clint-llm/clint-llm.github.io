The etiology of BPH is influenced by a wide variety of risk factors in addition to direct hormonal effects of testosterone on prostate tissue.

Although they do not cause BPH directly, testicular androgens are required in the development of BPH with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) interacting directly with prostatic epithelium and stroma.

BPH arises as a result of the loss of homeostasis between cellular proliferation and cell death, resulting in an imbalance favoring cellular proliferation. This results in increased numbers of epithelial and stromal cells in the periurethral area of the prostate and can be seen histopathologically

**Risk Factors**

Non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors also contribute to the development of BPH. These have been shown to include metabolic syndrome, obesity, hypertension, and genetic factors.

- **Metabolic syndrome**refers to conditions that include hypertension, glucose intolerance/insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Meta-analysis has demonstrated those with metabolic syndrome and obesity have significantly higher prostate volumes.

- **Obesity**has been shown to be associated with increased risk of BPH in observational studies.

- **Genetic predisposition**to BPH has been demonstrated in cohort studies, first-degree relatives in one study demonstrated a four-fold increase in the risk of BPH compared to control.
