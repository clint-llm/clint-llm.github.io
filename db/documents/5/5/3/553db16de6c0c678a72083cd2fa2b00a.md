Thymomas and thymic carcinomas originate from the epithelial cells of the thymus within the anterior mediastinum. The presence of histologic heterogeneity is common among thymomas and as a result benign and malignant thymomas cannot simply be differentiated based on history, however, malignant thymomas are much more invasive compared to their benign counterpart. This activity will focus on the role of the interprofessional team regarding the etiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of thymomas and thymic cancers.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of thymomas and thymic cancers.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of thymomas and thymic cancers.
- Outline the management options available for thymomas and thymic cancer.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of thymomas and thymic cancers and improve outcomes.
