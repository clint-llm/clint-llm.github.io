Hamartomas are usually benign, but malignant transformation may occur in some cases, e.g., in Cowden syndrome, where there is an increased risk of breast, thyroid, and endometrial cancer. The prognosis of hamartoma usually depends on the location and size of the mass and the comorbid conditions. Large-sized masses in the kidneys, hypothalamus, or spleen pose more significant health issues.
