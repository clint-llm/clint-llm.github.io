Lesions of the optic tract may result from vascular etiologies, compression, tumor infiltration, congenital abnormalities, encephalitis or meningitis, neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS), autoimmune etiology, metabolic abnormalities, iatrogenic causes, or trauma. Potential vascular causes include arteriovenous malformations, hemorrhagic or ischemic infarction, venous infarct, and mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like symptoms (MELAS).

An abnormal visual field perimetry test result, characteristic subjective findings of unilateral homonymous hemianopsia, newborn examination, or following incidental findings during the clinical evaluation of ophthalmic and neurological conditions may lead to suspicion of an optic tract abnormality. Standard automated perimetry (SAP) is commonly the first step in the assessment of a suspected optic tract lesion to localize affected visual pathways, determine the cause, and guide subsequent diagnostic imaging and management. Developments in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including newer modalities such as MRI diffusion tensor imaging, have led to its preferred use in soft-tissue assessment and distinguishing etiologies of optic tract disorders.

Peripheral prism expanders and vision restoration therapy are potential modalities of treatment in patients with permanent optic tract damage leading to homonymous visual field defects (HVFDs). The peripheral prism design consists of prism segments placed across the entire width of the spectacle lens superior and inferior to the pupil area, allowing for visual field expansion of twenty degrees or higher due to peripheral diplopia.
