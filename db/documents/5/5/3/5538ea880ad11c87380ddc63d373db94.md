Hydroa vacciniforme lesions typically begin as symmetrical, pruritic, or burning erythematous, clustered macules on photo distributed areas such as the face and dorsum of the hands. These lesions typically occur within hours of sunlight exposure. After several hours, the macules become tender papules or plaques surrounded by vesicles or hemorrhagic bullae. Finally, after several days, the lesions become umbilicated and secondarily crusted. These hemorrhagic crusted lesions heal over several weeks as varioliform scars.

In contrast, patients with hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma present with marked facial edema, multiple vesicles, large necrotizing ulcers, and severe scarring in photo distributed and non-photo distributed areas.
