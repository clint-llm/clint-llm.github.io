The origins of fibromuscular dysplasia are unknown; however, there are several theories of etiology. One theory shows FMD to be an inherited disorder as it appears there is an 11% familial prevalence. Hormonal effects are another possible etiology as the disease shows predominance in women. Hormones have a particular effect on the medial tissue of the arterial wall. Other theories include immunologic injury, abnormal embryologic development, and abnormal distribution of vaso vasorum.
