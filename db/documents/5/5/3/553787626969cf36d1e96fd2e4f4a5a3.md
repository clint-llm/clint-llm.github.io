Meige syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team including primary care providers, neurologists, neurosurgeons, pharmacists, and nurses. The current treatments for Meige syndrome are not ideal and many therapies exist. Botulinum A does work for a short while but resistance build-up is common. Deep brain stimulation has been hyped as a panacea for many brain disorders but in Meige syndrome, the technique has not worked with any reliability, nor does it consistently provide relief of symptoms. Neuroscience nurses work with patients, provide education to them and their families, and communicate with the team about issues. Pharmacists review causative and treatment medications, check for drug drug interactions and provide education about proper administration. [Level 5]
