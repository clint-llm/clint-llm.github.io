A malfunctioning gallbladder causes cholecystitis. Bile is made in the liver and travels down the bile duct and is stored in the gallbladder. After eating certain foods, especially spicy or greasy foods, the gallbladder is stimulated to empty the bile out of the gallbladder, through the cystic duct, down the bile duct into the duodenum. This process aids in food digestion. If the gallbladder is not functioning properly, for various reasons, the bile may not empty completely. This may lead to stone formation. Gallstones can cause mechanical blockage of the cystic duct. A poorly functioning gallbladder without formation of stones causes acalculous cholecystitis.
