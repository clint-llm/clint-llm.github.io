Xanthomas are localized lipid deposits within an organ system. Although innately benign, they are often an important visible sign of systemic diseases. These lesions were initially described in the early 1900s, along with reports of their association with lipid metabolism.

As a clinical entity, the relevance of xanthomas extends to multiple disciplines, including general medicine, pediatrics, dermatology, and surgery. Their pathophysiology and management have generated much interest in current literature. They can involve essentially all anatomical regions and organ systems of the human body, but they tend to show predilection towards the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The natural history and patterns of spread of these lesions are closely associated with that of the specific underlying systemic disease which is responsible for their existence.
