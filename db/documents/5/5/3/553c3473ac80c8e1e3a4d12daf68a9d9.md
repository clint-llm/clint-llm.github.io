Esophageal perforation poses a significant interprofessional challenge to the entire therapeutic team. It can occur in three different anatomical compartments and therefore presents with diverse symptoms; most of them are highly non-specific which can significantly delay the time between perforation and final diagnosis. Despite the marked improvement in the availability of diagnostic techniques and therapeutic approaches, esophageal perforation remains a direct life-threatening condition with mortality rates reaching as high as 50%. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of esophageal perforation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the anatomy of the esophagus.
- Describe the presentation of esophageal perforation.
- Summarize the management of esophagel perforations.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by esophageal perforation.
