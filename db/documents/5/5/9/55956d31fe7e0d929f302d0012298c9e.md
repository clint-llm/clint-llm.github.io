ESP block is most often performed using an in-plane ultrasound-guided technique. It is a paraspinal fascial plane block in which the needle placement is between the erector spinae muscle and the thoracic transverse processes, and a local anesthetic is administered, blocking the dorsal and ventral rami of the thoracic and abdominal spinal nerves.

There is a hypothesis that the multi-dermatomal sensory block is due to the cranial and caudal spread of the injected local anesthetic. This spread is aided by the thoracolumbar fascia, which extends across the posterior thoracic wall and abdomen.
