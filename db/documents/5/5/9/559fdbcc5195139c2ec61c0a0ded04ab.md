The use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has expanded considerably over the past two decades allowing for enhanced and swift evaluations, rapid triage, improved diagnostic capabilities in austere situations, and real-time assessment of focused clinical questions in critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU).

These guidelines have continued to expand alongside the ever-growing use of ultrasound. They have been adopted by several other specialties, especially in applying “procedural ultrasound” to assist in real-time guidance of vascular access, peripheral nerve blockade, and pre-surgical evaluations.

The main difference between POCUS and dedicated ultrasound exams is the ability to rapidly answer a focused clinical question, facilitate serial examinations in clinical deterioration, or guide a bedside procedure rather than provide a detailed report with the grading of pathology.
