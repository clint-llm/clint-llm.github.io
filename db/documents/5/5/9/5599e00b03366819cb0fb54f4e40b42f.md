The vast majority of reported cases of AGEP are due to an adverse drug reaction, with several cases confirmed via patch testing. Systemic antibiotics are the most commonly implicated agents, particularly beta-lactam antibiotics and macrolides. Other drugs reported to trigger AGEP include hydroxychloroquine, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic drugs, as well as antineoplastic and antirheumatic agents, analgesics, anticonvulsants, and intravenous contrast media, among others. In some cases, even corticosteroids have been reported as the offending drugs.

AGEP has been associated with various triggers, including infections, spider bites, contact allergens, herbal remedies, and psoralen-UVA treatment. However, the cause of some cases remains unknown or lacks sufficient confirmation to identify a specific trigger.

Certain medications are reported as the suspected cause of AGEP.
