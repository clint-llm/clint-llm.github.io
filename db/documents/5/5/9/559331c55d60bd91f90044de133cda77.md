**Ventricular Septal Defect Closure**

According to the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology, recommendations for VSD closure are as follows

- Patients with left ventricular volume overload and hemodynamically significant shunts (Qp: Qs ≥1.5:1) should undergo VSD closure if pulmonary artery (PA) systolic pressure is less than 50% systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance is less than one-third systemic. [COR I, LOE B]

- Surgical closure of perimembranous or supra cristal VSD is reasonable in adults in the presence of worsening aortic regurgitation (AR) secondary to the VSD. [COR IIa, LOE C]

- Surgical closure of a VSD may also be reasonable in adults with a history of infective endocarditis secondary to a VSD if not otherwise contraindicated. [COR IIb, LOE C]

- Consider VSD closure in the presence of a net left-to-right shunt (Qp: Qs ≥1.5:1) when PA systolic pressure is 50% or more than systemic and/or pulmonary vascular resistance is greater than one-third systemic. [COR IIb, LOE C]

- Surgical VSD closure is currently the recommended form of VSD closure. While percutaneous transcatheter VSD closure is recommended in patients who are non-surgical candidates. Transcatheter closure is also a viable alternative to surgical intervention if conduction abnormalities are a concern.
