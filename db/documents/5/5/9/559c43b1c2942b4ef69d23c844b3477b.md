Isolated meniscal tears occur due to rotational or shearing forces placed across the tibiofemoral joint, especially when an increased axial load is placed through the menisci. Â Such scenarios include positions with increased degrees of closed kinetic chain flexion (kneeling, squatting), lifting/carrying heavyweights, and activities requiring rapid acceleration/deceleration, change of direction, and jumping.
