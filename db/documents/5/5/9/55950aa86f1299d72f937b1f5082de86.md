The most challenging aspect of managing invasive Candida auris infections is the level of drug resistance and the ability to develop drug resistance to the three main classes of antifungals, as previously discussed. A study from India investigated the susceptibility patterns of 350 C. auris isolates and showed that 90% were resistant to azoles (fluconazole), 8% were resistant to polyene (amphotericin B), and 2% were resistant to echinocandins (anidulafungin and micafungin).

In vitro investigations reveal that the synergistic use of antifungals has shown initial promising results for the use of combination treatment of voriconazole and micafungin for multiresistant isolates. However, this was not observed in other combinations of echinocandins and azole.

There is no concrete documentation for therapeutic options for C. auris infection. Most cases are managed on a case-by-case basis with the guidance of susceptibility testing. It is highly recommended that consultation from an infectious disease specialist is obtained. Treatment of C. auris should be started only in the presence of clinical disease and should be avoided in patients colonized with C. auris when isolated from non-invasive sites (respiratory tract, urine, and skin).

The CDC has published tentative guidelines for initial therapy.

Apart from timely antifungal therapy, the management of candidemia involves the removal of central venous catheters or other indwelling devices and draining collections as soon as possible. In the setting of repeated positive blood cultures, a search for a metastatic focus should be done to rule out endocarditis, suppurative thrombophlebitis, or abscess formation. Nonneutropenic patients with candidemia should undergo a dilated ophthalmologic eye examination within the first week of diagnosis and one week after recovery from neutropenia in neutropenic patients to evaluate for endophthalmitis, chorioretinitis, and vitritis. Repeat blood cultures should be performed daily or every other day to establish clearance of candidemia. The Infectious Disease Society of America recommends continuing antifungal therapy for two weeks after the blood cultures remain negative in patients without obvious metastatic complications.

Prevention of invasive infection in colonized individuals involves minimizing the entry of the organism into sterile body sites. Ensuring appropriate use of medical devices, such as central venous catheters, indwelling urinary catheters, and maintenance of tracheostomy sites is needed. Continuous assessment of the need for such invasive lines and tubes followed by prompt removal are basic strategies to mitigate the risk of introducing organisms to sterile sites. Patients undergoing surgical procedures should have meticulous skin preparation with an alcohol-based agent.

The site of infection plays a crucial role in the choice of antifungals for invasive infections. Echinocandins do not have adequate penetration into many sites, such as cerebrospinal fluid, because of their high molecular weight, and the very less active drug could be recovered from urine.
