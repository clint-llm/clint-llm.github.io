The available propylthiouracil tablet has 50 mg of the drug, and storage should be at room temperature. The dosage is as follows:

- Adults: Propylthiouracil is administered orally, initially as 300 mg/day in three divided doses every 8 hours (may reach up to 600 to 900 mg/day). After the initial treatment, the general maintenance dose is 100 to 150 mg/day. The dose is adjusted to maintain normal TSH, T3, and T4 levels.

- Graves disease (off label): PTU can be started as an initial dose of 50 to 150 mg three times a day 
- Thyrotoxic crisis/thyroid storm (off-label): The American Thyroid Association recommends 500 to 1000 mg as a loading dose of PTU, which can be followed by 250 mg every 4 hours. Recommendations are widely variable, and comparative trials have not taken place.
- Pediatric: Due to severe liver toxicity reported with the use of PTU, it is no longer approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in pediatric patients. 
-  Geriatric: Clinical studies incorporating the effects of PTU in patients over 65 years are lacking. PTU should be used cautiously in the geriatric age group, owing to an increased likelihood of co-morbidities and declined organ function in the elderly.

**Pharmacokinetics**

- Absorption: 75%

- Distribution: 80 to 85% of the drug is bound to plasma proteins (lipoproteins and albumin are the major binding proteins), Vd 0.4 L/kg. It concentrates in the thyroid gland.

- Onset: 24 to 36 hours are necessary for a significant therapeutic effect.

- Duration: 12 to 24 hours

- Half-life elimination: approximately 1 hour

- Metabolism: PTU primarily undergoes metabolism in the liver to glucuronides or inorganic sulfates.

- Elimination: 35% gets excreted as metabolites in the urine.

**Propylthiouracil and Patient Population Groups**

- Pediatric population: PTU has been associated with liver injury in both adult and pediatric populations, whereas no case reports suggest liver injury with methimazole in the pediatric population. Hence, PTU is not for use in the pediatric population.

- Renal impairment: Dose adjustment is not required.

- Hepatobiliary disease: PTU causes liver injury; hence, it is not used in patients with liver impairment. However, the manufacturer's label does not require dosage adjustment.

- Pregnant: PTU is a pregnancy category D drug. PTU can cross the placenta and can cause fetal cretinism and goiter. Methimazole causes fetal anatomical abnormalities; hence, if it is necessary to use antithyroid drugs in pregnancy, PTU is preferred in the first trimester with the lowest possible drug dose usage. Due to the increased reported risk of maternal hepatotoxicity from PTU, methimazole is the therapeutic choice in the second and third trimesters.

- Breastfeeding: PTU is excreted in breast milk in small amounts and delivered to infants. There are no clear-cut recommendations for its use in nursing. (AAP suggests it is compatible with nursing while AAFP says it is safe with nursing).

**Drug Interactions**

- Coumarins (oral): PTU inhibits vitamin K activity and hence increases the effects of oral anticoagulants. Therefore, PT/INR monitoring is necessary for such patients.

- Beta-blockers, digitalis, and theophylline: Patients with hyperthyroidism demonstrate an increased clearance of these drugs. When the patient becomes euthyroid, a decrease in the dose of beta-blockers and theophylline is required.
