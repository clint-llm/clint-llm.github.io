Typically, a lactating mother will present with a lump in her breast, which is insidious and gradually progressive. There is no history of pain or fever. Primipara, mothers who have difficulty breastfeeding, mothers who breastfeed intermittently, or mothers who use formula feed instead of breast milk, are more likely to develop galactocele as there is an incomplete evacuation of milk in the lactiferous ducts. It is essential to ask about medication history, as drugs like metoclopramide and domperidone are known galactagogues that increase the risk of galactocele formation.

The clinical finding is usually a mass in the breast that varies in its degree of tenderness. The mass is usually solitary, non-tender, firm, discrete, and freely movable, may or may not be associated with a milky discharge from the nipple, usually does not demonstrate the findings of acute infection or inflammation, and gives the impression of a solid tumor in a woman in the reproductive span of life.
