Orbital vascular anomalies (OVAs) comprise a diverse spectrum of lesions encountered within the orbit. Owing to the complex anatomy of the orbit, the controversial classification schemes of the vascular anomalies, variable clinical behavior of each subtype, and lack of understanding regarding the natural course of the disease, the management of OVAs is challenging. A meticulous evaluation and use of relevant imaging modalities and a coordinated step-wise approach are crucial for establishing an accurate diagnosis and initiating an appropriate treatment strategy.
