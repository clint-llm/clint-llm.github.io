The key element of appropriate treatment and management of allergic contact dermatitis due to nickel allergy is the identification and removal of the source object. Identifying the source may require a log of all daily exposures, an intense review of these exposures, and is likely to require multiple visits within the healthcare system. Providing patients with a list of objects that may be high in nickel is helpful as they may not realize conventional household products contain the metal.Â  Nickel test kits are commercially available and may be useful in the identification of potential sources. If the patient is determined to have a nickel allergy, management begins with avoidance of repeat exposure, as this is the most effective treatment option. It is important for patients to avoid scratching as it can lead to excoriation and increases the risk of infection. Patients should also avoid foods that are routinely high in nickel content, such as cocoa, chocolate, oatmeal, various nuts, and legumes.
