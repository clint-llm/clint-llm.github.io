Epistaxis is one of the most common emergencies in otolaryngology, with over 60% of the US population reporting having experienced a nosebleed at some point.

Posterior bleeds typically present briskly, with the location of the culprit vessel often difficult to identify and hemostasis correspondingly more challenging to achieve. Patients with posterior epistaxis are more likely to be hospitalized and twice as likely to require packing.
