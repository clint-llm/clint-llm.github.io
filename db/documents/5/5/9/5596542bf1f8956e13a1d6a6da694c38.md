After the surgical placement of internal distractors, the patients are admitted for airway observation. Patients are discharged once able to breathe without issues and are tolerating an adequate diet. After a latency period of 4-7 days for school-aged children, the distraction is activated at a rate of 1 mm per day until the desired length based on preoperative design. Parents are taught how to turn the distractor and keep the surgical site clean at home.

Once distraction is completed, the externally exposed rods are removed close to the skin. After 2Â to 3 months of bony consolidation, the patient is brought back to the operating room to remove the internal device. A series of cephalograms are taken at the beginning of activation, end of activation, prior to device removal, and 1 year postoperatively.
