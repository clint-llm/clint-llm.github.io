Patient education is vital to the early diagnosis of reperfusion injury considering in cases of limb ischemia symptoms like increased pain and decreased sensation are indicative of injury. Careful follow-up laboratory evaluation as well as close monitoring of renal function with fluid input and output are also crucial. Interdepartmental coordination and communication remains the mainstay of good healthcare provision. Patients should also be canceled well regarding the concept that revascularization following an ischemic episode is absolutely important and that it will always be associated with reperfusion injury that can exacerbate the initial injury. Early detection of ischemia as in cases of myocardial or cerebral infarction remains important.
