It has been well established that both medullary carcinoma and invasive ductal carcinoma with medullary features are associated with germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene.

Among BRCA1-associated breast cancers, 7.8% to 19% are medullary carcinomas, and 35% to 60% show the presence of medullary features. This rate contrasts with the presence of only 2% medullary carcinomas among sporadic, nonâ€“BRCA-associated tumors.

Medullary carcinoma has been shown to display the basal-like molecular subtype by gene expression profiling, which correlates with its immunophenotypic profile.

Most cases are aneuploid with a high S-phase fraction.
