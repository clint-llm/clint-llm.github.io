IgA nephropathy is a common form of glomerulonephritis caused by the deposition of IgA immunoglobulins in the glomerular basement membrane. Immune-mediated damage to the basement membrane results in hematuria and renal insufficiency. Pathologically, a spectrum of glomerular lesions may be seen; however, the most commonly observed change is the mesangial proliferation with prominent IgA deposition. It also carries the name Berger disease. Although IgA nephropathy is a common disease, the data on prevalence is not very accurate because a renal biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis. This activity reviews the etiology, pathogenesis, evaluation, and management of IgA nephropathy and explains the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of IgA nephropathy.
- Describe the evaluation of IgA nephropathy.
- Summarize the management options available for IgA nephropathy.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients affected by IgA nephropathy.
