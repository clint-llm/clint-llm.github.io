With reported Lyme disease cases on the rise, it is important to make a timely and correct diagnosis to avoid complications of Lyme disease (meningitis, encephalopathy, and atrioventricular block). To ensure rapid diagnosis and improved outcomes all facets of a healthcare team must work seamlessly together. This healthcare team involves the primary care physician, nurses, pharmacy, hospitals, consultants, and health departments (Level V). The primary care physician has a central role in effecting Lyme disease outcomes by being familiar with clinical manifestations of the disease, educating their patient population on prevention, and diligently reporting new cases. Pharmacists ensure that appropriate antibiotic selection is made as well as appropriate dosages. Consultants are pivotal when there are atypical presentations of Lyme Disease. The health department can impact outcomes by increasing public awareness and implementing intervention programs. Overall, outcomes for Lyme disease are excellent, and with an interprofessional approach, outcomes will be exceptional. (Level V)
