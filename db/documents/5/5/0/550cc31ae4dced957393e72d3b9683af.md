# Continuing Education Activity

Presbycusis refers to bilateral age-related hearing loss. In literal terms, presbycusis means 'old hearing' or 'elder hearing. It is the most common cause of hearing loss worldwide and is estimated to affect approximately two-thirds of Americans aged 70 or older. The hallmark of presbycusis is the impaired ability to understand high-frequency components of speech (voiceless consonants, such as p, k, f, s, and ch). This activity reviews the evaluation and management of presbycusis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the classic patient's history associated with presbycusis.
- Outline the appropriate evaluation of presbycusis.
- Review the management options available for presbycusis.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by presbycusis.

# Introduction

Presbycusis refers to bilateral age-related hearing loss. In literal terms, presbycusis means "old hearing" or "elder hearing."

During the normal hearing, sound, in the form of air vibration, is captured by the funnel-shaped external ear and is directed to the tympanic membrane. This causes the tympanic membrane to vibrate at a specific frequency and amplitude. This movement is amplified by three small bones in the middle ear: the malleus, incus, and stapes. From there, the signal proceeds as vibrations that are transmitted through the fluid within the inner ear to the cochlea. In the cochlea, receptors known as hair cells transform the information encoded in the vibrations into a neurologic signal which travels to the auditory cortex via the cochlear nerve.

# Etiology

Presbycusis is multifactorial in origin.****In addition to age-related degeneration leading to physiologic and anatomic changes, other contributing factors include genetic factors, hormones, exposure to loud noises or ototoxic agents, history of ear infection, and the presence of certain systemic diseases.

**Age-Related Factors**

Presbycusis can be broken down further with regards to which structures and functions are primarily affected. Some argue that there is little clinical utility in subdividing presbycusis as there is no significant change in approach or treatment, and oftentimes mixed pathology is present.

- Sensory presbycusis: loss of receptor hair cells at the basal aspect of the cochlea resulting in characteristic high-frequency hearing loss.

- Neural presbycusis: loss of cochlear nerve fibers as well as the loss of spiral ganglion neurons.

- Strial presbycusis: degeneration of stria vascularis cells. These cells are essential for maintaining the appropriate ion composition of endolymph to generate the endocochlear potential for signal transduction.

- Mechanical presbycusis (cochlear conductive): due to physical changes of the cochlear duct. This is accompanied by a specific audiogram pattern.

- Mixed presbycusis: characterized by pathologic changes in more than one of the above structures.

- Indeterminate presbycusis: cases in which changes to the above structures are not significant.

**Genetic Factors**

Genetic factors, specifically, differences in mitochondrial DNA expression genes related to oxidative stress, have been found in patients with presbycusis when compared to controls.

**Ototoxic Factors**

There are multiple medications associated with ototoxicity, including salicylates, loop diuretics, aminoglycoside, and certain chemotherapeutic agents.****Minimizing exposure to these agents can help to prevent age-related hearing loss.

**Noise Exposure Factors**

Some long-term studies have shown that individuals who have sustained noise-induced cochlear damage in their youth go on to develop more severe presbycusis**.**Anatomically, noise exposure may lead to damage and subsequent loss of spiral ganglion neurons.

**Hormonal Factors**

Glucocorticoids, sex hormones, and glutamate signaling are thought to play a role in presbycusis.

# Epidemiology

Presbycusis is the most common cause of hearing loss worldwide and is estimated to affect approximately two-thirds of Americans aged 70 or older.

Worldwide, there are similar increases in prevalence with age. Presbycusis affects more than half of older adults by age 75 and nearly all adults over age 90.****The World Health Organization estimates that by 2025, among those aged 60 and above, greater than 500 million will have significant age-related hearing loss.

# Pathophysiology

Presbycusis is thought to be multifactorial in origin, and some components are not fully understood. Both intrinsic factors, such as genetics, as well as external factors (noise exposure, smoking, medications, and certain co-morbidities), are involved.****Presbycusis is a type of sensorineural hearing loss with the involvement of the inner ear or neurologic pathways that form connections to the auditory cortex.

# History and Physical

Presbycusis is generally insidious in onset, and mild cases are difficult to detect. It is imperative that primary care providers screen for hearing loss, especially geriatricians and those caring for adults age 60 and beyond. Often, family members and friends are more aware of hearing loss than patients themselves. A common initial presentation is difficulty discriminating speech in specific situations, such as a room with significant background noise.

The general physical exam is usually unremarkable in patients with presbycusis. It is common for older adults to have age-related benign opacification of the tympanic membrane and build-up of cerumen.

# Evaluation

Routine physical exam maneuvers alone are not sufficient for diagnosing presbycusis. An in-office screening audiometry test administered by trained personnel should be considered by providers such as geriatricians who have a large population of older adults at high risk of presbycusis. There should be a low threshold for referral for definitive auditory testing in patients suspected of presbycusis. Imaging is usually not performed except in cases in which there is a discrepancy between presentation and auditory testing, or there are associated neurological changes.

There are many variations of audiometry testing and central auditory testing that are beyond the scope of this review. In general, an audiometry exam tests the ability to hear sounds at varying intensity (loudness) and frequencies (tone). Commonly, pure tone testing (also known as an audiogram) is performed in patients with suspected age-related hearing loss. Pure tones are delivered through the use of headphones to one ear at a time. Patients are asked to respond if they hear a sound. The results are presented in the form of an audiogram, a graph with hearing level (in decibels) on the y-axis and frequency (in hertz) on the x-axis. In presbycusis, the highest frequency sounds are typically affected first, followed by lower and lower frequency sounds as the condition progresses.

Laboratory testing for diseases commonly associated with hearing loss, such as dyslipidemia, diabetes, and renal dysfunction, may be indicated but are not required for diagnosis.

# Treatment / Management

There is no cure for presbycusis. Hearing aids are the mainstay of treatment and have been shown to have a significantly positive effect on the quality of life and communication.

As extrinsic factors are thought to have a role in the progression of presbycusis, wearing earplugs or earmuffs to attenuate sounds may be helpful if the patient needs to be exposed to loud noises. A diet low in saturated fat may help slow hearing loss.

There is an abundance of ongoing research regarding the genetic and metabolic components of age-related hearing loss. Due to the potential role of oxidative damage, it was thought that antioxidants might slow the progression of hearing loss. While the administration of alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to prevent age-related hearing loss in rats, an antioxidant-enriched diet in humans did not delay the progression of hearing loss. Other agents, such as coenzyme Q-10 and ginkgo biloba, have been studied and lack sufficient evidence for use. Additionally, the use of these supplements is controversial as prolonged administration has been associated with an increase in overall mortality.****There are ongoing investigations into potential gene and hormone therapies for hearing loss.

# Differential Diagnosis

Presbycusis is a diagnosis of exclusion.

- Noise exposure

- Infection

- Ménière disease

- Trauma

- Autoimmune disease

- Perilymph fistula

- Genetically-inherited hearing loss

- Otosclerosis

- Tumor

- Exposure to ototoxic agents

- Metabolic dysfunction

In addition to audiometry, further testing such as imaging or metabolic assessment can be considered if hearing loss does not follow classic presbycusis characteristics. Other conditions associated with presbycusis, such as diabetes, hypertension, renal impairment, and hyperlipidemia, should be evaluated.

If the pattern of hearing loss is conductive, then an alternative diagnosis to presbycusis should be considered. These include:

- Cerumen impaction

- Foreign body

- Tumor obstruction

- Infection

- Perforation

- Otosclerosis

- Cholesteatoma

Presbycusis should be considered in older adults presenting with changes in mood and cognition as these may be due to underlying hearing impairment.

# Prognosis

Age-related changes in hearing are a natural consequence of getting older. Typically, presbycusis does not lead to deafness but ignored or untreated presbycusis can have serious consequences on mental, cognitive, and even physical health.

# Complications

Impaired hearing contributes to cognitive dysfunction in older adults.

****Negative effects on mood, such as increased incidence of anxiety, depression, and lethargy, can be present.

Impaired high-frequency hearing can pose serious safety concerns, as it may be difficult for older adults to respond to warnings and signals, such as doorbells, ringing phones, smoke alarms, and turn signals. There is evidence for a relationship between hearing loss and postural control in older adults, which may be related to the perception of one's motion and position in space.

# Consultations

Management of patients suffering from presbycusis is teamwork, following specialties can help in the management of these patients to improve outcomes.

- Audiology: referral for formal audiometry testing, hearing aid fitting, and education

- Otolaryngology: if the hearing impairment is sudden in onset, asymmetric, or concern for different auditory pathology

- Neurology: for further investigation into other causes of hearing impairment, especially if there are cooccurring neurologic signs and symptoms (headache, loss of balance, vertigo, facial numbness/weakness, visual changes)

- Gerontology: if there are concerns for concurrent cognitive impairment or dementia

- Oncology: if there are concerns for ototoxicity related to specific cancer treatment regimens

- Psychiatry: for negative effects on mood, anxiety, and depression

# Deterrence and Patient Education

A certain degree of presbycusis is inevitable with aging. It is important to educate patients, caretakers, and colleagues about the high prevalence of age-related hearing impairment and its many consequences. Successful interventions do exist. Early identification and treatment may help to slow progression and improve the quality of life.

Because poor hearing is associated with cardiovascular risk factors, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, avoiding smoking, staying physically and cognitively active may help to delay the onset and slow the progression of hearing loss.

Maintaining clean ears by safely removing cerumen and avoiding loud noises without ear protection may help to prevent other causes of hearing loss that can worsen the symptoms of presbycusis.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Presbycusis is very common and can have profound consequences on the quality of life. Due to wide variations in presentation, diagnosis may be delayed if patients are not specifically screened for hearing loss. Collaboration in care is an integral component of delivering efficient and effective health care. While the responsibility for screening rests mainly among primary care providers, most do not consistently assess hearing due to various barriers such as lack of time and reimbursement and the onus to address more pressing health issues.

Prompt referral to an audiometrist or other care provider who can perform specific audiometric testing is warranted in patients who are suspected of having age-related hearing loss. Subspecialties in areas such as otolaryngology, neurology, and geriatrics also have an opportunity to screen for presbycusis. Additionally, nurses and other allied health professionals can help to screen older patients by asking about hearing problems during an encounter. Collaboration between audiologists and primary care providers has the potential to increase awareness of the prevalence of hearing loss and the importance of audiological rehabilitation.

Interprofessional communication remains important after the diagnosis of presbycusis is made. Aural rehabilitation is essential in the management of age-related hearing loss. Hearing aids require significant time and effort from the patient and continued encouragement by the primary care provider and audiometry team.
