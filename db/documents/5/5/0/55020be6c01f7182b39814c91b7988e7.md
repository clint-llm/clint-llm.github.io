The shoulder girdle is a complex articulation connecting the upper extremity to the axial skeleton. The glenohumeral joint of the shoulder is the most commonly dislocated joint in the body and accounts for approximately 50% of all major dislocations seen in the emergency department. Posterior shoulder dislocations account for about 2% to 5% of all shoulder dislocations. Recurrent posterior dislocations occur in 30% of patients and predispose the joint to degenerative changes. Dislocations in a posterior direction can be difficult to diagnose, so a high index of suspicion should be maintained when the typical history and findings on the physical exam are present.
