Glucocorticoids are widely used to manage many acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. The adverse effects of glucocorticoids are extensive and can involve many organ systems. While short-term use of corticosteroids is associated with mild side effects, long-term use can result in several severe adverse effects, some of which are irreversible. This is why an interprofessional team approach to corticosteroid therapy and subsequent monitoring is necessary. Clinicians shall consider adverse effects and patients' underlying comorbidities before prescribing glucocorticoids and use glucocorticoids judiciously. The clinician should use the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible. Patient education is vital in recognizing the adverse effects early. Children are particularly vulnerable to the side effects of corticosteroids, and parents need to understand the benefits and adverse effects of glucocorticoids. Pharmacists shall alert physicians about possible drug interactions, check dosing and duration, and answer patient questions. The nursing team can play a crucial role in communication with the patient, early detection of adverse effects, and regular monitoring.

Close communication with other health professionals is necessary to ensure that the patient is not left unmonitored.
