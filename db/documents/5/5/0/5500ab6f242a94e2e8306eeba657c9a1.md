The most important factor in reducing the rate of infection is the administration of early antibiotics.

**Acceptable Alignment**

- <5 degrees of varus/ valgus

- <10 degrees

- >50% cortical apposition

- <1 cm of shortening

- <5-10 rotational deformity

Acceptable alignment is when the fracture falls within the acceptable alignment parameters listed above.  In fractures with moderate displacement, a closed reduction can be performed to obtain acceptable alignment. Nonoperative management is also a consideration in patients treated with long leg casting.

**Operative**

- Intramedullary rod - is the most common treatment for tibial diaphyseal fractures. It is the preferred treatment method for closed fractures and low-grade open fractures

- Open reduction internal fixation - can be used to treat tibial fractures but is more common on the fracture extends into the articular surface or is not amenable to an intramedullary fixation

- External fixation - is helpful significant swelling or extensive soft tissue damage. An external fixator is used as a temporizing surgery until it can convert to internal fixation.

- Irrigation and Debridement-required for all open injuries

- Fasciotomies - should be performed when there is clinical concern for compartment syndrome.  A stryker monitor can be used to measure compartment pressures especially in sedated patients
