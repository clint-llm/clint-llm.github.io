Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is an example of an accessory pathway syndrome, characterized by a short PR interval (< 120 ms), a prolonged QRS (> 100 ms), and a delta wave (a slurred upstroke to the QRS complex). Patients with WPW can occasionally present with an antidromic reentry tachycardia, in which the accessory pathway is the anterograde limb, and the AV node is the retrograde pathway. These typically present with a wide complex, regular, and extremely rapid tachycardia. In these cases, AV nodal blocking agents like adenosine are contraindicated because they can allow unopposed retrograde conduction through the accessory pathway, leading to ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Procainamide (15 mg/kg to 18 mg/kg loading dose, 1 mg/min to 4 mg/min maintenance infusion) is the first-line treatment of this tachydysrhythmia, followed by amiodarone (150 mg over 10 minutes, followed by 360 mg over six hours, then 540 mg over 18 hrs). For ventricular rates greater than 250 bpm, consider synchronized cardioversion at 100 J  to 200 J.
