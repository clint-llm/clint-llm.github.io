The most effective preventive measure against oral cutaneous fistula (OCF) is oral hygiene. Preventative measures against dental caries and thus dentoalveolar abscess are tooth brushing, flossing, and fluoridation of communal drinking water. A regular dental check-up should be done. In case of a toothache or dental abscess, immediately consult a dentist.
