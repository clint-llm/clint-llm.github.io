Wound healing is a natural physiological reaction to tissue injury. However, wound healing is not a simple phenomenon and involves a complex interplay between numerous cell types, cytokines, mediators, and the vascular system. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of wounds and discusses the various wound healing phases, highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with a wound.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the initial phases of wound healing.
- Identify the mediators of the inflammatory phase of wound healing.
- Outline the physiologic processes involved in the proliferative phase of wound healing.
- Summarize the factors that promote the development of chronic wounds.
