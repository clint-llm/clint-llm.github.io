The sacrum is a large triangular bone made up of five separate vertebrae, which fuse during childhood and early adulthood.

Nerves from the S2-S4 spinal levels leave the spinal canal via the ventral rami of the sacrum. The nerve roots form pelvic splenic nerves, which serve to innervate the lower gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and sexual organs.

ART is often performed repetitively to free all ranges of motion of a joint. The articulatory technique described here, sacral rocking, accentuates the physiologic respiratory motion of the sacrum. During exhalation, the base (superior portion) of the sacrum moves posteriorly, termed counternutation/extension. In contrast, during inhalation, the sacrum nutates/flexes as the sacral base moves anteriorly. By accentuating the natural motion of the sacrum with respiration, sacral rocking can restore physiological freedom of motion in each of the sacrumâ€™s four articulations, without putting excessive stress on ligaments and surrounding structures.
