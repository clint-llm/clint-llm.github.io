Fasting hypoglycemia is the most characteristic finding of insulinoma, reported in 73% of the population.

Hypoglycemia presents in different ways. Sympathoadrenal activation symptoms can be seen, including palpitations, tremulousness, and diaphoresis. Severe hypoglycemia can cause neuroglycopenic symptoms, including blurry vision, confusion, seizures, or a behavioral change. Amnesia of the hypoglycemic event is common.

Insulinoma should be suspected when a patient presents with the Whipple’s triad, which includes: symptoms of hypoglycemia, a documented low plasma glucose concentration, and subsequent improvement of the symptoms with the use of glucose treatment.

In rare cases reported in the literature, the insulinoma may present with psychiatric symptoms, especially panic attacks.
