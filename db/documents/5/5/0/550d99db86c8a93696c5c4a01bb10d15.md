Types of tests include cellular assays, immunologic, and molecular tests.

Conventionally, HLA classes are detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR uses variable exon sequences that encode the first amino-terminal from the HLA domains. From there, the HLA sequences from the database are used in hybridization with the amplified PCR products.

There have also been recent developments in less expensive assays to detect specific HLA antigens, such as high-resolution melting assays.

The standard technique for identifying HLA class I and class II antigens has been the complement-mediated microlymphocytotoxicity technique. In this technique, HLA sera are obtained from alloimmunized women, and those specificities get determined by matching against a panel with already known HLA types.

Testing for HLA antigens often is by bead-based multiplexed immunoassay system technology. In this test, HLA protein beads coat the surface of microspheres. A fluorescence quantification system measures the level of HLA antibody binding to each of the beads.

Testing in patients with HLA antibodies in their circulation requires a cross-match before transplantation. This traditional cross-match entails patient serum mixed with lymphocytes that have derived from the donor. "Virtual" cross matches may also be done to estimate the transplant risk by measuring the levels of circulating HLA antibody using single antigen beads and bead-based multiplexed immunoassay system technology.
