Even though the collection of BAL samples is not standardized, experts suggest following a protocol to minimize contamination and artifacts. The recovered lavage fluid should be pooled, mixed, and the volume recorded. The fluid should be sent to the laboratory while stored on ice if the transportation is going to be delayed by more than 1 hour. Studies show that cells in BAL fluid can remain viable for 4 hours at room temperature. The fluid is usually analyzed for white and red cells. To distinguish immature macrophages from large lymphocytes, esterase staining is employed. Other stains may evaluate for the presence of iron, malignant cells, inorganic dust, and microorganism. In general, if the BAL specimen contain less than 2 million total cells or has fewer than ten alveolar macrophages per high-power field, or contains a high number of red cells (due to trauma) or there are degenerative changes, the specimen should not be relied upon to make any valid diagnosis. Of note, the average number of cells recovered from BAL fluid in healthy nonsmoking adults varies from 100-150,000/ml. Smoking increases the number of cells by 4-6 fold, of which most are macrophages.
