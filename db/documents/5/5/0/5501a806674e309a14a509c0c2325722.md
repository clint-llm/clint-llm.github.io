Diverticulosis is usually asymptomatic, or it may cause episodes of bleeding. Approximately fifteen percent will develop diverticular bleeding. If inflammation develops within the diverticula, around eighty-five percent of people will respond to medical treatment. The remaining people may need a surgical procedure to get the inflamed diverticula fixed. Overall, the prognosis for most patients is good as long as they change their lifestyle, become physically active, eat a high fiber diet, and avoid constipation.
