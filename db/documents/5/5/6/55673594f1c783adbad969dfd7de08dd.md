While no muscles immediately act on the SC joint, it is important to reinforce that the movement of the SC joint primarily depends on the motion of the scapula and the entire shoulder girdle, including the clavicle. Muscles inserting on the clavicle that influence movement of the SC joint are the deltoid, pectoralis major, trapezius, and sternocleidomastoid muscles. Other muscles influencing movement at the SC joint and their respective innervations are in the "muscles" section of this article.
