Nasopalatine duct cysts present histologically with an epithelial-lined cyst wall surrounded by fibrovascular connective tissue, oftentimes with minor salivary glands as incidental findings.

Nasolabial cysts present histologically with pseudostratified columnar epithelium with occasional stratified squamous epithelium.

Palatal cysts of the neonate are diagnosed clinically and therefore require no additional tests.

Oral lymphoepithelial cysts present histologically as a cyst lined by stratified squamous epithelium surrounded by lymphoid tissue.

Epidermoid cysts present histologically as keratinized stratified squamous epithelium-lined cysts without dermal appendages in the underlying fibrous connective tissue. With more diagnostic imaging modalities, such as a CT scan, lesions may appear as well-circumscribed, unilocular, low-density masses.
