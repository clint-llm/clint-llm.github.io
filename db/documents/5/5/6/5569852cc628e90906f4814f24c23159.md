The gain of function mutation in the ACVR1/ALK2 gene, which encodes for ALK2 kinases, induces signal transduction by ALK2 in response to ligand binding.

Since these type II receptors are constitutively active ser/thr kinases, phosphorylation of ALK2 occurs at the GS domain consisting of glycine and serine residues in the ternary complex formed by the ligand binding to ALK2 at the cell membrane. This phosphorylated ALK2, in turn, activates the kinase activity and phosphorylates serine and threonine residues in the downstream substrates such as SMAD1, SMAD5, and Smad8/9.

These phosphorylated Smad proteins bind to specific DNA sequences and regulate the transcription of the target genes in the nucleus and result in the heterotopic ossification seen in patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Thus, all these mutations induce intracellular signaling where ALK2 acts as the type 1 receptor in co-operation with the type II receptors.
