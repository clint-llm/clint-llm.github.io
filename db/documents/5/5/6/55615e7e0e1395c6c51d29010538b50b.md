While there is no specific association of lymph nodes with the external jugular vein, the posterior lateral superficial cervical nodes lie in close proximity to the external jugular vein and the peri-facial lymph nodes may abut the retromandibular vein in some patients.  Additionally, the thoracic duct drains into the subclavian vein near the junction of the external jugular, internal jugular, and the subclavian vein, classically inserting immediately lateral to the junction of the internal jugular and subclavian. Further discussion of the thoracic duct and its anatomical variants can be found in StatPearls under this topic.    The thoracic duct primarily drains lymphatic fluid from the left half of the body above the diaphragm as well as the entire body below the diaphragm.
