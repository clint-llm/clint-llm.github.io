The modified Centor criteria is a clinical aid for physicians to determine who to test and treat when GAS pharyngitis is suspected. However, the Infectious Disease Society of American (IDSA) currently notes that the signs and symptoms of GAS pharyngitis overlap too broadly with other infectious and non-infectious causes to allow for a precise diagnosis to be made based upon history and physical alone.

The broad overlap of signs and symptoms seen in bacterial and viral pharyngitis coupled with the inaccuracy of medical providers when distinguishing GAS pharyngitis from other causes, the IDSA recommends confirmatory bacterial testing in all cases except when a clear viral etiology is expected. Diagnostic testing in children younger than 3 is not recommended because both GAS pharyngitis and acute rheumatic fever are rare in this age group. However, children under 3 years of age with risk factors, including but not limited to siblings with GAS pharyngitis, may be considered for testing.

For those who undergo testing, the IDSA recommends that a rapid antigen detection test (RADT) be employed as the first-line measure to aid the physician in the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis. Positive tests do not need to be backed up by a throat culture in all age groups due to the highly specific nature of the RADT. In children, a negative RADT should be followed by a throat culture, but this is not needed in adults due to both the low incidence of GAS pharyngitis and acute rheumatic fever seen in this population. Anti-streptococcal antibody titers are not recommended to aid the physician in the acute diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis because the test reflects previous infections. Following treatment, a test of cure is not needed but may be considered in special circumstances.
