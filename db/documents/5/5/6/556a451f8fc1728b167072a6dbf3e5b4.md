Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a condition also known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD), is a genetic disorder of the myocardium. ARVC/D is due to fatty infiltration of the right ventricular free wall. This results from the mutation of genes and can cause sudden death in young people and athletes. This activity reviews the presentation of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).
- Review the clinical presentation of a patient with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).
- Outline the treatment and management options available for arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).
