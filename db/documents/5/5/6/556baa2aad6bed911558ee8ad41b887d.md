Metformin-associated lactic acidosis is an important topic for practitioners of different specialties, including emergency physicians, internists, critical care physicians, toxicologists, pharmacists, and nephrologists. A multidisciplinary approach is required to stabilize patients during the acute toxicity phase. Patients with concerns for MALA should have the following:

- Obtain and monitor vital signs

- Contact your local Poison Control Center for assistance with management and epidemiology collection.

- Extensive laboratory assessment to search for additional and alternative causes of patientâ€™s presentation.

- Aggressive treatment of severe acidosis with initiation sodium bicarbonate and hemodialysis when indicated.

Patients with symptoms or evidence of MALA should be admitted. If the acidosis is severe, they require bicarbonate or extracorporeal renal clearance or require vasopressor or ventilator support; they should be admitted to the ICU. Patients who remain asymptomatic and do not have evidence of MALA on evaluation during an observational period of at least 12 hours can be safely discharged.
