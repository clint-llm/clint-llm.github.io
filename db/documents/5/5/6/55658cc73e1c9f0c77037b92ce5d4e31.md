As a major intracellular cation, potassium acts to preserve acid-base balance and maintain isotonicity and electrodynamic cellular function. It activates many enzymatic reactions within our body. It plays an essential role in the transmission of nerve impulses, contraction of cardiac muscles, skeletal and smooth muscles, tissue synthesis, gastric secretion, and renal function. Potassium reduces mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

Normal serum potassium values are between 3.5 and 5.0 millimoles/L (mmol/L). Levels outside this range correlate with increased rates of death from several causes.
