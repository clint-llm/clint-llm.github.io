Neuropathies are a common manifestation in the hand compartments. Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common neuropathy of the hand compartments, affecting 1 to 3 persons in 1000 per year. The specific cause is unknown, but it is a multifactorial syndrome.

CTS diagnosis is via electromyography and nerve conduction testing. Treatment begins conservatively, usually starting with a reduction in provoking factors. The next step is implementing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and a nightly wrist splint. The subsequent step is to use a local glucocorticoid injection to decrease the inflammation. The final intervention is to release the carpal tunnel surgically to decompress the components.
