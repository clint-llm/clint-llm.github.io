Patients most commonly present for emergency services with altered mental status and hypothermia, below 35.5°C (95.9° F). The lower the body temperature, the worst is the prognosis.

The salient features in the examination are as follows.

- Altered mentation - can be very subtle, like depressed affect, apathy, decreased intellectual capacity, confusion, short attention span, and disorientation. Rarely psychosis and coma. All patients with decreased alertness need to be screened for depression.

- Hypoventilation and sleep apnea

- Hypothermia - hypoglycemia and cold weather may present as severe hypothermia. Not every patient is hypothermic, and some patients may be normothermic.

- Dry, cool, and doughy skin (nonpitting edema, puffiness)

- Alopecia

- Decreased mobility

- Delayed reflex relaxation

- Diastolic hypertension followed by hypotension

- Bradycardia

- Bladder dystonia and distention

- Abdominal distention, paralytic ileus causing megacolon

- Fecal impaction (always perform rectal examination)
