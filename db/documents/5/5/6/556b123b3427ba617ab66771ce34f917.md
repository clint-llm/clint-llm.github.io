There are two forms E. histolytica can take: the cyst form, which can survive in the environment for a prolonged period, and the trophozoite stage, which is the active and invasive form. After the ingestion of the cyst form, trophozoites can be formed, which can invade and penetrate intestinal mucosa destroying epithelial cells and inflammatory cells.

The pathogenesis of infection by trophozoites is due to the adherence of colonic epithelial cells through a specific galactose-N-acetylgalactosamine lectin.

The pathological range includes mucosal inflammation, thickening, ulcers, and necrosis, leading to perforation. Amoebic cysteine proteinases can also contribute to trophozoites' ability to suppress a host’s immune response by being able to cleave and inactivate anaphylatoxins C3a, C5a, IgA, and IgG.
