Generally, anti-emetic medications are well tolerated. As indicated above, side effects range from more common (mild headaches and dizziness) to rare (anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity.) The list of all side effects is beyond the scope of this document, and the practitioner should review all possible side effects (common and uncommon) before prescribing these medications. However, as noted, extrapyramidal symptoms to including tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, and dystonia, are well described. QTc prolongation and subsequent Torsades de Pointes can also be a life-threatening complications and should be considered when prescribing these medications.
