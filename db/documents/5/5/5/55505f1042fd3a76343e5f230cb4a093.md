Nurses function as integral team members during procedural sedation. They are tasked with patient assessment by nursing standards, controlling the room with the procedure will be performed, and ensuring the patient has adequate monitoring in place, including IV access. The nurse should also ensure that they seek out training opportunities to be adept at administering and monitoring these medications. Additionally, nurses have a professional obligation to ensure that their professional societies support the nurses' education and function as full team members to the top of their license. This support includes advocating for the elimination of non-evidence-based restrictions on nursing practice.
