Although the etiology of atrophic gastritis is still being debated, we know H. pylori bacteria are the main culprit for chronic atrophic gastritis. Over time, this can lead to progressive loss and destruction of gastric glands described as multifocal atrophic gastritis. The prevalence of the infection is almost 50% of the world population. H. pylori were initially found to be the cause of gastric and duodenal ulcers in the early 1980s. The difficulty arises in the management of individuals infected with the pathogen that can then adversely affect the management of esophageal disease.

Autoimmune gastritis is due to the destruction of oxyntic mucosa cells from autoantibodies against the H+/K+ ATPase antigen protein resulting in mucosal atrophy. This autoimmune reaction predominantly attacks the body and fundus of the stomach where the oxyntic cells are located (parietal and chief cells), sparing the antrum.
