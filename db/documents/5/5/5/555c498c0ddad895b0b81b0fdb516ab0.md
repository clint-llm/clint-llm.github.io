- Hypertensive urgency is an acute, severe elevation in blood pressure without signs or symptoms of end-organ damage.

- Proposed blood pressure levels indicating hypertensive urgency are arbitrary and not associated with short-term morbidity and mortality.

- The focus should be onÂ symptoms of end-organ damage in the patient's history, including chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neurologic deficits, and vision changes.

- Caution is advised in pregnant patients with hypertension. Preeclampsia can ensue at lower blood pressure levels than expected in other hypertensive emergencies.

- Treat the patient, not the number. For example, rapidly bringing down blood pressure in a patient without end-organ damage may result in relative hypoperfusion and harm the patient rather than help.
