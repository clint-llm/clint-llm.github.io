Prompt diagnosis and treatment of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is critical for the optimal neurodevelopmental outcome and requires interprofessional communication, and care coordination by newborn screen laboratory, primary care physicians, and pediatric endocrinologists are important. Abnormal NBS test results should be communicated immediately to the responsible physician, who will then contact the family so that follow-up testing and evaluation can be arranged, preferably on the day of results become available or on the next day at the latest.

Patient education on CH and the importance of treatment adherence and follow-up care needs must be emphasized to the family. Demonstration L-T4 administration to newborns should be provided by nurses. If follow-up thyroid testing after treatment initiation does not show normalized free T4 or decreased TSH level to less than 20 mIU/mL within 4 weeks, physicians and healthcare team (nurses) should evaluate compliance, dosage, and administration method. Moreover, ongoing counseling at each follow-up visit should be provided for the family.
