Hydrocodone is a schedule II semi-synthetic opioid medication used to treat pain.

- Hydrocodone is FDA approved for managing severe pain to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative (non-opioid) treatments are inadequate. It is essential to recognize that hydrocodone is not intended for use as PRN (as needed) opioid analgesic.

- Hydrocodone is also an antitussive and is indicated for nonproductive cough in adults. In January 2018, the FDA required safety labeling changes for prescription cough and cold medicines containing hydrocodone or codeine to limit the use of these products to adults 18 years of age and older.
