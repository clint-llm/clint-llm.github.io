Meningioma is a known benign central nervous system tumor commonly arising from the meninges of the brain and spinal cord. The rate of recurrence and the risk of transformation to malignancy is dependent on the histopathological type of meningioma. Meningioma is classified into three grades, according to the World Health Organization. Prompt diagnosis, as well as understanding the severity of the tumor, would aid in the better future management of the patient. Since most patients with meningioma are asymptomatic, the management is usually done with close observation and follow-up with serial imaging. However, symptomatic patients usually require surgery to lower the risk of recurrence and severity of the disease. This activity highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in the management of patients suffering from meningiomas.
