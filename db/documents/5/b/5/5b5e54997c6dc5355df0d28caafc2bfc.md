The differential diagnosis for leukocytosis is broad. It is helpful for clinicians to be able to separate acute versus chronic leukocytosis, as well as to evaluate the degree of leukocytosis. The higher the WBC count, the more likely a significant acute reaction is occurring, or malignancy is the underlying cause. The following is a general list of considerations that a clinician should have when evaluating a leukocytosis:

- 
**Acute leukocytosis**

- 
              
- Leukemoid reaction
              
              
- Reactive causes
              
              
- Infection
              
              
- Acute allergies
              
              
- Tissue ischemia
              
              
- Drugs/medications (epinephrine, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, cephalosporin antibiotics, anticonvulsants, beta-agonists, allopurinol, penicillin-derivative antibiotics, illicit substances)
              
              
- Vaccine administration
              
              
- Myocardial infarction/injury
              
              
- HemorrhageÂ 
              
              
- Acute hemolysis
              
              
- Sepsis/septic shock
              
              
- Pregnancy

- 
**Chronic leukocytosis**

- 
              
- Smoking
              
              
- Obesity
              
              
- Chronic allergies
              
              
- Autoimmune phenomenon
              
              
- Vasculitis
              
              
- Connective tissue diseases
              
              
- Malignancy
              
              
- Pregnancy
              
              
- Chronic infection
