Smooth muscle derives from both mesoderm and neural crest cells; this is because smooth muscle contributes to many different tissues throughout the body. One unique feature of neural crest cells is that their migration occurs during embryological development. For this reason, numerous tissues throughout the body originate from neural crest cells. Neural crest cells play a vital role in the development of smooth muscle throughout the body, specifically in the regulation of blood vessels.

Vascular smooth muscle cells arise from multiple origins; this becomes medically significant because they may contribute to the site-specific localization of vascular diseases. For example, atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms often present at specific vascular locations. In the past, this appeared to be related to hemodynamics and underlying vessel structure. However, there is increasing evidence that smooth muscle cell embryonic lineage may play a role in determining the location and presentation of diseases.
