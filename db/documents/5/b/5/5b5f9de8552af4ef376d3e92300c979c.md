The etiologies of visual changes in preeclampsia are numerous, as are their resulting manifestations. Preeclampsia is defined as the first instance after 20 weeks of gestation of systolic blood pressure above 140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure above 90 mmHg and proteinuria of greater than 300 mg/day.

Visual pathology from preeclampsia can arise de novo or result from exacerbation of pre-existing ocular or intracranial disease by hypertension, which is hallmark preeclampsia, and blood-glucose dysregulation that can also be associated.
