Management of an overdose of fibric acids is primarily symptomatic. Signs and symptoms of overdose may include increased CPK, abnormal liver function tests, abdominal pain, diarrhea, joint and muscle pain, nausea, and vomiting. Fibric acids are highly protein-bound, which rules out the use of hemodialysis. Emesis or gastric lavage may be used in cases of fibric acid overdose so long as the usual precautions for airway maintenance are in place.
