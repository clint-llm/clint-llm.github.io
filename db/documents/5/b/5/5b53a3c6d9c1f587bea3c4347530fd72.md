There were 8.6 million myocardial infarctions in 2013 worldwide.Â  Inferior wall MIs are estimated to be 40% to 50% of all MIs. They have a better prognosis than other myocardial infarctions, with a mortality of 2% to 9%. However, up to 40% of inferior wall MIs have associated right ventricular involvement that portends a worse outcome.
