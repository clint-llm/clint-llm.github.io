Any patient presenting to the clinic with complaints of defective near vision should be meticulously evaluated to rule out any other ocular pathology. The patient must be made to understand what presbyopia is and what are the management options.

Patients willing to use contact lenses should be counseled in detail regarding the contact lenses available and the benefits of one lens over the other. Patients should be explained about contact lens complications and the need to maintain ocular hygiene while applying contact lenses. The examining ophthalmologist, optometrist, and nursing team play a key role in the meticulous management of these patients. The patient should understand that they will require a change of presbyopic correction with age, and there will be a need for contact lens change in the future.
