Schistocytes or helmet cells present on a peripheral blood smear are diagnostic of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Hepatic histology shows fatty infiltration, intravascular fibrin deposits, neutrophilic infiltrate, sinusoidal obstruction, intrahepatic vascular congestion, hepatic necrosis, and periportal hemorrhage. This may eventually result in intraparenchymal or subcapsular hemorrhage and capsular rupture.
