Numerous exercise monitoring systems are available for commercial purchase. These systems allow for the measurement of exhaled gas with each breath, as well as the real-time analysis of inhaled and exhaled oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. Volume measurement of inspired and expired air is possible through the use of an airflow transducer. Typically the exercise is conducted on either a stationary cycle ergometer or a motorized treadmill, with reproducibility and patient safety of particular concern. Both modalities can provide increased resistance to elucidate a patientâ€™s work over time, quantified in watts. However, maximal oxygen uptake has been reported to be 5% to 20% greater for individuals on a treadmill than equivalent cycle ergometer work due to the involvement of more muscle groups. Other equipment includes a metabolic cart, which contains a gas analyzer, a computer, and a screen with displays of both 12-lead EKG analysis as well as physiological changes as they occur during exercise.
