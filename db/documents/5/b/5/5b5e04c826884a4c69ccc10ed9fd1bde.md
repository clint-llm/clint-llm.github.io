The clinical picture of berry aneurysms includes the most severe manifestation of a major aneurysmal rupture, such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage to minor hemorrhage, also known as a sentinel bleed, nonhemorrhagic scenarios, or asymptomatic situations in which the aneurysm is found incidentally.

Many of these patients may be brought in in extremis, and as such, ABCs take priority. Assess the patient's airway, breathing, and establish good IV access. In the setting of trauma, give priority to your primary survey, and do not forget to do a thorough secondary survey. Do not be distracted by dramatic extremity injuries. Give priority to emergent neuroimaging once the patient has been stabilized hemodynamically.

Other patients may present less extreme and warrant a thorough history and physical, even outside the setting of trauma.

Your History should include some key elements as described below:

- Headache - WHOML (worst headache of my life), thunderclap headache. The headache need not be the worst of the patient's life. Even a headache that is different from past headaches should raise one's suspicion for subarachnoid hemorrhage.

- Change in level of consciousness - increased intracranial pressure decreased the perfusion pressures required to oxygenate the brain properly. Patients may appear confused or be less alert than expected.

- Seizures present in twenty-five percent of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. They may be focal or generalized.

- Meningeal signs - Patients may have classic signs of meningeal irritation and complain of neck pain or neck stiffness.

- Focal neurologic deficits - change in strength, sensation, change in the ability to speak or express themselves, memory loss.

- Visual symptoms- blurry vision, double vision (diplopia), defects in the patient's visual field

The physical exam should include and not be limited to the following elements:

- A complete neurologic exam:

- Cranial nerve testing
- Strength of upper and lower extremities and face
- Sensations of upper and lower extremities and face
- Assess speech (dysarthric, disorganized, comprehensible)
- Assess for meningismus, Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs

- HEENT

- Examine for signs of trauma to the head

- obvious signs of injury, including lacerations, abrasions, contusions, skull depressions/fractures
- Ears - look for blood behind the tympanic membrane (hemotympanum), assess for CSF otorrhea
- Eyes - ensure PERRLA (pupils equal round and reactive to light and accommodation)

- look for other signs of eye trauma (iritis, conjunctival hemorrhage, globe rupture) which may indicate a severe mechanism of injury


- Nose - assess for nasal fractures, CSF rhinorrhea
