Medical professionals must be aware of current recommendations for safe sleeping practices and SIDS prevention: do not drink alcohol or use illicit drugs during pregnancy, place the infant on the back to sleep, allow the infant to sleep in his or her own crib in the same room as caregivers, and use a firm and flat surface in a safety-approved crib. Keep soft bedding or objects such as blankets, pillows, bumper pads, or toys out of the sleeping environment. Avoid covering the infant's head and avoid overheating. Avoid second-hand smoke. Smokers should change clothes and wash their hair before coming in contact with the infant. Infants and caregivers benefit from learning to use a pacifier at bedtime - Do Not Prop bottles in the baby's mouth! Breastfeeding and immunizations are beneficial.

Despite a widespread campaign advocating for placing the baby in a supine position for sleep, the adherence to such behavior in the United States peaked at about 80% in 2015. Compliance never reached the targeted level.
