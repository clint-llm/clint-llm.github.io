In general, lacrimal gland carcinomas do not show a gender preference, though some exceptions exist. Adenocarcinoma NOS and ductal carcinoma have a slight predilection for males, whereas MEC and lymphoma have a slight female predilection.

All types of malignant lesions can appear at any age, but most are typically found in the older adult age group (6th decade or later).
