The primary mechanism of ibuprofen, an NSAID, is through the inhibition of prostaglandin precursors. After a physiological or pathological stimulus, membrane phospholipids release arachidonic acid due to the enzyme phospholipase A2. Arachidonic acid then undergoes passage into one of three different enzymatic pathways: cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 (CYP450). The cyclooxygenase pathway converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes: the lipoxygenase pathway yields hydroxyeicosatetranoic acids (HETEs), leukotrienes, and lipoxins from arachidonic acid metabolism. Lastly, arachidonic acid converts to HETEs and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EET) via the cytochrome P450 pathway.

These metabolic pathways all create products referred to as eicosanoids, which are molecules involved in the intercellular and intracellular signaling processes of a variety of physiological processes: smooth muscle tone regulation, vascular permeability, transporter proteins, platelet aggregation, and cell proliferation. As in the case of cyclooxygenase pathway products, eicosanoids also have involvement in autoimmunity, angiogenesis, atopy, inflammation, and cancer.

The cyclooxygenase pathway plays a prominent role in the current indicated uses of ibuprofen. There are three distinct isoforms in the COX pathway: COX-1 (PGH synthase), COX-2, and COX-3. COX-1 is a constitutionally expressed isoform, with levels relatively stable in reaction to most physiologic or pathologic stimuli. In contrast, COX-2 expression is highly inducible by mitogenic and inflammatory stimuli. Among these, the more well-known are transforming growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and tumor necrosis factors. The function of the COX-3 isoform is still largely unknown and remains a topic of contemporary research.

Inhibition of COX-1 and COX-2 pathways decreases the expression of prostaglandin precursors; this, in turn, lessens the degree of cellular response to pathologic or physiologic stimuli. It is by this mechanism that non-selective NSAIDs such as ibuprofen derive their analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory properties.

COX-2, aside from its well-known roles in inflammation, has also been found to get constitutively expressed during early carcinogenesis.

A sizeable amount of research on their potential involvement in carcinogenesis has been conducted for the other two enzymatic pathways, but the information is still limited. LOX isoforms, particularly 5-LOX, 12-LOX, and 15-LOX, have been discussed as potential contributors to tumor development and growth. 5-LOX is normally expressed only in immune cells and has been implicated in the early stages of colon cancer, carcinogenesis in oral cavity tissue, and the expression of chronic myeloid leukemia.
