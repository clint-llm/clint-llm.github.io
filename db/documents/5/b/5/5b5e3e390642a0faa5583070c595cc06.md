The lymph node development starts from the 11 weeks of gestation as a mesenchymal condensation giving rise to the lymph node capsule and connective tissue. The T-cell lymphocytic region begins development during the 13 weeks. The B-cell lymphocytic region begins during the 14 weeks. From week 13 onward, monocytes and macrophages can be present with the lymph sac. During the 20 weeks, the follicle, paracortex, and medulla are discernable and continue to develop throughout gestation and after birth.

The lymphatic system derives from the mesodermal embryological sheet.
