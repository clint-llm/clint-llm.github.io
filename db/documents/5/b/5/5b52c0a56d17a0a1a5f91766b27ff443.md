Severe and life-threatening toxicities are rare with RhIG treatments. In the event of an overdose in immune thrombocytopenic purpura, patients should be closely monitored to check that the hemoglobin doesn't decrease by more than 1.2 g/dL.

In the suppression of Rh isoimmunization, hemolytic reactions can occur in the case of incompatible blood transfusions after very large doses of RhIG.

Patients should be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of hemolysis with the initiation of supportive treatment at the start of symptoms.
