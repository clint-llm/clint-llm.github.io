Pathogenesis is not very well understood. Researchers think that the accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs in eccrine glands, which are more numerous in palms and soles, may cause eccrine squamous syringometaplasia (ESS). ESS is characterized by metaplasia and focal necrosis of the epithelium of the eccrine duct. ESS is occasionally detected in conjunction with acral erythema, but such occurrences are relatively uncommon.

Data suggests that Capecitabine (fluoropyrimidine) toxicity may be associated with genetic polymorphisms of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) and thymidylate synthase (TYMS), enzymes involved in its metabolism
