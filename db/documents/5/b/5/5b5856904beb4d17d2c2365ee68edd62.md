Three major mechanisms have been described in neck trauma:

- Blunt trauma: This includes motor vehicle accidents and sports injuries. There may be delayed presentation of laryngeal, vascular, and digestive tract injuries if blunt trauma occurs. Also, beware that occult cervical spine injury may be present in patients with blunt neck trauma. In addition, a shoulder harness (seatbelt) may also be responsible for shearing trauma to the anterior neck.

- Penetrating trauma: This comprises as much as 5% to 10% of all trauma injuries. Examples include gunshot wounds and stab wounds. It is the violation of the platysma that determines penetrating injury. Wounds that penetrate the platysma have the potential for severe injury. Consequently, it is wise to consider damage to the vital structures if the platysma is violated. Stab wounds involve low-energy penetration.

- Near-hanging or strangulation: External neck pressure causes cerebral hypoxiaÂ due to venous and arterial obstruction.

The most commonly injured area is zone 2, which can easily be accessed surgically. However, in zones 1 and 3 injuries, exposure and vascular control are more difficult to achieve.
