HLA is an important barrier for hematopoietic stem cell (HPC) transplantation. Therefore, HLA matching and compatibility between the donor and the recipient is necessary for a successful HPC transplantation. HLA antigens also have a role in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a potentially serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. GVHD occurs when donor T cells react to host antigens on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and attack host tissues, with sequential activation of donor T cells and monocytes/macrophages.

In solid organ transplantation, HLA antibodies play an important role, and HLA matching is not as important. With patient exposure to foreign HLA antigens due to pregnancy or blood transfusions or transplantation, they can make antibodies against epitopes of those foreign HLA molecules; this is called HLA alloimmunization. Presence of HLA antibodies against graft can cause antibody-mediated rejection and graft loss.

HLA alloimmunization can also cause platelet refractoriness. This condition creates difficulty in finding compatible platelet units, especially in transfusion-dependent HPC transplant patients. In platelet refractoriness HLA Class I antibodies especially antibodies against HLA-A and HLA-B play an important role.
