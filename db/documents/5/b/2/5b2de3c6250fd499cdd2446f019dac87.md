The primary long-term sequela of facial nerve injury from a temporal bone fracture is facial synkinesis, manifested by voluntary movements accompanied by involuntary movements, spasms, tension, and soreness. Synkinesis is caused by aberrant reinnervation during the axonal regeneration process, specifically when an axon either regenerates such that it connects to the motor end plate of a muscle to which it was not previously connected or when a single axon connects to multiple motor endplates in the correct muscle, the incorrect muscle, or a combination of both.

While synkinesis is the most common result of incomplete recovery, flaccid weakness may persist after temporal bone fracture in some patients, and this may subsequently necessitate facial reanimation procedures such as eyelid weight placement, static facial suspension, nerve transfer (such as masseteric or hypoglossal), or muscle transfer (such as temporalis or gracilis).

Other potential complications of temporal bone fracture include long-term hearing loss, which may require rehabilitation with hearing aids or even cochlear implantation, vestibular dysfunction and persistent imbalance, cholesteatoma from entrapped middle ear epithelium, external auditory canal stenosis, and meningitis from chronic CSF leak. Closed head injury may also result in neurocognitive sequelae and/or post-concussive syndrome.
