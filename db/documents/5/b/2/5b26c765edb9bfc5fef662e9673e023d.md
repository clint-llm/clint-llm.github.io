Lung segmental resection should be performed by a trained thoracic surgeon specializing in surgical therapy of lung cancer. All cases should be discussed at a multidisciplinary tumor board to determine appropriate multimodality therapy. This should include oncology, pathology, pulmonology, radiation therapy, and thoracic surgery.

In the operating room, the thoracic surgeon will be joined by an assistant surgeon, an anesthesiologist experienced in single lung ventilation, a scrub nurse familiar with thoracic surgical procedures, and a circulating nurse familiar with commonly used thoracic surgery equipment.
