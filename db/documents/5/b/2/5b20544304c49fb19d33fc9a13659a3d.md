Diagnosis is primarily clinical as specific assays and reference laboratory testing take time and often do not have the sensitivity and specificity necessary for an accurate assessment. Cholinesterase levels can help establish a diagnosis and be an accurate predictor of prognosis. Assays of RBC AChE can give more information about the degree of toxicity and if subsequent dosing of oximes may be required. Follow up measurements of RBC AChE can demonstrate the reactivation of the enzyme over time and the effectiveness of treatment
