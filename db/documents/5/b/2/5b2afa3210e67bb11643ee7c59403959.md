The heart consists of 4 valves separating four chambers of the heart and its outlets - aortic, pulmonic, mitral, and the tricuspid valve. Aorta is the largest artery in the body and originates from the left ventricle. The aortic valve lies between the left ventricle and the aorta. The aortic valve typically has three cusps and that are named after their attachment and vicinity to the other structures. Bicuspid valves are not uncommon with 1 to 2% of the population has congenital two leaflets.

Rarely, Valves with congenital four and single cusp have also been reported. The left coronary cusp covers the left coronary sinus and origin of the left main coronary artery, the right coronary cusp covers the right coronary sinus and origin of the right coronary artery, and the non-coronary cusp covers the non-coronary sinus towards the interatrial septum.
