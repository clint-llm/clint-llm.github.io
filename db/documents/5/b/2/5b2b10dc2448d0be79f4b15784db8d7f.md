Jaw fracture can affect the patientâ€™s intake of nutrients, leading to a decline in weight and nutrition. Lack of proper nutrition may lead to general weakness and interfere with the healing process. Therefore the patient must be instructed regarding the diet. During the first three weeks after surgery, the patient must understand they will be on a full liquid diet, including high protein drinks, blended food, juices, and soup, consuming only a soft diet. They must receive education on the importance of eating frequently in small amounts to maintain sufficient calorie intake. They should be advised not to smoke. As malnourishment may lead to increased incidence of infection and delayed wound healing, it is important that the patient must record their weekly weight that will assist in guiding nutritional support. For illiterate patients, the use of pamphlets and simple illustration booklets may educate them about safely living and maintaining normal body weight.
