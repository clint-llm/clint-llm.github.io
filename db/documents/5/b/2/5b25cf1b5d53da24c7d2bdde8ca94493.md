Evaluating a patient with cachexia includes monitoring blood chemistries and body weight. Bioelectrical impedance has also been used.

**Stages of Cancer Cachexia**

- In pre-cachexia, there is anorexia and metabolic change with a weight loss of 5% or less.

- In cachexia, the BMI is less than 20, and weight loss is more than 2%, or systemic sarcopenia and weight loss of more than 2%.

- In refractory cachexia, the cancer is usually unresponsive, the performance score is low, and the predicted survival is less than three months.
