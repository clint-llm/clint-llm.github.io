The nucleus ambiguus provides innervation to the muscles of the soft palate, larynx, and pharynx by contributing motor fibers to three cranial nerves: glossopharyngeal (CN IX), vagus (CN X), and spinal accessory (CN XI)Â  nerves. Axons leaving the nucleus ambiguus exit the medulla dorsally to the inferior olive to join fibers with the three cranial nerves. These three cranial nerves innervate the striated muscles of the soft palate, larynx, pharynx, and upper part of the esophagus. The glossopharyngeal nerve innervates the stylopharyngeus muscle; the vagus nerve innervates palatal muscles, pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles, and striated muscle of esophagus-palatoglossus; the spinal accessory nerve innervates the cranial portion of the laryngeal muscles.

Additionally, the nucleus ambiguus receives fibers from neighboring nuclei, such as the sensory spinal trigeminal nucleus and nucleus solitarius to comprise the gag reflex. The gag reflex is composed of a sensory and motor part. The sensory limb is from CN IX, which synapses in the spinal trigeminal nucleus and the nucleus solitarius. The motor limb is from CN X from the nucleus ambiguus, and stimulation of the motor limb causes movements of the tongue and soft palate muscles.
