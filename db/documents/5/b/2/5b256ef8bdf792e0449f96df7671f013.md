The pathophysiology of this group of anemia is ineffective erythropoiesis secondary to intramedullary apoptosis of hematopoietic cell precursors, which results from DNA synthesis abnormalities. Both vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies may cause defective DNA synthesis. Subsequently, the nucleus and cytoplasm do not mature simultaneously. The cytoplasm (in which hemoglobin synthesis is unaltered) mature at the normal rate, and the nucleus (with impaired DNA synthesis) is not fully mature. The cells arrest in the DNA synthesis (S) phase and make DNA replication errors, which eventually leads to apoptotic cell death.

The primary role of folate is to donate methyl groups in DNA synthesis. Vitamin B12 is a cofactor in the reaction that recycles 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate back to tetrahydrofolate (THF). The generation of THF is coupled to the conversion of homocysteine to methionine. Lack of vitamin B12 causes folate to become trapped in the 5-methyl-THF form, and it also leads to a deficiency of methionine.

With altered DNA synthesis hematopoiesis is disrupted as hematopoietic precursor cells are rapidly dividing cells. As stated above, these deficiencies lead to arrested nuclear division without significant alteration in the cytoplasmic maturation cycle. Nucleated precursor cells in the bone marrow develop immature or morphologically abnormal nuclei and giant metamyelocytes, with macrocytic red blood cells and hypersegmented neutrophils on the peripheral blood smear.

The pathophysiology behind pernicious anemia involves autoantibodies against the intrinsic factor or gastric parietal cell antigens.
