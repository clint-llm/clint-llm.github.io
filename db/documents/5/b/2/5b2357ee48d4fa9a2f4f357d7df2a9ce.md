All patients recover from Ramsay Hunt syndrome; the question is, "to what degree?" Overall, the most consistent prognostic indicator in Ramsay Hunt syndrome is the presenting severity of facial paralysis. Patients who present with House-Brackmann grade III paralysis tend to recover to normal function; patients with House-Brackmann grade IV or V paralysis are more likely to recover to grade II function, and patients with House-Brackmann grade VI function at presentation are more likely to recover to grade III function.

Other factors that have been associated with non-recovery include age over 50 years old, a greater degree of axonal damage on electrodiagnostic testing, involvement of multiple cranial neuropathies, the presence of oropharyngeal lesions, and diabetes.
