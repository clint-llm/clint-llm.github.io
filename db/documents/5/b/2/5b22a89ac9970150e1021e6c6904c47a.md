As described above, patient education remains a cornerstone in postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome management. Information regarding differentiation and attribution of symptoms, alleviating and exacerbating factors, combination treatment modalities, and focus on daily functional improvement must be presented in a clear manner. As with many chronic conditions, establishing a favorable physician-patient rapport via timely follow up, close monitoring, and if needed specialty consultation is key to therapeutic adherence and overall recovery.
