The actual prevalence of ovarian cysts is unknown, as many patients are believed to be asymptomatic and undiagnosed, and the prevalence depends on the population studied. Approximately 4% of women will be admitted to the hospital for ovarian cysts by age 65. In a random sample of 335 asymptomatic 24Â to 40-year-old women, the prevalence of an adnexal lesion was 7.8%.

In postmenopausal women, 18% can develop one or more Graffian follicles, which appear as cysts on imaging.
