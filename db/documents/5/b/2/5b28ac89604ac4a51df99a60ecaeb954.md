The morphology of EMZL typically reproduces the normal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, with reactive follicles with neoplastic cells occupying the marginal zone. The typical marginal zone B cells are small to medium-sized with slightly irregular nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. The chromatin is moderately dispersed with associated pale cytoplasm. The morphology of the malignant clone is variable, and the involved tissue usually demonstrates a polymorphous infiltrate of small lymphocytes and less frequently large, activated cells, which are by definition in the minority. The key immunophenotypic findings are the demonstration of clonality and confirmation of B cell origin. The immunophenotype also helps in the exclusion of other small B cell lymphomas like small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma.

EMZL tumor cells express the CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a, which are the B-cell associated antigens as well as CD21 and CD35, which are the complement receptors. They are usually negative for CD5, CD10, CD23, BCL6, and cyclin D1. It is important that the diagnosis is confirmed by an expert hematopathologist.
