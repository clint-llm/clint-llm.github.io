Spontaneous improvement of homonymous hemianopsia varies dramatically, with great emphasis on the timeline from when the injury occurred to when the visual field test was administered. Even with reported differences in spontaneous improvement, after six months from the incident, it is unlikely that the patient will experience a spontaneous recovery. However, improvement in underlying diseases has shown to provide visual field improvement even after such time (eg., multiple sclerosis).
