Teeth play a vital role during mastication, phonetics, smiling, and giving shape to the face. The different layers of tooth i.e., enamel, dentin, pulp, and cementum, play different roles—enamel functions to protect the dentin. Dentin provides support to the overlying enamel and transmits impulses from the enamel to the dental pulp. The pulp helps in the formation of dentin and providing nutrients such as albumin, transferrin, tenascin, and other proteoglycans to the dentin. Also, it has a defensive role through the formation of new dentin, creating a barrier between irritants and slows the rate of carious decay. The cementum functions to provide attachment to the collagen fibers present in the periodontal ligament, thus maintaining the integrity of the root and its position. It is also involved in the repair and regeneration of teeth.
