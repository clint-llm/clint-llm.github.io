Patients with cocaine toxicity need to be stabilized, and attention should be paid to the ABCDEs. The patient's fever should be managed, and one should rule out hypoglycemia as a cause of the neuropsychiatric symptoms. A pregnancy test should be ruled in women of childbearing age. The treatment should be based on clinical symptoms, and one should avoid physical restraints.

Based on a large systematic review referenced below, cardiovascular toxicity and agitation are best-treated first-line with benzodiazepines to decrease CNS sympathetic outflow.

Agitated patients are best treated with benzodiazepines, but antipsychotics such as haloperidol and olanzapine may also be useful. Combination treatment with benzodiazepines and antipsychotics has been shown to be more efficacious than monotherapy.
