Discontinuation of this medication because of side effects is rare, but some common adverse effects can occur, particularly in the elderly and debilitated. Most of the side effects associated with these medications are preventable by correct dose adjustment. Common side effects include fatigue, sedation, depression, dizziness, ataxia, slurred speech, weakness, confusion, forgetfulness, nervousness, hyperexcitability, and pain at the injection site. Some of the rare side effects include mania, weight gain, hallucination, hypotension, skin eruptions, menstrual irregularity, dry mouth, and hyper-salivation. Life-threatening side effects are blood dyscrasias, renal dysfunction, hepatic dysfunction, and respiratory depression, particularly when taken with CNS depressants in overdose. Hyperactive pediatric patients require monitoring for the paradoxical effect.
