On the initial clinical presentation of patients with xanthomas, an evaluation must focus on both locoregional and systemic disease. For the locoregional lesion, a clinical exam is often enough to make a ready diagnosis of xanthoma. Radiographs are typically normal in these patients. Ultrasound study may be performed of tendinous xanthomas, and advanced imaging in the form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful to rule out differential diagnoses and for surgical planning.Â Upon diagnosis of xanthoma, a systemic workup must be undertaken simultaneously.

Early recognition of morbid conditions such as familial hypercholesterolemia can avoid delays in management. Therefore, prompt workup by the treating clinician should start with laboratory investigations that include plasma triglycerides, plasma cholesterol, serum LDL, and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). These tests should preferably be performed under fasting conditions and as per other collection and processing standards prescribed by the local laboratory. Specific clinical patterns of presentation such as diffuse plane xanthomas or palmar crease xanthomas should warrant investigation for known pathognomonic conditions that are associated with such findings. As part of the workup for metabolic syndrome, blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c may also be performed as indicated.
