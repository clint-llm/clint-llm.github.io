Like leiomyosarcoma (LMS) elsewhere in the body, renal LMS shows interlacing bundles of muscle fascicles with spindle cells that have blunt-ended (cigar-shaped) nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Cellular pleomorphism, foci of tumor necrosis, and increased mitoses are typical features. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells are positive for markers of muscle origin, such as smooth muscle actin and desmin, and are negative for cytokeratin, S-100, and HMB-45.
