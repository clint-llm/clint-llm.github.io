The diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum is clinical and largely a diagnosis of exclusion. The list of potential differential diagnoses for patients with similar symptoms is quiteÂ extensive. It can include:

**Gastrointestinal Conditions**

- Gastroenteritis

- Gastroparesis

- Achalasia

- Biliary tract disease

- Hepatitis

- Intestinal obstruction

- Peptic ulcer disease

- Pancreatitis

- Appendicitis

**Genitourinary Conditions**

- Pyelonephritis

- Uremia

- Ovarian torsion

- Kidney stones

- Degenerating uterine leiomyoma

**Metabolic Conditions**

- Diabetic ketoacidosis

- Porphyria

- Addison disease

- Hyperthyroidism

- Hyperparathyroidism

**Neurologic Disorders**

- Pseudotumor cerebri

- Vestibular lesions

- Migraine headaches

- Tumors of the central nervous system

- Lymphocytic hypophysitis

**Miscellaneous Conditions**

- Drug toxicity or intolerance

**Psychologic Conditions**

**Pregnancy-related conditions**

- Acute fatty liver of pregnancy Preeclampsia

It is important to evaluate women presenting with (HG) for gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) and multiple gestations as they may also present with severe nausea and vomiting in the first trimester of pregnancy. The workup may begin with an obstetric ultrasound scan, which will confirm the diagnosis in most cases. Other first-trimester obstetric concerns include ectopic pregnancy, which is more likely to include abdominal pain, syncope, or vaginal bleeding and can again be evaluated by obstetrical ultrasound and beta-hCG levels.

The onset of nausea and vomiting after nine weeks should spark concern for alternative diagnoses. Preeclampsia, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets), and acute fatty liver of pregnancy typically present themselves during the late second or third trimester of pregnancy.

Non-obstetrical causes for nausea and vomiting can also occur during pregnancy and should always remain on the differential, keeping in mind that pregnant patients are considered to be at higher risk of blood clotting; therefore, diagnoses that result in ischemia or thrombus formation may be more common during pregnancy. Gastrointestinal causes such as gastroenteritis, small bowel obstruction, gastroparesis, peptic ulcer disease, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, hepatitis, and appendicitis should be considered. Pyelonephritis, urinary tract infections, renal stones, and ovarian torsion may also include vomiting. Metabolic derangements such as diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperthyroidism, and hyperparathyroidism may also have similar symptoms. Neurologic disorders such as migraine, intracranial hemorrhage, pseudotumor cerebri, and venous sinus thrombosis can also cause vomiting but are likely to have associated headaches or neurologic deficits. Psychiatric disorders such as anxiety and depression may also result in vomiting, toxic ingestions, and myocardial ischemia.
