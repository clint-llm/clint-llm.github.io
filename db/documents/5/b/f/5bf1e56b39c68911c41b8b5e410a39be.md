While there are no specific or absolute contraindications for Doppler peripheral venous duplex US, several conditions may limit the peripheral venous systems' interrogation. Obesity, casts, and dressings in the areas of interest may block US beams, thus limit visualization. Additionally, in post-traumatic patients, burn patients, or post-surgical patients, open/recent wounds or pain may not permit appropriate interrogation.
