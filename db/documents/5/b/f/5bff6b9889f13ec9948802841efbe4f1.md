Non-dihydropyridines may cause constipation, worsening cardiac output, and bradycardia.

Dihydropyridines may lead to lightheadedness, flushing, headaches, and peripheral edema. The peripheral edema is likely related to the redistribution of fluid from the intravascular space to the interstitium.

There have also been reports of gingival hyperplasia.
