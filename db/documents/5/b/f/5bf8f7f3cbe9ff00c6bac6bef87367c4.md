The 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (9vHPV) is a second-generation, non-infectious, recombinant, 9-valent vaccine indicated to prevent diseases and cancers caused by both low-risk and high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58. HPVs are the number one sexually transmitted viruses causing precancerous and cancerous lesions. The 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (9vHPV) has been licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 2014, and it is the only HPV vaccine available in the United States that confers protection against specific HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58.

Three different FDA-approved vaccines protect against infection with a varying number of HPV types:

- 2vHPV (bivalent vaccine): protects against HPV types 16 and 18 (not available in the US, but it is still in use in other countries)

- 4vHPV (quadrivalent vaccine): protects against HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18

- 9vHPV (nine-valent vaccine): protects against HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58

9vHPV is routinely recommended to both males and females from ages 9 to 45 years of age to help prevent the following diseases and dysplastic lesions caused by human papillomavirus

- Anal, oropharyngeal, cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and other head-and-neck cancers caused by HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58

- Condyloma acuminata (genital warts) caused by HPV types 6 and 11

- Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ, anal, cervical, vulvar, vaginal intraepithelial neoplasias caused by HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58
