Multiple genetic and environmental risk factors are identified in the development of leukemia.

- Exposure to ionizing radiation is associated with an increased risk of multiple leukemia subtypes.

- Exposure to benzene is a risk factor for leukemia in adults, particularly AML.

- Previous exposure to chemotherapy, especially alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors, increases the risk for acute leukemia later in life.

- A history of any hematologic malignancy is a risk factor for subsequently developing another subtype of leukemia.

- Viral infections (e.g., human T-cell leukemia virus, Epstein Barr virus) are linked with subtypes of ALL.

- Several genetic syndromes (e.g., Down syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Bloom syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome) are associated with an increased risk of AML and ALL.
