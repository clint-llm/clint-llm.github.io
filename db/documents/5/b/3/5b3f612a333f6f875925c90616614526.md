Complex coronary lesions carry higher overall mortality in patients with stable angina than those with non-complex lesions. These complex lesions are often associated with diabetes, lower ventricular ejection fraction, lower HDL-C. The SYNTAX Score and SYNTAX Score II are frequently the means to decide on the best revascularization approach. Studies have shown SYNTAX Score II to be superior to the SYNTAX score as a tool of prognosis. The 4-year mortality showed an adequate correlation between score and mortality in patients with low and medium SYNTAX Score II, however, found that a high SYNTAX Score II underestimated mortality at four years.
