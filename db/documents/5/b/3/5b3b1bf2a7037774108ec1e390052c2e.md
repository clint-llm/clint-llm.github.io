The esophagus is a muscular tube that transports a food bolus from the pharynx to the stomach. The esophagus is derived from the endoderm germ layer which forms the pharynx, esophagus, stomach, and the epithelial lines of the aerodigestive tract. The trachea and esophagus arise from the separation of a common foregut tube during early fetal development.

Additionally, approximately 50% of patients with TEF/EA will have associated congenital anomalies including VACTERL (vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, TEF, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities) or CHARGE (coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae, growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear abnormalities) syndrome.

Patients with this constellation of symptoms should have an expedited workup for EA and TEF, and prompt referral to a higher level of care for pediatric surgeon evaluation.
