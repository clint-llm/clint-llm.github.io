Patients taking steroids should be educated on the risks of IOP elevation. While steroids will have a minimal effect on the IOP of most patients, there is a small population that will develop a significant increase in IOP. Providers should inform patients that already have glaucoma that the risk of IOP elevation and glaucoma progression with steroids is greater than in the general population.
