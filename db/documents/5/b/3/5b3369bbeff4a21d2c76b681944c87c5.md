Parvovirus B19 is transmitted most commonly through respiratory droplets into cells in the respiratory tract. Transmission can also occur via blood exposure. Viremia from parvovirus B19 exposure usually occurs within 5 to 10 days, and the patient remains contagious approximately 5 days after viremia occurs. If an immunocompetent host becomes infected, there can be a range of symptoms. This can range from no symptoms to non-specific flu-like symptoms to the classic symptoms of facial rash and arthralgias. In patients with aplastic anemia, very high viral loads are noted.  When a patient has symptoms of arthralgias and exanthem, they are no longer contagious and are not at risk to spread the virus. When parvovirus B19 infects a fetus, hydrops fetalis occurs because the virus affects red blood cell production in the fetus which, in turn, causes high output heart failure.
