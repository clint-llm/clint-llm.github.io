Debriefing is essential for the trainee to have a comprehensive and successful encounter in a simulation scenario. Debriefing refers to facilitated reflection in the process of experiential learning. Below are some facilitator guided debriefing tools that educators have described. “Debriefing with good judgment” refers to a three-phase conversational structure consisting of reaction, analysis, and summary. The learner is afforded an initial “reaction” to explore his/her emotional response to the simulation encounter. The analysis phase focuses on what happened during the simulation and why the learner performed the way they did. The summary phase focuses on participants describing what they learned and how this knowledge can be applied to future patient care scenarios.

Promoting Excellence and Reflective Learning in Simulation, also known as PEARLS,

High fidelity medical simulation should be a close approximation to clinical practice and is most successful when feedback is provided directly during and after the learning experience.
