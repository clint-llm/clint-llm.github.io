Because of the irreversible binding of AADC, carbidopa can decrease or deplete peripheral levels of serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Additionally, research has demonstrated that the irreversible binding of PLP causes nutritional deficiencies in vitamins B3 and B6. Specific carbidopa-induced dyskinesias, including “facial twitching and head bobbing,” have also been described.

Recognizing the adverse effects associated with carbidopa/levodopa combinations is also essential. In addition to dyskinetic movements, there are reports of psychiatric problems, autonomic dysfunction, and sensory/pain symptoms with levodopa use. These non-motor symptoms range from euphoric mood, hallucinations, and worsening cognition, to poor thermoregulation, dysphagia, and peripheral neuropathy and can vary depending on the “on/off” fluctuations of levodopa.
