**Inner Ear**

Pendrin is expressed in the cochlea and vestibule of the inner ear, thus playing an important role in endolymphatic fluid resorption, acid-base balance, and proper function of the inner ear.

**Thyroid gland**

Pendrin is expressed on the thyrocyte apical membrane, where its activity as a Cl-/I- exchanger is essential for cellular iodide efflux into the follicular lumen. A defect in the Pendrin gene usually leads to the partial impairment of thyroid organification. However, patients with Pendred syndrome usually have a euthyroid goiter.

**Kidneys**

Pendrin protein is located at or near the apical membrane of type B and non A non B intercalated cells of the cortical collecting ducts.

**Bronchial Epithelium**

Pendrin is also expressed in the airway epithelium at the apical membrane of bronchial epithelial cells. It helps to regulate airway surface liquid thickness via its function as a Chloride/bicarbonate exchanger. The defective pendrin gene affects mucus production and may play a vital role in patients with asthma and COPD. It also functions as SCN/Cl exchanger that helps in the innate defense mechanism of mucosal surfaces by secreting SCN, which is an antioxidant to the lumen.
