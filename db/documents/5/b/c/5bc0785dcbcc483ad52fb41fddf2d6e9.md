Patisiran, a first-in-class siRNA molecule, is administered as a drip into the vein.

Dyspepsia, dyspnea, muscle spasms, arthralgia, erythema, bronchitis, and vertigo are the other adverse reactions from the placebo-controlled clinical trial that occurred in at least 5% of patients in the patisiran-treated group and at least 3% more frequently than in patients in the placebo-treated group.

Infusion-related reactions have occurred in patients treated with patisiran. In clinical trials, all subjects received premedication with acetaminophen, corticosteroid, and antihistamines (H1 and H2 receptor blockers) to decrease the risk of IRRs.

In a randomized controlled clinical study, 19% of patients treated with patisiran experienced IRRs, compared to 9% of patients who received a placebo. Among patisiran-treated subjects who experienced an IRR, the majority (79%) experienced the first episode of IRR within the first two infusion therapy. The frequency of IRRs decreased over time.

The incidents of IRRs resulted in interruption of infusion in 5% of patients and permanent discontinuation of patisiran in 0.7% of subjects (one patient) in clinical studies. The flushing (including facial erythema or skin warm), headache, back pain, nausea, abdominal pain, and dyspnea were the most common symptoms of patisiran IRRs affecting more than 2% of patients across clinical trials.

Other manifestations included but were not limited to arthralgia or pain (including neck and musculoskeletal pain), chills, cough, chest pain or chest discomfort, rash, increased heart rate or palpitations, hypotension, hypertension, dizziness, fatigue, and facial edema. Severe hypotension, syncope, and pruritus as symptoms of IRRs reported from the expanded access program (EAP) and postmarketing setting.

On the day of patisiran therapy, premedication is administered at least 60 minutes before initiating the infusion to prevent IRRs.

During subsequent infusions for the patients who have experienced the IRRs, higher or additional dosages of premedication and slower infusion rate might help reduce the risk of infusion-related reactions(IRRs).

The patisiran tends to reduce levels of serum vitamin-A. Therefore, vitamin-A supplementation at recommended daily allowance is advisable to prevent its deficiency when the patient is on patisiran treatment.

Four serious adverse events of atrioventricular (AV) heart block (2.7%), including three cases of complete AV block, were reported in patients treated with patisiran. No such AV-block (AEs, or SAEs) occurred in placebo-treated patients. The first-degree heart block and Mobitz’s type-1 second-degree heart block require only clinical monitoring and observation. The patients with Mobitz type-2 second-degree heart block and complete heart block require a permanent pacemaker.

Ocular adverse events (AEs) occurred in 2 to less than 5% of patients treated with patisiran and more frequently than patients in the placebo group in the randomized clinical trial, including dry eyes, the most common (5% vs. 3%), followed by blurred vision (3% vs.1%), and vitreous floaters, the least common (2% vs. 1%).

Extravasation occurred in less than 0.5% of patisiran infusions in clinical trials, including cases graded and reported the serious. Symptoms and signs included erythema or injection site redness, infusion or injection site swelling, burning sensation or injection site pain, phlebitis or thrombophlebitis, dermatitis (subcutaneous inflammation), and cellulitis.

The risk of injection or infusion site cellulitis reduces by strict aseptic and antiseptic precautions. The most common microorganism responsible for non-purulent cellulitis is Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci and staphylococcus aureus for purulent cellulitis. The patient management strategy includes antibiotics and supportive therapy. Penicillin is the treatment of choice. If the patient has a history of penicillin allergy, cephalexin can cause cross hypersensitivity and, therefore, in that case, clindamycin is the treatment of choice.

**Immunogenicity**

In the clinical trials, the incidence of developing anti-patisiran antibodies was low (3.4%) and transient, without effects on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, or safety.
