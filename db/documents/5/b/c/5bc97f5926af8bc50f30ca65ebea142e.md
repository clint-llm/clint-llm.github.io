X-linked agammaglobulinemia or XLA is a primary immunodeficiency disorder that prevents affected individuals from making antibodies and requires them to rely on lifelong immunoglobulin replacement therapy for survival. Without immunoglobulins (or antibodies), XLA patients are rendered vulnerable to invasive infections. Hospitalization for bacterial pneumonia, requiring intravenous antibiotics for resolution, is usually what prompts the diagnostic work-up for primary immunodeficiency. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of XLA and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of X-linked agammaglobulinemia.
- Review the evaluation process for X-linked agammaglobulinemia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for X-linked agammaglobulinemia.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance X-linked agammaglobulinemia and improve outcomes.
