Different diagnostic methods that help evaluate brain function are among the most critical advances that have made it possible to target neuromodulatory psychiatric treatment. Several diagnostic techniques are good at giving information about the cortical structures and function.

- TMS provides a noninvasive means of probing the neurophysiology of different cortical structures function and dysfunction.

- fMRI and PET help provide information about the subcortical structures.

Laboratory workup is performed to exclude primary organic etiologies that may mimic psychiatric disorders. Neuroimaging studies include brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomographic (CT) scans of specific body areas as needed.
