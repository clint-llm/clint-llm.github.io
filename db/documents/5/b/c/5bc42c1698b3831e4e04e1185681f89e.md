Any patient with a corneal foreign body comes into contact with multiple health care providers. A significant number of patients are seen by primary care providers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and optometrists. Many of these patients arrive at the emergency department. Here, nurses will perform triage, and they may already notice an irregular pupil and opted to cover the eye to protect it like an open globe. They may also take out an intraocular pressure meter, which will guide the exam. As one retrospective chart review study showed, intraocular pressure was one determining factor in open globe outcomes.
