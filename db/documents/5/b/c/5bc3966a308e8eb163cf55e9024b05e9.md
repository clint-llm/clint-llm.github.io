- Electrolyte disturbances: As a result of diuresis, torsemide can cause electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, acid-base imbalance, etc., causing fatal cardiac arrhythmias. It is more common with IV administration and with higher doses.

- Hypotension due to excessive diuresis. So diuretics are not recommended to start or be given on the day of any surgical procedure as they can severely affect blood pressure when compounded with anesthesia.

- Renal failure due to aggressive diuresis, especially in cases of hypovolemia or infection/sepsis

- Ototoxicity, especially with concomitant ototoxic drugs

- Hyperuricemia may occur, including asymptomatic hyperuricemia or gout especially when used with other drugs that can cause hyperuricemia (like Thiazide diuretics)

- Pancreatitis

- Sulfa allergy,Â causing Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis

- Photosensitivity reaction

- Gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, dyspepsia, diarrhea, constipation

- Central nervous system manifestations like nervousness or anxiety

- Diuretic resistance: Sometimes, an adequate diuretic response is unattainable despite using higher doses of loop diuretics. The diuretic response can be improved by IV administration or using torsemide with other diuretics (e.g., another loop diuretic or thiazide diuretic). Serum electrolytes require very close monitoring if using the diuretic combination.
