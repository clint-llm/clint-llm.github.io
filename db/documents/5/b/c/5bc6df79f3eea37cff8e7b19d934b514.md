Cyclic AMP was first discovered by Dr. Earl W. Sutherland in 1958 for which he received a Nobel prize.****Cyclic adenosine monophosphate is a small, hydrophilic molecule commonly known as cyclic AMP or cAMP, which is an important intracellular second messenger molecule regulated in many physiological processes.****cAMP can trigger a cascade of events to influence cellular function through its interaction with protein effectors such as protein kinase A (PKA), exchange proteins activated by cAMP (EPACs), cyclic nucleotide-gated ion (CNG) channels, and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels.****Metabolism, gene regulation, regulation of neurotransmitter synthesis, growth factors, and immune function are some examples of the numerous biological processes that utilize cAMP. Clinically, the ubiquitous nature of the cAMP pathway gives rise to therapeutic possibilities within the signal transduction system to fight against diseases such as cancer, diabetes, heart failure, inflammation, neurological disorders, myocardial atrophy, and mood disorders.********
