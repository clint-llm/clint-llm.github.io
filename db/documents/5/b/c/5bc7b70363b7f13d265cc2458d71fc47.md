- Complete blood count, metabolic profile, and serology

- Electroencephalogram

- CSF analysis (oligoclonal bands)

- Motor- and sensory-evoked potential tests

- Videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) and Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) for screening and grading of dysphagia
