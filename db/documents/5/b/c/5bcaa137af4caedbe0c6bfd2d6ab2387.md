The most immediate organ affected by a fast is the pancreas. During times of low plasma glucose, the pancreas will release more glucagon from the alpha cells found in the islets of Langerhans. Glucagon will mainly affect the liver as it stores most of the glycogen in the body. Skeletal muscle is also affected by glucagon, but to a lesser extent since skeletal muscle contains a low glycogen concentration. After hepatic glycogen stores are depleted, the body uses adipose tissue and protein for energy. The liver has an active role in the metabolism of fats as it is the main oxidizer of triglycerides. In more extreme versions of fasting, where fat sources have been expended, the body breaks down skeletal muscle for energy. Catabolism of skeletal muscle provides the body with amino acids that can be metabolized. However, this process also leads to a reduction in muscle mass.
