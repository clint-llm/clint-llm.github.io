ARS has been associated with mutations in several chromosomes including 4, 6, 9, 13, 18, and 21, affecting genes such as Forkhead-Like 7 (FKHL7) on chromosome 6p25.

FKHL7 is a gene from the forkhead/winged-helix transcription-factor family and linked to 6p25, it has been described as having a role in embryonic development and found mutated in some patients with ARS.

Approximately 40 to 70% ofÂ ARS cases correlate with mutations in FOXC1 and PITX2, on chromosomes 6p25 and 4q25, respectively.

Forkhead-Box C1 gene (FOXC1), along with the Pituitary Homeobox 2 gene (PITX2) are two of the most studied transcription factor-encoding genes associated with ARS. Research has characterized FOXC1 mutations as frameshift, nonsense, missense, deletions, and duplications. PITX2 has associations with splice-site mutations, deletions and chromosomal translocations in patients with ARS.
