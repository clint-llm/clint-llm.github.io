Endothelial cells form the lining of blood vessels. These cells have the critical ability to rearrange to remodel the vasculature network. This feature of endothelial cells enables blood vessel changes and adequate blood flow to allow tissue growth and repair throughout the body. The endothelial cells are closest to the lumen of both arteries and veins. Surrounding the thin endothelial cell layer is a basal lamina, followed by varying amounts of smooth muscle cells and connective tissue dependent on the vesselâ€™s function. In contrast to arteries and veins, capillaries are only a single layer of endothelial cells and pericytes.
