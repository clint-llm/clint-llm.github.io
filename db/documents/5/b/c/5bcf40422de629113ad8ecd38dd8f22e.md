Griseofulvin is a pregnancy Category C medication. It should not be prescribed to pregnant women due to its reports of causing fetal abnormalities in rats and dogs. There are also reports of conjoined twins in women taking griseofulvin during their first trimester of pregnancy. Patients should wait at least a month after completion of treatment with griseofulvin before becoming pregnant.
