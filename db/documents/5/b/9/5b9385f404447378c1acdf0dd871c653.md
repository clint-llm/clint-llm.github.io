Echocardiography is a reliable and non-invasive imaging modality for assessing cardiac structure, function, and hemodynamics. Compared to other cardiovascular imaging modalities, it is easily available and relatively inexpensive and does not expose the patient to radiation. Portable machines provide the ease of doing the study at the bedside for sick patients. Echocardiography displays live real-time images and are widely available. Although it is operator-dependent, its accuracy is comparable with other imaging modalities.
