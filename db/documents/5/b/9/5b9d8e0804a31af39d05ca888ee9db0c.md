Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia is an extremely rare disease in the United States. The patient presenting with nocturnal cough, dyspnea, wheezing, and eosinophilia on bloodwork with travel history to the filarial endemic region should undergo tests to measure serum IgE and antifilarial antibody levels. They should also undergo stool tests to rule out other causes likeÂ Strongyloides, Toxocara, and Ascariasis.

The management of TPE involves an interprofessional team that consists of an infectious disease expert, pulmonologist, microbiologist, pharmacist, nurse, and clinician. The clinician and nurse should take a careful history, including asking about recent travel to the endemic region, which can help early detection of TPE. The role of infectious disease experts and microbiologists is to find the exact organism causing the disease and rule out other infectious causes of pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome. Once the diagnosis is made, treatment with DEC has an excellent response.
