Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is a group of symptoms comprised of severe peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and chronic diarrhea caused by a gastrin-secreting tumor of the duodenum or pancreas (gastrinoma triangle) that results in increased stimulation of acid-secreting cells of the stomach. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome could impact the patient's quality of life and increase mortality if it is not recognized and treated. This activity covers the proper evaluation by the interprofessional team to provide effective treatment plans to lower mortality. This activity reviews the assessment and management of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the typical presentations associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
- Identify the proper steps to diagnose Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
- Review the treatment options for Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
