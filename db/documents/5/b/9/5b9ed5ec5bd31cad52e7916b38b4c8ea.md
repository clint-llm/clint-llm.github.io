The pathophysiology of acute and chronic pain is complex and not completely understood. Research is ongoing. In general, the following provides an overview of the current understanding of pain pathophysiology.

**Acute Pain**

It is caused by activating peripheral pain receptors and specific A-delta and C-sensory nerve fibers (nociceptors). It is commonly a response to tissue injury.

**Chronic Pain**

Chronic pain is usually related to ongoing tissue injury and is thought to be caused by persistent activation of these pain fibers. Chronic pain may also develop from ongoing damage to or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system, which causes neuropathic pain.

**Nociceptive Pain**

Nociceptive pain receptors may be somatic or visceral. Somatic pain receptors are located in the subcutaneous tissues, fascia, connective tissues, endosteum, periosteum, joint capsules, and skin—stimulation results in burning, dull, or sharp pain.

Visceral pain receptors are located in the viscera and connective tissue. Visceral pain due is usually due to obstruction of a hollow organ. This pain is deep, cramping, poorly localized, and may be referred to a remote site. Visceral pain from connective tissue injury or organ capsules may be more localized and sharp.

**Psychologic Factors**

Psychologic factors in the modulation of pain intensity are highly variable. Culture, emotions, and thoughts and emotions affect an individual's perception of pain. Patients who suffer from chronic pain may also have psychological stress, particularly anxiety and depression. As a result of some syndromes being characterized as psychiatric disorders, such as somatic symptom disorders defined by self-reported pain, patients are often mischaracterized as having a psychiatric disorder and are deprived of appropriate care. Pain may interfere with cognitive attention, concentration, the content of thought, and memory.

**Multifactorial Pain Syndromes**

Many pain syndromes are multifactorial; for example, cancer and chronic low back pain syndromes have a nociceptive component but may also involve neuropathic pain resulting from nerve damage.

**Pain Modulation and Transmission**

Pain fibers enter the spinal cord at the posterior root ganglia and synapse in the posterior horn. Fibers then cross to the contralateral side and travel up the lateral columns reaching the thalamus and, finally, the cerebral cortex. Repetitive stimulation from prolonged pain can sensitize neurons in the posterior horn of the spinal cord so that a minimal peripheral stimulus results in pain.

Peripheral and nerves at other levels of the central nervous system are sensitized, resulting in long-term synaptic changes in cortical receptive fields that can result in exaggerated pain perception. This process of chronic afferent input causes increased sensitivity and lower pain thresholds, with the remodeling of the central nociceptive pathways and receptors termed central sensitization.****The consequence may be:

- Allodynia (exaggerated response to a nonpainful stimulus)

- Hyperalgesia (excessive pain response to a normal pain stimulus)

**Substances Released When Tissue is Injured**

The inflammatory cascade can sensitize peripheral nociceptors. Substances released include vasoactive peptides such as calcitonin, gene-related protein, neurokinin A, substance P, and mediators such as bradykinin and epinephrine, prostaglandin E2, and serotonin. The pain signal is modulated in both segmental and descending pathways by neurochemical mediators such as endorphins (enkephalin) and monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin). These mediators are thought to increase, reduce, shorten sustain the perception and response to pain. They also mediate the benefits of CNS-active drugs such as antidepressants, antiseizure medications, membrane stabilizers, and opioids interacting with neurochemicals and specific receptors that treat chronic pain.

Psychologic factors are important pain modulators. They affect how patients describe and react to pain, such as complaining, being irritable, grimacing, or being stoic. They may also generate neural output that modulates neurotransmission along pain pathways. The psychologic reaction to protracted pain interacts with central nervous system factors that may induce long-term changes in pain perception.

**Pain Theories**

**Intensity Theory**

The theory goes back to the Athenian philosopher Plato (c. 428 to 347 B.C.), who, in his work Timaeus, defined pain not as a unique experience but as an 'emotion' that occurs when the stimulus is intense and lasting. Centuries later, we are aware that chronic pain especially represents a dynamic experience, profoundly changeable in a spatial-temporal manner. A series of experiments conducted during the nineteenth century sought to establish the scientific basis of the theory. Based on the tactile stimulation and impulses of other nature, such as electrical stimulations, these investigations provided important information concerning the threshold for tactile perceptions and the role of the dorsal horn neurons in the transmission/processing of pain.

**Cartesian Dualistic Theory**

The oldest explanation for why pain manifested in specific populations was rooted in religious beliefs. Throughout history, religious ideologies have substantially influenced people's thoughts and actions. As a result, most people believed pain was the consequence of committing immoral acts. There was also a belief that the suffering they endured was the individual's way to repent for these sins.

The dualism theory of pain hypothesized that pain was a mutually exclusive phenomenon. Pain could be a result of physical injury or psychological injury. However, the two types of injury did not influence each other. At no point were they to combine and create a synergistic effect on pain, making pain a mutually exclusive entity.

The dualistic approach to pain theory fails to account for many factors that are known to contribute to pain today. Furthermore, it lacks an explanation as to why no two chronic pain patients have the same experience with pain, even if they have similar injuries. Despite these shortcomings, it still provided future researchers with a solid foundation to continue expanding the scientific understanding of the intricate phenomenon of pain.

**Specificity Theory**

Many scientists continued research long after Descartes proposed the dualistic theory of pain. However, it wasn't until 1811 that another well-known pain theory came onto the scene. This theory, initially presented by Charles Bell (1774–1842), is referred to as the specificity theory. This theory is similar to Descartes' dualistic approach to pain in the way that it delineates different types of sensations to different pathways. In addition to identifying specific pathways for different sensory inputs, Bell also postulated that the brain was not the homogenous object that Descartes believed it was but instead a complex structure with various components.

Scientists and philosophers alike spent the next century and a half further developing the specificity theory. One of the many contributors to this theory was Johannes Muller. In the mid-1800s, Muller published in the Manual of Physiology that individual sensations resulted from specific energy experienced at certain receptors. Furthermore, Muller believed that there was an infinite number of receptors in the skin. This surplus of receptors accounted for the ability of an individual to discriminate between different sensations.

This concept correlates well with previous research on this theory of pain, which reiterated the presence of distinct pathways for different sensations. Although this theory and the research surrounding it provided significant advancement in understanding pain, it still fails to account for factors other than those of physical nature that results in the sensation of pain. Much like the dualistic approach to pain, this theory also lacks an explanation for why pain sometimes persists long after the healing of the initial injury. This incomplete nature of the specificity theory regarding pain etiology necessitated additional theories and continued research.

**Pattern Theory**

Following the specificity theory, a handful of other philosophies were introduced regarding the sensation of pain. Of these philosophies, the pattern theory of pain has the greatest coverage in the scientific literature. The American psychologist John Paul Nafe (1888-1970) presented this theory in 1929. The ideas contained in the pattern theory were directly opposite to those suggested in the Specificity theory regarding sensation. Nafe indicated that there are no separate receptors for each of the four sensory modalities. Instead, he suggested that each sensation relays a specific pattern or sequence of signals to the brain. The brain then takes this pattern and deciphers it. Depending on which pattern the brain reads, it correlates with the sensation felt.

**Gate Control Theory**

In 1965, Patrick David Wall (1925–2001) and Ronald Melzack announced the first theory that viewed pain through a mind-body perspective. This theory became known as the gate control theory.

An individual's sensation of pain is the result of the complex interaction among these three components of the spinal cord. Simply stated, when the "gate" closes, the brain does not receive information from the periphery to the spinal cord. However, when the signal traveling to the spinal cord reaches a certain level of intensity, the "gate" opens. Once the gate is open, the signal can travel to the brain, where it is processed, and the individual proceeds to feel pain. The information mentioned above accounts for the physical component of pain. Still, as stated earlier, the Gate Control Theory was one of the first to acknowledge that psychological factors also contributed to the pain. In their original study, Melzack and Wall suggested that in addition to the control provided by the substantia gelatinosa, there was an additional control mechanism located in cortical regions of the brain.

In more recent times, researchers have postulated that these cortical control centers are responsible for the effects of cognitive and emotional factors on the pain experienced. Current research has also suggested that a negative state of mind amplifies the intensity of the signals sent to the brain.

The gate control theory has proven to be one of the most significant contributions to the study of pain throughout history. The concepts Melzack and Wall introduced to the study of pain are still utilized by researchers today. Even though this theory initiated the idea that pain wasn't solely a result of physical injury but rather a complex experience influenced by cognitive and emotional factors, additional research was necessary to completely comprehend the mechanisms and etiology of pain. This need precipitated the introduction of the following two philosophies regarding pain.

**Neuromatrix Model**

Almost thirty years after introducing the gate control theory of pain, Ronald Melzack introduced another model that contributed to the explanation of how and why people feel pain. Until the mid-1900s, most pain theories implied that this experience was exclusively due to an injury somewhere in the body. The thinking was that if an individual suffered an injury, whether it be through trauma, infection, or disease, a signal would transmit to the brain, resulting in the sensation of pain. Although Melzack had contributed to these previous theories, his exposure to amputees experiencing phantom limb pain in well-healed areas prompted his inquiry into this more accurate philosophy of pain. The theory he proposed is known as the neuromatrix model of pain. This philosophy suggests that the central nervous system is responsible for eliciting painful sensations rather than the periphery.

The neuromatrix model denotes four components within the central nervous system responsible for creating pain. The four components are the "body-self neuromatrix, the cyclic processing, and synthesis of signals, the sentinel neural hub, and the activation of the neuromatrix."

This idea that peripheral signals can alter the neurosignature is an important concept when considering the effect of nonphysical factors on an individual's experience with pain. Melzack's theory claimed that not only are there specific neurosignatures that elicit certain sensations, but when there is an alteration in a certain signal, this allows for memory formation of these particular experiences. If the same circumstances occur again in the future, this memory allows for the same sensation to be felt.

Considering all of these claims, it is evident that pain is a complex issue that cannot be accounted for by physical factors alone. Even though the neuromatrix model further established that cognitive and emotional factors influence pain in addition to physical factors, it still fails to account for social constructs of pain. Therefore, a new theory of pain must be utilized to appropriately explain the mechanism behind pain and why each individual's experience with pain is unique.

**Biopsychosocial Model**

The biopsychosocial model provides the most comprehensive explanation behind the etiology of pain. This specific theory of pain hypothesizes that pain results from complex interactions between biological, psychological, and sociological factors. Any theory that includes all three pain constructs fails to provide an accurate explanation for why an individual is experiencing pain.

One of the most prominent physicians who utilized this more comprehensive approach to pain was John Joseph Bonica (1917-1994). This Sicilian American anesthesiologist at Madigan Army Hospital established himself as the founding father of the pain medicine discipline. In the 1940s, Bonica cared for many patients who had returned home from World War II and were now experiencing debilitating pain due to injuries they had suffered in the war. He had recognized that the pain these wounded soldiers were experiencing was rather complex and not easily managed. This situation led him to propose that physicians create interprofessional pain clinics comprising multiple disciplines to manage these patients adequately.

This methodology considers that the human body cannot be divided into separate categories when considering treatment options. Instead, it is beneficial to acknowledge the fact that illness and disease are the results of complex interactions between biological, psychological, and sociological factors, and they all affect an individual's physical and mental well-being.

Loeser suggested that four elements must be considered when evaluating a patient with pain. These elements include nociception, pain, suffering, and pain behaviors. Nociception is the signal sent to the brain from the periphery to alert the body that there is some degree of injury or tissue damage. On the other hand, pain is the subjective experience that occurs after the brain has processed the nociceptive input. The last two pain components that merit consideration is suffering and pain behaviors. The thinking is that suffering is an individual's emotional response to the nociceptive signals and that pain behaviors are the actions people carry out in response to the experience of pain. Both of these can be either conscious or subconscious.

Loeser's four pain elements account for the biological, psychological, and sociological factors that can create or influence an individual's experience with pain. Failing to consider any of these four elements when determining the cause or establishing a management plan could be regarded as inadequate assessment or care. With a better understanding of what is causing a patient to experience pain, the doctor is provided with a more accurate foundation to begin formulating a treatment plan. Loeser's findings prove that the Biopsychosocial Model of pain offers the most comprehensive philosophy and provides the framework to start appropriate therapy to manage patients with chronic pain adequately.
