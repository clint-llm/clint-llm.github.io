A clavus is a well-demarcated thickened area of the epidermis that has a central core. This skin lesion is most commonly found on the foot and is often painful. Mechanical stresses to the epidermis result in clavus formation. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of clavus and highlights the vital role of the interprofessional healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of clavus formation.
- Outline the common physical exam findings associated with a clavus.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with a clavus.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by a clavus.
