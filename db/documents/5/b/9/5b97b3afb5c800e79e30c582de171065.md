Size and tumor location are the most important factors which determine the clinical presentation of the disease. The involvement of the suprasellar region results in hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction with significant endocrinal insufficiency. The patient develops polyuria and polydipsia due to diabetes insipidus. Growth failure, adrenal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, delayed puberty or precocious puberty may also be evident secondary to hypopituitarism. Dorsal extension of the tumor can cause compression of optic chiasm leading to abnormalities in the vision. However, symptoms may be subtle, leading to significant diagnostic delay.

Pineal region tumors usually present with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (headache, nausea, vomiting, papilledema) due to obstructive hydrocephalus. Neuroophthalmological abnormalities are also present, which include diplopia and Parinaud syndrome characterized by upward gaze paralysis, loss of light perception, loss of convergence, and nystagmus.

Complete general physical examination is critical, especially ophthalmological and neurological assessment. Primary and secondary sexual characteristics should be evaluated. In young children, assessment of growth parameters is also important.
