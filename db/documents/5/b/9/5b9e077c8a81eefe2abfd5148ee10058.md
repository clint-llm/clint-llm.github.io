Trauma may also play a role in creating issues that stem from the grey matter.  Since the neuronal cells of the grey matter are constantly working, they require a high supply of oxygen to function efficiently.  Therefore when the grey matter does not have access to oxygen, the cells will begin to die, leading to possible irreversible brain damage and loss of function.  Additionally, under blunt force trauma situations, the grey matter may become damaged due to an intracerebral hemorrhage, which can lead to apoptosis of the grey matter cells.
