In the case of drug-induced erythroderma, patients need counsel on avoidance of the specific trigger drug. For patients with underlying dermatoses, emphasis should be on ensuring proper management and follow-up for their underlying condition to decrease the risk of relapse.Â Those with psoriatic arthritis, atopic dermatitis, or other steroid-responsive dermatoses should understand that abrupt withdrawal of oral steroids may trigger an erythrodermic reaction.

Lastly, reasonable expectations are necessary with regard to the clearance of their clinical findings, which varies from case to case. Patients should also be made aware of possible long-term sequelae, though rare, including postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation in darker skin types, permanent nail changes, and keloid formation, among others.
