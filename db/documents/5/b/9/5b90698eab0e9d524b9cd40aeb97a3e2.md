When Waterhouse Friderichsen syndrome is suspected, complete blood work is required. Fall in hemoglobin and hematocrit levels suggest some form of occult bleeding. Leukocytosis may be present because of underlying bacterial infection. Low mineralocorticoid levels lead to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Hyponatremia also occurs due to the Syndrome of inappropriate diuretic hormone (SIADH) caused by cortisol deficiency. Volume contraction with accompanying prerenal azotemia may also be a feature. However, the absence of these electrolyte derangements should not exclude the diagnosis. Hypoglycemia, attributed to decreased glucocorticoid, tends to occur in WFS but is not severe, and it is readily correctable. Arterial Blood Gas analysis reveals metabolic acidosis.

Levels of plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, aldosterone, and renin activity should be obtained to assess adrenal function. There is a decrease in cortisol level with a rise in ACTH level, a decrease in aldosterone level, and a rise in renin level, features consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency.Â  If the diagnosis remains in doubt, one may administer cosyntropin (ACTH) to assess the adrenal function. CT scan is often used to evaluate adrenal hemorrhage in stable patients. Unstable patients may require an ultrasound at the bedside. Electrocardiography is also necessary to assess any changes in rhythm secondary to hyperkalemia.
