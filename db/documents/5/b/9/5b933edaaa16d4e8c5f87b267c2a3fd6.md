Baclofen is a medication primarily used as a muscle relaxant for spasticity. Baclofen overdose or withdrawal can be life-threatening. It is utilized as an adjunct in treating painful muscle spasticity, clonus, and rigidity caused by spinal-cord related diseases such as multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, or spinal cord injury. This activity reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management in the clinical setting related to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients with toxicity from baclofen.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of baclofen toxicity.
- Identify the common physical exam findings in patients presenting with toxicity from baclofen.
- Summarize the epidemiology of baclofen toxicity.
- Explain the management of patients with baclofen toxicity.
