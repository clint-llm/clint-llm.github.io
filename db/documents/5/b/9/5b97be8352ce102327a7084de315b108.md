Prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm has been decreasing over time, falling from about 4% to 8% prevalence in men older than age 65 to just over 2% prevalence in the same cohort in recent studies. This drop in prevalence has likely been due to decreased rates of tobacco use and implementation of healthier lifestyle choices. The majority of patients identified as having AAA have small aneurysms of less than 5.5 cm.  Because the 1-year incidence of rupture significantly increases to 9.4% for aneurysms of 5.5 cm to 5.9 cm, this is the usual threshold where risks of operative repair fall below risks of rupture. Furthermore, an aneurysm that has increased by greater than 0.5 cm is at increased risk of rupture and should prompt repair.

During the period between 2005 through 2012, the incidence of rupture was demonstrated to fall in both England and the United States, likely as a result of increased surveillance and intervention before rupture. The incidence of rupture in the United States was 7.29 per 100,000 population. However, it has been estimated that 4% to 5% of cases of sudden death are secondary to rAAA. Only about 50% of individuals with rAAA reach the hospital, and operative mortality in the setting of rupture is about 50%; however, it is difficult to know precise figures.
