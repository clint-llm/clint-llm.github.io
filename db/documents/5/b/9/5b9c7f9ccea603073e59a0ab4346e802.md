Because of the diverse causes of vaginal bleeding, the disorder is best managed by an interprofessional team. In all cases of severe bleeding, the first step is patient stabilization with attention to the ABCs. In most cases, vaginal bleeding is handled by an obstetrician or gynecologist. Severe bleeding may require blood transfusions and vaginal packing.

Beyond this, treatment depends on the etiology of the patient's vaginal bleeding. In cases of mild vaginal bleeding, often no specific therapy is required urgently, and work-up for underlying etiology and treatment of that etiology becomes paramount.
