Patients with an amebic liver abscess will typically have evidence of leukocytosis, elevated serum transaminases, alkaline phosphatase on laboratory evaluation. On imaging, most amebic liver abscesses will be found in the right lobe. Imaging modalities include ultrasound which might show around, hypo-echoic mass, CT scan can identify a low-density mass with peripheral enhancing rim, and MRI typically shows low signal intensity on the T1-weighted image and high signal intensity on T2-weighted image, which are fairly sensitive but without absolute specificity for an amebic liver abscess. Travel history to an endemic area, coupled with typical signs and symptoms and visualization of lesions on imaging should make one consider this entity and should be followed by doing the serologic testing. Serum antigen detection has a sensitivity of over 95% with serologic testing (indirect hemagglutination) having a sensitivity of 70% to 80% in acute disease and greater than 90% in the convalescent  state. It should be noted that in the first week of the disease course, there may be false-negative serologic tests. On the other hand, stool microscopy, has a sensitivity of only 10% to 40%.
