Patients more susceptible to CPM include those with a history of malnutrition, alcohol use disorder, chronic liver disease, and hyperemesis gravidarum. Patients most commonly have a history of rapid sodium correction, greater than 0.5-1.0 mEq/L per hour. The most susceptible patients are those with chronic hyponatremia (>48 hours) or those with severe hyponatremia (Na <120 mEq/L).

The onset of symptoms is usually seen 1 to 14 days after electrolyte correction. Clinical features of central pontine myelinolysis reflect damage to upper motor neurons and generally present in a biphasic course. Initially, patients present with acute encephalopathy and seizures that typically resolve as normal sodium levels are restored. This is later followed by clinical deterioration 3-5 days later. Signs and symptoms include dysphagia, dysarthria, spastic quadriparesis, pseudobulbar paralysis, ataxia, lethargy, tremors, dizziness, catatonia, and in the most severe cases, locked-in-syndrome and coma.
