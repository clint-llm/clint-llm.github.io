Caregivers of children discharged from the emergency department with antalgic gait should be given appropriate return precautions and timely follow-up arranged. Antibiotics should not be initiated. Detailed instructions stating conditions for a return on an emergent basis include persistent fever, persistent/worsening pain, refusal to ambulate, or irritability. If clinically indicated, outpatient follow-up with pediatric orthopedics should be arranged.
