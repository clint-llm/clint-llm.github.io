A need exists for an agreed set of definitions, and increased awareness of ventriculitis, to adequately assess incidence and risk factors in an attempt to reduce infection rates. Recommendations are currently based on expert opinion as rigorous clinical data are not yet available.

New tests and needed to rapidly and reliably detect the common causes of device-related ventriculitis, including those involving indolent bacteria such a P. acnes. Nucleic acid amplification tests may help accomplish this.

Care is necessary when sampling CSF as there is a risk of introducing infection, and it should be done based on clinical need only.
