Neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists are a class of antiemetic drugs that possess unique anxiolytic, antidepressant, and antiemetic properties. The discovery of neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor blockers was a crucial point in the prevention of emesis associated with cancer chemotherapy. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other key elements of antiemetic neurokinin-1 receptor blockers in the clinical setting related to the essential points needed by members of an interprofessional team managing the care of patients who can benefit therapeutically from these agents.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor blockers.
- Identify the approved indications for neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor blockers.
- Review the adverse events and contraindications of neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor blockers.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance appropriate clinical outcomes with neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor blocker therapy to treat nausea and vomiting and drive the optimal outcomes.
