Eptifibatide is intravenously administered and is available in strengths of 0.75 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml. The dose of eptifibatide is different in patients diagnosed with the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In patients with ACS, it is given immediately after the diagnosis at a loading dose of 180 mcg/kg IV, followed by a continuous IV infusion of 2 mcg/kg/min. The infusion continues up to 72 hours. Pre-PCI, eptifibatide is given as a loading dose of 180 mcg/kg IV, followed by a continuous infusion of 2 mcg/kg/min with another 180 mcg/kg IV bolus (double bolus regimen) given 10 minutes after the first one. Status post-PCI eptifibatide infusion continued up to 18 hours.

- Eptifibatide injection is provided as a sterile solution in 10-mL single-dose vials containing 20 mg of eptifibatide and 100-mL single-dose vials containing 75 mg of eptifibatide. Discard unused portions. Eptifibatide vials should be refrigerated at 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F). Upon transfer, the hospital pharmacist must mark the vial with a "DISCARD BY" time (Two months from the transfer date or the expiration date, whichever comes first). In addition, Eptifibatide should be Protected from light until administration.

- In ACS, eptifibatide is a therapeutic option, and other medications include alteplase, heparin, metoprolol, nitroglycerin, morphine, or furosemide. However, Eptifibatide is chemically incompatible with furosemide, and thus they should not be administered in the same intravenous line.

- Eptifibatide may be administered as eptifibatide injection in the same IV line with 0.9% NaCl or 0.9% NaCl/5% dextrose

**Specific Patient Population**

- **Patients with Renal Impairment:**Total drug clearance is reduced by almost 50%, and the steady-state plasma eptifibatide concentrations are doubled in patients with an estimated CrCl less than 50 mL/min. Consequently, clinicians should reduce the infusion dose to 1 mcg/kg/min in such patients and keep the loading dose similar to that of a normal kidney function. Eptifibatide is contraindicated in patients with serum creatinine greater than 4 mg/dL or patients requiring hemodialysis.

- **Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**Information regarding hepatic impairment is not provided in the manufacturer's labeling (no clinical studies have been conducted on patients with hepatic impairment).

- **Pregnancy Considerations:**Published literature and the pharmacovigilance database are insufficient to establish an eptifibatide associated with major congenital disability or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There were no adverse developmental effects in animal reproduction studies when eptifibatide was administered intravenously to pregnant rats and rabbits at approximately four times the recommended maximum daily human dose. However, myocardial infarction is a medical emergency that can be fatal to the pregnant woman and fetus if left untreated. Hence, the clinician should not withhold therapy for the pregnant woman because of potential concerns regarding the effects of eptifibatide on the fetus.

- **Breastfeeding Considerations:**No published information is available on the use of eptifibatide during breastfeeding. Eptifibatide is a small cyclic peptide; hence absorption by the infant is unlikely because it is likely destroyed in the infant's gastrointestinal tract.
