Overall, the therapeutic index of TCAs is narrow, and the therapeutic range for each specific TCA is dependent on the drug prescribed. Because of the narrow therapeutic index of TCAs, patients should be monitored closely for symptoms of toxicity, i.e., QRS-widening on electrocardiogram (ECG), tremors, confusion, muscle rigidity, and coma.

All patients starting a TCA need screening for pre-existing cardiac conditions, including prolonged QTc intervals, heart disease, and a family history of arrhythmias. Patients who test positive for pre-existing heart conditions may need additional evaluation by a cardiologist before initiating treatment. Additionally, these patients require regular monitoring for the presence of new cardiac symptoms. Patients with low potassium blood concentrations should have periodical monitoring to reduce the risk of arrhythmias.

All patients starting a TCA or presently taking a TCA should be monitored for worsening depressive symptoms or new-onset suicidal thoughts or behaviors. It may be helpful to monitor the blood concentrations of TCAs in non-adherent patients, have decreased tolerability or little response to the drug. However, there is mixed evidence on the effectiveness of blood concentration monitoring on clinical outcomes.
