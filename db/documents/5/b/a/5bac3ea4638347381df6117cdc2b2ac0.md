UTIs are usually managed by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and internist. however, not all UTIs are due to gram-negativeÂ organisms. In some cases, the organism may be S.Saprophyticus, which can only be identified following culture. While culture is not routine in all patients with a UTI, when the patient fails to improve, one must suspect a different organism and send the urine for culture.

Treatment with outpatient antibiotics is indicated in symptomatic or complicated UTIs and pyelonephritis. It is important to take into consideration specific local resistance patterns when choosing appropriate antibiotic coverage.

Patients who are hemodynamically unstable, have associated kidney injury, abscess formation, or emphysematous pyelonephritis, have failed outpatient treatment, have intractable nausea, vomiting, or pain, are unable to tolerate oral intake, or are unable to comply with medical treatment may require admission. These patients may need IV antibiotics and radiological studies to determine the extent of the infection.

When treated promptly, most patients have good outcomes.
