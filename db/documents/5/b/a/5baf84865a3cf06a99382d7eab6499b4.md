Treatment options may be divided into surgical and non-surgical. Surgical options include tangential excision, curettage, en bloc or serial excision and direct closure, and excision with reconstruction using tissue expansion, skin graft, or flap.

Non-surgical treatments include dermal abrasion, chemical peels, cryotherapy, electrosurgery, and ablative lasers.

Historically the rationale for treatments for CMNs was influenced by improving the aesthetic appearance and reducing the risk of malignant change. However, excision surgery to reduce malignancy risk remains controversial. Advocates of surgery argue that the incidence of melanoma isÂ lower in groups of patients who have undergone excision than those managed with observation.
