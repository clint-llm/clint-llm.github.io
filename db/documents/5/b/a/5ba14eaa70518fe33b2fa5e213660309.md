Central lines are placed for the following indications:

- Hemodynamic instability that requires vasopressor support

- Need to instill hyperosmolar agents or agents known to cause vein scarring (phlebosclerosis)

- Inadequate peripheral IV access (either failure to obtain peripheral access anywhere, or needing multiple IVs to sustain and resuscitate a patient)

- Mass transfusion protocol in patients with inadequate peripheral access
