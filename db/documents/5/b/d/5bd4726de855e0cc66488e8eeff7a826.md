Cortical blindness can affect both children and adults. In children, common causes include:

- Traumatic brain injury to the occipital lobe of the brain

- Congenital abnormalities of the occipital lobe

- Perinatal ischemia

In adults, it is seen in lesions of the primary visual cortex of the occipital lobes secondary to multiple disorders, including:

- Stroke

- Cardiac embolism

- Head trauma

- Occipital lobe epilepsy

- Hyponatremia

- Severe hypoglycemia

- Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease

- Infection e.g., HIV

- Eclampsia

- MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes)

- Rarely, transient cortical blindness can be caused by

- Infective endocarditis or
- Hypertensive encephalopathy,
- Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)
