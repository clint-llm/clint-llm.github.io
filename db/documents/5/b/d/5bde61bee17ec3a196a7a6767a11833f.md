Severe hypotension, bronchospasm, and allergic reactions are rare but life-threatening adverse effects, often necessitating immediate emergency treatment. Clinicians should not abruptly withdraw nadolol [US BOX WARNING] as it can cause rebound tachycardia, hypertension, or ischemia. Treatment should be stopped gradually to avoid these complications.
