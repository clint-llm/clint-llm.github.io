Diagnostic sympathetic blocks are used to confirm the presence of sympathetically mediated pain. Longer-acting therapeutic blocks can be performed by injecting neurolytic substances or repeated local anesthetic administrations. Physical modalities, such as radiofrequency denervation or cryoneurolysis of sympathetic nerves, may be utilized.

Sympathetic blocks are used to treat visceral, vascular, and neuropathic pain.

**Visceral Pain**

A). Foregut and midgut structures (stomach, duodenum, pancreas, biliary system and liver, small intestine) are innervated by the celiac plexus. Blocking this plexus may relieve pain and nausea, often associated with malignancies of the above-mentioned organs. If successful, this procedure may significantly reduce or even eliminate the need for opioid therapy. If a neurolytic agent is used, the relief may last from weeks to months.

B). Hindgut structures (descending, sigmoid colon, and proximal rectum) and pelvic organs (uterus, ovaries, prostate, urinary bladder, testes, and seminal vesicles) are innervated by the superior hypogastric plexus. A blockade of this prevertebral ganglion may be used to treat persistent or intractable pelvic and rectal pain that failed conservative treatment measures.

C). Inferior hypogastric plexus block may be utilized to treat pelvic, perineal, and genital pain of benign or malignant etiology. This procedure is not commonly used due to the pre-sacral location of the ganglion, posing difficulty to access and a higher risk of complications.

D). Distal structures of the pelvis are innervated sympathetically by the ganglion Impar. This ganglion may be blocked to treat malignant vulvar, rectal and anal pain, intractable sacral and perineal pain (e.g., postherpetic neuralgia), and/or coccydynia.

E). The thoracic paravertebral sympathetic chain not only transmits nociceptive input from the thoracic viscera but also acts as a relay station for white rami traveling to the cervical, abdominal, lumbar, and sacrococcygeal sympathetic nodes. Due to proximity to somatic nerves and complex surrounding anatomy,

If the primary disease process involves somatic structures (e.g., malignancy invading abdominal walls or musculoskeletal tissues, nerves), and the pain gains a somatic component, a sympathetic block may be less efficacious. In such cases, regional and neuraxial techniques may improve the quality of pain relief. Neuraxial analgesia (intrathecal or epidural) will block somatic and visceral afferents simultaneously, which is the basis for the implantation of long-term intrathecal drug delivery systems.

**Neuropathic Pain**

Sympathetic blocks can provide significant, yet often incomplete relief of neuropathic pain and are usually combined with adjuvant therapies (e.g., physiotherapy, medications, and/or neuromodulation). The role of sympathetic blocks in treating acute herpes zoster pain remains unclear. Pain from herpes zoster of the trigeminal region may be treated with stellate ganglion blocks, which may decrease the risk of developing postherpetic neuralgia.

Ultimately, sympathetic nerve blocks are not indicated for chronic treatment of neuropathic pain not related to CRPS according to the practice guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force of Chronic Pain Management and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine.

**Vascular Pain**

Pain from tissue ischemia (e.g., vasospastic, thrombotic, embolic) is transmitted via sympathetic afferent fibers and is enhanced by sympathetic vasoconstriction. Simultaneously, chronic ischemia can result in direct damage to soft tissues (e.g., ulceration) and nerves, adding somatic and neuropathic nociceptive components, respectively. Lumbar sympathetic block for treatment of resting pain of obliterative lower extremity disease (e.g., thromboangiitis obliterans and atherosclerosis) was historically among the most beneficial neural percutaneous interventions available with the majority of patients responding with a significant decrease in pain and increase in perfusion in the affected extremity.

**Hyperhidrosis**

Sympathetic ganglion blocks can provide temporary relief of hyperhidrosis.

**Acute Treatment of Electrical Storm**

A severe form of recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia with greater than or equal to 3 episodes in 24 hours is called an electrical storm. It is associated with a 2-fold to 8-fold increased risk of sudden cardiac death. A recent prospective study

**Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment**

A recent randomized control trial showed the efficacy of stellate ganglion blocks in the treatment of PTSD.

**Evidence of Blockade**

Common subjective signs of sympathectomy include pain relief, warmth, decrease in perspiration, and change in color of the area supplied by the nerves blocked. Objective tests are recommended and include measuring skin temperature (which is expected to elevate for the ipsilateral limb as compared to the contralateral limb) and blood flow, skin conductance, and provocative sweat tests (e.g., cobalt blue or ninhydrin sweat tests).
