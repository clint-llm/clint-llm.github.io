There are several chronic inflammatory disorders with no cure. Most are managed with symptomatic therapy. An interprofessional team including primary care physicians, nurses, physical therapists, dieticians, and specialists should be involved in the management of the underlying etiology, as well as prevention of complications of chronic inflammation. Patient education is the key with emphasis on diet and lifestyle modification including weight loss, regular exercises, smoking cessation, healthy diet, and good sleep hygiene.Â Unfortunately in some cases, life long anti-inflammatory medications may be needed to control chronic inflammation.
