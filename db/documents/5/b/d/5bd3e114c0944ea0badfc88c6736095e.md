Like all strokes, cerebellar infarcts are roughly divided into ischemic and hemorrhagic events. Ischemic strokes are caused by arterial obstructions that impair blood and oxygen delivery directly. These can be further subdivided by the source of the obstruction in the blood vessel, either through migration from the heart or directly at the vasculature. The thrombotic phenomenon can occur in large or small vessels, and thromboembolic can travel from large to small vessels. These can be due to atherosclerosis or other vasculopathies, including arterial dissections, typically of the vertebral arteries in cerebellar strokes.

In contrast to ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes are usually caused by arterial bleeding that directly damages brain tissue or obstructs vascular flow through elevated local pressure. These usually occur spontaneously, especially in patients with long-standing hypertension or those taking anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Secondary hemorrhagic conversion can also occur from ischemic infarcts, as well as from damaged tissue due to tumor or trauma. Finally, subdural hematomas, which usually stem from tears in bridging veins between the dura and arachnoid mater, can lead to focal neurologic deficits.
