Multiple Myeloma affects many organ systems and is best managed by an interprofessional team. Kidney involvement has been well documented in patients with plasma cell disorders. The light chains produced are filtered through the glomerulus and are endocytosed by the megalin receptors. Few of these light chains are resistant to degradation and tend to accumulate, causing damage to the proximal tubules. It can also cause Fanconi syndrome by the formation of crystalline inclusions in the proximal tubules. It is important to get the nephrologist involved early in the disorder as renal failure is a complication of multiple myeloma. Initial treatment should be focused on assessing the degree of renal impairment, correcting the hemodynamics, volume status, and electrolyte disturbances.  The hematologist should be consulted on the overall management of the disorder. The prognosis for patients with renal involvement in multiple myeloma depends on the severity of renal dysfunction and other comorbidities. For those whose renal function is irreversibly damaged, dialysis is necessary. However, at this stage, life expectancy is significantly reduced. [Level II]
