The incidence of mid-gut malrotation is estimated to be around 1 in 6000 live births. The majority of anomalies remain asymptomatic, so the true incidence remains unknown.  The most common type of rotational anomalies is nonrotation, with a rate of 2 per 1000 contrast studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract.

The most severe presentation of the gastrointestinal rotational anomaly is malrotation with bowel volvulus. Therefore, intestinal malrotation was considered a disease of infancy, presenting within the first year of life. Thirty percent of cases occur in the first month of life, 60% by approximately one year of age, and over 75% percent by the age of five.

Mid-gut malrotation is associated with congenital anomalies, including congenital heart disease(CHD) such as heterotaxy, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, omphalocele, and other congenital abdominal wall defects(CAWD), certain types of intestinal atresias, esophageal atresia, biliary atresia, complex anorectal malformations such as VACTERL.
