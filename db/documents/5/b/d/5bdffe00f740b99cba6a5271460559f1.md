There is no specific safe range for insulin glargine as the dose is adjusted individually and depends on factors specific to the individual, including responsiveness to the insulin, diet, and daily routine. Other contributing factors that merit consideration during dosing include the type of diabetes, body weight, compliance, and rate of medication elimination. Safety issues that can arise include confusing insulin glargine with another insulin that the patient is taking concurrently. If an individual takes an inappropriate insulin dose, they are at high risk of suffering severe hypoglycemia.

The effects of insulin glargine are monitored on an outpatient basis utilizing a glucometer or continuous glucose monitor to follow blood glucose trends. The dosing of insulin depends on those findings. Continuous glucose monitors are becoming a more popular means to monitor blood glucose levels and the efficacy of an insulin regimen.
