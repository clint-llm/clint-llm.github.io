A clear regional variation exists for choledochal cysts, where two-thirds of the reported cases in Asia occur in Japan. This condition predominantly affects the Asian population with an incidence of 1 in 1000 live births, compared to an incidence of 1 in 100000-150000 live births in the western population. Although uncommon in the western population, the incidence of this disease in the U.S. and Australia was reported to be 1 in 13500 and 1 in 15000 live births, respectively.
