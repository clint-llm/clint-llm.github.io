**DNA Viruses**

**Herpesviridae**

**Primary Herpetic Gingivostomatitis (PHGS) and Herpes Labialis**

Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (PHGS) and herpes labialis can potentially recur, mainly in immunocompromised patients. The untreated cases lead to the dissemination of the infection.

Additionally, reactivation of HSV-1, particularly in the geniculate ganglion, may lead to Bell palsy.

**Chicken Pox**

In cases of severe chickenpox infection, patients may experience severe complications, including Reye's syndrome, encephalitis, and Guillan Barre.

**Shingles**

Long-term complications of shingles infection include postherpetic neuralgia and severe pain in affected areas after the resolution of the infection. This is due to scarring of the affected sensory nerve. Additionally, patients may experience hyperpigmentation and scarring of affected areas.

**Infectious Mononucleosis**

Several complications associated with EBV infection are recognized. These include hepatitis, aplastic anemia, or splenic rupture.

**Oral Hairy Leukoplakia**

Oral hairy leukoplakia is a benign lesion, and malignant transformation has not been described. However, due to the location of lesions and potential size, patients may experience mild complications such as oral burning or pain.

**Cytomegalovirus**

Cytomegalovirus may lead to complications in at-risk populations, e.g., infection in pregnancy can cause fetal transmission and illness. In immunocompromised patients, the infection may disseminate and cause retinitis and blindness.

**Kaposi Sarcoma**

Potential complications of Kaposi sarcoma include ulceration and associated bleeding.

**Papillomaviridae**

**Human Papillomavirus**

******Verruca Vulgaris, Oral Squamous Papillomas, Condyloma Acuminatum, and Heck's Disease******

Human papillomavirus infection and its long-term implications are still not completely understood. Most benign lesions are associated with low-risk HPV subtypes, usually cleared from the oral mucosa with time.

A high-risk subtype, HPV-16, is known to remain in the oral and oropharyngeal mucosa and contribute to HPV-positive oropharyngeal malignancy. The risk of HPV persistence in oral mucosa is particularly increased in smokers.

**Poxviridae**

**Molluscum Contagiosum**

Generally, the disease resolves within six months, but cases where the condition has remained for several years, have been described.

Additionally, patients with immunodeficiency experience larger and refractory lesions with more extensive involvement of the oral mucosa. Some may also develop eczema molluscorum: eczematous plaques around the lesions.

**Enteroviruses**

******Herpangina, Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease, and Acute Lymphonodular Pharyngitis******

Oral lesions and pain caused by coxsackie virus infection may result in dehydration. Additionally, those with severe illness may experience neurologic involvement, like encephalitis or aseptic meningitis.

**Paramyxoviruses**

**Measles or Rubeola**

Complications of primary measles infection are rare due to decreased disease prevalence; however, several complications were described before vaccination. These included pneumonia, keratoconjunctivitis leading to blindness, and CNS infections, including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, measles inclusion body encephalitis, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.
