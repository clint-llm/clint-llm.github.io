Glaucoma is defined to be a progressive optic neuropathy that can lead to irreversible blindness. There are various known risk factors for glaucoma. However, intraocular pressure (IOP) appears to be the only known modifiable risk factor for control of onset and progression of optic neuropathy.

Wise and Witter described the first protocol for argon laser trabeculoplasty in 1979. They demonstrated the safety and efficacy of ALT in a group of patients with open-angle glaucoma (OAG). The safety and long-term efficacy of ALT were studied in the Glaucoma Laser Trial (GLT). In the GLT, eyes receiving 360 degrees ALT were compared with medical monotherapy with a follow-up period of  2.5 to 5.5 years, concluding that trabeculoplasty was as efficacious as medical therapy in reducing intraocular pressure. However, ALT did not become primary therapy in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) because of a reduction in efficacy over time, so it was used as an adjunctive therapy.

Laser trabeculoplasty gained popularity with the introduction of selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT). SLT uses a Q-switched frequency-doubled Nd: YAG laser in the trabecular meshwork, which appears less destructive than ALT. However, it has been noticed that both ALT and SLT are equally efficacious in reducing intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma.
