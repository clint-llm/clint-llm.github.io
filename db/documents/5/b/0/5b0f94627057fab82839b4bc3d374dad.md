In a recent meta-analysis including 144 fetuses with mega cisterna magna, the rates of the additional central nervous system (CNS) and extra-CNS anomalies were 12.6% and 16.6%, respectively, without any identifiable chromosome abnormality.

It has been postulated that the cerebellum is connected to various regions of the cerebral cortex by a cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit and that the cerebellum may serve a crucial role in this circuit by coordinating or modulating aspects of cortical activity.

There have been reported psychiatric associations between mega cisterna magna, including mania, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and catatonia.

Due to the limited reports and rarity of mega cisterna magna, it is difficult to state if there is any relationship between mega cisterna magna and psychiatric disorders or if these are purely incidental reports.
