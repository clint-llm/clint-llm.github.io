The procedure itself is described to a patient as follows: "A cardiac catheterization is a minimally invasive procedure in which we will be assessing the blood vessels of your heart with the use of contrast dye and fluoroscopy. The first step of the procedure entails gaining vascular access, most commonly through the radial artery in the wrist and sometimes through the femoral artery in the groin. Once arterial access is obtained, we will use a small catheter (approximately 2 to 3mm in diameter) and wire (approximately 0.014- 0.035 mm in diameter) to gain access to the arteries of the heart. Once the arteries are accessed, we will take multiple pictures to look for significant blockages. If blockages are present, we will proceed with fixing these lesions with stents and balloons. The procedure does care for risks of bleeding and infection at the entry site, pain, discomfort, vascular complications, stroke, heart attack, and possible death. The risk is generally low (between 1 to 2%), and the benefits of the procedure far outweigh the risk."
