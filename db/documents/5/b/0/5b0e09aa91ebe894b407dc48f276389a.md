It is essential to confirm vitamin B12 deficiency before starting therapy and a follow-up plan for the monitoring of the patient’s response. If there is severe anemia associated with vitamin B12 deficiency, the patient’s response should lead to a marked increase in reticulocytes (precursors of red blood cells) by one-to-two weeks. In mild deficiencies of B12, this is less important, and follow-up should be done at two-to-three months after initiation of hydroxocobalamin. These measurements should include vitamin B12 levels as well as homocysteine and methylmalonic acid levels.
