The initial evaluation and determination of SCH is clinical and based on appearance itself. However, a careful slit-lamp with fluorescein examination is important to determine any ocular trauma or possible underlying local ocular condition, which can lead to an SCH. All patients presenting with SCH should have blood pressure checked routinely. An INR should be checked if a patient is taking warfarin. If the SCH becomes persistent or recurrent then a workup regarding bleeding disorders and other hypocoagulable states should be done. However, it should be noted that extensive hemostatic testing is not warranted in the absence of other bleeding symptoms and solely SCH. Fundoscopy is generally not indicated.
