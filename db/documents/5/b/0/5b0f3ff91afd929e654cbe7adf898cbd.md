One year survival rate post-HTx is close to 90%. Median survival for patients receiving HTx has improved significantly. Patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support before HTx have a worse prognosis. Acute allograft rejection is responsible for 10% of deaths within the first three years. The incidence of CAV increases steadily after transplantation. Malignancy is the most common cause of mortality beginning at 5 years post-HTx. About 2-4% of heart transplant recipients end up receiving repeat retransplantation. Overall outcomes after retransplantation are inferior compared to primary HTx.
