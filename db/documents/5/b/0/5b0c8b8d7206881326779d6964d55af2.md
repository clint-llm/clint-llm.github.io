Pemphigus vulgaris is a life-threatening autoimmune disease for which treatment is indicated. The goal of treatment in PV is to induce complete remission of PV with minimal treatment-related adverse effects. Cutaneous and mucosal involvement in PV can cause significant pain and functional impairment. Local measures may help to improve patient symptoms. Due to the serious adverse effects, prolonged treatment with high doses of a systemic glucocorticoid is not recommended.  A secondary infection like Herpes simplex should be considered when lesions fail to respond to treatment. An interprofessional approach, including social workers, wound care staff, dieticians, nursing, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, dentists, primary care physicians, hospitalists, and dermatologists, can optimize outcomes.
