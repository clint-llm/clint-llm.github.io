Often, the use of microbiological testing does not provide relevant diagnostic information,Â as the microbiological description of ANUG can also be typical of healthy gingiva, gingivitis, and periodontitis.

Four distinct layers have been described. Most superficial is a bacterial area of fibrous mesh composed of epithelial cells, leukocytes, and a variety of bacterial cells, including rods, fusiform bacteria, and spirochetes. Deep to that layer exists a neutrophil-rich zone composed of a higher number of leukocytes, spirochetes, and bacterial cells. Next lies a necrotic zone containing disintegrated cells, spirochetes, and fusiform bacteria. The deepest layer contains spirochete infiltration.
