Chemically enalapril is (S)-1-[N-[1-(ethoxycarbonyl)-3-phenylpropyl]-l-alanyl]-l-proline. The active form of enalapril is enalaprilat. It inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), thereby reducing the level of angiotensin-II. This action causes a decrease in total peripheral resistance without an increase in cardiac oxygen demand. There is a decrease in aldosterone and an increase in serum renin levels.

**Pharmacokinetics**

- Absorption: Good oral absorption

- Distribution: Volume of distribution is 1 to 2.4 L/kg

- Metabolism: De-esterified into enalaprilat in the liver
