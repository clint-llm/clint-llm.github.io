Ultrasonography, the most common radiological imaging used for gallstone disease diagnosis, has a high specificity for detecting gas in the gallbladder wall. This indicates emphysematous cholecystitis, but the sensitivity is low. During an ultrasonogram, the air in the wall or lumen of the gallbladder can interfere with the clear visualization of the gallbladder The best imaging modality to confirm the presence of emphysematous cholecystitis is a contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan.

The plain x-ray may reveal air and/or air-fluid levels in the gallbladder.

A CT scan will confirm the presence of gas in the gallbladder wall or lumen and provide accurate information about the presence of air or fluid in the pericholecystic tissue, free air in the peritoneum, or rarely, retroperitoneum. The presence of air in the peritoneum or retroperitoneum represents a more severe form of emphysematous cholecystitis. A suggested classification according to radiological findings as progressive stages starting with detection of air limited to the gallbladder lumen and progressing to findings of air in the gallbladder and the pericholecystic tissue as the most advanced stage. MRI can provide accurate information on the presence of intramural air and necrosis.

Blood work will usually reveal a leucocytosis, and liver function tests may be normal or abnormal. Serum glucose levels are usually elevated.
