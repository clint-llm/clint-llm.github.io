May-Hegglin anomaly (MHA) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by neutrophils with abnormal cytoplasmic inclusions, large platelets, and variable thrombocytopenia. May-Hegglin anomaly is a member of a group of diseases associated with myosin heavy chain single gene defects that represent hereditary forms of macrothrombocytopenia associated with leukocyte inclusions and variable clinical features such as sensorineural hearing loss, presenile cataracts, and renal failure. This group also includes Fechtner syndrome, Sebastian syndrome, and Epstein syndrome. This activity describes the pathophysiology, etiology, presentation and treatment of May-Hegglin anomaly and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in providing care for affected individuals.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of May-Hegglin anomaly.
- Describe the presentation of May-Hegglin anomaly.
- Summarize the treatment options for May-Hegglin anomaly.
- Explain the importance of optimizing coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care to patients with May-Hegglin anomaly.
