The most common type of gallbladder polyps are pseudo or cholesterol polyps. These account for 60% to 90% of all gallbladder polyps. They are not true neoplastic growths, but rather they are cholesterol deposits that form as projections on the inner lumen of the gallbladder wall. They are formed from precipitation of cholesterol or bile salts. Presence of cholesterol polyps may be indicative of pathologic gallbladder disease such as chronic cholecystitis. Inflammatory polyps account for 5% to 10% of all gallbladder polyps. They are associated with inflammation of the gallbladder mucosa and wall. Usually, this type is associated with repeated bouts of cholecystitis and acute biliary colic. Both pseudopolyps and inflammatory polyps carry close to a zero risk of developing a gallbladder cancer. These polyps rarely exceed 1 cm in diameter and are often multiple. True adenomatous gallbladder polyps are considered neoplastic. They are rare and are often associated with gallstones. They can range in size from 5 mm to 20 mm. Once the polyp reaches a size of greater than 1 cm, consideration needs to be made for cholecystectomy, because of the potential malignant increases above 1 cm. Adenomyomatosis is a more common true poly. It has classically been considered a benign lesion of the fundus of the gallbladder. However, recent findings suggest these lesions do have premalignant potential. Malignant polyps tend to be singular and more than 2 cm in diameter.
