**Biosynthesis**

The synthesis of ET gets regulated at the level of transcription. The first protein transcribed would undergo processing by a furin-type proprotein convertase. This process yields a molecule called â€˜big ET-1', an inactive intermediate. Endothelin converting enzyme (ECE) acts on big ET-1, converting it into ET-1. ECE conversion consists of two steps: Big ET-1 to ET-1(1-31) by chymase and then to ET-1 by neprilysin.

**Cellular Signaling:**

Arterial vasoconstriction is mainly by ETA, while venous vasoconstriction is by ETB. Vasodilation is otherwise mediated via ETB receptor activation. The same vessel undergoes constriction when the ET-1 passes deeper into the smooth muscle layer and activates the ETA receptors.

**Regulation:**

Angiotensin-II, transforming growth factor-b, thrombin, bradykinin, hypoxia, and low-density lipoprotein (either oxidized or acetylated) induces the expression of ET-1. An inhibitor of expression is nitric oxide (NO).

**Endothelin Converting Enzyme:**

Endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) belongs in the family of metalloproteases. The ECE-1 gene is on chromosome 1. The same ECE-1 has four isoforms (ECE-1a, 1b, 1c, 1d), among which ECE-1a and ECE-1c have antagonistic activities of suppressing and increasing the invasiveness of cancer cells.

**Endothelin Receptors:**

There are two types of G-protein coupled transmembrane receptors detected - ETA and ETB.
