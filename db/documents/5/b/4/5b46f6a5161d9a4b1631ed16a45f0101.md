Only topical formulations have approval for use by the FDA. Most formulations contain 1% silver sulfadiazine. Care is necessary to avoid the periocular region and mucosal surfaces when applying the medication, as research has shown that eye irritation and mucosal absorption can occur. Silver sulfadiazine application should be performed with sterile equipment and minimal trauma to the tissue. This technique is best achieved by using sterile gloves and applying the medication manually. A layer 1/16" should be applied to entirely cover the cleaned, debrided burned area.

It is important to employ a sterile technique and never "double-dip" when using sterile tongue blades or sterile cotton swabs for smaller burns. Bacteria can be introduced into the tub of medication if not following these guidelines. For a similar reason, each tube or tub of medication should be designated for one patient only to avoid spreading pathogens between patients. Patient education regarding the proper application and use of drugs is imperative, and documentation of that teaching is equally important.

The same administration is used in pediatric burn wounds, although pediatric use is currently off-label as of this writing.
