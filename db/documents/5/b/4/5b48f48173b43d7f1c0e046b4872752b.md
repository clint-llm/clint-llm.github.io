The initial evaluation of OH must include measuring blood pressure, and heart rate after the patient has been recumbent for at least 5 minutes and again after 1 minute and 3 minutes of standing. The diagnosis is made with one or both criteria of the definition of orthostatic hypotension. For those patients with hypertension, a reduction of systolic BP of 30 mm Hg is more appropriate to define OH.

A complete medical history and physical examination should be performed. With special regard to medications, comorbidities, potential volume losses, and a complete neurologic examination. Seeking clinical clues to possibleÂ etiologies.

The heart rate response is useful to give us a clue in the etiology. If the heart rate response to postural change is less than 15 bpm suggests a neurogenic OH. On the other hand, if there is an increase in heart rate of over 20 bpm suggests volume depletion or over 30 bpm suggests postural tachycardia syndrome. Postural tachycardia syndrome is another form of chronic orthostatic intolerance, mostly affecting children and young adults. These patients usually present the typical symptoms of orthostatic hypotension, but not meet the criteria for OH (little or no fall of blood pressure) and the autonomic response is associated with an exaggerated tachycardia.

If there is a high suspicion of OH of neurologic origin, patients should be referred to an Autonomic Center for further evaluation. Although, regardless of the cause, the treatment of orthostatic hypotension is symptomatic.
