Generally, there are no contraindications to performing the Achilles reflex test; however, one may have to defer the test in cases of injury. These injuries could be secondary to trauma or any underlying disorders that make the procedure difficult for the examiner to perform and the patient to sustain. Other possible contraindications are skin disorders. For instance, if a patient has advanced psoriasis of the overlying skin, it could be uncomfortable for the patient to undergo this procedure.
