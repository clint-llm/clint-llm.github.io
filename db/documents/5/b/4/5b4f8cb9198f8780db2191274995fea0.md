Multiple etiologies can result in ulnar nerve compression at the cubital tunnel and cause symptoms such as tingling along the medial aspect of the forearm, the little finger, and the medial aspect of the ring finger.

- **Pressure**on the ulnar nerve is a common cause of symptoms. The ulnar nerve is quite superficial at the point of the medial epicondyle; this is why people may experience the feeling of shooting pain and electric shock in the forearm if they accidentally hit their elbow on a hard surface.

- **Stretching**the ulnar nerve can also result in similar symptoms. The ulnar nerve lies behind the medial epicondyle. During flexion of the elbow joint, the ulnar nerve gets stretched because of this anatomical position. Repetitive elbow flexion and extension can cause further damage and irritation to the ulnar nerve. Some individuals sleep with elbows bent which can stretch the ulnar nerve for an extended period during sleep, which is an identified cause of irritation to the ulnar nerve.

- **Injuries**to the elbow joint (fractures, dislocations, swelling, effusions) can cause anatomical damage which will cause symptoms because of compression/irritation of the ulnar nerve.

A study of 117 patients identified that direct pressure on the nerve because of habits while sitting, or secondary to occupational activities is a significant cause of nerve damage as the nerve passes posterior to the medial epicondyle.
