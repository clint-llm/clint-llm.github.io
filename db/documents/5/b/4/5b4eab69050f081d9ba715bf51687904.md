The fascia lata (FL) is a fascial plane that surrounds the deep tissues of the thigh. It varies in thickness throughout its course from the hip to the leg. It receives fibers from gluteus maximus and tensor fascia lata (TFL) laterally. This arrangement could explain the often interchangeability with the (TFL) and the iliotibial band (ITB) colloquially. The TFL often serves as a landmark for surgical procedures, including anterior/anterolateral hip and femur procedures.
