Most bacteria have a peptidoglycan cell wall surrounding the bacterial plasma membrane, preventing osmotic lysis and providing structural integrity. The peptidoglycan wall is continually remodeling during replication and growth. Penicillin inhibits the cross-linking of peptidoglycan in the cell wall.

Most penicillin derivatives are not metabolized much by the liver. Oral vs. injection will have different bioavailabilities. They are rapidly excreted in the urine as they are water-soluble, and some of the drugs are excreted in bile. Penicillin has a relatively short half-life of about 2 hours.
