Individuals diagnosed with pseudocholinesterase deficiency should inform their doctor and anesthesia provider of their condition before any surgery. The patient's medical record should be updated to reflect the diagnosis of pseudocholinesterase deficiency. Future anesthetics should avoid administration of succinylcholine and mivacurium to avoid prolonged neuromuscular blockade and possibly respiratory failure. Â Family members of patients with pseudocholinesterase deficiency are encouraged to undergo laboratory testing due to a strong genetic component associated with inheriting an abnormal variant of the pseudocholinesterase gene.
