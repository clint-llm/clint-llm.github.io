Inflammatory back pain is differentiated from mechanical back pain by its insidious onset, improvement with exercise, lack of improvement with rest, and pain at night that improves with rising and movement. Given its association with seronegative spondyloarthropathies, IBP may be preceded by an inciting illness or systemic inflammatory process.
