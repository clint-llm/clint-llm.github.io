Giant fornix syndrome (GFS) is a rare infectious inflammatory condition of the superior and, less commonly, the inferior conjunctival fornices, associated with abnormally deep fornices, a gross recurrent bacterial infection of the conjunctivae, and age-related levator aponeurosis degradation.Â Normal fornices depth has been defined in healthy South Asian populations as 15.3 mm and 10.9 mm for superior and inferior fornices, respectively.

Patients are almost exclusively over 65, with mean and median ages falling in the late seventies to early eighties.
