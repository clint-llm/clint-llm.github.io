Persistent hyperglycemia in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can cause several complications, both acute and chronic. Diabetes mellitus is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular disease (CVD), blindness, kidney failure, and amputation of lower limbs. Acute complications include hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state, and hyperglycaemic diabetic coma. Chronic microvascular complications are nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy, whereas chronic macrovascular complications are coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), and cerebrovascular disease. It is estimated that every year 1.4 to 4.7% of middle-aged people with diabetes have a CVD event.
