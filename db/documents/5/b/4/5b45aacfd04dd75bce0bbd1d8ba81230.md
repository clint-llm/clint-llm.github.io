The musculature of the upper limb is quite vast, much more so than the lower extremity. The upper arm contains three muscles in the anterior compartment. The long and short head of the biceps brachii are located superiorly while the coracobrachialis and brachialis are deep to the biceps. The posterior compartment contains only one muscle, the triceps brachii. The forearm consists of 20 muscles, separated into five compartments. Biceps brachii tendon rupture is a common pathology seen with flexion at the elbow. Patients typically present with a bulge in the anterior arm, sometimes referred to as “Popeye sign,” after hearing a loud pop during the injury.

The anterior forearm consists of four muscles in the superficial group: flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, palmaris longus, and pronator teres. The lone muscle in the intermediate/middle compartment is the flexor digitorum superficialis. The deep layer of the anterior compartment contains three muscles: flexor digitorum profundus, flexor pollicus longus, and pronator quadratus. These muscles consist of mainly flexor and pronator muscles, and most of the superficial muscles arise from a common flexor tendon on the medial epicondyle of the humerus. Overuse of the superficial flexor muscles can lead to a syndrome known as medial epicondylitis, which is sometimes referred to as "golfer's elbow." Repetitive pronation/flexion leads to pain near the medial epicondyle, which worsens with use.

The posterior forearm is separated into two compartments, superficial and deep, with seven and five muscles, respectively. The superficial compartment consists of anconeus, brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis, extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor digitorum, and extensor digiti minimi. The deep compartment contains abductor pollicis longus, extensor indicis, extensor pollicis longus and brevis, and supinator. As with the anterior superficial compartment, the majority of the superficial muscles of the posterior compartment arise from a common extensor tendon; this time arising from the lateral epicondyle. The main actions of the muscles in the posterior forearm are extension and supination. Like the flexors in the anterior department, the superficial extensor also can suffer from an overuse injury. This syndrome is referred to as tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis.

The muscles of the hand can be subdivided into three groups, which are muscles of the palm, thenar muscles, and hypothenar muscles. The thenar muscles are located at the thumb, and consist of abductor pollicis brevis, flexor pollicis brevis, and opponens pollicis. The median nerve innervates all three of these muscles. The hypothenar muscles are located at the ulnar side of the hand, near the five digit, or pinky finger. They are the abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi brevis, and opponens digiti minimi. The ulnar nerve innervates them all. The third group of muscles consists of two single muscles and three groups of muscles. The single muscles are palmaris brevis and adductor pollicis. The first group is the dorsal interossei, which consists of four muscles attaching to the metacarpals, which are responsible for abduction of the fingers. The second group, the palmar interossei, are three (some anatomy texts report four) muscles located on the anterior surface of the metacarpals. They are responsible for adduction of the fingers. The ulnar nerve innervates both the palmar and dorsal interossei. There are also four lumbrical muscles in the hand. Each of these muscles originates from the tendon of the flexor digitorum profundus and is responsible for flexion of the finger at the metacarpal-phalangeal joint and extension of the interphalangeal joints. The radial two lumbricals are innervated by the median nerve, while the ulnar nerve innervates the two on the ulnar side. There are no lumbricals associated with the thumb.
