Subdural empyema usually presents with signs and symptoms of infection; however, it can also be asymptomatic.

Physical examination can show unstable vital signs, including fever, tachycardia, and respiratory compromise, which could all correlate with sepsis. Presentation in most cases is gradually progressive, and if untreated, symptoms may worsen. Some patients can become critically ill quickly, becoming drowsy, stuporous, and eventually comatose or even die.

Other physical examination findings related to the neurological exam include meningismus, contralateral hemiplegia, and cranial nerve palsies, anisocoria, and papilledema.
