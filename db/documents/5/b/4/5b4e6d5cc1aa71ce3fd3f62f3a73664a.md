There are no known complications related to Lhermitte's sign. However, it is occasionally reported as a facet of a discontinuation syndrome related to certain medications. Psychotropic medications such as SSRIs and SNRIs, specifically paroxetine and venlafaxine, have been shown to have a reported association. Fluoxetine, given the extended length of its half-life, has less likelihood of causing Lhermitte's sign upon sudden discontinuation.
