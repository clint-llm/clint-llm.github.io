Most patients may not recall a tick bite due to the delayed progression of ACA. Furthermore, diagnosis is quite challenging due to varying clinical manifestations. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is considered to be biphasic; it initially presents as bluish-red lesions overlying doughy and swollen skin. It later progresses to extensive skin atrophy with a prominence of underlying blood vessels and a shiny appearance or “cigarette paper skin.” Lesions are primarily located on the bilateral extensor surfaces of the limbs. Fibroid nodules may develop over bony prominences, especially in the ulnar or tibial regions.

In 15% of the patients with ACA, a localized increase of collagen leads to band-like induration with decreased movement of the joints.
