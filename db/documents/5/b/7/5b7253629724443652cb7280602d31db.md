Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a recurrent, bilateral allergic inflammation of the conjunctiva.

Additional types include perennial and seasonal rhinoconjunctivitis, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, and giant papillary conjunctivitis.VKC is classified based on the area of ocular involvement into palpebral, limbal, and mixed forms.

**Palpebral VKC**

This involves the upper tarsal conjunctiva. There is a close association between the inflamed conjunctiva and the corneal epithelium, often leading to significant corneal disease.

**Limbal VKC**

This typically affects bulbar conjunctiva in the palpebral area and typically affects the Black and Asian populations.

**Mixed VKC**

This has features of both the palpebral and limbal forms.

Arlt was the first to describe peri-limbal swelling in 1846. Horner and Tranta explained the white elevations at the limbus, and these were named as Horner-Tranta dots. Gabrielides studied conjunctival secretions; he found that eosinophils are the main components of these secretions.
