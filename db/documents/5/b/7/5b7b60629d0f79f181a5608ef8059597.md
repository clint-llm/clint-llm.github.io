Even though Acinetobacter is mostly a nosocomial pathogen and is isolated from hospitalized patients, care should be exercised in determining if the isolate is a cause or simplyÂ a result of colonization. Acinetobacter is a water-loving organism and has the propensity to colonize body organs that contain fluid. Thus, in hospitalized patients, Acinetobacter is often found in the peritoneal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), saliva, respiratory secretions and urinary tract.
