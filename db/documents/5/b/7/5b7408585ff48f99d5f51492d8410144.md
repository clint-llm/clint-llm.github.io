The oral cavity lies at the junction of many critical anatomic structures and the coalescence of many fascial planes.

Odontogenic infections are classified and treated based on the tissues and spaces involved and the severity or progression of infection. Dental caries is the leading cause of odontogenic infection, the most common of which is the periapical abscess.

Treatment often involves a combination of enteral or intravenous antibiotics and surgical drainage or debridement. In any case of odontogenic or orofacial infection, treatment by definitive dental extraction is the gold standard, although select cases may be amenable to dental preservation through endodontic treatment.
