Diseases affecting the glomerulus generally divide into two different entities according to the clinical presentation:

- Nephrotic syndrome: This syndrome presents with proteinuria >3.5g per 24 hours or protein-to-creatinine ratio >3000 mg/g, hypoalbuminemia <3g/dL, edema, and hyperlipidemia.

- Glomerulonephritis or nephritic syndrome occurs when the patient presents with hypertension, hematuria, proteinuria (usually sub-nephrotic), and rapidly progressive azotemia.

**Nephrotic Syndrome**

Nephrotic syndrome may be primary or secondary. Primary nephrotic syndrome occurs when the kidney is the primary or sole affected organ. Secondary nephrotic syndrome is when systemic immunologic, metabolic, or vascular diseases affect the glomeruli. Out of these two, secondary nephrotic syndrome is the most common.

**Primary Nephrotic Syndrome**

The following are some of the most common causes of primary nephrotic syndrome.

- Minimal Changes are the most common cause of primary nephrotic syndrome in children. It is idiopathic in most cases, but sometimes it is associated with neoplasias, recent infections, or vaccination. It is characterized by normal glomeruli appearance on H&E stain, negative immunofluorescence (IF) given no immune complex deposits, and effacement of foot processes on electron microscopy (EM).

- Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the most common cause of primary nephrotic syndrome in Hispanics and African American adults. It is usually idiopathic (primary)  but can be associated with HIV, sickle cell disease, or heroin use (secondary). It is characterized by focal and segmental sclerosis on H&E stain, effacement of foot processes on EM, and negative IF. This type of glomerulopathy often progresses to chronic renal failure.

- Membranous nephropathy is the most common etiology of primary nephrotic syndrome in White race adults. It is usually idiopathic (primary) but can be related to hepatitis, rheumatic diseases, neoplasias, or drugs (secondary). Microscopic characteristics are glomerular basement membrane thickening on H&E, subepithelial immune complex deposition with a “spike and dome” appearance on EM, and granular appearance on IF. Similar to FSGS, membranous nephropathy often progresses to chronic renal failure.

**Secondary Nephrotic Syndrome**

Secondary nephrotic syndrome can result from systemic immunologic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or vasculitis, metabolic diseases like diabetes, or vascular diseases like hypertension. The most common cause of secondary nephrotic syndrome is diabetes mellitus. In diabetes, hyperglycemia leads to glycosylation of the vascular basement membrane, causing hyaline arteriolosclerosis. The efferent arteriole is most commonly affected, increasing the glomerular filtration pressure and hyperfiltration. This state eventually progresses to albuminuria, one of the first clinical markers of altered renal function. Histologically, it characteristically demonstrates mesangium sclerosis and the formation of Kimmelstiel Wilson nodules.

**Nephritic Syndrome**

As with nephrotic syndrome, nephritic syndromes can also be primary or secondary. Some of the most common causes of nephritic syndrome are post-infectious glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, and lupus nephritis.

- Poststreptococcal nephritic syndrome arises 2 to 3 weeks after group A B-hemolytic nephritogenic streptococcal infection of the skin (impetigo) or pharynx. It usually occurs in children but can also occur in adults. No characteristic finding on H&E stain but granular IF pattern and subepithelial immune complex deposition (“humps”) on EM.

- IgA is the most common nephropathy worldwide. It is characterized by the IgA immune complex deposition in the mesangium of glomeruli. It commonly presents as hematuria following mucosal infections, especially gastroenteritis.

A special presentation of the nephritic syndrome is the Rapidly Progressive Nephritic Syndrome. In this clinical scenario, patients progress to renal failure in weeks to months. It presents with the characteristic crescents in the Bowman space on the H&E stain. Crescents are an extra capillary proliferation of macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells, as well as fibrin deposition due to a rupture of the glomerular membrane, indicating a severe injury to the glomerular capillary wall. The differential diagnosis is possible through histologic immunofluorescence patterns on renal biopsy. Immunofluorescence patterns help identify the etiology.

- Linear pattern: caused by anti-basement membrane antibodies, as is characteristic of Goodpasture syndrome.

- Granular pattern: caused by immune complex deposition. This pattern can occur in post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis or diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis.

- Negative immunofluorescence: in some diseases, such as Wegener granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome, the tissue is negative to immunofluorescence. This condition is known as pauci-immune glomerulonephritis, which is caused by antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).
