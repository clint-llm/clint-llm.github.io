Any child with clinical suspicion of primary congenital glaucoma presenting to the outpatient department must be evaluated meticulously by an ophthalmologist. The general ophthalmologist should start the child on antiglaucoma medications and must refer the child to a glaucoma specialist for confirmation of diagnosis and targeted treatment. The glaucoma specialist should decide for evaluation under anesthesia and surgical intervention of the child in the form of goniotomy or trabeculectomy.
