Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic that has been in use since 1964. Triamterene is used by physicians who treat patients with fluid retention states secondary to conditions such as congestive heart failure, nephrotic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis, secondary hyperaldosteronism, or even merely idiopathic edema; all of which are FDA approved indications.
