Isoniazid has been the most important drug used in TB treatment regimens since 1952. It is a prodrug activated by the catalase-peroxidase KatG, creating a variety of radicals and adducts that inhibit the mycobacterium's production of the mycolic acids that make up its cell wall. This activity lends INH to being a potent bactericidal agent. It also appears to be synergistic with other species produced by KatG and other medications used to treat TB.

However, mutations in the katG, inhA, kasA, and ahpC genes may cause resistance in isoniazid therapy. This resistance in M. tuberculosis develops faster when only monotherapy of isoniazid is used for the treatment.

**Pharmacokinetics**

- Absorption: Rapid and complete absorption occurs after oral or intramuscular administration.

- Time of peak plasma concentration: 1 to 2 hours

- Distribution: Rapidly into all body tissues compartments, including cerebrospinal fluid

- Plasma protein binding: 10% to 15%

- Metabolism: Metabolized primarily by acetylation and dehydrogenation in liver

- Excretion: A majority (75% to 95%) of unchanged drug and it's metabolites are excreted in the urine, while small amounts are excreted in feces and saliva.
