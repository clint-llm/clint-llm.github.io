Public education should focus on preventative measures that are possible to ensure people understand the risks of heat illness. Education should include the importance of maintaining an adequate level of cooling during the hottest of days and the importance of staying shaded. Utilizing the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) index, a composite index of temperature, humidity, and solar radiation, is an excellent assessment of the environmental risk of developing a heat-related illness.
