Martin-Gruber anastomosis occurs in 10% to 15% of all forearms (motor nerve connection between the median and ulnar nerves). In 50% of these cases, the nerve communication from the median nerve arises from the AIN branch. Therefore, palsy of the AIN could lead to palsy of the intrinsic muscles of the hand normally supplied by the ulnar nerve.
