An interprofessional team provides a holistic and integrated approach in the care of suction drain. The role of the nurse and family must be determined. If the patient is to be discharged with drain, educate the caretaker who can monitor and care of the drain. The major complication associated with drain is accidental slippage from the wound, and the patient has to be evaluated immediately. The fluid measurement and maintaining the record are essential to time the removal of the drain. The care of the drain insertion site has to be educated to all team members. Inexpensive and straightforward antiseptic intervention at the drain insertion site reduces bacterial colonization of drains.
