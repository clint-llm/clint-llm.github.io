The early identification of ischemic tissue, whether secondary to infection or peripheral vascular disease, is essential to the success of the treatment strategies listed above. A detailed history and physical, including ankle-brachial index in patients at risk for peripheral artery disease, can identify patients at risk before tissue loss develops.

For necrotizing soft tissue infections and gas gangrene, worsening mortality has been identified with the delay in surgical treatment more than 24 hours after admission, so the entire clinical team is essential in considering the diagnosis and pursuing evaluation and treatment once identified to reduce patient mortality risk.
