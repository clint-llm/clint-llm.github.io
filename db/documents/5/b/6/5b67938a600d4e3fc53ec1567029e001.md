The failure to induce menses despite stimulating the endometrium with an estrogen-progesterone challenge, in a patient with secondary amenorrhea, with normal hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian functions and hormone levels, points towards the diagnosis of Asherman's syndrome.

Although two-dimensional sonography may suggest adhesive disease, Asherman syndrome is more often evaluated initially with saline sonography or hysterosalpingography to demonstrate the adhesions. Still, the sensitivity for diagnosis remains only 75% for these modalities. Hysteroscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosing the extent of the disease and allows treatment to occur simultaneously. MRI is needed when there is a total obliteration of the uterine cavity.
