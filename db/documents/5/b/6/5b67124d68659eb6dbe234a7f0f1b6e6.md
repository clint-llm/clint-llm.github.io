A thorough history and physical is usually the only evaluation necessary in patients presenting with bodily fluid exposure. Management will depend on the type of exposure and the source of exposure. All percutaneous injuries should be assessed for foreign bodies. Some cases may require some form of radiographic imaging. Modality would be dependent on the location of the exposure and clinical suspicion of a foreign body. Labwork consisting of testing for HIV, hepatitis B virus surface antigen, and hepatitis C is standard at the time of injury as a baseline evaluation. Additional testing may be needed according to local hospital guidelines and the regional incidence of other blood-borne pathogens.
