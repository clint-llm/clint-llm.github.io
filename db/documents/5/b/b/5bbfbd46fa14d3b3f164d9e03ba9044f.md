Alexia itself has less association with increased morbidity in affected individuals; however, combined with other communication issues, it can significantly contribute to disability. Individuals suffering from strokes and subsequent neurocognitive dysfunction can become withdrawn, depressed, and feel secluded. Removing a form of communication such as interpretation of written language can add to depression and isolation. Patient education should be emphasized to the individual and surrounding family and caretakers. Education should be provided in multiple forms rather than the traditional written discharge instructions, which will be incomprehensible to the patient. Education should focus on how to interpret repeat stroke symptoms for patients, patient's families, and caretakers.
