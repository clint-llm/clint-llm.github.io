Using an operating microscope with an appropriately sized ear speculum or 0-degree endoscope, the ear canal and tympanic membrane are visualized. Cerumen and squamous epithelium are removed to facilitate visualization and access to the TM. A myringotomy knife is then used to make a radial incision in the anterior inferior portion of the TM approximately 2 mm in length. If a middle ear effusion is present, it can be aspirated using a 5F or 3F Fraiser tip suction.

Saline can be irrigated into the middle ear space to facilitate the removal of thick mucoid effusions. Using alligator forceps, the tympanostomy tube is placed through the myringotomy. This is positioned using a pick or right angle so that the middle ear mucosa is visualized through the tube. Any bleeding usually stops spontaneously but can also be controlled using oxymetazoline or 1Â to 1000 epinephrine applied topically to the area. Antibiotic drops are applied and continued several times a day for a few days after surgery to keep the tube(s) patent and reduce postoperative otorrhea risk.
