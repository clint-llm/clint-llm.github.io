SSRIs' mechanism of action is exerted by binding to the sodium-dependant serotonin transporter protein (SERT) located in the presynaptic neuron. SERT works by re-uptaking serotonin from the synaptic cleft to the presynaptic neuron. When SERT is inactivated by escitalopram, this increases the amount of serotonin in the synaptic cleft.

Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) modulates a wide range of human behavioral processes, which include mood, perception, memory, anger, aggression, fear, stress response, appetite, addiction, and sexuality. For these to happen, brain regions like cortical, limbic, midbrain, and hindbrain regions express multiple serotonin receptors.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Pharmacokinetics of escitalopram is linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/day. Absorption is not affected by the presence of food. The time to attain peak plasma concentration is approximately 5 hours. Steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved within 1-2 weeks.

**Distribution:**Escitalopram has a high volume of distribution(12 L/kg). Escitalopram has low plasma protein binding (56%) and is not likely to cause interactions with highly protein-bound drugs.

**Metabolism:**Escitalopram is metabolized in the liver by CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 to S-desmethylcitalopram(S-DCT) and S-di-desmethyl citalopram(S-DDCT).

**Excretion:**The terminal half-life of escitalopram varies from 27 to 33 hours. Escitalopram and its metabolites are exerted in the urine.
