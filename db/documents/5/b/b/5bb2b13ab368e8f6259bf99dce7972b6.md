Educating patients about what symptoms may be signs of TTTS, including contractions and a sudden increase in size, and advising them to quickly report them to their provider may help with earlier diagnosis of TTTS.

Once diagnosed, patient education and counseling regarding the prognosis based upon the stage, management, and treatment options available along with their respective risks and benefits, and expected progression of the condition should be provided.Â Additionally, there should also be a discussion about the possibility of long-term complications after birth, including neurological complications.
