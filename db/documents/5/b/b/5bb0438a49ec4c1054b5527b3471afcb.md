A papilloma is a benign (non-cancerous) tumor arising from an epithelial surface and usually known to grow in an outward direction. Commonly, a papilloma refers to squamous cell papillomas which appear as frond-like tumors that can develop almost anywhere on the body with squamous epithelium:

- Skin: as warts and cutaneous papillomas

- Lip

- Oral cavity

- Eyelid

- Tongue

- Pharynx

- Larynx

- Esophagus

- Cervix

- Genital tract: known as genital warts

Most of these lesions are caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV). They are contagious upon contact with the exception of cutaneous papilloma, which is also called an acrochordon or more commonly known as a skin tag. Most of these lesions are usually self-limiting in immunocompetent individuals.
