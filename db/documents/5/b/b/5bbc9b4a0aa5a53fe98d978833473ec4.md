- Dementia—Late-onset depression, when presented as cognitive deficits as the primary symptom, can be confused with dementia in the elderly. Detailed mental status examination and cognitive testing should take place before making the final diagnosis.

- Episodes of mania with mixed or irritable symptoms—symptoms of depression presented as irritability, anger outbursts can mimic a manic episode.

- Mood disorder due to another medical condition—depression should be diagnosed only when the symptoms are not a direct pathophysiological consequence of a specific medical condition, for example, multiple sclerosis, stroke, hypothyroidism.

- Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder—If the depressive disorder is secondary to substance/medication use, the symptoms fade away after stopping the suspected substance or medicine, and the effect wears off.

- Adjustment disorder with depressed mood— The full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met in adjustment disorder.

- Sadness— Intervals of sorrow are inherent traits of the human experience; this should not be interpreted as a major depressive episode unless it fulfills the depression criteria.
