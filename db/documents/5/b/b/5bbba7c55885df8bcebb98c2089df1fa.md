ECMO is useful for treating cardiac failure in adults who cannot wean from cardiac bypass or heart failure that cannot be treated with a ventricular assist device.

ECMO should be considered in case of life-threatening but potentially reversible respiratory failure.

Survival after Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): 67% weaned off ECMO, and 52% survival to hospital discharged has been reported by Hemmila et al. Similar findings were reported in the CESAR trial. H1N1 influenza ARDS reported 23.7% mortality on ECMO compared to 52.5% without ECMO.

Use of VA ECMO in cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, or failure to wean from cardiopulmonary bypass after cardiac surgery reported 20 to 30% survival. Shin et al. mentioned increased survival with minimum neurological impairment with ECMO support post-cardiac arrest compared to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Chen et al. also mentioned improved survival and minimal disability on discharge, 30 days, and 1-year survival.

In the case of progressive organ dysfunction such as liver dysfunction or neurological decline, some patients may deteriorate despite ECMO support. In such instances, discontinuation of ECMO and hospice arrangements are recommended.
