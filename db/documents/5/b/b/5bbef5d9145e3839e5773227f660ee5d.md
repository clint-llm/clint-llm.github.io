Because of the small cohort of single institutions in studying congenital heart disease, one approach is to regionalize databases and interventions. One example of regions beginning to address health disparities for high-risk groups includes the Southwest Congenital Cardiac Consortium, which is an interprofessional group formed to study processes of congenital cardiac care at each institution and positively change healthcare inequities specific to the southwest region of the United States.

Muscle training after Fontan was attempted in a study to see if it could improve exercise capacity over a 12-week period. There were some positive effects seen in the study, including a significant improvement in exercise capacity. The study was small, and more research needs to be done to see if post-operative rehabilitation can improve exercise capacity for Fontan patients.
