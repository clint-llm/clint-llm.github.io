Providers should have a high suspicion of viral meningitis when acute flaccid paralysis is present. Testing should include blood, CSF, respiratory, stool tests, EMG, and brain/spinal cord MRI to rule out other pathologies. Regarding Post-Polio Syndrome, there are no definitive biomarkers widely accepted; thus, diagnosis is made by exclusion. There is currently early research of potential biomarkers of PPS in the CSF using PCR.
