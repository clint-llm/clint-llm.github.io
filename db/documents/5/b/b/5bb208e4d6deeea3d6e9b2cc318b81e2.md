Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin that is derived from animal products such as red meat, dairy, and eggs. Intrinsic factor is a glycoprotein produced by parietal cells in the stomach and necessary for the absorption of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum. Once absorbed, vitamin B12 is used as a cofactor for enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), fatty acids, and myelin. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to hematologic and neurological symptoms. Vitamin B12 is stored in excess in the liver, decreasing the likelihood of deficiency. However, in cases in which vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed, for example, due to dietary insufficiency, malabsorption, or lack of intrinsic factor, hepatic stores are depleted, and deficiency ensues. This activity describes the evaluation and management of vitamin B12 deficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of vitamin B12 deficiency. 
- Review the risk factors for developing a vitamin B12 deficiency.
- Describe the typical presentation of a patient with vitamin B12 deficiency.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with vitamin B12 deficiency.
