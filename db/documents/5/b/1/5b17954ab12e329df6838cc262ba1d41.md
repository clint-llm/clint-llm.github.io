Screening, treatment, and prevention of fertility-altering environmental toxins requires action amongst women’s health providers and reproductive infertility specialists and their ancillary staff and requires cooperation and active management by local government, environmental agencies, and public policymakers. By enacting treatment and change in environmental exposures from the individual to government level, the effects of environmental toxins on infertility can be minimized and ideally even be entirely prevented.
