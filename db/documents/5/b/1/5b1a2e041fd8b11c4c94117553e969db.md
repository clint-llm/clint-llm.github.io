The axillary lymph nodes, like other components of the lymphatic system,Â develop from hemangioblastic stem cells. There is a close relationship between the lymphatic and vascular systems in early development.

Mesenchymal buds invaginate into these lymphatic sacs but do not penetrate the lymphatic endothelium lining the sacs. The mesenchymal buds are then covered by endothelial cells and enlarge. As a result, the initial lymphatic sac becomes the capsule of the mature lymph node, and the mesenchymal invagination becomes the hilus. The sac lumen also forms the sinuses inside the developing lymph node, while the mesenchymal tissue forms the lobules.
