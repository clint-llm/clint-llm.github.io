A comprehensive history of labor and birth is needed to identify newborns at risk of developing cephalohematoma. Factors that increase pressure on the fetal head and the risk of developing a cephalhematoma include:

- A prolonged second stage of labor

- Macrosomia, or increased size of the infant relative to the birth canal

- Weak or ineffective uterine contractions

- Abnormal fetal presentation

- Instrument-assisted delivery with forceps or vacuum extractor

- Multiple gestations

- Presentation with occiput in transverse or posterior position during delivery

- Cesarean section was initiated following the first stage of labor

Because of the slow nature of subperiosteal bleeding, cephalohematomas usually are not present at birth but instead become most noticeable within the first one to three days following birth. Therefore, repeated inspection and palpation of the newborn’s head is necessary to identify the presence of a cephalohematoma. Ongoing assessment to document the appearance of a cephalohematoma is important. Once a cephalohematoma is present, assessing and documenting changes in size is continued. Patients may initially present with a firm but increasingly fluctuant area of swelling over which the scalp moves easily.
