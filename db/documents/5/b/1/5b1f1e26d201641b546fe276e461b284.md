Hemorrhoids can receive treatment with both medical and/or surgical interventions depending on their degree of prolapse and whether they are external or internal. One of the first and foremost conservative recommendations is a high-fiber diet. Garg recommends the addition of 4 to 5 teaspoonful of fiber that corresponds with the addition of 20 to 25 gm of supplemental fiber a day. For this method to be effective and not cause abdominal cramping, an adequate amount of water (500 ml) needs to be consumed at the same time with the fiber supplement for the water to be absorbed and result in soft stools. This intervention has proven to stop progression and help decrease the size of prolapse.

Rubber band ligation and infrared coagulation are indicated for grade one and two hemorrhoids that fail medical management.

Operative hemorrhoidectomy is necessary for large third- and fourth-degree hemorrhoids in the following situations:

- Failed nonoperative management

- Advanced disease process unlikely to respond to conservative management

- Mixed hemorrhoids with a bulging external component

- Incarcerated internal hemorrhoids needing urgent intervention

- Coagulopathic patients requiring management of hemorrhoidal bleeding
