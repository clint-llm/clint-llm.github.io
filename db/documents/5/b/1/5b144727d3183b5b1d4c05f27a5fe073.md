A careful history is vital to confirm the diagnosis of eyelid coloboma. Since it is a congenital defect, the absence of eyelid tissue has to be present at birth. Traumatic damage toÂ the eyelid tissue must be ruled out. Colobomas of the eyelid are generally rare and associated with systemic and ocular abnormalities. A complete review of symptoms should be asked, and medical records should be reviewed.

The physical exam should include an examination for dermoids, lipo-dermoids, keratoconus, coloboma of the iris, and micro-ophthalmia. There will be a shortage of conjunctiva, tarsal plate, orbicularis oculi muscle, and skin seen in patients with eyelid colobomas. The eyelid defect leaves the cornea exposed, leading to exposure keratopathy and secondary bacterial infections, so the cornea should be examined for epithelial breakdown and corneal ulcers.

In any patient with an eyelid coloboma, a complete eye exam should be performed. This includes assessing visual acuity, a pupil exam, checking intraocular pressure, a dilated fundus examination, assessing for ocular misalignment, and cycloplegic refraction.
