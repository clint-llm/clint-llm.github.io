Amputations of the hand are a relatively rare but devastating injury. These injuries affect daily activities, including work, hobbies, and self-care. Furthermore, extremity amputations may have psychosocial implications on the patient. As with all amputations, those of the hand are classified according to the anatomic level at which they occur. The level of hand amputation has implications both for treatment and for the degree and course of functional recovery. The economic costs of amputation are difficult to accurately determine, particularly when considering the acute injury costs, long-term rehabilitative and prosthetic costs, and the economic impact that limb loss has at a societal level. The overall economic, physical, psychological, and societal impact of an amputation is high.
