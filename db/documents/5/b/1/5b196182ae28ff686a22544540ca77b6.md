Patients with abdominal pain and, generally, an ultrasound that shows gallstones often receive a referral to undergo a CCK-HIDA scan. The patients must understand that this test will determine the functionality of their gall bladder. An abnormal GBEF of <35% confirms that a diagnosis of biliary dyskinesia, or with a filling defect that an obstructed cystic duct is present and cholecystectomy may relieve their symptoms. It is a good prediction for the successful resolution of symptoms following cholecystectomy. This procedure is tolerated well by the patients.

As the radioactive tracer may take some days to exit from the bloodstream via urine or stool, the patients should increase the intake of water for a short period post-procedure.
