Often, patients will complain of feeling like something struck them on their calf. Accompanying this feeling is an audible snap or pop, sounding like breaking a twig. At the moment of injury, there may be no pain. After the patient takes a few steps, the pain develops on the posteromedial part of the calf. Intense pain may limit their ability to ambulate.

The physicalÂ examination will frequently demonstrate edema, ecchymosis, and tenderness over the muscle tear site and possibly extending to the knee and ankle. Practitioners should palpate the calf along the full length of the muscles. Gastrocnemius strains usually present with pain on palpation of the medial belly or the musculotendinous junction. In soleus strains, the tenderness is frequently more lateral.
