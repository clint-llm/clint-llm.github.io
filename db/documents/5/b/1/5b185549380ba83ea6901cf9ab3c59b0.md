Before transportation to a hospital, emergency medical services (EMS) or lay people may utilize an automated external defibrillator (AED). Once EMS arrives cardiac monitoring via ECG should occur.

Full cardiac assessment is required for cardiac arrest survivors. The following tests should be completed to establish a cause

- ECG

- Echocardiogram

- Coronary angiography

- Exercise test

- Electrophysiology testing

- Cardiac MRI

- Genetic testing if ARVC, Brugada syndrome, CPVT, or LQTS are found

- Cardiac biopsy may be considered if no other cause is found

ECG testing helps determine a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and inherited channelopathies. Echocardiograms evaluate for evidence of heart failure, cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, and congenital heart disease. Coronary angiography further evaluates coronary artery disease, congenital coronary anomalies, and coronary spasms. Exercise testing is helpful for diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, LQTS, and CPVT. Electrophysiology studies can detect the suspected arrhythmia. Procainamide can provoke Brugada syndrome regardless of the findings on the initial ECG. Cardiac MRI can detect ARVC, sarcoidosis (fibrotic cardiomyopathy), myocarditis, and myocardial injury from coronary spasms.
