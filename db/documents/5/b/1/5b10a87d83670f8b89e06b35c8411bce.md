The evaluation and cause of tachypnea are dependent on the patient's general disposition. Providers can evaluate based on oximetry, arterial blood gases, chest x-ray, chest CT, pulmonary function tests, glucose, electrolytes, hemoglobin, EKG, VQ scan, brain MRI and/or a toxicology screen.

Arterial blood gases give an estimate of oxygen and carbon dioxide content, which can help determine the pH and metabolic abnormalities. If the pH indicates acidosis, some potential causes are diabetic ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or hepatic encephalopathy.

A chest X-ray can depict any pulmonary causes of tachypnea, such as pneumothorax, cystic fibrosis, or pneumonia.

A complete blood count and complete metabolic panel can indicate any evidence for anemia or infections, which can potentially cause tachypnea. A toxicology screen can determine if any drugs, both prescription or non-prescribed, may be causing tachypnea.
