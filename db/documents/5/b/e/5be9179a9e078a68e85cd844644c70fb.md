Quantitation of Bence Jones proteins occurs through electrophoresis and densitometry. Laboratory analysis of urine can identify Bence Jones proteins at a threshold of 10 mg/L. However, it is important to note that detection limits for Bence Jones proteins can only be approximate. The presence of Bence Jones proteins in the urine is usually considered abnormal and should raise suspicion for multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disorders.

The serum free light chain (FLC) assay is quickly becoming the test of choice for detecting free light chains. This assay measures free kappa or lambda light chains. The reference range for the kappa to lambda light chain ratio is 0.26 to 1.65. An increase in the ratio denotes increased kappa light chains; a decreased ratio means an excess of lambda.
