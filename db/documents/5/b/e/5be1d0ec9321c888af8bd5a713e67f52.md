The pathophysiology of vibration perception and its pathways is related to the diseases affecting the dorsal column. Any factor which disrupts the neuronal transmission from vibratory sensors in the deep dermis to the somatosensory area in the cortex affects the vibratory sensations. The explanation of several of these mechanisms is in the clinical significance section below.
