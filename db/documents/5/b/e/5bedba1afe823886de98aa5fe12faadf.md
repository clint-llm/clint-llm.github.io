**Primitive Streak**

The initiation of the primitive streak is based upon a system of signaling pathways working to both positively and negatively regulate downstream expression. The combination of TGFB, Wnt, Nodal, and BMPs is important in primitive streak development.

Additionally, the induction of streak formation can be regulated by Wnt factors; not only has upregulated Wnt induced streak formation, but the use of Wnt antagonists such as Dkk-1 and Crescent prevents the formation of the streak.

**Endoderm**

Endoderm is the embryonic precursor to the thyroid, lungs, pancreas, liver, and intestines, which evolve from four consecutive steps developmental steps: proliferation and induction of pluripotent stem cells, the separation of stem cell-derived endoderm versus mesoderm germ layers, anterior-posterior patterning, and bifurcation of the liver and pancreas. Cells near the anterior portion of the primitive streak will express Forkhead box A2 (Foxa2) to become definitive endoderm (DE). The DE will pattern itself into the foregut, midgut, and hindgut via mesodermal induction during embryonic folding with foregut cells expressing Hhex, Sox2, and Foxa2 and the hindgut expressing different homeobox genes Cdx1, Cdx2, and Cdx4. The upregulation of TGFB signaling promotes pancreas formation with BMP and FGF/MAPK signaling to specify the liver.

**Mesoderm**

Epiblast cells invaginating through the primitive streak that express high levels of a fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) are fated down a path towards becoming mesodermal cells. More specifically, they will end up as paraxial, intermediate, or lateral plate mesoderm, which will correlate to different tissues as the embryo develops.

**Notochord**

Progenitor cells from the primitive node and primitive pit migrate to initiate notochord formation. Epiblast cells from the floor plate of the amniotic cavity fill in the notochord to form a thick rod-like structure down the midline of the embryo. Providing support and serving as an induction center for surrounding cells, the notochord in vertebrates extends throughout the entire length of what will be the vertebral column and reaches as far as the midbrain. The notochord develops first, then mesodermal cells grow medially to surround it. The notochord is only present in developing organisms with the primary goal of patterning the surrounding tissues. The notochord secretes Sonic Hedgehog, Chordin, and Noggin in a morphogenic gradient pattern where the highest concentration is near the notochord with diffusion outward. These bind to receptors on target cells to induce specification and differentiation events in the neural plate, somites, and ectoderm.

Mesoderm divides into three main categories: paraxial (or axial), intermediate, and lateral (or lateral plate) mesoderm, which are the embryonic precursors to a large variety of cells and tissues, including smooth, cardiac, and skeletal muscle, kidney, reproductive organs, the muscles of the tongue and the pharyngeal arches, connective tissue, bone, cartilage, the dermis and subcutaneous layers of the skin, dura mater, vascular endothelium, blood cells, microglia, and adrenal cortex.

Cells of the paraxial mesoderm cells first organize to form somitomeres. As the somitomeres develop into somites in a cranial-to-caudal fashion, the outer cells undergo a mesenchymal to epithelial transition, which serves as a distinct boundary between individual somites. Individual somites then separate into cranial and caudal portions, followed by the cranial portion of each fusing with the caudal portion of the somite directly anterior to it. Distinct regions of each somite (sclerotome, dermatome, myotome) become specific tissue and cell types as the body matures. The skull, vertebral column, and brain meninges develop from the mesoderm surrounding the neural tube and notochord.

The intermediate mesoderm connects the paraxial mesoderm with the lateral plate and differentiates into urogenital structures.

The lateral plate mesoderm splits into a parietal (or somatic) layer to aid lateral body fold wall formation and a visceral (or splanchnic) layer involved in gut tube formation.

**Ectoderm**

The interplay between BMPs and Hox genesÂ is integral to differentiating the remaining epiblast tissue into the ectoderm. This is especially important for the surface ectoderm and what will become the neuroectoderm, setting up the brain and spinal cord.

The notochord is the main inductive tissue delineating neuroectoderm from the remaining ectoderm that will become skin.
