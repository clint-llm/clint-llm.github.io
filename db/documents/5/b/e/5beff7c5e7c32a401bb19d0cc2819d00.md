**Hyoid Bone Insertion Tendinitis**

Hyoid bone insertion tendinitis is also known as hyoid bone syndrome. Patients describe it as neck pain that increases with swallowing and movement of the neck. The pain is characteristically either dull or sharp, radiating to the temporal area, posterior pharyngeal wall, sternocleidomastoid muscle, ear, and supraclavicular region. On examination, tenderness over the greater horn of the hyoid is noted upon palpation. The condition is diagnosed mainly by history and physical examination. Imaging may be used to exclude the other differential diagnoses. Medical therapy is the initial treatment of choice. It includes topical and systemic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, local anesthetics and steroid injections. If medical therapy fails, then surgery is the next consideration.

**Calcified Stylohyoid Ligament and Eagle Syndrome**

- It is important to discuss Eagle syndrome here in the context of calcification of the stylohyoid ligament that connects the lesser horn of the hyoid with the tip of the styloid process causing similar symptomatology. The literature reports cases of unilateral and bilateral calcification of the styloid ligament. There may be partial or complete calcification of the stylohyoid ligament. Incidental cases of the calcified stylohyoid ligament also present in otherwise asymptomatic subjects.

- There are two types of Eagle syndrome. The first type is the classic Eagle syndrome or the classic styloid syndrome, usually seen after tonsillectomy as pharyngodynia found in the tonsillar fossa, occasionally associated with odynophagia, dysphagia, foreign body sensation, hypersalivation, and seldom, temporary voice changes. All of these symptoms appear when the tightened tonsillectomy scar tissue moves along the tip of an elongated styloid process through functional movements.

- The second type is called the stylo-carotid syndrome and it develops following the compression of the internal and/or external carotid arteries and their perivascular sympathetic fibers, which leads to constant pain that radiates to the carotid region, such as chronic neck pain, headache, pain when moving the head and pain that radiates to the eye. Other symptoms include vertigo and ear pain. Therefore, patients with these symptoms may present to the ENT, dental, neurosurgery, or ophthalmology clinics with a variety of complaints.

- Differential diagnoses of this syndrome include temporomandibular joint diseases, temporal arteritis, glossopharyngeal, sphenopalatine or trigeminal neuralgias, mastoiditis, dental pain, hyoid bursitis, cluster-type headache, and migraine.

- Imaging is vital when it comes to the diagnosis of Eagle syndrome as an elongated styloid process is the most common presenting sign. The styloid process is considered elongated if its length is greater than 2 inches.

- Treatment options include medical and surgical. The medical treatment consists of antihistamines, neuroleptics, vasodilators, tranquilizers, antidepressants, steroids injections, and local anesthetics. Surgery is considered as a secondary treatment approach, as there are recurrences reported postoperatively.
