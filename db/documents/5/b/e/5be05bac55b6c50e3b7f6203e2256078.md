Congenital vertical talus is a condition of the foot in which there is plantar flexion of the talus and equinus of the calcaneum bone.

The valgus and equinus deformity in congenital vertical talus occur mainly due to the contracture of the subtalar joint capsule, tendon Achilles tendon, and involvement of primarily the posterolateral part of the ankle.

The dorsiflexion and abduction at the forefoot and midfoot occur due to the contracture of the peroneus tertius, extensor digitorum longus, tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus tendon, extensor hallucis brevis, and dorsal part of the talonavicular capsule.

All of this results in hypoplasia of the navicular bone, abnormal shape of the talus, and dorsolateral dislocation of the calcaneocuboid joint.
