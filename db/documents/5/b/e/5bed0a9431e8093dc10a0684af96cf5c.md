Synovial sarcoma is more common in children and young adults. Hence, it is prudent to involve the parents/ guardians in the discussion of the management of this rare yet aggressive malignancy. The diagnosis and treatment pose a particular challenge to the clinician of this tumor, which has proven resistant to multiple treatment regimens. Therefore, all patients and parents/ guardians must receive education on the importance of surgical resection and RT's role in managing SS.

In addition, the patient, parents, and guardians should understand the pros and cons of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy in managing SS. A decision regarding the treatment of SS must only be made only with the consensus of parents/guardians. Finally, If a clinical trial is available at the institution or nearby, the patients, parents, and guardiansÂ must be encouraged to explore that opportunity.
