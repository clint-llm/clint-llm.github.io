Common methods of administration are oral, intravenous, intranasal, and topical. Dosages for beta-1 agonists such as dobutamine can begin with 0.5 to 1 mcg/kg/min and go up to 40 mcg/kg/min on the maximum end. The doses at the lower end can also be prescribed at 2.5 mcg/kg/min to 5 mcg/kg/min. While doses at the higher end can be prescribed at 5 mcg/kg/min to 20 mcg/kg/min.

While other medications such as clonidine (alpha-2 agonists) may be prescribed as transdermal patches with dosages of 0.1 mg/day to 0.3 mg/day while changing the patch every week. Clonidine can also be prescribed via an immediate-release tablet at 0.1 mg/day to 0.3 mg/day and an extended-release tablet with a dosage of 0.1 mg/day.
