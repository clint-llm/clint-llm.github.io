**Hepatitis B and C**

Hepatitis B: The treatment of viral hepatitis B includes general management (bed rest and abstaining from alcohol). Hepatitis B is treated with drugs, such as adefovir dipivoxil and lamivudine.

Hepatitis C: The current treatment of choice for HCV infection (chronic) is a combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon alfa.

Human immunodeficiency virus infection: The treatment of choice for HIV infections is antiretroviral therapy (ART). For example, the use of one of the following combinations: abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine (Triumeq), or elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (Stribild).

HTLV-1–associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP): Use of corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, cyclophosphamide, and interferon temporarily alleviate signs and symptoms associated with HAM/TSP.

Malaria: Quinine is the drug of choice for malaria. A second agent in drug-resistant P. falciparum is doxycycline, tetracycline, clindamycin or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine.

Chagas disease: Benznidazole and nifurtimox are of benefit as drugs of choice for American trypanosomiasis.

West Nile virus infection: No specific antiviral treatments or vaccine is available for West Nile virus infection. Supportive therapy is given to severe cases.
