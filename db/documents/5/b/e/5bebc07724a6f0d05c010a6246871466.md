The causes of acromegaly can be divided into primary GH excess, ectopic or iatrogenic GH excess, and excess growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH).

Acromegaly is most commonly caused by a somatotroph GH-secreting adenoma of the anterior pituitary gland. The most commonly associated mutation involves activating the alpha subunit of the guanine nucleotide stimulatory protein gene.

Other causes of primary GH excess include pituitary adenomas that secrete multiple hormones and GH-cell carcinomas. Important familial syndromes associated with acromegaly include Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, familial acromegaly, McCune-Albright syndrome, and Carney complex.

GH excess can also be ectopic and produced by other tumors such as lymphoma and pancreatic-islet cell tumors. GH excess can also be iatrogenic, resulting from excessive GH administration.

Rarer causes of acromegaly are related to GHRH excess. These can be further divided into central and peripheral causes. Central causes include hypothalamic hamartomas, choristoma, and ganglioneuroma. Peripheral causes include secretion of GHRH by bronchial carcinoid tumors, small cell lung cancer, adrenal adenoma, and even production by some medullary thyroid cancer or pheochromocytoma has been described.
