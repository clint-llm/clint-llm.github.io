Pubic lice are estimated to involve 1Â to 2% of the population globally. The exact prevalence of phthiriasis palpebrarum is unknown. Certain studies estimate phthiriasis pubis to have a prevalence ranging from 2% to over 10%. However, because of frequently non-declared cases treated by first-line physicians, this prevalence is probably underestimated. In the Indian population cohort, the cases are underreported due to social barriers and stigmas. Phthiriasis palpebrarum is diagnosed chiefly in children. Approximately 30 % of cases are grouped under sexually transmitted diseases.
