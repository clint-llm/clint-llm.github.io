The hand contains an extensive network of collateral vessels so that oxygenated blood can reach all parts of the muscles in the hand and fingers. In the event that one of these vessels is injured, the connections that exist between arteries are capable of maintaining perfusion to the muscle. This network allows blood supply to reach areas of ischemia when injuries occur.
