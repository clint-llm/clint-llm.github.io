Toxicity with midazolam is rare but can happen when combined with other CNS depressants like alcohol, opioids, and other tricyclic antidepressants. The risk increases with intravenous administration and in elderly individuals with COPD. Symptoms of overdose include ataxia, nystagmus, hypotension, slurred speech, slurred speech, impaired motor coordination, coma, and death. Impaired reflexes, impaired balance and dizziness, dysarthria, and vasomotor collapse can also occur. Flumazenil is the antidote for midazolam toxicity.
