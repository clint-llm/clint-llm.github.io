Patients experiencing radiation proctitis may present with malabsorption, perforation, bowel obstruction, bleeding, and stricture formation. They can also present with fistulous disease. If the anal sphincter is directly involved in the radiation field, patients may present with fecal incontinence.

It is important to consider a recurrent malignancy in patients who present several years after their radiation therapy with symptoms of malabsorption, abdominal pain, increased frequency of bowel movements and bleeding, etc. While these symptoms may be due to radiation proctitis, they may also signify a local recurrence.

In terms of physical examination, a focused abdominal examination should be performed and, most importantly, a digital rectal exam to identify any anorectal stenosis. The examination can be painful and may not be able to be performed in the office setting, in which case an examination under anesthesia is indicated.
