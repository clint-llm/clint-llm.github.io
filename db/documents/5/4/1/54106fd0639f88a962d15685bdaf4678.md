The typical posture occurs due to the simultaneous mass contraction of agonist and antagonist muscle groups along with increased tone. There is an imbalance between facilitatory and inhibitory neurologic pathways innervating the muscle groups involved. It is possible that the secretion of inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as glycine and gamma-aminobutyric acid, plays a role. Consequently, there is uncontrolled activity of alfa and gamma motor neurons. The segmental reflex loop keeps active, perpetuating a sustained state of muscle contraction. In tetanus, the toxin blocks the presynaptic spinal inhibitory neurons.
