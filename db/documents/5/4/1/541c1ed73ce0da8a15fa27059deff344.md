Botulinum toxin injection is commonly performed to chemically denervate certain muscles of facial expression for the purposes of facial rejuvenation and anti-aging. Facial rhytids, or "wrinkles," result from repeated contracture of the muscle underlying the facial skin, which over time causes atrophy of the overlying dermis and pleating of the skin.

Botulinum toxin prevents acetylcholine release at the presynaptic nerve terminal, blocking neurotransmission. Effects usually take up to 2 days to appear, with maximal effect in 1 week to 1 month and last up to 3 to 4 months.

Botulinum toxin is created by fermentation of the bacteria Clostridium botulinum.

RimabotulinumtoxinB is notable for having the most rapid time to onset; however, it also has the greatest area of diffusion and shortest duration of effect. Its acidic pH (5.5-6.5) also increases the discomfort of an injection.
