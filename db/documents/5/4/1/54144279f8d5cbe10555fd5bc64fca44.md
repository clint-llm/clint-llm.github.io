The differential diagnosis for back pain is comprehensive when considering the pediatric population. Below is a review of the more common diagnoses along with history or physical exam features that may increase your index of suspicion. This list is not comprehensive but represents the more likely and more concerning conditions that make up the differential.

Adults:

- Lumbosacral muscle strains/sprains

- Presentation: follows traumatic incident or repetitive overuse, pain worse with movement, better with rest, restricted range of motion, tenderness to palpation of muscles

- Lumbar spondylosis

- Presentation: patient typically is greater than 40 years old, pain may be present or radiate from hips, pain with extension or rotation, the neurologic exam is usually normal

- Disk herniation

- Presentation: usually involves the L4 to S1 segments, may include paresthesia, sensory change, loss of strength or reflexes depending on severity and nerve root involved

- Spondylolysis, Spondylolisthesis

- Presentation: similar to pediatrics, spondylolisthesis may present back pain with radiation to the buttock and posterior thighs, neurologic deficits are usually in the L5 distribution

- Vertebral compression fracture

- Presentation: localized back pain worse with flexion, point tenderness on palpation, may be acute or occur insidiously over time, age, chronic steroid use, and osteoporosis are risk factors

- Spinal stenosis

- Presentation: back pain, which can be accompanied by sensory loss or weakness in legs relieved with rest (neurologic claudication), neuro exam can be within normal limits or can have progressive loss of sensation, as well as weakness

- Tumor

- Presentation: a history of metastatic cancer, unexplained weight loss, focal tenderness to palpation in the setting of risk factors
- Clinical note: 97% of spinal tumors are metastatic diseases; however, the provider should keep multiple myeloma in the differential

- Infection: vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, septic sacroiliitis, epidural abscess, paraspinal muscle abscess

- Presentation: Spinal procedure within the last 12 months, Intravenous drug use, Immunosuppression, prior lumbar spine surgery, fever, wound in the spinal region, localized pain, and tenderness
- Clinical note: Granulomatous disease may represent as high as one-third of cases in developing countries

- Fracture

- Presentation: Significant trauma (relative to age), Prolonged corticosteroid use, osteoporosis, and age greater than 70 years, Contusions, abrasions, tenderness to palpation over spinous processes

Pediatrics:

- Tumor

- Presentation: fever, malaise, weight loss, nighttime pain, recent onset scoliosis 
- Clinical note: Osteoid osteoma is the most common tumor that presents with back pain - classically, the pain is promptly relieved with anti-inflammatory drugs such as NSAIDs

- Infection: vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, septic sacroiliitis, epidural abscess, paraspinal muscle abscess

- Presentation: fever, malaise, weight loss, nighttime pain, recent onset scoliosis
- Clinical notes: Epidural abscess should be a consideration with the presence of fever, spinal pain, and neurologic deficits or radicular pain; discitis may present with a patient refusing to walk or crawl

- A herniated disk, slipped apophysis

- Presentation: Acute pain, radicular pain, positive straight leg raise test, pain with spinal forward flexion, recent onset scoliosis

- Spondylolysis, spondylolisthesis, lesion, or injury to the posterior arch

- Presentation: Acute pain, radicular pain, positive straight leg raise test, pain with spinal extension, tight hamstrings

- Vertebral fracture

- Presentation: acute pain, other injuries, traumatic mechanism of injury, neurologic loss

- Muscle strain

- Presentation: acute pain, muscle tenderness without radiation

- Scheuermann’s kyphosis

- Presentation: chronic pain, rigid kyphosis

- Inflammatory spondyloarthropathies

- Presentation: chronic pain, morning stiffness lasting greater than 30min, sacroiliac joint tenderness

- Psychological Disorder (conversion, somatization disorder)

- Presentation: normal evaluation but persistent subjective pain

- Idiopathic Scoliosis:

- Presentation: positive Adam’s test (for more significant angle curvature), most commonly asymptomatic
- Clinical note: Of note, no definitive evidence that scoliosis causes pain, but patients with scoliosis have more frequently reported pain; therefore the provider should rule out other causes before attributing pain to scoliosis
