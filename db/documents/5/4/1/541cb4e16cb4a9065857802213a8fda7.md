Treatment should be guided by an underlying condition predisposing to edema formation.

Diuretics are the treatment of choice for CHF, liver, and renal disease. Loop diuretics are usually the most effective, but several doses are required daily because of their short half-life. Patients with cirrhosis often have secondary hyperaldosteronism; therefore, spironolactone is the first choice of diuretic therapy along with furosemide.

Anticoagulation therapy is used in patients with DVT, either with low molecular weight heparin or newer anticoagulants like rivaroxaban or apixaban.

Mechanical therapies, including leg elevation and compression stockings, are effective in patients with chronic venous insufficiency. Compression therapy is contraindicated in peripheral arterial disease because it can compromise blood supply further. In lymphedema, treatment involves complex decongestive physiotherapy composed of manual lymphatic massage and multilayer bandages. Maintenance therapy includes compression stockings and pneumatic compression devices. In patients where medications are the offending agent, they should be discontinued and switched to a different class.
