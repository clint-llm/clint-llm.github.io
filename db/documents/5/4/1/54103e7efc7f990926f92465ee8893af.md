Liver biopsy is crucial for the diagnosis of glycogenic hepatopathy as there is no single serological test to diagnose glycogenic hepatopathy. Based on clinical features, other common causes of chronic hepatitis should be ruled out. Autoimmune serology testing may be done. Glycogen storage diseases result from the congenital absence of various enzymes and usually present in neonates and infants with hepatomegaly and hypoglycemia.

**Biochemical Features**

In more than 90% of the cases, hepatomegaly has been reported, with the varying elevation of transaminases and almost no alkaline phosphatase elevation. The synthetic functions of the liver are preserved. The elevated enzymes are thought to be due to cell membrane injury rather than necrosis.

**Imaging**

Ultrasound imaging shows hepatomegaly with uniform echogenicity, which can also occur in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It cannot differentiate NAFLD from glycogenic hepatopathy.

The computed tomography can help in differentiating fatty liver from glycogenic hepatopathy. The fatty liver is hypodense on the CT scan, whereas the glycogen loading of the liver appears hyperdense on the CT scan. The bright liver on computed tomography can be used as a clue to the diagnosis of glycogenic hepatopathy while taking into consideration other causes of increased hepatic attenuation like hemochromatosis.
