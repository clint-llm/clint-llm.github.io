Ultrasound is the first test of choice to confirm a rectus sheath hematoma diagnosis after basic blood work, and coagulation profile are obtained. The hematoma appears as hypoechoic space in the posterior rectus sheath. Further information like the size and exact location of the hematoma can be obtained from the ultrasound study. If the ultrasound study is inconclusive, a CT scan is the next test. It can show more details about the location, size, and extension of the hematoma. When intravenous contrast is administered with the CT scan, active bleeding can be detected by the presence of the contrast in the form of blush in the hematoma if the bleeding is active.

Unless a contrast is visualized in the hematoma, the differential diagnosis of a fluid collection in the rectus sheath should not be ignored. If the diagnosis of hematoma is still in doubt after imaging, needle aspiration can be performed to differentiate a hematoma from an abscess. However, with needle aspiration, there is a risk of puncture the bladder, bowel, or a hernia.

Evaluation of the hematoma should be part of the comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition. General assessment addressing the related factors and conditions causing the hematoma or as a complication of the hematoma is necessary for a proper evaluation
