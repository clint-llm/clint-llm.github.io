There is no cure for presbycusis. Hearing aids are the mainstay of treatment and have been shown to have a significantly positive effect on the quality of life and communication.

As extrinsic factors are thought to have a role in the progression of presbycusis, wearing earplugs or earmuffs to attenuate sounds may be helpful if the patient needs to be exposed to loud noises. A diet low in saturated fat may help slow hearing loss.

There is an abundance of ongoing research regarding the genetic and metabolic components of age-related hearing loss. Due to the potential role of oxidative damage, it was thought that antioxidants might slow the progression of hearing loss. While the administration of alpha-lipoic acid has been shown to prevent age-related hearing loss in rats, an antioxidant-enriched diet in humans did not delay the progression of hearing loss. Other agents, such as coenzyme Q-10 and ginkgo biloba, have been studied and lack sufficient evidence for use. Additionally, the use of these supplements is controversial as prolonged administration has been associated with an increase in overall mortality.****There are ongoing investigations into potential gene and hormone therapies for hearing loss.
