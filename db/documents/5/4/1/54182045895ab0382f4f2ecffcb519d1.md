Neonatal lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that takes place due to the passive maternal transfer of autoantibodies of Sjogren syndrome autoantigen type A (Ro/SSA) or B (La/SSB) to the fetus. Autoantibodies against antigen type A recognize 2 cellular proteins, Ro52/52kD (localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm) and Ro60/60kD (localized in the nucleus and nucleolus). Autoantibodies against antigen type B target a 47kD protein localized between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. So far there is no specific epitope responsible for neonatal lupus erythematosus, but some animal models have suggested a greater role of anti Ro52.
