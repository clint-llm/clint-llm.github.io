Elderly patients or those with osteoporosis or who are at risk of osteoporosis who present with mechanical ground-level falls or low impact trauma complaining of acute back pain should undergo CT to evaluate for compression fractures. Osteoporosis can be diagnosed with a vertebral body fracture alone and/or a DEXA scan with a value of less than -2.5. Imaging is the gold standard in assessing vertebral column fractures. Lateral radiographs of the spine can be diagnostic of both osteoporosis and vertebral column fractures. Measurements of the adjacent vertebral bodies can be taken and compared with the segment in question. CT is considered the best modality for evaluating spinal fractures. CT allows the clinician to evaluate the spine in three planes to properly grade the extent of pathology. CT can also be used to guide toward a DEXA scan.

In 1993, Vertebral Fracture Assessment Using a Semiquantitative Technique, by Genant et al., was published and evaluated osteoporotic fractures; this has wide acceptance and utilization. The scale looks at the shape of the vertebrae and measures the loss of height (LOH).  It starts at grade 0 for normal vertebrae, grade 1 for mild fracture of 20 to 25% LOH, grade 2 for moderate fracture 25 to 40% LOH, grade 3 for severe fracture showing LOH at greater than 40%

The classification schemes for all fractures of the entire spine are listed below for completion, as compression deformities can also occur in the setting of multiple traumatic fractures, as well as a component of a more severe injury.

The cervical spine divides into upper and lower sections. Upper cervical spine injuries are related to the occiput, atlas (C1), and axis (C2).  Subaxial cervical injuries are from C3-C7. Due to anatomical differences, the remainder of the spine can subdivide into thoracic levels, T1-T10, thoracolumbar junction T11-L1 (where more than half of these fractures occur), and the lumbar spine L2 to L5.

Occipital condyle fractures are usually the result of high-speed trauma.  Anderson and Montesano classify these injuries based on morphology and type of injury.

- Type I results from impaction via an axial force resulting in a comminuted fracture with an intact tectorial membrane and alar ligaments but is considered unstable when bilateral.

- Type II is basioccipital fractures that involve the occipital condyle and are usually stable.

- Type III is an avulsion fracture that results from forced rotation and lateral bending as the alar ligaments pull away from the bone. These are treatable with rigid orthosis or halo vest.

Atlanto-occipital injuries are from occiput to C2. Atlanto occipital dislocation (AOD) represents less than 1% of cervical spine injuries but is highly fatal due to anoxia due to respiratory arrest after bulbar cervical dissociation. This dislocation can classify into three types:

- Type I is an anterior dislocation of the occiput relative to the atlas.

- Type II is a distraction injury in a longitudinal axis.

- Type III is a posterior dislocation of the occiput relative to the atlas.

The basion-axial interval (BAI) measures from the inferior tip of the clivus to the superior extension of the posterior axial line, off the cortical margin of the body of C2. The basion dental interval (BDI) measures the distance from the basion to the closest point on the tip of the dens and should be less than 8.5 mm in adults and 10.5 mm in children. The Powers ratio can only be used to assess Type I dislocations. It is a measurement from the basion to the posterior arch of C1 divided by the measurement of the opision to the anterior arch of C1 and should be less than 1.

Atlantoaxial rotatory subluxation injuries are classified using the Fielding and Hawkins system that assesses the transverse atlantal ligament (TAL), facet injury, and anterior displacement (AD).

- In Type I, the TAL is intact. The facet injury is bilateral. The AD is less than or equal to 3 mm.  The patient may require a soft collar for support.

- In Type II, the TAL is injured. There is unilateral facet injury. The AD is 3.1 to 5 mm, and the patient will require a hard collar.

- In Type III, the TAL is injured. There is bilateral facet injury.  The AD is greater than 5 mm.

- Type IV has a posteriorly displaced odontoid.

Type III and IV subluxation injuries are unstable and require halo stabilization. Subluxation that cannot be reduced with a halo vest or gentle traction should receive surgical fixation and arthrodesis.

In the anterior atlantoaxial subluxation, there is transverse atlantal ligament injury with an increase in the atlanto-dental interval or odontoid process fracture with a normal ADI measurement.

- A Type I injury is a tear in the TAL and requires surgical stabilization.

- A Type II injury results from the C1 tubercle detaching from TAL and can heal with halo vest immobilization.

Atlas (C1) fractures account for nearly 7% of cervical spine fractures.

- Type I is a fracture that involves a single arch.

- Type II is a four-point burst fracture. This is a classic Jefferson fracture that has expanded its definition to include two and three-point fractures. The fracture stability gets determined by the status of the TAL and will require either cervical immobilization and or surgical stabilization.

- Type III is a lateral mass fracture of the atlas.

Axis (C2) fractures can vary, including hangman's fractures, odontoid fractures, and other parts. The hangman's fracture results from hyperextension and axial loading with resulting bilateral pars interarticularis fractures and can often be managed with cervical immobilization. The Levine classification of the hangman's fractures evaluates fracture line, angulation between endplates, and anterior subluxation.

- Type I is a vertical pars fracture with less than 3 mm of subluxation of C2 on C3 and no angulation.

- Type IA demonstrates non-parallel fracture lines with vertebral foramen extension, with C2 subluxed 2 to 3 mm anterior on C3, and a high incidence of paralysis.

- Type II includes the pars fractures with C2-C3 disc rupture, injury to PLL, subluxation of C2 on C3 greater than 3 mm, and can often be reduced with traction.

- Type IIA is an oblique fracture with subluxation less than 3 mm and angulation up to 15 mm treated with surgical arthrodesis without traction.

- Type III includes fractures through the pars with bilateral C2-C3 facet disruption, C2 free-floating posterior arch, C3 ALL disruption, and requires closed reduction without cervical traction.

If any fracture extends through the vertebral foramen, a CTA should be obtained to evaluate for vertebral artery injury.

Odontoid fractures are classified using the Anderson and D’Alonzo system.

- Type I is through the tip, likely the result of alar ligament avulsion and considered unstable.

- Type II is through the base of the neck and is unstable.

- Type IIA is through the base of the neck but with bone fragments and is unstable.

- Type III is through the body of C2 and is usually stable.

The Spine Trauma Study Group created the subaxial cervical spine injury classification and severity scale (SLICS) to evaluate fractures from C3-C7.  The SLICS scale evaluates morphology, discoligamentous complex, and neurological status. Morphology gives 1 point for compression fracture, 2 points for burst fracture, 3 points for distraction injury, 4 points for rotation/translation like teardrop fracture (flexion with axial loading), facet dislocation, or bilateral pedicle fractures. The discoligamentous complex includes the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL), posterior longitudinal ligament, ligamentum flavum, facet capsule, interspinous, and supraspinous ligaments. The DLC scoring is 1 point for indeterminate injury where there is an isolated widening of the spinous process and no facet malalignment. 2 points are given for disrupted as seen in perched or diastatic facets with widened anterior disc space. The neurological status is given 1 point for nerve root injury, 2 points for complete spinal cord injury and 3 points for incomplete spinal cord injury, and +1 for continuous cord compression with neurological deficit. This table was designed to indicate that adding up points for a score of greater than or equal to five is an indication for surgery.

Isolated injury to the spinous processes due to avulsion is called a clay shoveler’s fracture and can occur with whiplash, neck hyperflexion, or direct blow to the neck. These fractures are stable and do not require intervention.

In evaluating compression and burst fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine on sagittal CT, always measure the angulation, retropulsion of fragments, listhesis, and loss of height.  Look for any abnormal separation of spinous processes that may warrant an MRI to evaluate for ligamentous injury. Axial CT will allow clear visualization of pedicles and retropulsion of bony fragments into the canal. The thoracolumbar injury classification and severity (TLICS) scale provides for the classification of fractures and guidance for intervention.

TLICS scale evaluates bony images, neurologic status, and integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex. Evaluation of bony pathomorphology gives compression and burst fractures 1 point, distraction injuries 2 points, translational/rotational injury 3 points.  Neurological status with nerve root injury or complete spinal cord injury is 2 points each, and incomplete spinal cord or cauda equina injury is given 3 points each. The posterior ligamentous complex is given 2 points for suspicion of injury and 3 points for definitive injury. A score of 5 or higher is a strong argument for surgical stabilization of the patient. Certainly, any incomplete spinal cord injury should be taken to the OR within 24 hours for the best possible outcome. Patients should remain on thoracolumbar precautions until there is a determination of spine stability and a treatment plan is in place.

Minor fractures of the thoracic or lumbar spine are considered stable and do not require intervention when there is no neurological deficit include spinous processes, articular processes, isolated laminar fractures, and transverse processes (unless accompanied by brachial plexus or lumbosacral plexus injuries).

MRI will be utilized to verify disc and ligamentous injury. A CT myelogram is an option for patients unable to obtain an MRI.

Individuals who use IV drugs, who are immunocompromised, or have diabetes, who present with back or neck pain not attributed to trauma and who have labs demonstrating elevated CRP, WBC, and or ESR should be evaluated for an infectious etiology of osteomyelitis and discitis that could lead to spinal instability due to bony erosion. A CT will demonstrate the erosion of bony elements. An MRI will evaluate for abscess, disc, and soft tissue injury.
