Serum concentrations after a single oral or intravenous dose of chloramphenicol peak 1 to 2 hours after ingestion; chloramphenicol has excellent absorption in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Intramuscular chloramphenicol has variable absorption with serum concentrations reaching only 5% to 65% the concentration of the equivalent intravenous or oral dose. Roughly half of serum chloramphenicol is bound to albumin and other plasma proteins. Elimination happens primarily in the liver through O-glucuronidation, which puts neonates with immature hepatic metabolism at risk for the gray-baby syndrome. This syndrome has been seen in patients who were given doses greater than 200 mg daily. Urinary excretion of the parent chloramphenicol compound is approximately 20% in children and 10% to 12% in adults; the rest is excreted as the glucuronidated metabolite.
