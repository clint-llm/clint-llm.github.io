According to the United States Renal Data System, in 2015, there were 124,411 new ESRD diagnoses, reflecting an increasing burden of kidney failure. The prevalence of the disease has been rising at a stable number of about 20,000 cases per year.

**Race/Ethnicity**

The degree of kidney failure varies widely by race in the US. In 2015, the rate of ESRD was three times higher in African Americans compared to Whites (393.5 versus 139.9 per million population). That same year, the ESRD prevalence was about ten times higher in American Indians or Alaska Natives and twice as high in Native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders. Prevalence rates were 1.3 times higher in Asian Americans, as well. Of note, incidence rates in the African American population have decreased each year since 2006, leading to an overall decrease of 21%. This reduction has been even more pronounced in American Indians/Alaska Natives.

**Age**

The prevalence of CKD increases with age, with the most rapid growth in people aged 60 years or older. For example, the prevalence is 6.0% at ages 18Â to 44 years and 38.1% at ages more than 65 years.

**Sex**

The cumulative incidence of end-stage renal disease is higher in males than females.
