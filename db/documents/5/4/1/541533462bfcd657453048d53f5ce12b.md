- Alexander disease is a leukodystrophy. This term identifies a group of heritable diseases that predominantly affect the white matter of the CNS.

- It represents the only known example of a genetic disorder affecting astrocyte cells.

- This rare disease has multiple clinical forms spanning from newborn to adult. Typically, the early onset of the disease correlates with an increase in severity.

- Alexander disease usually occurs through a sporadic mutation of the GFAP gene (chromosome 17q21).

- The hallmark of Alexander disease is hyaline eosinophilic rods that aggregate in astrocytes. These intracytoplasmic inclusions are also known as Rosenthal fibers.

- Clinically, Alexander disease has been divided into four subtypes: neonatal, infantile, juvenile, and adult forms.

- The early onset of the disease correlates with an increase in severity.

- The diagnosis can be made based on clinical and imaging features.

- After the diagnosis is suspected, genetic testing is usually done for confirmation.

- The treatment of Alexander disease is supportive.

- Decreasing the expression of GFAP can represent a therapeutic perspective.
