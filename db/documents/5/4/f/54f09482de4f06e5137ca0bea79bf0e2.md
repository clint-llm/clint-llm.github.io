A stye is usually a self-limiting condition with resolution occurring spontaneously within a week. Both internal and external hordeola are treated similarly. To hasten recovery and prevent the spread of infection, warm compresses and erythromycin ophthalmic ointment applied twice a day are usually sufficient treatment. There is little evidence demonstrating a benefit from the use of topical antibiotics but erythromycin ointment use for 7 to 10 days has been recommended. Warm compresses should be applied for 15 minutes at least four times a day. Gentle massage of the nodule has also been suggested to assist in the expression of the obstructed material. Oral antibiotics are rarely indicated unless there are significant surrounding erythema and a concern for periorbital cellulitis. For very large hordeola in which incision and drainage are considered, referral to an ophthalmologist is appropriate. Reevaluation within 2 to 3 days is appropriate to assess response to treatment.

Conservative treatment is the mainstay of therapy for chalazia. Warm compresses and washing the affected eyelid with a gentle soap such as baby shampoo will usually be the only treatment required. Given that the etiology is inflammatory and not infectious, antibiotics are not necessary. For recurrent chalazion or those refractory to conservative treatment, corticosteroid injection into the lesion or incision and curettage may be needed. These procedures necessitate referral to an ophthalmologist. Patients with chalazia should be referred to an ophthalmologist for nonurgent evaluation.
