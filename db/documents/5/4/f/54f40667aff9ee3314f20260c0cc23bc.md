Adenoma malignum (which is a slight aberration adenocarcinoma of mucinous type, a well-differentiated multicystic form) and glandular malignant cervical lesions may mimic Nabothian cysts; however, the glandular malignant cervical lesions are usually located deep in the cervix. Also, endocervical adenocarcinoma should be a consideration, as it may present with a prominent cystic component.

Other differentials include leiomyomas, endometriosis, micro-glandular hyperplasia, squamous papilloma, and mesonephric duct remnants, all of which are benign tumors of the uterine cervix.
