Cow's milk allergy is a common diagnosis in infants and children. It characteristically presents as an allergic reaction to the protein found in cowâ€™s milk. Cow's milk allergy manifests as a variety of symptoms and signs which commonly develop in infants and can regress by the age of 6. It can be a source of parental and family stress due to a milk-free diet and can lead to a subsequent nutritional deficiency if not treated appropriately.
