Complications from a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt can be broadly categorized into immediate, procedure-related clinical complications and longer-term complications.

**Immediate Complications**

- Puncture related bleeds, including hemoperitoneum (may need percutaneous embolization or surgical intervention)

- Stent malposition/migration

- Early shunt thrombosis due to technical issues or bile duct injury

- Shunt-related encephalopathy (30% to 46%)

- Deterioration of hepatic function (may be treated with shunt narrowing or in severe cases closure of the shunt)

- Shunt stenosis (leading to secondary intervention with balloon dilation or re-stenting)

**Long-term Complications**

- Intimal hyperplasia within the TIPS (may lead to reduced flow and recurrence of portal hypertension in the patient)

- Similarly, complete TIPS thrombosis (may lead to recurrence of portal hypertension)

- Both treated by re-establishing TIPS patency with balloon dilation and re-stenting
