Methotrexate is a folate antagonist that works by inhibiting the dihydrofolate reductase enzyme in cells. Leucovorin is a folate derivative that does not need to undergo reduction by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase for utilization in various one-carbon transfer reactions in the body, such as DNA synthesis.

In contrast, leucovorin can also enhance the therapeutic effect and toxicity of 5 fluoropyrimidines, such as 5-fluorouracil, by increasing the binding of the drug to thymidylate synthase.

The onset of action is less than 5 minutes for intravenous dosing and 10 to 20 minutes and 20 to 30 minutes for intramuscular and oral administration, respectively. Leucovorin rapidly absorbs after oral administration; however, the absorption remains saturated in the gut for doses of more than 25 mg.

Leucovorin is excreted by the kidneys mainly as 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate and 5,10-methenyl tetrahydrofolate.
