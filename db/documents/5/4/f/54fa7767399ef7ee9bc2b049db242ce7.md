Trauma is the fifth leading cause of death in the elderly population and accounts for up to 25% of all trauma admissions nationally.  Special considerations include multiple comorbidities, polypharmacy, decreased functional reserve, and increased morbidity and mortality, compared to younger adults.

As the world population continues to age, geriatric traumas will continue to increase.  Mortality increases after age 70 when adjusting for injury severity score.  Pre-hospital geriatric trauma triage criteria improve identification of those needing trauma center care.
