Choi et al. reported that of 19 patients with rotational vertebral artery syndrome managed conservatively, no patient developed a posterior circulation stroke over 37.5 months of follow-up. Furthermore,Â four patients had resolution of symptoms during the follow-up period.

Conversely, a review by Rastogi et al. reported only a 37% favorable outcome incidence for patients managed conservatively.
