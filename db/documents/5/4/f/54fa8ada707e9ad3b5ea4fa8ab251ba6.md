**Cause******

Muscular dystrophy most often results from defective or absent glycoproteins in the muscle membrane.

Modes of Inheritance
********

- **Autosomal Dominant, Autosomal Recessive, X-Linked:**Emery-Dreifuss (EDMD)

- **Autosomal Dominant, Autosomal Recessive:**Limb-Girdle (Dysferlinopathy, Erb), Pelvifemoral, Scapulohumeral

- **Autosomal Dominant:** Facioscapulohumeral (Landouzy-Dejerine), Late-Onset Distal (>40 Years old), Myotonic, Oculopharyngeal, Scapuloperoneal

- **Autosomal Recessive: **Congenital, Early Onset Distal (<40 years old)

- **X-Linked:** Becker (Benign Pseudohypertrophic), Duchenne (pseudohypertrophic)

**Autosomal Dominant, Autosomal Recessive, X-Linked Inheritance**

- Emery-Dreifuss (EDMD)

**Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy: **Caused by an X-linked recessive defect in nuclear protein emerin at the Xq27-28 position.

**Autosomal Dominant, Autosomal Recessive Inheritance**

- Limb-Girdle (Erb)

- 
Pelvifemoral *

- 
Scapulohumeral *

**Limb-Girdle (Erb) Muscular Dystrophy: **The majority are autosomal recessive but can be autosomal dominant.

LGMB 1B results from by lamin A/C gene deletion.

**Autosomal Dominant Inheritance**

- Facioscapulohumeral (Landouzy-Dejerine)

- 
Late-Onset Distal (>40 Years old) *

- Myotonic

- Oculopharyngeal

- 
Scapuloperoneal *

**Facioscapulohumeral (FSHD) Muscular Dystrophy: **Caused by an autosomal dominant deletion of 3.3 kb repeat on chromosome 4.

**Myotonic Muscular Dystrophy: **Myotonic muscular dystrophy (or simply Myotonic dystrophy) results from the impaired expression of the Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase (DMPK).

Clinical severity increases as the number of nucleotide repeats increases; some cases can be in the thousands.

**Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy: **Age of onset is approximately 30 to 40 years of age. Distribution of involved muscles includes the extraocular and pharyngeal muscles. Caused by an autosomal dominant GCG trinucleotide repeat resulting in deficient mRNA transfer from the nucleus.

**Autosomal****Recessive Inheritance**

- Congenital

- 
Early Onset Distal (<40 years old) *

**Congenital Muscular Dystrophy: **Caused by a mutation of the sarcolemmal protein Merosin gene, deficiencies or mutations in laminin-alpha 2, collagen type VI, integrin-alpha 7, and glycosyltransferases.

**X-Linked Inheritance**

- Becker (benign pseudohypertrophic)

- Duchenne (pseudohypertrophic)

**Becker Muscular Dystrophy: **Caused by a mutation of muscle protein dystrophin gene, which codes for the protein dystrophin, with 79 exons, by far the largest gene known in humans.

**Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: **Caused by a mutation of the dystrophin gene, located on the small arm (p) of the X chromosome at the Xp21 position.

Female Duchenne muscular dystrophy results from an error in female somatic cells whereby one X-chromosome becomes inactivated at an early stage, creating a mosaic representation of heterozygous X-linked genes. This condition generally is sufficient to protect female heterozygotes from X-linked disorders that affect males. However, X-inactivation in the female carrier of an X-autosome translocation can sometimes create a lethal genetic imbalance in half of the body's cells, causing those cells to die. The result is that the same X-chromosome expresses in every cell, and if that chromosome carries a disease allele, the individual can express the X-linked disease like a male, which explains some female cases of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
