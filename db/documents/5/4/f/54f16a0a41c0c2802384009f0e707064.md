cGMP mediates many physiologic processes and cell types in the cardiovascular system. Dysfunctional signaling at any step of the cascade, including cGMP synthesis, effector activation, or cGMP breakdown, have been present in many cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis as well as cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

Guanylyl cyclase plays an important role in cardiac muscle relaxation. ANP and BNP are produced and released by cardiac muscle when there is an increase in myocardial wall stretch and/or pressure, an increase in catecholamines, arginine vasopressin, angiotensin 2, endothelin, and glucocorticoids. ANP and BNP are natriuretic peptides and both bind to membrane-associated guanylyl cyclase receptors (also called NPRs). Of the seven mammalian membrane-associated guanylyl cyclases, the NPR A and NPR B participate in natriuretic peptide pathways.  ANP and BNP activate NPR A to regulate body volume homeostasis, blood pressure, and local anti-hypertrophic effects in the myocardium.

Guanylyl cyclase plays a prominent role in the process of erection as well. During sexual arousal, nerve terminals and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. NO activates guanylate cyclase, which then converts guanosine triphosphate (GTP) into cyclic guanosine triphosphate (cGTP), triggering a cGMP dependent cascade of events. Smooth muscle relaxation then occurs when cGMP accumulates in the corpus cavernosum to increase blood flow to the penis.
