Von Willebrand factor is a multimer formed from a basic dimer subunit. It is produced in megakaryocytes and endothelial cells. The size of the multimer determines the physiological hemostatic effect. Bigger multimers are more active and even prothrombic. They are cleaved by circulating proteases into smaller units. These larger multimers are stored in cytoplasmic granules and released in response to a trigger such as thrombin, fibrin, and histamine.

Larger multimers have more available sites for binding to platelets and endothelium. Von Willebrand factor increases factor VIII half-life by preventing its degradation. Regarding the subtypes, type I is characterized by a mild decrease in von Willebrand factor antigen (Ag), von Willebrand factor activity, and VIII:C.

Of note, von Willebrand factor levels of less than 30% are required for a diagnosis of Von Willebrand disease. Conversely, type III  is characterized by a significant decrease in the parameters above.

- A qualitative decrease with specific variations characterizes type II disease:

- Type 2A: variable decrease in von Willebrand factor Ag and VIII:C with a significant decrease in von Willebrand factor activity and absence of large and intermediate size multimers.

- Type 2B: variable decrease in von Willebrand factor Ag and VIII:C and a significant decrease in von Willebrand factor activity and absence of large multimers. However, most importantly, this type is hypersensitive to ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA).

- Type M: vWF activity is decreased relative to Ag and multimers are present.

- Type N: this is characterized variably by a decrease in vWF Ag and activity but is distinguished from the other types by the significant decrease in VIII: C, albeit usually more than 5%. This specific subtype can be confused with hemophilia A.
