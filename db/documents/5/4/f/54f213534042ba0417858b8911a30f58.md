Morbidity from vision loss in NTG can be significant and can lead to difficulty with activities of daily living (ADL). Tasks that involve visual searching are commonly affected, and fall risk increases.

Conjunctival hyperemia and ocular surface symptoms are the most common side effects seen with all classes of topical IOP lowering medications. Side effects of prostaglandin analogs include hypertrichosis and changes in iris pigmentation. Prostaglandin-associated periorbitopathy is an important complication of long-term prostaglandin analog use. This includes orbital fat atrophy, ptosis, chronic inflammation of the eyelids, and skin discoloration. It is seen most commonly with bimatoprost.

Complications from SLT are rare but may include intraocular inflammation or an IOP spike after treatment.

Glaucoma surgery complications include failure, hypotony, cataract, blebitis, tube erosion, endophthalmitis, and corneal decompensation.
