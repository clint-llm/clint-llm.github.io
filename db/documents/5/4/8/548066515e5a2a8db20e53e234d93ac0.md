Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus, in line with the epidemiology of SLE, affects more females than males, usually of African descent in the second to the fourth decade of life. Nevertheless, it can be seen in all races, ages, or males. The reported incidence is limited but estimated at ~2% of all subepidermal autoimmune bullous cutaneous conditions.
