Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is largely unrecognized due to its nonspecific clinical presentation likeÂ GI upset, blood in the stool, melena, iron deficiency, decreased appetite, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue. However, proper family history and early screening of such patients help diagnose and manage, which is a multidisciplinary approach.

The gastroenterologist and GI surgeons are almost always involved in the care of patients with HNPCC; it is always necessary and of great help to consult with a multidisciplinary team of specialists that include an oncologist, gynecologist, and a dermatologist if necessary. The nurses play a vital role in the group as they participate actively in diagnosis, management, and patient education. The Pharmacists are also involved during the preoperative and postoperative management of the patients with various kinds of drugs, including antibiotics, antiemetics, analgesics, and chemotherapeutic agents. The radiologist also plays a vital role in the diagnosis of HNPCC.

The outcomes of HNPCC depend on early detection and intervention. However, to improve outcomes, prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended.
