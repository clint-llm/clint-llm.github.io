Intestinal ischemia occurs when at least a 75% reduction in intestinal blood flow for more than 12 hours.

**Mesenteric Ischemia**

Generally, mesenteric ischemia (MI) can be divided based on the timing of onset into acute and chronic.

1-Mesenteric arterial embolism-Usually, mesenteric arterial embolism is seen in patients with cardiovascular disease. The common cardiac causes are including myocardial infarction, mitral stenosis, cardiac arrhythmias, ventricular aneurysm, and valvular endocarditis. Vascular causes can happen anywhere from the heart to the origin of SMA, which include mycotic aneurysm, atheromatous plaques in the aorta, or vascular aortic prosthetic grafts.

2-Intestinal hypoperfusion or nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) usually involved who presents with a systemic shock, which can be due to cardiac, infection, or hypovolemia.

3-Mesenteric arterial thrombosis-The risk of mesenteric arterial thrombosis is increased in patients with advanced age, peripheral artery disease, traumatic injury, and low cardiac output states.

4-Mesenteric venous thrombosis can happen in patients with acquired and inherited hyper coagulopathy conditions.

**Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia**

In chronic mesenteric ischemia, the diffuse atherosclerotic disease is an account for 95% of cases. Female with age greater than 60,
