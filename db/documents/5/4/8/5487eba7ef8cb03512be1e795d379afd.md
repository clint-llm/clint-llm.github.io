Clopidogrel is a widely used drug by cardiologists, emergency department physicians, family practice clinicians,Â and internists. While the drug is useful for the treatment of ischemic heart disease, its use must be monitored, which is best accomplished with an interprofessional healthcare team. Because the drug has the potential to cause bleeding, the patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit must have regular monitoring.
