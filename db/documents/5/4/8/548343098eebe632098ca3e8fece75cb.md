# Continuing Education Activity

Most newborns with primary ciliary dysfunction (PCD), formerly known as immotile cilia syndrome, develop neonatal respiratory distress with atelectasis visible on chest radiographs. Unlike other causes of respiratory distress in newborns, which occur in the first few hours after birth, the respiratory distress associated with primary ciliary dysfunction patients occurs 12 to 24 hours after delivery in term infants. The four main clinical features described in primary ciliary dysfunction are unexplained neonatal respiratory distress in term infants, early-onset year-round wet cough, early-onset year-round nasal congestion, and laterality defects. If three or more of these features are met, the specificity for primary ciliary dysfunction diagnosis is more than 96%. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with primary ciliary dysfunction.

**Objectives:**
- Review presenting features of primary ciliary dysfunction.
- Explain how to evaluate primary ciliary dysfunction.
- Summarize how to diagnose primary ciliary dysfunction.
- Outline the need for a well-integrated interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with primary ciliary dysfunction.

# Introduction

Primary ciliary dysfunction (PCD), first described in 1976, is a disorder of the structure and function of motile cilia that results in chronic oto-sinopulmonary disease.

This abnormal function impairs the ability of cilia to function in a coordinated manner, impairing mucociliary clearance and causing chronic upper and lower respiratory inflammation.

# Etiology

Primary ciliary dysfunction is a genetic disorder that results in abnormal ciliary ultrastructure and/or function. There are currently 40 known genes associated with primary ciliary dysfunction, with the majority following autosomal recessive inheritance. DNAI1 and DNAH5, which encode components of the outer dynein arm complex in cilia, are the two most common genes associated with PCD.

# Epidemiology

The reported prevalence of primary ciliary dysfunction is estimated to be between 1:10,000 to 1:20,000 newborns.

In the United States, the prevalence of PCD is around 1:16,000 live births. These numbers may be affected by geographic area and consanguinity. Based on the autosomal recessive type of inheritance, the chance of having children with PCD is 1:4.

No age, sex, or racial predilection has been noted.

# Pathophysiology

Cilia exist on epithelial cells lining the nasopharynx, lower respiratory tract, paranasal sinuses, middle ear, and reproductive tract.

Given the wide range of possible mutations, there is significant variation in clinical presentations.

The sperm tail and fimbriae of fallopian tubes also have motile cilia. Therefore, male and female infertility often occurs. Situs abnormalities occur in about 50% of cases of PCD. Normal ciliary movement is needed for visceral rotation. In the absence of normal ciliary function during embryogenesis, abnormal orientation can result. Kartagener syndrome is a triad of chronic sinusitis, bronchiectasis, and situs inversus resulting from ciliary dysfunction.

# History and Physical

Clinical presentations of ciliary dysfunction are highly variable. Most newborns with primary ciliary dyskinesia develop neonatal respiratory distress with atelectasis on chest radiographs. Unlike other causes of respiratory distress in newborns, which occur in the first few hours after birth, respiratory distress from primary ciliary dyskinesia occurs 12 to 24 hours after birth in full-term infants.

Four main clinical features have been described in primary ciliary dyskinesia, including unexplained neonatal respiratory distress, early-onset year-round wet cough, early-onset year-round nasal congestion, and laterality defects.

Patients typically present in childhood, with a median age of diagnosis around five years of age. Typically, they present due to year-round respiratory infections with mucopurulent sputum and chronic daily cough.

About half of the patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia also have situs inversus totalis, including transposition of the right and left lung.

Physical examination may reveal the following signs:

- Inflammation of tympanic membranes

- Perforation with hearing loss

- Right-sided apex beat and heart sounds, if associated with dextrocardia

- Evidence of situs inversus, such as the spleen and liver on the incorrect side

- Digital clubbing due to chronic and recurrent lower respiratory infections

# Evaluation

Diagnosing primary ciliary dyskinesia is challenging as it results from various defects in cilia, and no single diagnostic test can detect all these defects (Figure).

In patients older than five, nasal nitric oxide measurements can be used as a screening or diagnostic tool for diagnosing primary ciliary dyskinesia.

Per guidelines outlined in the European Respiratory Society, high-speed videomicroscopy analysis (HSVA) for the evaluation of ciliary motility is extremely sensitive (100% sensitivity) and specific (93% specificity) and should be conducted as well.

Advances in electron microscopy have enabled a deeper understanding of the structural consequences of genetic variations.

Additionally, in all the above testing methods, false positives can occur due to secondary loss of function of cilia. This can occur, for example, if the sample was taken during an acute viral illness that caused transient loss of function. To minimize the impact of this, cell culture can be used.

# Treatment / Management

Similar to diagnosis, there is no current 'gold standard' treatment or management of primary ciliary dysfunction. Given that no curative therapy exists, treatment primarily relies on symptom management and varies based on the clinical presentation. Most current treatment options are largely extrapolated from other diseases that cause bronchiectasis, such as cystic fibrosis.

Unlike cystic fibrosis, the lung clearance index does not seem to be a helpful monitoring tool for patients with PCD. Additionally, children with primary ciliary dysfunction should be evaluated by an ear-nose-throat specialist one to two times per year and as needed in adults. An audiology assessment should be performed since there is a high incidence of recurrent otitis media with chronic middle ear effusions and associated complications of conductive hearing loss.

While there are many similarities between the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) and PCD, it has been found that certain mucolytic agents, such as DNase, while effective in CF, are not effective for PCD. When prevention fails and acute exacerbations occur, antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment and should be started even when symptoms appear mild. Obtaining regular sputum samples helps guide antibiotic choice for empiric coverage during an acute exacerbation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa should always be considered, and patients may require IV antibiotics for such infections. For recurrent exacerbations, prevention with chronic antibiotic suppression, such as azithromycin, can effectively reduce the number of infections.

A bilateral lung transplant may be necessary for patients with end-stage respiratory disease.

# Differential Diagnosis

Some important differential diagnoses are to be considered with the pretext of primary ciliary dysfunction.

- Cystic fibrosis

- Foreign body aspiration

- Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia

- Idiopathic nasal polyposis

- Immunosuppression

- Malignancy

- Post-infectious bronchiectasis

- Severe atopy

- Tracheobronchomegaly

# Prognosis

While many similarities exist in the clinical presentation and management between patients with cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dysfunction, one notable difference is that the rate of decline of lung function is typically much slower in PCD than in cystic fibrosis.

# Complications

Frequent bronchiectasis exacerbations with recurrent infections are a complication for patients with primary ciliary dysfunction. Other complications include recurrent ear infections, chronic sinusitis, and infertility.

# Consultations

Patients diagnosed with primary ciliary dysfunction should be followed by a pulmonologist for routine PFTS and airway clearance management. Additionally, patients should be evaluated at least initially by ENT providers if suffering from chronic sinusitis and recurrent otitis media. Genetic consultation can be helpful for patients seeking additional information. Lastly, fertility consultation may be required for adults with PCD requesting information on family planning.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients should be educated on routine vaccinations and smoking cessation to limit potential complications. Parental genetic counseling should be offered in the cases of newly diagnosed infants and children. The significance of regular health monitoring must be emphasized. Counsel patients to avoid allergens, exposure to respiratory pathogens, and environmental irritants.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Primary ciliary dysfunction is managed by an interprofessional team of healthcare workers, including clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, and respiratory therapists. Primary ciliary dysfunction patients should be managed in centers specializing in primary and chronic pulmonary diseases. Patients should be evaluated by a pulmonologist two to four times per year. Spirometry and surveillance cultures of sputum should be done during these visits. Additionally, children with primary ciliary dysfunction should be evaluated by an ear-nose-throat specialist one to two times per year and as needed in adults. An audiology assessment should be performed since there is a high incidence of recurrent otitis media with chronic middle ear effusions and associated complications of conductive hearing loss. The primary care provider and nurse practitioner should monitor for chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps. These patients should receive daily chest physiotherapy, influenza vaccination, and pneumococcal vaccination, as indicated. Antibiotics should be prescribed for acute respiratory exacerbations.
