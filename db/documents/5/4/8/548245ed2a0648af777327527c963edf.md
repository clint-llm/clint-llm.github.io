Polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disorder that affects many organs, and hence an interprofessional approach to management is necessary. A nephrologist, surgeon, invasive radiologist, neurosurgeon, cardiologist, and a nephrology or dialysis nurse are key professionals required to manage these patients. The pharmacist needs to educate the patient on blood pressure control and undergo regular blood testing to assess renal function. Patients need to be educated about the complications that may include cerebral aneurysms, kidney stones, and end-stage renal disease.

The PRO-PKD score has been developed to predict the prognosis of ADPKD. As uncontrolled hypertension accelerates the decline in renal function, it is essential to control the blood pressure properly. Pain control and early treatment of cyst infection or urinary tract infection can improve the quality of life in ADPKD patients. The education of patients about the condition can reduce the number of hospitalizations.
