The exact frequencies of Jarisch Herxheimer reaction (JHR)according to age, sex, and other variables are not well studied. However, the disease frequency in the general population as a whole is adequately discussed. The occurrence of JHR in syphilis is as follows: seronegative primary syphilis (55%), seropositive primary syphilis (95%), and secondary syphilis (95%). It is usually not seen in latent syphilis. It is also very rare in late syphilis, with the exception of patients suffering from general paresis of insane (GPI), also called paralytic dementia, where it can occur in 75% of patients. In Lyme disease, the range of JHR frequency is 7 to 30%, a much lower frequency than syphilis. In leptospirosis patients treated with an antibiotic, the incidence of JHR is around 9%. In patients with tick-borne relapsing fever, the frequency of JHR occurrence is 39% compared to louse-borne relapsing fever in which the occurrence is in a range of 37 to 100% depending upon different antibiotics used.
