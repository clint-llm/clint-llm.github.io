Historically the diagnosis of HIV-2 has been challenged several issues, including HIV antibody differentiation and the detection of plasma HIV-2 RNA levels. Before the widespread availability of the 4th generation HIV-1/2 antigen-antibody tests, clinicians had to rely on clinical suspicion to determine when HIV-2 specific testing was appropriate. Such scenarios included declining CD4 counts in an HIV-1 patient on appropriate therapy, untreated HIV-positive patients with an undetectable viral load, or those with opportunistic infection from West Africa. Previous immunoassays effectively detected both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies but did not differentiate between them. Confirmatory western blots were used, but cross-reactivity between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies often resulted in indeterminate results or misdiagnosis as HIV-1.

Many of these limitations have been mitigated by the widespread use of the 4th generation HIV-1/2 antigen-antibody testing, which includes a differentiation assay. Consequently, in 2014 the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) revised its HIV testing algorithm to improve the diagnosis of HIV-2 by including the differentiation assay results.

The testing algorithm was revised in 2018 and should be used by all clinicians when interpreting diagnostic testing results for HIV.
