The evidence available on the effectiveness of glucosamine sulfate as a beneficial therapy in the management of osteoarthritis is, to date, inconclusive. Interestingly, studies have shown that patients are not deterred from supplement use when presented with data concluding lack of efficacy, with the only evidence of significant toxicity showing to be capable of causing changes in supplement consumption. Physicians should be mindful of this when discussing the benefits and risks of various treatment modalities with OA patients, particularly those of no validated benefit. The physician must personalize the risk and benefits of taking glucosamine sulfate to each patient. Typically, a 60-day trial of glucosamine sulfate will determine if there are beneficial effects, after which it should be discontinued if the patient has not observed any beneficial effect by that time.

As patients search online for alternatives to medication,Â clinicians must stay educated on various supplements a patient may seek out for their condition. Communication between all interprofessional healthcare team members, including pharmacists, is crucial in these situations. A pharmacist will know how different drugs and supplements could interact with a patient's current medications. Through collaborative effort and open communication between clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists, patients can integrate glucosamine supplements into their OA treatment regimen more safely and avoid adverse effects.
