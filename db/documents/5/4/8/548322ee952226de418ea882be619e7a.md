Prompt and accurate diagnosis of medial epicondyle apophysitis requires a thorough history and physical of young athletes presenting with medial elbow pain. Important historical clues include an age range between 6Â to 15 years old with a history of a sporting activity requiring repetitive overhead motions. If the patient regularly plays a sport, providers should inquire about the position played, frequency and duration of athletic activity, and type of overhead arm motion required for the sport. The typical presentation of medial epicondyle apophysitis is an insidious onset of progressively worsening medial elbow pain associated with overhead throwing and decreased throwing performance and endurance.

The physical exam is vital for the diagnosis of medial epicondyle apophysitis. The patient will typically have medial epicondyle point tenderness, medial elbow pain with valgus stress, and sometimes subtle elbow contractures.

Avulsion fractures of the medial epicondyle can have additional exam findings, including elbow instability, reduced ROM, and ulnar neuropathy.
