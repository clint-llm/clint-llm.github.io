Falling onto an outstretched hand is the most common mechanism leading to elbow dislocations.

Importantly, soft-tissue structures can also undergo compromise during an elbow dislocation. Disruption of supportive structures occurs, from lateral to medial, called the “Horii circle.”

Elbow dislocations differentiate by the direction of the olecranon relative to the humerus. Posterolateral, posteromedial, posterior, anterior, medial, and lateral are different possibilities. Posterolateral is the most common pattern of dislocation.

Dislocations can also be complete or subluxated (also referred to as perched). A perched dislocation shows the coronoid resting on the trochlea instead of complete dissociation, as seen in a complete dislocation.

Finally, dislocations can be termed simple or complex. A simple dislocation involves injury to only capsular or ligamentous structures. A complex dislocation involves fractures of the surrounding bony structure.
