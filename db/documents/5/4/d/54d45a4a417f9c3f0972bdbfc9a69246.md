There are many causes and treatments for tendinosis; hence the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team. The primary caregiver and nurse practitioner monitor the majority of patients. The key is to curtail the condition causing tendinitis. Irrespective of the treatment, if the primary cause is not discontinued, relapse of symptoms is very common. Overall, most patients have a recurrence of symptoms, and they undergo a variety of treatments, albeit with little satisfaction.
