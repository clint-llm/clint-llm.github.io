Prognosis in early-stage liver disease is good since steatosis and steatohepatitis lesions may be reversible after alcohol cessation. However, up to 20% of patients with steatosis may still progress to cirrhosis.

The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was adopted by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to prioritize patients waiting for a liver transplant due to its ability to predict 90-day mortality.

DF is also a useful predictive tool, and patients with alcoholic hepatitis and a DF greater than 32 have a >50% 30-day mortality.
