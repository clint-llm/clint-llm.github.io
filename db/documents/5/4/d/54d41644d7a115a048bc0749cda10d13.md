Complications of SCFE include femoral growth arrest due to premature closure of the physis, femoral head osteonecrosis, chondrolysis, femoroacetabular impingement, labral tears, infection, chronic pain, and development of SCFE in the contralateral hip. Later complications of SCFE include early-onset osteoarthritis of the hip.

**Femoral head osteonecrosis**could result from the initial injury, with a higher risk in unstable SCFE cases.

**Chondrolysis**could be a consequence of articular surface penetration.

**Femoroacetabular impingement**is due to failure of proximal femoral remodeling (pistol grip deformity). This can be addressed, as mentioned earlier, by proximal femoral osteotomy.

**Slip progression:**This has been reported in 1Â to 2% of cases with single screw fixation.
