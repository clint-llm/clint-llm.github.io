Using a task trainer can allow for the creation of a simple teaching model leading to a standardized teaching approach and, ultimately, a sustainable outcome. For many years, the standard of practice in the medical community has been Halstead's "See one, Do one, Teach one" but this has become less acceptable, particularly when invasive procedures and high-risk care are involved.

For the second step, the teacher can deconstruct the procedure and explain each maneuver on the task trainer as he or she performs it. For the third step, the teacher can test for comprehension by having the learner describe each step as the teacher performs it on the task trainer. The final step of this model refers to the student simultaneously executing and describing each maneuver on the task trainer to demonstrate proper execution of the procedure. With a task trainer, the teacher can easily go through Peyton's 4 step approach to allow for more effective learning.
