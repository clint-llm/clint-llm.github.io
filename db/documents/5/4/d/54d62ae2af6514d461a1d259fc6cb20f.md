Early lesions of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva show a rapid and destructive inflammatory stage characterized by an intense mononuclear and perivascular infiltration by macrophages, mast cells, and lymphocytes. The subsequent migration of these inflammatory cells into the affected skeletal muscle causes its death.

Early lesions of this phase are histologically similar to aggressive juvenile fibromatosis and can not be distinguished. As these lesions mature, the fibroproliferative tissue is converted into cartilage by the process of avascular condensation. This is followed by the final phase of revascularization with osteogenesis in a characteristic process of heterotopic ossification forming new ossicles of heterotopic bone, which appear histologically similar to the mature lamellar bone and often contain marrow elements.

This heterotopic bone formation resembles bone formation in embryonic skeletal development and postnatal fracture healing, except for the lack of inflammation in the primary skeletal formation. The fibroproliferative, chondrogenic and osteogenic stages of heterotopic ossification are characterized by multipotent stem-like cells of vascular origin while the late osteogenic phase is characterized by inflammatory cells of hematopoietic origin. All these stages are seen in an active Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva lesion, thus suggesting different rates of maturation of different regions of the lesion.
