Frostbite, also known as freezing cold injury (FCI) is tissue damage as a result to cold exposure, occurring at temperatures below 0 degrees C. It is included in a spectrum of injury, from FCI to non-FCI and frostnip.

Frostbite tend to occur when the body is exposed to intense cold, resulting in vasoconstriction. The resulting decrease in blood flow fails to deliver heat to the tissues and eventually leads to ice crystal formation. Body parts most prone to frostbite include the feet, hand, ears, lips, and nose. Most cases of frostbite occur in the winter; homeless people and those who perform outdoors activity are most susceptible to the injury. The goal of treatment is to salvage as much tissue as possible so that maximal function remains.
