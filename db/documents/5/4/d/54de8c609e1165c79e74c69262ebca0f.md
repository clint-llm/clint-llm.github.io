Baclofen taken orally is rapidly absorbed, and 80% is eliminated renally. The remainder is hepatically metabolized by unknown cytochrome enzymes. Peak serum concentration occurs two hours post-ingestion and has a half-life of approximately 3.5 hours (with a range of 2.5 to 6.8 hours) in healthy subjects. With baclofen overdose, the half-life can be markedly prolonged. One case report documented a 36-hour half-life following a baclofen overdose of 450 mg.

Baclofen is moderately lipophilic, which can result in the redistribution of baclofen out of tissues, causing a delayed second rise in serum levels as well as prolonged clearance. With plasma protein binding of 30% and a small volume of distribution of 0.7L/kg, hemodialysis can effectively remove baclofen.
