In the present day, Milk-alkali syndrome occurs due to ingesting inappropriately high amounts of calcium carbonate. Increased awareness of the importance of calcium intake and the increased availability of over-the-counter preparations of calcium carbonate for the treatment of osteoporosis and dyspepsia are significant causes of the development of the milk-alkali syndrome.

Certain other drugs may also contribute to the development of this syndrome. An association between the development of milk-alkali syndrome and thiazide diuretics have been reported.

Severe cases of milk-alkali syndrome have been reported in pregnant women.

A rare cause is the use of large amounts of nicotine-substitute chewing gum, which may deliver high quantities of calcium.
