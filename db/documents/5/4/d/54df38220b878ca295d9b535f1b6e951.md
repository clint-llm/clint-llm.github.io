The most common complication of hemophilia is due to bleeding episodes. Recurrent hemarthrosis, which leads to synovial membrane inflammation and hypertrophy, eventually leads to destructive arthropathy. Other complications include intracranial hemorrhages after minor trauma, hypovolemic shock events due to iliopsoas muscle bleeding, and airway compromise due to retropharyngeal bleedings.

Patients treated with factors in the late 1970s and early 1980s were known to have a high risk for infection with HIV, HCV, which reached 80% to 85%. But after 1992, and due to the combination of effective blood screening with viral inactivation protocols, the risk of infection was extremely low.

Psychosocial impairments, depression, and functional impairments in patients with hemophilia have been reported to have a higher incidence than normal healthy individuals. In children, maturational delays were reported.
