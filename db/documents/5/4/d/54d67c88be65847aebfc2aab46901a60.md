Cardiac ultrasound, or echocardiography, is a noninvasive diagnostic modality that can provide detailed hemodynamic information in a short period of time at a patient's bedside. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in performing cardiac ultrasound and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for the cardiac ultrasound.
- Review the technique involved in cardiac ultrasound.
- Describe the equipment used for the cardiac ultrasound.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the use of cardiac ultrasound and improve patient outcomes.
