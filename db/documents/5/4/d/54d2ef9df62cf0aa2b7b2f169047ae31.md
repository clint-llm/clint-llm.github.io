The treatment of initial caries lesions by demineralization is aÂ significant advance in the clinical management of dental caries, where the main goal is to preserve tooth structure and arrest or reverse the process to prevent the lesion from cavitating. The dentist must acquire a more conservative look, motivating their patients to practice prevention: regularly visiting the dental office, brushing teeth at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, adequate exposure to fluorides, and a diet low in fermentable carbohydrates.
