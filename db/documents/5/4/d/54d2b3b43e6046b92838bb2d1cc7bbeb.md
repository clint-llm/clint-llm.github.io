Blood levels and urinary excretion are not sensitive markers of riboflavin deficiency, and the preferred method for assessing riboflavin status is stimulation of the FAD-dependent erythrocyte glutathione reductase. The results express as an activation coefficient (erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient) such that the poorer the riboflavinÂ status, the higher is the activation coefficient.
