The timing strongly influences etiology.

- Underlying conditions (e.g., immunosuppressed patients) may have a reduced inflammatory response or reduced fever while at the same time having a serious infection.

- Differential diagnosis includes infectious (e.g., nosocomial or surgical site infections) and non-infectious (e.g., deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, myocardial infarction, drug-related, transfusion-related, endocrine-related for example adrenal insufficiency or thyroid storm) causes.

- Fever is more likely to be due to infection as the time interval following surgery increases.

- Fever in patients may have more than one cause at the same time, and infectious and non-infectious causes may coexist.
