The most important and equally common condition that has to be differentiated from familial short stature (FSS) is CDGP. In most cases, the differentiation is simple. Children with CDGP resemble FSS because they have normal birth length and weight; they have a "catch down growth" that crosses percentiles and have a normal growth rate. However, they differ since they are slightly above the growth curve, develop puberty later, and have a bone age that is delayed by at least two years. The final height in CDGP is much greater than that found in FSS:

Height velocity or the rate of linear growth can help to differentiate the causes:

Normal height velocity: familial short stature and CDGP.

Slow height velocity: growth hormone deficiency.

GSS: final height that is below the 3rd percentile.

CDGP: final height in the normal range.

The majority of children born small for gestational age (SGA) will catch up with height and weight during the first two years of life. A few, however, fail to catch up and remain short. This type of individual can be distinguished by obtaining a careful history.

Other causes of proportionate SS are Turner, Noonan, and Russell-Silver syndromes are differentiated by various associated physical findings and investigations.

The children with FSS have an adequate nutritional status and are easily distinguished from states of malnutrition, where weight is affected more than height.

Chronic systemic illnesses have features peculiar to their condition and can be easily distinguished from FSS; since children with FSS are healthy and active.

Hypothyroidism may present with SS; but have a delayed bone age, deceleration of growth velocity, and other characteristic findings. Thyroid function tests will help confirm the diagnosis.

Cushing syndrome is a rare cause of SS. In this case, children are sick, have distinguishing physical findings, delayed bone age, growth deceleration, and typical laboratory test results.

Classical GH deficiency has physical features of the condition, symptoms, signs of deficiencies of other pituitary hormones, delayed bone age, very significant SS, growth deceleration that extends from onset of the disease and continues throughout, a low IGF1, IGFBP3, and poor GH responses to stimulation tests.

It is when GH deficiency is partial or incomplete that distinguishing it from FSS or CDGP becomes difficult. Here, the GH stimulation tests are not sensitive enough to make that determination.

In pre-pubertal boys older than 11 years and girls older than ten years, it is important to prime with sex steroids before GH stimulation studies; otherwise, many children with CDGP (and some with combined FSS and CDGP) may be misdiagnosed as GH deficiency and unnecessarily exposed to rGH therapy. There is a significant difference in the GH response to stimulation when sex-steroid priming is employed. Either 2 mg of 17-beta-estradiol (for both boys and girls) orally two days before the test or testosterone (for boys) 50 mg intramuscularly a day before the procedure is recommended. Obesity blunts GH responses to stimulation testing. Many normal children also show ambiguous responses following a single stimulation procedure. Therefore, it is important to test with two modalities for accurate classification.
