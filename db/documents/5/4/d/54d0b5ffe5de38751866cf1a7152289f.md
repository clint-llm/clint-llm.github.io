The distinction between hypertrophic scars and keloid scars can be seen histologically. Both hypertrophic scars and keloids show thick bundles of collagen on histopathology. Hypertrophic scars show the deposition of collagen type III fibers that are arranged parallel to the epidermis. Keloid scars show haphazard sheets of type-1 and type-2 collagen with random directional orientation. This is sometimes termed “keloid collagen,” and tends to be much more histologically disorganized. There also tend to be more blood vessels and neo-capillary ingrowth histologically in keloid scars than in hypertrophic scars.
