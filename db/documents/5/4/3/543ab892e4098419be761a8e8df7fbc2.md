There are two staging systems commonly utilized for skeletal metastasis, the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society/Enneking staging system, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system.

The MSTS/Enneking staging system can be used for both malignant and benign lesions. Malignant lesions are described using Roman numerals, whereas benign lesions are defined by Arabic numbers. The staging system is based on 3 categories: histological grade of tumor, intracompartmental versus extracompartmental location, and presence of metastasis. The staging system is depicted in Table 4.

The AJCC Staging System is based upon 5 categories: histological grade, tumor size, depth, nodal involvement, and presence of metastasis. The staging system is depicted in Table 5.
