Younger patients with an odontoid fracture typically have identifiable recent trauma (motor vehicle accident, sports-related impact, diving accident, fall from a height or downstairs). Older patients tend toÂ have less resilient bones and can sustain an odontoid fracture after minor trauma, including falling from ground level or running into a door or cabinet. However, older individuals can also sustain an odontoid fracture from recent injuries similar to those of younger people.

On physical exam, patients may note cervical neck pain, which is worse with motion. They can also have dysphagia due to a retropharyngeal hematoma or associated parapharyngeal swelling. Less commonly, the patient may have myelopathic spinal cord injuries such as paresthesias in the arms and/or legs, weakness of the arms and/or legs, or other neurologic dysfunctions. There are fewer spinal cord injuries in odontoid fractures due to the relatively large cross-sectional diameter of the spinal canal at the level of the odontoid process compared to the diameter of the spinal cord.
