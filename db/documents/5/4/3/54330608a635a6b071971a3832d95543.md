Although radiographic testing can help to confirm a retrobulbar hematoma, the diagnosis is clinical.

These results reinforce the importance of a thorough clinical exam. CT imaging can be used to help visualize the extent of the hematoma, as well as identify other associated injuries such as maxillofacial fractures, globe rupture, or intraocular foreign bodies. A CT scan may also reveal optic nerve tension or a distorted posterior globe. If a patient displays the signs and symptoms typical of optic nerve ischemia from RBH, however, radiographic imaging should be delayed in favor of prompt surgical intervention.
