Work up includes radiographs of the wrist and forearm. On AP radiographs, there will be an increase in radial inclination and lunate subsidence into the lunate fossa with a characteristic "v-shaped" carpus. On lateral radiographs, there will be an increase in volar tilt and relative volar subluxation of the carpus.

Due to the increased volar tilt of the distal radius, the ulna will be relatively dorsally displaced in appearance. If the deformity is severe and long-standing, the distal ulna may appear spiculated and irregular. If the distal radioulnar joint remains reduced, forearm and elbow radiographs may demonstrate the radial head pulling away from the capitellum.

This is more common in the entire radius subtype of Madelung deformity, with an increase in radiocapitellar distance greater than 4 mm. Radial bowing may also be present on forearm radiographs, especially pronounced in the entire radius subtype.

There have been proposals to perform screening MRIs in patients with a strong family history of Madelung deformity to enable prophylactic treatment. However, this is not routinely recommended.

MRI may also identify an oblique appearing triangulofibrocartilage complex as the deformity becomes more severe. There may be a bony physeal bar across the volar ulnar physis, although this may be apparent on radiographs as well.

The pathognomonic finding of a flame-shaped distal radial notch at the origin of Vickers ligament and distal radial metaphyseal flare may be seen on radiographs or MRI. Acquired Madelung deformity will not demonstrate Vickers ligament on MRI. However, MRI may demonstrate paraphyseal edema and physeal bridging in the post-traumatic subtype.
