Metolazone is a quinazoline sulphonamide diuretic related to the thiazide class. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved metolazone to treat salt and water retention, causing edema accompanying congestive heart failure or chronic kidney disease. It is commonly used as adjuvant therapy and loop diuretics for treating severe CHF to produce diuresis in patients refractory to loop diuretics monotherapy.

The drug can be used to treat edema associated with nephrotic syndrome alone or in combination with spironolactone. Also, metolazone is indicated to treat hypertension alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs of a different class.
