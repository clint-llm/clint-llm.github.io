The primary care provider, ophthalmic nurse, and pharmacist should educate the patient on the prevention and basic treatments of dry eyes by limiting screen time, blinking often, using artificial tears, and keeping the home environment cool and moist. Eye care providers should work with the patient's primary care providers or rheumatologists to investigate possible underlying systemic diseases in cases where an underlying systemic disease is suspected. In cases of primary or secondary Sjogren syndrome, treatment of the underlying disorder is often needed to treat the ocular manifestations adequately.

The interprofessional team approach with all clinicians, nursing staff, and pharmacists communicating openly and sharing information is the optimal approach to addressing patients with dry eyes syndrome. [Level 5]
