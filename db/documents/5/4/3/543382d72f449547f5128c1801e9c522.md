Aluminum hydroxide [Al(OH)3] dissociates into Al3+ and OH- in the stomach. The freed hydroxide groups then bind to free protons, ultimately producing water and insoluble aluminum salts, mostly Al(Cl)3, within the stomach. The proton binding serves to increase the overall pH of the stomach, i.e., less acidic, reducing the symptoms of indigestion. The produced aluminum salt primarily gets excreted in the feces, with less than 1% of the bioavailable aluminum absorbed within the GI tract.

Aluminum exists at a steady-state within the body, so the body manages transient increases in aluminum uptake from use as an antacid with an equivalent increase in urinary excretion of unmodified aluminum. However, the setpoint of that steady-state may become elevated with prolonged increased intake of aluminum, so aluminum hydroxide treatment should not be considered as a long-term solution for patients suffering from acid indigestion. Furthermore, patients with chronic kidney disease may not be able to excrete the increased aluminum and thus also should be carefully considered.

Topical aluminum hydroxide creates an acidic, hydrophilic layer over the area of irritation; this serves as a protective barrier to prevent infection and deter bacterial growth within the wound.

As an adjuvant in vaccines, aluminum hydroxide is known to increase macrophage phagocytosis, possibly via the upregulation of the NLRP3-inflammasome, increasing uptake of the desired antigen. Additionally, it is known to facilitate what is known as the "repository effect," whereby the antigens aggregate on and around the molecule, which helps to prevent their degradation within the body.
