Antihistamines are a class of medications that can be subdivided into H-1 and H-2 categories. H-1 antihistamines, which can be further divided into first and second generations, are primarily used to treat allergic symptoms and illnesses mediated through similar mechanisms. H-2 antihistamines can lower excessive stomach acid and thereby treat acid reflux, gastritis, and gastrointestinal ulcers.

Pharmacists serve as dispensers and educators of these medications, given the availability of antihistamines at pharmacies for off-the-shelf purchase. They have a crucial role in advising the patient to utilize the correct dose and be cautious of any contraindications and adverse effects. Nurses should be prepared to answer questions regarding these medications, as well as offer counsel on adverse effects and note their therapeutic effectiveness, and report any findings to the clinician.

Providers that recommend antihistamines, such as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and physicians, should use caution and make sure the healthcare team is aware of the recommendation and the pharmacist can review the patient's medication profile to determine if there are any clinically significant drug interactions, especially in elderly patients.
