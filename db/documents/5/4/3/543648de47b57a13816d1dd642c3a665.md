ACO is a lung condition that makes breathing difficult. It has both asthma and COPD features. It mostly happens due to having risk factors for both asthma and COPD. The airways, the branching tubes that carry air through the lungs, can become congested with mucus and narrow in people with ACO. Also susceptible to damage are the air sacs. People feel exhausted and out of breath as a result. The main difference in symptoms between ACO and COPD and asthma is that the patient with ACO has more rate of exacerbations than patients with asthma or COPD alone. As a patient, to avoid developing COPD, you have to avoid risk factors that can lead to the development of the disease or exacerbations.

- Avoid smoking. The most important measure patients can do for their health is to stop smoking. If they have other underlying risk factors for asthma, smoking can lead to ACO development and makes symptoms more severe. Clinicians may need to assist with smoking cessation.

- Reduce the patient's risk of infection because some infections can exacerbate ACO symptoms. By receiving specific vaccinations, patients can reduce their risk. These include receiving an annual flu shot, the pneumococcal vaccine, and subsequent doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.

- Avoid triggers, such as dust or pollution, that worsen a patient's breathing.
