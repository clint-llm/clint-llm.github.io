Patients with PIH have a history of an inflammatory disorder of the skin or skin injury in the same distribution. Once the underlying inflammation has resolved, PIH is asymptomatic. However, psychological distress and impact on the quality of life may persist.

On physical examination, PIH appears as irregular, hyperpigmented macules or patches in the distribution of the initial inflammation or injury. Epidermal hyperpigmentation is tan, brown, or dark brown in color and may persist for months to years without treatment but does tend to improve over time as the underlying inflammatory disorder resolves. Woodâ€™s lamp examination of epidermal PIH may reveal fluorescence. Dermal hyperpigmentation is blue-gray and may be permanent. Dermal and epidermal hyperpigmentation may both be present. If the inflammatory process is still active, erythematous papules, plaques, or nodules may also be visible.
