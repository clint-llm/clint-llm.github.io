**Limitations of the Rinne test**

Like its complementary test, the Weber test, both are screening tests that do not replace formal audiometry. Additionally, the validity of the Rinne test as a screening test is often questioned. The test is not sensitive in differentiating conductive and sensorineural loss causes of total sensorineural or severe unilateral hearing loss. False negatives are common in such situations. In any situation where there is a question about the Rinne test, the patient must be referred to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeon for formal audiometry.

Another important caveat about the Rinne test is that the technique is not uniform. The orientation of the tuning fork and its exact placement varies from individual to individual. All physicians who perform the Rinne test must pay attention to the orientation of the tines of the tuning fork relative to the long axis of the external auditory canal when testing for air conduction.
