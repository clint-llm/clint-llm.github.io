Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) presents as bilateral corneal opacification present at birth or in the immediate newborn period and is due to an autosomal recessive mutation affecting the corneal endothelium.

Opacification is the result of stromal edema and Descemet membrane thickening due to endothelial dysfunction.
