The patientâ€™s vitals should be checked promptly, and arterial blood gases with blood glucose levels checked while performing a complete physical exam. This would estimate hemoglobin, electrolytes, and blood glucose values. If signs of new focal neurologic deficits are present, a computed tomographic scan of the head should be strongly considered. An individualized panel of lab tests might be requested according to the specific clinical vignette. For instance, a previous history of alcohol abuse might result in thiamine deficiency. In the setting of an abnormal liver function test, along with compatible physical examination, further diagnostic steps are required. Increased carbohydrate metabolites, lactate, pyruvate, and decreased blood thiamine levels are confirmatory.
