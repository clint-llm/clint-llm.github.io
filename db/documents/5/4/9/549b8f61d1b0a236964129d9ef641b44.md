Clinical manifestations vary depending on the type of healthcare-associated infection (HAI), implicated pathogen, and the severity of illness.

**Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infection (CLABSI)**will manifest with fever and rigors due to bacteremia in a patient having a central line at the time of infection or within 48 hours after removal. Purulence or erythema at the site of insertion and catheter dysfunction may occur, but absence should not minimize suspicion of CLABSI. Occasionally complicated infections due to the bloodstream infection (BSI) may be the first manifestation, such as endocarditis, suppurative thrombophlebitis, septic arthritis, osteomyelitis, or abscess.

**Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI)**

Signs and symptoms of CAUTIare similar to other urinary tract infections, but they occur with indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheters, intermittent catheterization, or within 48 hours of removal of a catheter. Common signs and symptoms are fever, suprapubic or costovertebral angle tenderness, acute hematuria, catheter obstruction, dysuria, urgency.

**Skin and Soft Tissue Infection (SSI)**will have different clinical signs and symptoms based on the site, type of infection, and pathogen(s) involved. SSI usually occurs within the first 30 days post-operatively or 90 days in the setting of prosthetic devices. Signs of inflammation, such as erythema, warmth, and pain, and wound dehiscence, are seen in SSI. Purulent drainage may be present depending on the characteristics of the implicated organism and typically occurs in superficial incisional infections. Post-surgical drains may also drain purulent material. Deep tissue and organ-specific/space occupying infections are usually somewhat concealed and present with more systemic signs, such as fevers, rigors, more profound and extensive pain, and leukocytosis.

**Pneumonia**will manifest with new-onset fever, cough, purulent sputum production, and declining oxygenation. To meet the criteria for HAP or VAP, the symptoms should have an onset after 48 hours of hospitalization or ventilation, respectively. Sedated patients on mechanical ventilation may present with fevers, increasing oxygen requirement, and purulent material from endotracheal suctioning. Physical examination findings may reveal coarse breath sounds and rales on auscultation, in the setting of parapneumonic effusions, there may be decreased breath sounds.

**Healthcare Facility Onset C. difficile Infection****(HO-CDI)**should be suspected in the setting of unexplained CDI symptoms, which include three or more unformed stools in 24 hours that occur within three days of hospitalization. Diarrhea is the cardinal symptom of CDI. However, other signs and symptoms may include abdominal pain, distention, cramping, fever, nausea, anorexia, and dehydration. Symptoms typically occur in the setting of recent antibiotic use.

It is vital to consider immunocompromised and elderly patients who may not mount robust immune responses to infection. In these special patient populations, a high index of suspicion for underlying infection should be kept when there are signs of altered mental status, lethargy, fatigue, and changes in baseline vitals (tachycardia, hypotension, respiratory status).
