The staging of glottic and other laryngeal cancers is according to the 2016 eighth edition of the AJCC TNM classification of malignant tumors. Unlike oral and oropharyngeal cancers, depth of invasion and p16 status does not have a role in staging glottic tumors. The extra-nodal extension is one of the most important predictors of clinical outcomes in head and neck cancers. To reflect this, TNM8 introduced the presence of extra-nodal extension into all laryngeal cancer staging, with its presence immediately classifying a patient as N3b regardless of nodal size, quantity, or location; to accurately reflect the negative impact this finding can have on prognosis.

The TMN8 Tumour (T) staging is as follows:

- Tx: primary tumor cannot be assessed

- Tis: carcinoma in situ

- T1: tumor limited to the vocal cords (including the anterior and posterior commissure) with normal mobility

- T1a: tumor limited to one vocal cord
- T1b: tumor involving both vocal cords

- T2:

- T2a: tumor extends to supraglottis and/or subglottis with normal vocal fold mobility
- T2b: tumor extends to the supraglottis and/or subglottis, or with impaired vocal cord mobility

- T3: tumor limited to the larynx with vocal cord fixation or invasion of the paraglottic space or inner cortex of the thyroid cartilage

- T4: advanced disease

- T4a: tumor invades through the outer cortex of the thyroid cartilage and/or invades tissues beyond the larynx (trachea, cricoid cartilage, tongue muscles, strap muscles, thyroid, or esophagus)
- T4b: tumor invades prevertebral space, encases carotid artery, or invades mediastinal structures

The TNM 8 nodal (N) staging is as follows:

- Nx: nodes unable to be assessed

- N0: no regional lymph nodes

- N1: single ipsilateral lymph node ≤3cm and no extra-nodal extension

- N2

- N2a: single ipsilateral lymph node >3cm but <6 cm in greatest dimension and no extra-nodal extension
- N2b: multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none >6cm in greatest dimension and no extra-nodal extension
- N2c: bilateral or contralateral lymph nodes, none >6cm in greatest dimension and extra-nodal extension

- N3

- N3a: any lymph node >6cm and no-extra-nodal extension
- N3b: any nodes with clinically overt extra-nodal extension

The TNM8 metastasis (M) staging is as follows:

- M0: no distant metastasis

- M1: distant metastasis
