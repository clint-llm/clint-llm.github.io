Gastric resection remains the preferred surgical treatment option for many diseases of the stomach, including malignancy, peptic ulcer disease, and bariatric procedures. Minimally invasive gastrectomy has been shown to have decreased hospital length of stay, fewer perioperative complications, and less intraoperative bleeding than open procedures. Gastric resection is often complicated by post-gastrectomy syndromes, including internal herniation, dumping syndrome, bile reflux gastritis, and afferent/efferent loop syndromes.
