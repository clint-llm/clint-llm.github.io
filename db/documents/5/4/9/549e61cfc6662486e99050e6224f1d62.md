When evaluating a patient with a complaint of tinnitus, the history and physical will help refine the differential diagnosis. All causes of objective tinnitus should be considered when developing a differential diagnosis. Stapedius myoclonus and palatal myoclonus are very high on the differential in a patient with TT syndrome as all three can present similarly. History, physical, as well as tympanometry can direct a clinician to one or more potential diagnoses, but the most definitive diagnosis is by direct visualization of TT spasm. Other conditions to be considered are a patulous Eustachian tube, arteriovenous fistula or malformations, glomus tumors, carotid artery stenosis, and other atherosclerotic diseases. However, these other disorders will most likely present with different history and physical exams as well as more definitively distinguished by audiometry and imaging.
