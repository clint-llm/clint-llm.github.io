The monitoring and administration of clavulanic acid are only considered in conjunction with amoxicillin. There are reports of hypersensitivity reactions to this drug combination, so monitoring for this at the beginning of an administration is recommended. Monitoring for secondary infection while on this drug regimen is also advisable. Hepatic, hematological, and renal functions also require monitoring if the administration lasts for longer than one week. Patients with hepatic and renal impairment require close surveillance while on the drug and after discontinuation of the drug.
