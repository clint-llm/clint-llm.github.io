Midshaft humeral fractures are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an orthopedic surgeon, emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, radiologist, and therapist. The majority of these fractures are managed non-surgically and hence clinicians should know the follow-up protocol. Once the cast is removed, physical therapy is required to restore muscle strength and range of motion. The pharmacist should educate the patient on pain management. The key is to ensure that there is no injury to the radial nerve. The majority of these fractures are managed non-surgically with casting. Extensive rehabilitation is required to regain muscle mass and strength once the fracture has healed. Serial x-rays are necessary and all patients with non-union should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon for more definitive management. Open communication between the team is essential to enhance patient outcomes.
