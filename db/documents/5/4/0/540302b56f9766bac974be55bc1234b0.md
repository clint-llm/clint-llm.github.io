Management of EMZL depends on the primary site of involvement. Broadly the treatment depends on if the EMZL is gastric or non-gastric EMZL.

**Gastric EMZL**The majority of patients usually present as early-stage in gastric EMZL. The treatment depends on the status of H. pylori.

**Patients Positive forH. pylori**

The primary treatment is directed at the eradication of the H. pylori with antibiotics in early-stage gastric EMZL. The choice of therapy depends on the local antibiotic resistance of H. pylori. The antibiotic treatment resulted in the regression of lymphoma and long-term disease control in the majority of patients.H. pylori, but the remaining may need an additional course of antibiotics. The outcome of the eradication treatment should be checked by a urea breath test or a stool antigen test about 6 weeks after the eradication therapy. Gastric EMZL regression is noted in up to 75% of cases with histologic complete response.

**Response Evaluation**

After confirming the eradication of H pylori, periodic upper gastrointestinal endoscopic evaluations are recommended at least every 3 months with multiple biopsies to evaluate for tumor response as well as for recurrence. Once the complete response is achieved on the histology, the endoscopic evaluation can be staggered to every 6 months and then yearly after the first 2 years since diagnosis.

**Failure of Initial Treatment**

About 20 percent of the patients do not respond to the initial antibiotic therapy and require additional therapy. The appropriate timing for the second-line therapy is not clear as the responses from initial therapy can be slow and sometimes take up to a year. Treatment options include radiation therapy or systemic therapy with immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy.

**Patients Negative forH. pylori**

A minority of patients with gastric EMZL are negative for H. pylori at the time of diagnosis. The consensus on treatment differs slightly between the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European Society of Medical Oncologists (ESMO). While NCCN suggests the use of other modalities like radiation and systemic therapy, ESMO recommends a trial of H. pylori directed therapy as testing for H. pylori is not 100 percent sensitive where some patients can have false-negative test results.

**Advanced Gastric EMZL**Patients with advanced disease who are positive forH pylori are still treated with antibiotics for eradication. In symptomatic disease, immunotherapy/chemoimmunotherapy is used as initial therapy. Those without H. pyloriÂ infections are usually treated with systemic therapy, and treatment is usually initiated when patients are symptomatic.

**Non-gastric EMZL**

The common sites of involvement of EMZL other than gastric are the ocular adnexa, lung, thyroid, lacrimal glands, salivary glands, breast, skin, small intestine, dura, and soft tissues as discussed above. The treatment usually depends on the stage. Patients with localized disease are usually treated with local therapy like radiation, and advanced disease is treated with systemic therapy like immunotherapy and chemoimmunotherapy, which are discussed below.

Unlike gastric EMZL, the benefit from antibiotic use is still unclear in some of the non-gastric EMZL. Doxycycline was used in patients with ocular adnexa EMZL with evidence of C. psittaci infection, an estimated progression-free survival (PFS) at 5 years was about 55 percent.

**Radiation Therapy**

Local radiation therapy results in high rates of remission in early non-gastric EMZL. The 5-year survival rates are greater than 90%.

**Systemic Therapy**

Systemic therapy is usually used in patients with advanced disease or if radiation is not feasible or if the disease progressed after local radiation.

Rituximab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody, is used with or without chemotherapy. Single-agent rituximab therapy is well tolerated, and the overall responses are in the range of 80 percent.

When compared to single-agent rituximab, the combination rituximab and chlorambucil showed improved complete response (79% vs. 56%) and a 5-year PFS (72% vs. 57%). All three treatments have a similar 5-year OS rate.

Rituximab, in combination with lenalidomide, has shown promising activity in a phase II trial.

Surgery is not recommended in patients with EMZL, as it may impair quality of life, especially with local treatments having a significantly high overall survival even at 10 years.

**Transformation**

Indolent lymphomas, including EMZL, can transform into more aggressive high-grade large cell lymphoma. It should be suspected in patients who develop B symptoms (fever, weight loss, drenching night sweats), a significant elevation in LDH, or rapid growth of a lymph node. A concern for large cell transformation should be further evaluated by a biopsy and PET scan for appropriate staging and treatment considerations. PET scan also can help select the appropriate site to do the biopsy.
