Intramuscular injection (IM) is installing medications into the depth of specifically selected muscles.

Drugs may be given intramuscularly both for prophylactic (around 5% for immunization) as well as curative purposes (accounting for more than 95% of IM injections).

The most common medications given by IM route include:

- Antibiotics- penicillin G benzathine penicillin, streptomycin

- Biologicals- immunoglobins, vaccines, and toxoids

- Hormonal agents- testosterone, medroxyprogesterone

Any nonirritant and soluble drugs may be given IM during an emergency scenario.
