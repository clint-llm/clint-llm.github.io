The prognosis of hydrops fetalis is dependent mainly on the underlying cause, gestational age at the time of the diagnosis, time of delivery, amount of fetal edema, and intrauterine interventions.

Survival in hydrops fetalis depends on the underlying disease, available fetal therapies to resolve hydrops, and the gestational age of delivery, not on the specific anatomic manifestations of hydrops. In fetuses with hydrops with high cardiothoracic ratios, the cardiovascular profile score may be a useful prognostic indicator.Â Patients with hydrops who can have a fetal intervention for their underlying condition now benefit from improved survival, especially when hydrops can be resolved, and there is no preterm delivery. While particular physiologic parameters such as the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity did not predict survival, the cardiovascular profile score is a useful adjunct to predict survival when the underlying cause results in a high cardiothoracic ratio. Furthermore, the fact that patients with such variable disease processes and cardiac manifestations can converge on the simple anatomic finding of fluid in two compartments suggests a basic fetal distress mechanism that is yet to be discovered.
