# Continuing Education Activity

Internal degloving injuries are usually associated with high-energy trauma and can be devastating. This injury occurs when a tangential shearing occurs between the dermis and deep fascia, severing the perforating vessels and creating a potential space for fluid collection. Management depends on size, severity, and associated injuries. This activity reviews internal degloving injuries and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients with these injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of internal degloving injuries.
- Summarize the presentation of a patient with an internal degloving injury.
- Review the treatment considerations for patients with internal degloving injuries.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients with internal degloving injuries.

# Introduction

Internal degloving injuries are usually associated with high-energy trauma and can be devastating. More commonly known as Morel-Lavallee lesions, when in the pelvic or thigh region, a degloving occurs when the superficial fascia separates from the deep fascia in a shearing mechanism. This not only disrupts the vascular and lymphatic channels that span these two layers but creates a potential space for fluid collection. The hemolymphatic fluid that collects is a nidus for infection and may put the overlying skin at risk for necrosis. Management depends on lesion size, severity, and associated injuries.

# Etiology

Internal degloving injuries are uncommon but can have significant associated morbidity, especially if overlooked. Male sex predominates. A history of a high-speed motor vehicle collision, motorcycle accident, or direct crush to the area is common, with motor vehicle collisions being the most common mechanism reported.

# Epidemiology

The exact incidence of internal degloving injuries is impossible to determine because small injuries resulting in insignificant or minor fluid collections may not be clinically significant. Furthermore, even large internal degloving injuries are frequently missed due to either delayed presentation or the presence of distracting injuries. Internal degloving injuries do not typically occur in isolation. Morel-Lavallee lesions are frequently associated with and complicate the treatment of fractures of the pelvis, acetabulum, or proximal femur. There is a very wide range of associated rates between pelvic or acetabular fractures and Morel-Lavallee lesions.

# Pathophysiology

Normal skin and musculoskeletal anatomy include the following general layers from superficial to deep: skin, subcutaneous fat, superficial fascia, deep fat, deep fascia, muscle, bone. When a mechanism occurs that causes a tangential shearing of these layers, an internal degloving may take place. Essentially, the bone, muscle, and deep fascia shear one way, and the more superficial layers slide in the opposite direction. This event transects the perforating arteries and lymphatics that are traversing the fascial layers and leads to a collection of blood, lymphatic fluid, and necrotic fat in the newly created potential space.

# History and Physical

Internal degloving injuries have been described to appear in the immediate post-traumatic period or a delayed or chronic fashion. In the polytraumatized patient, there are often distracting, and life-threatening injuries present and the clinical stigmata of the degloving injury are inconsistent and can be delayed for several days. These facts, coupled with a patient population that has an ever-increasing average BMI, results in an injury that is overlooked 33% of the time.

# Evaluation

If the diagnosis is suspected clinically, large-bore needle aspiration of the area may be attempted to aid in diagnosis.

# Treatment / Management

The management of internal degloving injuries will depend on the overall clinical picture of the patient, including associated fractures, expected surgical course, and planned incisions. Also important is a careful assessment of the extent of devitalized and at-risk tissue, including initial viability of skin and size of the fluid cavity. Management can consist of compressive therapy, needle aspiration, sclerodesis, limited or radical surgical irrigation, and debridement. Several case series demonstrate validity for non-operative management with compressive wrap with occasional serial aspiration.

# Differential Diagnosis

Differential diagnoses for internal degloving injuries include seroma, abscess, vascular injury, compartment syndrome, and deep venous thrombosis. However, history and physical exam, coupled with appropriate imaging, should be able to direct the clinician to the correct diagnosis. In the acute trauma setting, a seroma or abscess should be less likely. A vascular injury, while possible, should be ruled out with a distal neurovascular exam, ankle-brachial index, and CT angiogram if necessary. Likewise, a deep venous thrombosis would most likely have more generalized limb swelling and could be easily evaluated with duplex ultrasound. Compartment syndrome of the thigh is rare and, while possible, should be ruled out by the physical exam. If in question, compartment pressure measurements can be obtained.

# Prognosis

As discussed, most of the literature has demonstrated that with identification and proper surgical management of Morel-Lavallee lesions, complete resolution can be obtained. Recurrence, infection, wound healing issues are the most likely complications.

# Complications

Specifically, recurrence is the most common complication, and rates differ with treatment modalities. Percutaneous aspiration alone is associated with the highest risk of recurrence at approximately 56%, compared to compression wrapping and observation at 19%. Lower rates of recurrence are reported with proper operative management.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patients that suffer internal degloving injuries may have a host of orthopedic and other injuries at the time of presentation. Discussion with family and patient are paramount in setting expectations for the clinical course. They should be informed that the internal degloving injury is uncommon and may complicate any fractures in the area; however, surgical treatment is usually successful with the complete resolution being the goal.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

During the hospital and rehabilitation course, these patients will undoubtedly see many different medical teams. The initial evaluation and stabilization efforts are likely to be performed in the emergency department by the trauma service. When a fracture is present, the orthopedic surgeon is also involved early in the care process and responsible for definitive care of the associated orthopedic injury and potential surgical wounds and incisions. A thorough exam by these initial providers may identify concern for internal degloving early in the hospital course and limit complications during treatment as well as decrease the incidence of missing these often overlooked injuries.

Plastic surgery consultation may be of use in assisting with wound management. While often not involved in performing the initial drainage of the lesion - they are frequently consulted for wound coverage, chronic lesions, and tissue rearrangement. The plastic surgeon may also assume care in an outpatient setting for contouring or cosmetic procedures after the initial wound is healed.
