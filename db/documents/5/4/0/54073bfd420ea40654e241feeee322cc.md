Hepatobiliary scintigraphy is a nuclear imaging technique that permits evaluation of the liver and biliary system for acute and chronic cholecystitis, biliary atresia, biliary obstruction, and post-surgical biliary leak. These are diverse conditions that require definitive diagnoses prior to intervention. This activity reviews the indications and contraindications for hepatobiliary scintigraphy and highlights interprofessional considerations for patients undergoing evaluation of the liver and biliary system with nuclear imaging.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the physiology of the hepatobiliary system.
- Review the indications and contraindications for hepatobiliary scintigraphy.
- Differentiate the common imaging findings associated with cholecystitis, biliary leak, biliary atresia, and biliary obstruction.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and communication between the interprofessional teams involved in the care of patients with hepatobiliary disease to hasten the diagnosis and management of patients with these pathologies.
