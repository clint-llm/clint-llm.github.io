The pathophysiology of post-traumatic headaches is still unknown; however, several theories have been proposed to explain the underlying cause of PTHA. These include impaired descending modulation, neurometabolic changes, and activation of the trigeminal sensory system.

**Impaired Descending Modulation**

This theory derives from the similarity between migraine and PTHA. A study by Schwedt et al. showed structural differences in cortical thickness and cerebral volumes in PTHA patients and healthy controls.

**Neurometabolic Changes**

Research suggests that TBI produces changes in brain metabolic activity. Physical trauma leads to cellular injury, resulting in an unregulated ion-exchange neurotransmitter release. The increased neuronal activity results in metabolic stress (lactate and free radicals), leading to axonal damage (secondary axotomy).

**Trigeminal Sensory System Activation**

The trigeminal sensory system may also be affected by neuroinflammation—inflammatory processes in the brain increase after TBI. Neuroinflammation may also increase the central nervous system (CNS) excitability resulting in CSD and subsequent activation of the trigeminal sensory system.

**Other Theories**

Additional possible contributions in PTHA include hyperadrenergic activity, activation of extracranial dural afferents, and meningeal irritation due to craniotomy.
