Standard operative equipment is used for eyelid reconstruction. Most of the tissues used for grafts or flaps are borrowed from distal sites, but sometimes synthetic grafts are used. Synthetic tarsal grafts commonly used as fillers when there is insufficient tarsus for repair include examples like an acellular matrix that essentially acts as a scaffold and over time and porcine acellular dermal matrix.
