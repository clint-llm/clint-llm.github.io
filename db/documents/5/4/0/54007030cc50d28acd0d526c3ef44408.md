After the eggs of AncylostomaÂ pass from the stool of their host, the eggs hatch into larvae. In favorable conditions, this occurs in 1 to 2 days. The hatched rhabditiform (non-infective) larvae grow in the feces or soil for 5 to 10 days and mature into filariform (infective) larvae. The filariform larvae can penetrate the human skin via hair follicles, enter the lymphatic system, and migrate to the heart and lungs. In the lungs, the larvae penetrate the pulmonary alveoli, where they ascend from the bronchial tree to the pharynx, can be coughed up, swallowed, and reach the small intestine where they mature into male or female blood-feeding-adults. The mating adult worms can produce thousands of eggs, and the cycle starts over. Furthermore, the filariform larvae can spread via oral ingestion and trans-mammary route where the larvae directly mature in the small intestine or stay dormant in human skeletal musculature. The dormant larvae have been proven responsible for vertical transmission during breastfeeding and are possibly the cause of transplacental infection.
