Gastrulation is a phase that occurs during the third week of early embryonic development, and it takes place immediately after the blastula phase in most animals. Here, the single-layered and hollow blastula is rearranged and differentiated in the multi-layered gastrula with three distinct layers: the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. This differentiation is a change from homogenous, single layered cells into distinct cell lineages and also sets up the axis along which the embryo will continue to develop.

Shortly after the gastrulation phase, the process of neurulation will occur. During this phase, mesodermal cells (middle layer from gastrulation) will form the notochord and will signal overlying ectodermal cells at the neural plate to fold inwardly to form the neural tube, and the joining ends will form the neural crest. The neural tube and neural crest detach from the rest of the overlying ectoderm. The neural tube will become the central nervous system. The neural crest will give rise to the peripheral nervous system, enteric nervous system, melanocytes, facial cartilage, odontoblasts, entero-chromaffin cells, spiral membrane, and more. The ectoderm that fails to involute will form the epidermis of the skin, hair, exocrine glands, and the anterior pituitary. Also, proper development requires communication between the three layers.
