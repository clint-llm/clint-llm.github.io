Anesthetic management of the burn patient can be a complex task due to various pathophysiological and hemodynamic changes following burn comprising greater than 20% total body surface area. The severely burned patient poses added challenges of airway management, fluid resuscitation, and vascular access due to direct trauma to the skin and soft tissue structures. This activity reviews and highlights the important components necessary for the anesthetic management of a severely burned patient, emphasizing the inter-professional team in evaluation and treatment.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how the pathophysiologic changes associated with burns alter anesthetic management.
- Identify the ideal approach to an airway complicated by significant thermal injury to supraglottic structures.
- Review the Parkland formula for fluid resuscitation after a severe burn and the parameters by which fluid resuscitation should be guided.
- Summarize how interprofessional team dynamics can improve patient outcomes in providing anesthesia for burn patients.
