Clubfoot (talipes equinovarus) is a congenital deformity involving the foot, otherwise known as congenital talipes equinovarus. It is among the most common congenital deformities and appears with varying degrees and severity of predictable contractures manifesting with four main deformities:

- Midfoot cavus

- Forefoot adductus

- Heel/hindfoot varus

- Hindfoot equinus

Clubfoot demonstrates excellent success rates in correction and overall patient outcomes if recognized early and treated appropriately.  Thus, its recognition and diagnosis early on in the infant's life facilitate an ideal outcome long-term.
