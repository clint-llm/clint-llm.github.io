Acne vulgaris, a common dermatologic condition, is defined by the presence of comedones. Essentially benign in nature, acne vulgaris can, however, result in permanent disfigurement and significant psychosocial sequelae. Although the condition is by far the most prevalent among the adolescent patient population, it can and does occur at any age, including infancy.

Pediatric acne subdivides into four subgroups based on the age of onset - neonatal acne, infantile acne, mid-childhood acne, and preadolescent acne. Infantile acne presents anytime between approximately 6 weeks and 12 months of age and displays a male predominance.
