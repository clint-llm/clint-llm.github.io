Brachioradial pruritus (BRP) is a localized neuropathic dysesthesia of the dorsolateral upper extremities. It is commonly seen in middle-aged white females with a seasonal predilection for warmer summer months. Cervical radiculopathy or neuropathy in the upper extremities in conjunction with ultraviolet radiation (UVR) are thought to be causative.
