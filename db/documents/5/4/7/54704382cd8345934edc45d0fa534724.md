Current recommendations for the ventilator initial settings in managing congenital diaphragmatic hernia include; 1. PIP; less than 25 cm H2O, 2. a PEEP of 3–5 cm H2O, 3. a rate of 40–60 breaths/min to maintain Paco2 between 50 and 70 mmHg.

Due to the risk of incarceration, it is recommended that all Morgagni hernias should be surgically repaired; however, the approach to repair and type of repair is still under debate. The hernia defect can be approached either through an abdominal approach or through a thoracic incision. A posterolateral right thoracotomy is made through the six intercostal spaces when utilizing the thoracic approach.

When approaching repair from an abdominal approach, the repair can be performed either through an open laparotomy incision or with minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques. The advantages of an abdominal approach include the ability to identify and repair bilateral defects and evaluate and repair other intra-abdominal pathology, such as malrotation, during the same operation.

In 1997, Georgacopulo was the first to report a successful laparoscopic repair of a Morgagni hernia in a child.
