The procedure should be done in the operating room or the ICU where the patient can be continuouslyÂ monitored. Besides having an ECHO machine one needs sterile drapes, local anesthetic, syringes, needles, scalpel and a pericardiocentesis kit. An alligator clip connector is needed to connect the V1 lead to the ECG machine. The patient is placed supine with the head of the bed slightly elevated. The patient must have IV access, receive oxygen and be hooked on to a cardiac monitor. If time permits, a nasogastric tube to decompress the stomach is recommended to lower the risk of gastric perforation.
