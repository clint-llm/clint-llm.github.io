There are no tests to diagnose restless legs syndrome except the ones to rule out secondary causes. Blood work is done to rule out other causes as well. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies are done if one suspects radiculopathy or neuropathy. Polysomnography is often done to quantify the frequency of leg movements and characterize the pattern of sleep.

Iron studies should be done in all patients with symptoms of RLS.

Patients whose RLS is under control but who have a reemergence or augmentation of their symptoms should again go through an assessment of their iron status. Augmentation means the presence of one or more of the following:

- Symptoms occurring earlier in the evening

- Symptoms are more intense in the morning

- Symptoms extend to the upper parts of the body

If a secondary cause is suspected, then other laboratory tests should be carried out, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and an evaluation of levels of the following:

- Blood urea nitrogen (BUN)

- Fasting blood glucose

- Creatinine

- Magnesium

- Vitamin B-12

- Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)

- Folate

In terms of the nervous system, even if the neurological examination is normal, nerve conduction studies and needle electromyography (EMG) should be considered if radiculopathy or polyneuropathy appear probable on clinical examination.
