In general, hypokalemia is associated with diagnoses of cardiac disease, renal failure, malnutrition, and shock. Hypothermia and increased blood cell production (for example, leukemia) are additional risk factors for developing hypokalemia. There are subsets of patients that are susceptible to the development of hypokalemia. For instance, psychiatric patients are at risk for hypokalemia due to their drug therapy. Hypokalemia is also prevalent in hospitalized patients, in particular, pediatric patients, those who have a fever and those who are critically ill. Additionally, in developing countries, an increased risk of mortality is observed in children when severe hypokalemia is associated with diarrhea and severe malnutrition.
