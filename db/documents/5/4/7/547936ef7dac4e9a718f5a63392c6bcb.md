Fungal endocarditis rarely occurs in healthy individuals and is associated with immunocompromised states, intravenous drug use, prolonged antibiotic use, and long-term parenteral nutrition. Individuals with prosthetic heart valves or a history of reconstructive cardiac surgery also have a higher risk of fungal endocarditis. Native valve fungal endocarditis can occur in organ transplants recipients on immunosuppressive agents, patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, and patients on long-term glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs.

Candida species are commensal organisms in the gastrointestinal tract, lower genital tract, and oral cavity. They are of less medical importance in an immunocompetent individual due to their inherent low virulence. The risk of candidiasis increases dramatically if the host of immunocompromised due to various reasons.

Aspergillus spp. are ubiquitous organisms in the environment. Renovation of old buildings, including hospitals and contaminated air conditioning systems, may be the source of infection as airborne transmission is common for Aspergillus spp. Extension from pre-existing intra-thoracic foci, venous access devices, or contamination of prosthetic valves is less common.
