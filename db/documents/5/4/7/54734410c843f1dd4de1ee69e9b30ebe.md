Surgical repair remains the mainstay of treatment and is indicated for patients with symptoms of tracheal and/or oesophageal compression or as a supplementary procedure in patients undergoing repair of other cardiothoracic abnormalities.

The principle of surgery is to relieve the vascular compression on the trachea and/or esophagus by the division of the lesser arch. This process occurs under general anesthesia via an ipsilateral muscle-sparing thoracotomy and does not involve cardiopulmonary bypass.

The forth-intercostal space is usually used to gain access to the chest cavity. After retraction of the lung and opening of the pleura, the vascular ring and main adjacent structures such as the esophagus, trachea, phrenic nerve, vagus nerve, and recurrent laryngeal nerve are identified and protected. The location of the arch intended for the division is temporarily occluded to ensure patent blood supply to the vessels supplying the head and lower body. The surgeon then undertakes staged division and oversewing while ensuring hemostasis is maintained. A drain is occasionally left in place to monitor for chylothorax or residual hemorrhage.
