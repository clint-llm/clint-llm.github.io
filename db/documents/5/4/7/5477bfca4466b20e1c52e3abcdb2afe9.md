Assessment of head lag should be a routine part of well child care in the first six months of life. It is essential to properly educate the parents about the timeline of motor developmental milestones. This information helps prevent unnecessary anxiety and intervention by the parents while also keeping them abreast of what to expect and when to see a physician for further evaluation of a pathological head lag. Head lag beyond four months typically requires investigation, and early intervention through home physical therapy, with the parents, actively involved, has been shown to improve outcomes.
