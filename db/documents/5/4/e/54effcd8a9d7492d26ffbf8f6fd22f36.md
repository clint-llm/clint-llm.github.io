The acromioclavicular (AC) joint is a common pain generator in patients presenting with shoulder pain. The incidence of AC joint pain is reported to be roughly 0.5 per 1000/year in primary care.

Patients with non-traumatic AC joint pain are usually older than 40 years of age and will typically present with focal shoulder pain located over the superior aspect of the shoulder.

The most common non-traumatic causes of pain in the AC joint are overuse, degenerative changes, and distal clavicle osteolysis. Conservative management, including physical therapy, activity modification, and NSAIDs, are the first line of treatment.

In patients with chronic AC joint pain refractory to initial management, AC joint injections can be both diagnostic and therapeutic, resulting in significant relief. Providers must remain up to date on the indications, possible complications, and most effective methods of performing this procedure to benefit patients suffering from this condition maximally. This article reviews acromioclavicular (AC) joint injections and highlights the role of the healthcare team in performing this procedure.
