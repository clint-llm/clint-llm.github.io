The prevalence rates of hiatal hernia range from 0.8 to 2.9 in all patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Cameron lesions are seen in 5% of patients with known hiatal hernia discovered on upper endoscopic studies.

Cameron lesions may heal spontaneously within a couple of days, contributing to the underreporting of these lesions. The size of the hiatal hernia correlates directly with the prevalence of these lesions. Since the frequency of hiatal hernia increases with age, most cases are reported in the elderly population.

Most of the cases have been reported from developed countries, including North America and Western Europe. There are few cases reported from Africa, but this could be attributed to underreporting. There has been no correlation with any environmental factors or genetics. Studies have shown that inadequate fiber intake and high sitting position during defecation could be possible risk factors for developing Cameron lesions.
