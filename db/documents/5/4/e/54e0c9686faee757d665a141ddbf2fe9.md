The most common cause ofÂ CHI is a fall, accounting for over 35% of CHI, followed by motor vehicle/traffic injuries. Other causes include acts of violence, industrial injuries, and sports injuries. The possibility of non-accidental trauma, elder abuse, and domestic violence should be considered when evaluating a patient with CHI.
