Acute compartment syndrome is a condition in which there is increased pressure within a closed osteofascial compartment, resulting in impaired local circulation. Without prompt treatment, acute compartment syndrome can lead to ischemia and eventually, necrosis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of acute compartment syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the body parts most commonly affected by acute compartment syndrome and the expected corresponding symptoms.
- Explain how to evaluate a patient for acute compartment syndrome.
- Outline how to treat acute compartment syndrome. 
- Review the need for a well-integrated, well-coordinated interprofessional team approach when caring for patients with acute compartment syndrome.
