The onset of improved critical care has decreased the incidence of stress-induced gastritis. The mainstay of treatment is PPI administration, and the second line is the use of histamine blockers.

PPIs, such as omeprazole, and lansoprazole, are irreversible inhibitors of the H/K ATPase. This results in decreased hydrogen ion secretion regardless of the levels of acetylcholine and gastrin as the drug directly inhibits the enzyme. Patients placed on PPIs will develop a paradoxical elevation in gastrin. Because of this, if the PPI is stopped, this patient will develop an acute increase in acid production. This is secondary to the loss of inhibition of the H/K ATPase, with an artificially elevated level of gastrin.

H2 blockers, such as famotidine, do not affect the H/K ATPase of parietal cells directly. These function to inhibit the histamine-mediated stimulation of parietal cells, thus resulting in decreased phosphorylation and activation of H/K ATPase via protein kinase A.

For this, it is imperative for early administration of acid secretion inhibitors in the form of PPIs and H2 blockers to critically ill patients to prevent stress-induced gastritis. Since the etiology of gastric stress comes from angiotensin, studies are being conducted on how to reduce the effects of angiotensin on the gastric mucosa.
