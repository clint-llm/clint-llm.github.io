Astereognosis indicates a lesion of the contralateral parietal lobe. Small postcentral lesions can produce astereognosis, whereas complete parietal lesions produce hemianesthesia on the contralateral side.

Other etiologies includeÂ ischemic infarction of the parietal lobe.

Astereognosis is associated with the severity of stroke.
