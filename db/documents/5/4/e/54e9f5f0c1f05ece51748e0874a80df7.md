Bethanechol should not be administered to subjects with compromised durability of the urinary bladder wall and GI tract. The agent is also contraindicated if a mechanical obstruction is present or suspected, as the therapeutic effects on the muscular tone of the GI tract and bladder may cause harm as retained urine may reflux back into the kidneys.
