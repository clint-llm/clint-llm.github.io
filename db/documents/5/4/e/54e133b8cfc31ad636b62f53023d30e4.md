Implantable drug delivery systems are usually reserved for patients whose condition is considered chronic and in whom conventional approaches are insufficient or not tolerated.  Patients typically have poor pain control or intolerable side effects on systemic opiates and non-opioid adjuvant therapy.  The implantation of a pump should be part of a treatment sequence based on specific selection criteria.  Although the patient does not need to meet every criterion for implantation, the following should merit consideration:

- The patient has an expected 3 months survival (at least)

- Failed conservative treatments

- Has a trial of neuraxial medication(s) that provides acceptable pain relief (greater than 50%)

- Tolerable side effects

- Functional improvement

- Has favorable spinal anatomy that will allow for spinal catheter placement

- Is both medically and mentally stable without untreated infectious and psychiatric conditions

Intrathecal therapy has been used successfully for chronic cancer pain as well as chronic non-malignant pain.

Cancer indications include primary tumors and metastatic tumors generating pain from tissue invasion, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and radiation-induced nerve injury.  Noncancer indications include failed back surgery syndrome, spinal canal and foraminal stenosis, compression fractures, peripheral neuropathy, truncal pain, axial pain, complex regional pain syndrome, and connective tissue disorders.
