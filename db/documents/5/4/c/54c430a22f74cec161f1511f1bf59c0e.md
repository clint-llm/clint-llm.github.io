Clinicians should consider several differential diagnoses when encountering vaginal bleeding in the setting of pregnancy. Vulvar, vaginal, cervical trauma should be ruled out during a pelvic examination.  Cervical friability can lead to vaginal bleeding which can be caused by cervicitis from an infection or due to premalignant or malignant changes on the cervix. Clinical judgment should determine whether or not the patient should undergo a Pap smear and/or cultures for infection at the time of examination. Other types of abortion should be considered including elective, inevitable, incomplete, complete, septic, and missed abortion
