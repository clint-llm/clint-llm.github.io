The five different types of lipoproteins are chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and HDL. Lipoproteins classify according to their density and composition. Lipoproteins are complex particles that transport lipids, such as phospholipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol, between cells.  HDL, as per its denomination, is the highest density of the lipoproteins, with the highest proportion of proteins to lipids.
