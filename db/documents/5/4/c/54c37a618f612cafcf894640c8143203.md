Orf disease being a zoonotic host-switch illness does not carry a particularly grim prognosis. The lesions are self-limiting, and in immunocompetent patients - symptoms would spontaneously resolve in a 4- to 6-week window.

Most cases rarely require anything more than reassurance and expectant care. However, in immunocompromised hosts, this isn’t always the case. Giant orf can grow to several centimeters, and the resultant morphology may mimic those of tumors and pyogenic granulomata.

Because Orfviridae utilizes a novel viral form of DNA dependent RNA polymerase, topical cidofovir (a potent blocker of the enzyme mentioned above) has found almost ubiquitous use as first-line antiviral therapy, along with mechanical eradication (i.e., cryotherapy, surgical excision, imiquimod, etc.) if needed.

Complications with superinfection and lymphangitis are common; therefore, clinicians often start topical antibiotics prophylactically.

Because of the highly conserved and complex antigenicity of the orf virus, vaccination is particularly effective. Many domesticated sheep and goat populations are routinely vaccinated, with varying levels of success. In humans, recurrence is rare but with diminished severity per incident (as anticipated adaptive immunity).
