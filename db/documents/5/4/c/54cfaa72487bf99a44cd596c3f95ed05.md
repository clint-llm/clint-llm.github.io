Physicians dealing with infertility couples should be prepared to refer patients for genetic counseling, reproductive endocrinology, and assisted reproductive services such as intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization, and ICSI as needed.

Couples with infertility will need support and reassurance. It can be a stressful and challenging time for them, especially if there is family pressure which can be quite intense in some cultures.

Counseling may be needed for some couples, as infertility is frequently associated with psychological distress, sometimes severe. This is particularly important if genetic abnormalities are found.
