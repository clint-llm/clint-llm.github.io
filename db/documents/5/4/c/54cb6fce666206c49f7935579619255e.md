Fifty percent of infants whose deafness results from congenital hearing loss have environmental factors as a cause, and the other 50% have genetic abnormalities causing hearing loss. Seventy percent to 80% of congenital hearing loss is non-syndromic, meaning that it is an isolated finding, with 49% of nonsyndromic cases resulting from a mutation of a gene encoding the gap junction protein connexin 26. Connexins are proteins that form channels to permit the exchange of nutrients and ions between cells. Within the inner ear, connexin 26 helps maintain the appropriate intracellular level of potassium. Disruptions in this protein can result in hearing loss. The remaining 20% of children with congenital hearing loss have syndromic losses associated with other findings.
