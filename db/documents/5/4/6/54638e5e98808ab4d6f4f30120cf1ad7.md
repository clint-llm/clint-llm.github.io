Risk factors of renal infarction are atrial fibrillation, history of a previous embolism, mitral stenosis, hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic cardiac disease, as mentioned in a study by Domanovits.

Another mechanism is a thrombus from the heart in atrial fibrillation, becoming dislodged and eventually occluding the renal artery. All renal segmental arteries are end-arteries, so a complete or partial reduction in vascular flow due to embolic or thrombotic occlusion leads to renal ischemia and infarction with focal tissue necrosis of the kidney. The consequent impairment in renal function can manifest as elevated creatinine levels and decreased glomerular filtration rates (GFR), leading to acute renal injury, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and sometimes end-stage renal failure.

Atheroemboli are more solid and irregular than thrombus-based emboli, but the crystals are smaller. They are, therefore, more likely to produce an incomplete renal arterial blockage than thromboembolic emboli and tend to affect smaller branches.
