Status epilepticus must be addressed quickly and in an organized manner, with simultaneous assessment/management of the airway, breathing, and circulation, while also administering antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. The primary goal of management is to definitively abort seizure activity as rapidly as possible while supporting the patient’s cardiovascular and respiratory status.

- Position the head to maintain an open airway (rapid sequence intubation may be necessary at any point during management if oxygenation or ventilation is impaired).

- Provide supplemental oxygen.

- Initiate monitoring of the heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.

- Obtain vascular access.

- Check a bedside blood glucose and treat hypoglycemia if present. If thiamine deficiency is a possibility, administer thiamine before dextrose.

- Benzodiazepines are the antiepileptic drug of choice for emergent control. Lorazepam is preferred because of its rapid onset of action and is dosed at 0.1 mg/kg IV. No more than 2 mg should be administered per minute. If lorazepam is not available, then diazepam can be used at 0.15 mg/kg IV up to a maximum of 5 mg per minute. A repeat dose may be administered after 3 to 5 minutes if seizures do not resolve following the first dose. Intravenous administration is preferred, but benzodiazepines can be administered via the intramuscular, rectal, nasal, or buccal route if vascular access is not available.

- Antiepileptic drugs should be administered concurrently with benzodiazepines. Choices include fosphenytoin (20 mg/kg phenytoin equivalents [PE] up to 100 to 150 PE/minute, phenytoin (20 mg/kg up to 25 to 50 mg/minute), levetiracetam (40 to 60 mg/kg up to a total of 4500 mg over 15 minutes) and valproic acid (30mg/kg at up to 10 mg/kg/minute) (concern for hepatotoxicity with valproic acid use in children younger than two years).

- If the second dose of benzodiazepines does not abort seizures, then treat as refractory status epilepticus.

- Refractory status epilepticus should be treated with a continuous infusion of an antiepileptic drug. Choices include an intravenous (IV) infusion of midazolam, pentobarbital, thiopental, or propofol (propofol infusion should not be used in children due to the risk of propofol infusion syndrome).

- Magnesium sulfate is indicated for pregnant women with eclampsia.

- A neurologist should be consulted early in the management, simultaneously with the administration of first-line therapy.

All patients with status epilepticus require hospital admission, preferably to the intensive care unit.
