NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) insulin is an insoluble intermediate-acting insulin preparation first created in 1946. The name refers to**N**for neutral,**P**for protamine (a protein), and**H**for its creator scientist name Hans Christian Hagedorn. It is on the list of essential medicines of the World Health Organization (WHO). NPH insulin is FDA-approved in the adult and pediatric population to control type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is currently the most widely used basal insulin that simulates the physiological basal insulin action. Basal insulin provides a constant supply of insulin in the body necessary for glucose regulation despite fasting, such as between meals and overnight. NPH insulin offers a sustained release of insulin over an extended period.

American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend an NPH insulin dose of 0.4 to 1.0 units/kg/day subcutaneously to manage type 1 diabetes mellitus. A higher dose is necessary during medical illness and puberty. A dose of 0.1 to 0.2 units/kg/day subcutaneously is recommended in type 2 diabetes mellitus depending on body weight and the patient’s hyperglycemia. The treatment is individualized, and the NPH insulin dose is titrated accordingly over days to weeks.
