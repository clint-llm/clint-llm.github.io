The majority of individuals with social anxiety disorder will report theÂ onset of symptoms before 20 years old when obtaining a history. Many will report symptoms beginning in early childhood. Social anxiety is a chronic disorder, typically lasting for 6 months or more. Individuals with SAD are more likely to be less educated, unmarried, and have lower socioeconomic status. Additionally, many patients with SAD may not seek treatment because they believe the social anxiety to be part of their personality structure and therefore does not require treatment.
