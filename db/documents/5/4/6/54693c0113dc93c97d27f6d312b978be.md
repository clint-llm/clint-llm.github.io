Idioventricular rhythm is a benign rhythm in most settings and usually does not require treatment with a good prognosis. It usually self-limits and resolves when the sinus frequency exceeds that of ventricular foci and arrhythmia requires no treatment.

In occasional scenarios when there is AV dissociation leading to syncope or sustained or incessant AIVR, the risk of sudden death is increased and arrhythmia should be treated.
