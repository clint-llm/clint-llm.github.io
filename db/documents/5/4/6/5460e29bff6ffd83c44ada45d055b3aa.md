The foramen spinosum approximately measures 2.25 mm in length in newborns and 2.56 mm in adults. In most cases, it is bilaterally present, but in a few individuals, there may be a unilateral or bilateral duplication of the foramen. In some individuals, the foramen spinosum may be smaller than the usual size, or it may be completely absent. Rarely when the foramen spinosum is absent, the middle meningeal vessels and the meningeal branch of the mandibular nerve pass through the foramen ovale. One study found an anomaly in the foramen spinosum in which the foramen appeared “channel-shaped,” providing direct access to the foramen ovale. This anomaly was unilateral and did not seem to have any accompanying abnormalities. Another potential defect in this area occurs when the middle meningeal artery originates directly from the persistent stapedial artery. In these cases, the foramen spinosum is typically either absent or reduced in size.
