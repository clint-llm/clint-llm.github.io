After many years of using anthelmintic MDA to treat and control Ancylostoma and other STH infections, the transmission of these worms is still ongoing. Hence, drug resistance exists. The increasing rates of drug failure and the inability to provide long-term protection raise concern for new ways to manage Ancylostoma and other STH infections, especially in endemic areas. Vaccines that could provide long-term protection and the ability to stop disease transmission have been developed and target several antigens of Ancylostoma species. The availability of the vaccine will be a huge benefit for public health in combating these infections.
