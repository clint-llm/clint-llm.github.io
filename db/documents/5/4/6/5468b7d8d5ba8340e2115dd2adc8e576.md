Children with GSS will ultimately attain a final height that is below the 3rd percentile. Whereas children with CDGP will achieve a final height in the normal range. However, this differentiation may not be absolute.

The height velocity is normal in children with familial (or genetic) short stature. But it is slowed in children presenting with GH or thyroid deficiencies.
