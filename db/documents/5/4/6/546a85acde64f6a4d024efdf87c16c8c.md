Agraphia is an impairment or loss of a previous ability to write. Agraphia can occur in isolation, although it often occurs concurrently with other neurologic deficits such as alexia, apraxia, or hemispatial neglect. Agraphia is an impairment or loss of a previous ability to write and can result from a number of etiologies. When agraphia results from disruptions to neurologic processes directly involved in language, this results in central agraphia, and when agraphia results from the motor output of writing, this results in peripheral agraphia. Proper characterization of agraphia is essential in determining the right treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of agraphia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of agraphia.
- Explain the common physical exam findings associated with agraphia.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with agraphia.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients affected by agraphia.
