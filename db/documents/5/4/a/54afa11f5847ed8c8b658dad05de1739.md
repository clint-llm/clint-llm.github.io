On Giemsa-stained blood smears, P. vivax parasites may be present. Because P. vivax invades erythrocytes, infected RBCs will appear larger than uninfected cells. Trophozoite may appear as thick, large ameboid rings, about one half the diameter of the RBC and Schuffner’s dots are present. P. vivax schizonts contain****12 to 24 merozoites, almost fill the entire cell, and also contain Schuffner’s dots.
