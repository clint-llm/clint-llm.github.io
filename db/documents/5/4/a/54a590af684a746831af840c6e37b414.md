The prognosis of the aortic arch aneurysm largely depends on the size of the lesion as the aneurysm size and rate of expansion are found to be the most significant predictors of the rupture. Prognosis is usually good if timely intervention is instituted before the rupture, which can have mortality as high as 80%, as observed in some studies.
