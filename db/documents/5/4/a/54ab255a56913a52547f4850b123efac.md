Unconsciousness is caused byÂ a temporary or permanent impairment of the bilateral forebrain (thalamus/cerebrum) or reticular activating system of the brainstem. Because of the diverse causes for an unconscious patient, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that consists of a neurologist, internist, intensivist, primary care provider, and neurosurgeon. A systematic evaluation of the unconscious patient is recommended. Because many cases of unconsciousness are reversible, the management of unconscious patients necessitates thorough history-taking, patient evaluation, stabilizing treatment, and diagnostic testing occurring simultaneously. The prognosis of persistently unconscious patients is variable but generally poor. The most consistent prognostic exam findings are neuro-ophthalmologic responses and motor function.

The nurse helps the patient with the absent protective reflexes, elimination, skincare, reorientation to the surroundings, and orientation for the family (problem-oriented approach) to improves outcomes.
