The risk of miscarriage is multivariate, and while some maternal risk factors tend to be more important than others, there is no one predictor of future pregnancy loss. Maternal age is an important predictor of the risk of miscarriage. In women ages, 20 to 30 risk of miscarriage less than 20 weeks gestation is 8.9%. This increases to 74.7% for women over 40 years

Maternal comorbidities such as thrombophilia, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, extremes of maternal weight, and hypertension also increase the risk of miscarriage. Additional maternal risk factors have been identified such as cigarette smoking, large amounts of caffeine use, trauma, and malnutrition.
