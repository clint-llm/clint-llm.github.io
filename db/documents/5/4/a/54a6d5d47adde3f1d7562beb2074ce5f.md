The main benefits of using CO2 for angiography are that CO2 has no adverse effects on the kidneys or the immune system and that it is the least expensive contrast medium.

CO2 can be used for a variety of procedures:

Arteriography

- Renal arteries

- Mesenteric arteries

- Uterine arteries

- Peripheral arteries

Wedged portal venography

- During a transjugular liver biopsy or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation

Venography

- Inferior vena cava filter placement

- Dialysis fistula/shunt repair

- Paravertebral venography during vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty

Given its lower viscosity, when used properly CO2 is theortically less likely than fluid contrast to cause injury to the tissues into which it is infused, such as hepatic capsular rupture in wedged hepatic venography,
