**Airway Patency**

The effect of the extrinsic muscles on the tongue plays a vital role in the patency of the airway. The main muscle responsible for airway dilation is the genioglossus, and if this muscle has decreased function, it can lead to airway constriction or obstruction. However, the role of the tongue retractor muscles (styloglossus and hyoglossus) in ensuring upper airway patency is not fully understood. Some studies have shown that in response to hypoxia and hypercapnia, both the hyoglossus and styloglossus muscles are activated alongside the genioglossus muscle.

Knowledge of how to optimally ensure airway patency is of particular importance in patients with obstructive sleep apnea, as it can help reduce symptoms. One of the newer treatment options offered to select patients with obstructive sleep apnoea is hypoglossal nerve stimulation. As the hypoglossal nerve provides innervation to genioglossus, styloglossus, and hyoglossus, knowing which branches of the hypoglossal nerve to stimulate to optimize airway patency can improve patient outcomes. However, although the co-activation of these muscles has been seen in hypoxia and hypercapnia, studies looking at the ideal placement of electrodes for hypoglossal nerve stimulation have concluded that ensuring the tongue retractors are activated as little as possible resulted in better airway patency.

This result is mainly accomplished by ensuring the lateral division of the hypoglossal nerve was not stimulated as this division had a greater proportion of fibers to the styloglossus and hyoglossus muscle compared to the medial division of the hypoglossal nerve, which mainly resulted in genioglossus muscle contraction.

**Swallowing**

The hyoglossus also plays a key role in swallowing and is especially important in swallowing difficulties due to atypical first and second epiglottic movements. The first epiglottic movement is horizontal, and the second is the full inversion of the epiglottis. It has been suggested that the cause of impairments in these movements may be due to a reduction in both tongue base retraction and elevation of the larynx. In these cases, the hyoglossus, alongside the styloglossus and long pharyngeal muscles, should be the focus for rehabilitation.
