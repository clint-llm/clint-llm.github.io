**Anthracycline-Induced Cardiotoxicity**

- Cardiotoxicity-induced by anthracyclines is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The clinical definition is new-onset heart failure and/or detection of left ventricular dysfunction in exposed individuals; LV ejection fraction is the most commonly used measure.

- Patients at high risk are those receiving any of the following treatments -

- High dose anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin greater than 250 mg/m), high dose radiation therapy (greater than 30 Gy) where the heart is in the radiation field and, lower dose anthracyclines in combination with lower-dose radiation therapy.

- Other risk factors - Age older than 60 years at cancer diagnosis, compromised cardiac function, multiple cardiovascular risk factors including smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and, obesity.

**Antidotes for Anthracyclines**

Tissue necrosis induced by the extravasation of anthracycline can have many complications. Dexrazoxane is an available antidote to tackle the effects of extravasation and may also help prevent the development of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.
