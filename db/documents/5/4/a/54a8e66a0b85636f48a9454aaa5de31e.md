Intraosseous (IO) vascular access refers to the placement of a specialized hollow bore needle through the cortex of a bone into the medullary space for infusion of medical therapy and laboratory tests.

IO success rates are twice as high as intravenous line placement in critical trauma patients without a blood pressure and should have priority over IV placement.

Although IO access is superior in many clinical situations, it is highly underutilized.

IO can be used to administer any substance that is infusible intravenously, but IO use should not be for longer than 24 hours due to an increased risk of complications.

Multiple IO devices are available from manufacturers, and availability varies institutionally. IO is easier than standard venous access and central lines in many situations and acceptable for all age groups, including preterm neonates.
