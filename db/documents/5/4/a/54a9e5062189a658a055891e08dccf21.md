Anteroseptal MI is an electrocardiographic definition. The treatment of ASMI should be like any other acute coronary syndrome. An early invasive intervention strategy for patients with the acute coronary syndrome is usually the most acceptable approach in whom significant coronary vascular obstruction is a known entity. Low-risk patients with ASMI benefit substantially from guideline-directed optimal medical therapy, although this is often suboptimally used. The role of noninvasive imaging modalities is important in patients with acute coronary syndrome at intermediate risk and helps guide the choice of therapies: invasive versus optimal medical therapy.

Newer and more potent antiplatelet therapies in addition to anticoagulant use are always indicated, irrespective of the choice of the treatment strategy. Evidence-based decisions often require a patient-specific tailored approach by comparing the effectiveness of available data from the controlled investigations. an interprofessional heart-team care approach, which includes physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nursing staff, and pharmacists, collaborating to optimize treatment is paramount to achieve the best long-term patient outcomes.
