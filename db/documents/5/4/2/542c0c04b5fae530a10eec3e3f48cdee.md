As the majority of the body's iron is present in RBCs, bleeding from any site can cause iron deficiency. It is the most common cause of iron deficiency in developed countries. Overt causes of bleeding like hematemesis, menorrhagia, multiple pregnancies, and childbirth, etc. can easily be recognized based on history alone. Other causes like occult gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, parasitic infections like hookworm, and frequent blood donations can be easily overlooked. Frequent blood donation is an important cause of iron deficiency, especially in women.

Inadequate dietary intake is rare in developed nations. There are two forms of dietary iron; heme iron, which is present in animal sources, is more readily absorbed by the body than non-heme iron from plant-based foods. People from poor socio-economic backgrounds, vegetarians/vegans, and elderly who do not eat a balanced diet are prone to developing iron deficiency. In toddlers, excessive milk or juice intake, prolonged bottle-feeding, and snacking contributes to iron deficiency.

Malabsorption of iron occurs in celiac disease, atrophic gastritis, Helicobacter pylori infection, and bariatric surgery. Reduced absorption of iron can also present in association with some dietary elements like tannates, phosphates, phytates, oxalates, and calcium.

Certain medications can interfere with iron absorption. Examples include gastric acid-suppressing drugs, antibiotics, levodopa, levothyroxine, ibandronate.

Iron deficiency also occurs in chronic disease conditions like chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic heart failure, inflammatory bowel disease, certain malignancies, and rheumatoid arthritis, etc.

SLC11A2 mutation and IRIDA (iron refractory iron deficiency anemia) due to TMPRSS6 mutation are rare inherited conditions associated with iron deficiency.
