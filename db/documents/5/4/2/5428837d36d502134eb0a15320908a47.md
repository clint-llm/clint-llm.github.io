The patient with a bacterial corneal ulcer will often present with rapid onset of pain, photophobia, and conjunctival injection, and a variable degree of vision loss. On slit lamp exam these ulcers appear as clearly defined infiltrates with stromal inflammation and edema.

The patient with HSV keratitis or corneal ulcer will usually present similarly to the patient with bacterial keratitis. They will often have foreign body sensation, photophobia, conjunctival injection, and blurred vision. Slit lamp exam will classically reveal dendritic lesions with fluorescein uptake.

Fungal infections tend to have a more indolent course and often do not have the impressive conjunctival injection seen with bacterial infections. On slit lamp exam fungal lesions appear as gray-white feathery dry appearing lesions with irregular margins. Ulcers due to yeast appear as superficial, white, raised colonies with clearly defined borders.

The patient presenting with Acanthamoeba keratitis will classically present with pain out of proportion to physical exam findings. Severe photophobia is also common. The exam may reveal diffuse punctate epithelial lesions, dendritic-like lesions, or ring-shaped infiltrates.

Patients presenting with peripheral ulcerative keratitis (PUK) due to an underlying autoimmune disease may already carry a diagnosis or the corneal ulcer may be the first manifestation of the disease.
