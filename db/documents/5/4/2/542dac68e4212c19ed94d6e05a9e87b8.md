In the setting of clinical anesthesia, the carbon dioxide response curve is subject to drastic changes ranging from changes in threshold (left/right shifts) or sensitivity (slope amplification/depression) pending the agents utilized throughout the procedure, ventilation settings, and current health status of the patient, among others (see Figure). In the event of hypoxemia with PaO2 less than 60 mmHg, the CO2 response curve left-shifts, amplifying respiratory drive.

Commonly utilized analgesic medications such as opioids, specifically fentanyl, further dampen the CO2 response curve, causing a right shift (decreased threshold).
