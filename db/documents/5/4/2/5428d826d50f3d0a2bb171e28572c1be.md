Complete spinal cord injuries can be expected to improve one ASIA grade in about 80% of patients, two grades in about 20% of patients, and complete recovery in about 1% of patients at the time of hospital diagnosis.

Below are examples of the level of injury and corresponding functional status:

- **C1-C4:**Ventilator dependent, will need an electric wheelchair with head and chin control

- **C5:**Ventilator independent, has biceps and deltoid function, can flex elbow but lacks wrist supination and extension (unable to feed oneself). Use an electric wheelchair with hand control. They can perform independent activities of daily living (ADLs).

- **C6/C7:**Ability to bring the hand to mouth because of intact wrist extension and supination (able to feed oneself). Independent living, use of a manual wheelchair, and can drive with manual controls.

- **C8/T1:**Improved hand and finger strength/dexterity, independent transfers.
