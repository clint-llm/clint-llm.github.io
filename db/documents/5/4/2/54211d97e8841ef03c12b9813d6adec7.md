Under normal circumstances, when the chyme arrives at the duodenum, both secretin and cholecystokinin are released, leading to secretion of about 1.5 l/day of pancreatic juice containing pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase, and protease), water, and ions (bicarbonate and phosphate). These enzymes are responsible for most of the digestive work in the small intestine.

Chronic pancreatitis is a condition affecting the pancreas where recurrent inflammation results in a replacement of pancreatic tissue by fibrosis; consequently, both endocrine and exocrine functions of the pancreas could be affected.

In cystic fibrosis, epithelial cells in pancreatic ducts could be affected by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that encodes a cAMP-regulated anion channel. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency results from chronic obstructive pancreatitis.

Diabetes mellitus can lead to EPI. It has been noted that the pancreas is smaller in size in patients with type 1 diabetes. This could be secondary to the lack of trophic effect of insulin on acinar cells, autoimmune destruction of islet cells, and reduced pancreatic secretory function due to diabetic neuropathy.

EPI might result from reduced cholecystokinin secretion caused by villous atrophy in celiac disease or milk protein enteropathy patients. Cholecystokinin levels come back to normal after mucosal healing.
