The positive diagnosis of EN is primarily clinical. However, a thorough anamnesis (looking for tuberculous contagion, fever, bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, respiratory problems, dysphagia, etc.) should be conducted as well as a complete clinical examination, always looking for associated signs.

In typical cases, a complementary investigation for positive diagnosis is not necessary. Nevertheless, it finds its place in the etiological diagnosis. Taking into account the above, the etiological assessment of an EN should include examinations according to the clinical orientation.

- Blood count, vital signs, and C-reactive protein (in case of infectious context)

- Mantoux + chest x-ray + interferon-gamma blood test (in case of tuberculous contagion or suspicion of LÃ¶fgren syndrome)

- Throat smear + culture + rapid test - serology: anti-streptolysin O and streptodornase (in case of streptococcal suspicion)

- Viral serology, two samples at four-week intervals (in case of suspicion of virosis)

- Stool and stool examination (in case of diarrhea or digestive symptoms)

- Cutaneous biopsy in atypical cases or in case of doubt
