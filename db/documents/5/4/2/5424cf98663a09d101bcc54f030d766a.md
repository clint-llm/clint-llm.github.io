The cause and trigger of chronic arthritis in JIA remain unclear. Abnormal immune responses triggered by the interactions between environmental factors in a genetically susceptible individual are speculative. Some environmental factors such as antibiotic exposure and C-section deliveries are potential risks; however, breastfeeding and household siblings are possible protectives.

Based on familial aggregation studies and the concordance rate of 25%Â to 40% in monozygotic twins, genetic factors play a significant role.
