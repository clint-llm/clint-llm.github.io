There is no cure for Werdnig-Hoffmann disease.

Nusinersen is a survival motor neuron-2 (SMN2)-directed antisense oligonucleotide, and FDA approved for the treatment of SMA in adult and pediatric patients. It is administered intrathecally. It increases exon 7 inclusion in SMN2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and assists in the production of full-length SMN protein.

The treatment is supportive. Medications that are often used to improve symptoms include phenylbutyrate, valproic acid, albuterol, and hydroxyurea. Unfortunately, clinical trials have not shown any definite evidence that these medications prevent the progression of the disease. Treatment is directed towards symptom control. Symptomatic treatment is aimed at support with feeding, breathing, and motor weakness.

Feeding difficulties: Children often have difficulty with feeding and can have nutritional deficiencies or aspiration pneumonia secondary to swallowing difficulty. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes can help with nutritional supplementation.

Respiratory difficulties: Children may require non-invasive ventilator support initially as respiratory muscles are involved. As symptoms worsen, they may need tracheostomy and ventilator support.

Motor weakness: Physical and occupational therapy can help with muscle stretching, strengthening, and minimizing contractures. Surgical procedures to help with scoliosis and braces may be helpful.
