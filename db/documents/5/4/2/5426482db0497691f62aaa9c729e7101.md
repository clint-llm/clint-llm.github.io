There are three identifiable structures on ultrasound that appear sequentially during the first trimester; the gestational sac, the yolk sac, and the embryonic pole.  The gestational sac appears approximately 30 days following the beginning of the last menstrual cycle.

Appearing within the gestational sac, the yolk sac is a small, circular, hyperechoic ring that appears at about day 35, or between weeks 5 and 6, counted from the beginning of the last menstrual cycle. The yolk sac also grows at about 1 mm per day until about 9 weeks, when it begins to regress.

The embryonic pole first appears as a small linear structure congruent with the yolk sac giving the appearance of a “signet ring.”  This embryonic pole is the first structure that can be measured to obtain the crown-rump length and gives an accurate date to the gestational age. The embryonic pole will develop a cephalic and caudal portion that first appears wrapped or bent tightly to the embryo.  As these begin to unfold and the limbs appear, the first true crown-rump length measurements can be obtained. The differentiation between a fetus and embryo occurs at about 9 weeks when organogenesis has completed, and the developing fetus focuses on maturation and further development of existing structures.
