Pituitary adenomas are responsible for nearly 80% of the cases of Cushing disease.

Harvey Cushing first described this disease in 1912 after he was presented with a unique case in 1910.Â Cushing hypothesized that excess basophil pituitary cells were responsible for his patients presenting symptoms of obesity, amenorrhea, abnormal hair growth, underdevelopment of sexual characteristics, hydrocephalus, and cerebral tension.
