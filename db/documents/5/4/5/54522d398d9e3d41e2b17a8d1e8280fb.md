Given the consequences of traumatic dental injuries on the child and the developing of permanent dentition, there is a need to educate parents, carers, teachers, and healthcare professionals about the need for dental assessment and treatment of injuries to the primary dentition.

Initial first aid management for TDIs in primary dentition may be delivered by pediatricians, nurses, teachers, or caregivers. It is important to stay calm, clean bleeding wounds with saline solution (0.9%) or tap water, stop bleeding wounds by applying pressure with a clean piece of cotton for 5 minutes, and refer to a pediatric dentist for dental injuries.

It is hard to prevent dental injuries; however, management of risk factors, including increased overjet and open bite, should be considered. The cessation of non-nutritive sucking habits should be encouraged before they influence the developing dentition.
