Histopathologic appearance of cicatricial pemphigoid is a subepidermal blister with dermal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with variable numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils. This is nonspecific and can be seen in other immunobullous disorders including bullous pemphigoid, linear IgA bullous dermatosis, and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita.
