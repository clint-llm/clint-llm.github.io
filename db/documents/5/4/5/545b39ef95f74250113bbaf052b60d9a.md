A thorough history of the patient and his/her mother is paramount. Maternal history of past medical conditions, medications, history of abnormal glucose tolerance, or previous adverse pregnancy complications, as well as family history, including that of first-degree relatives with diabetes, is important. Poorly controlled gestational diabetes can also manifest with fetal malformations and complications. It is important to note that there may be other confounders resulting in congenital anomalies, including advanced maternal age, a specific race, or ethnic group, as previously mentioned, and body mass index of more than 25 are high-risk cases for the development of gestational diabetes.

Physical examination of the child at birth is important to assess for birth defects. These infants are also at risk for hypoglycemia and complicated delivery course. Common birth defects identified include neural tube defects, craniofacial defects such as cleft palate, hydrocephaly, microcephaly, micrognathia, anencephaly. Ear and ocular abnormalities include microphthalmia and lens opacity, among other findings. Heart defects are also fairly common in this population, which includes the tetralogy of Fallot or a ventricular septal defect. Spina bifida is a distinct and common finding in these infants.
