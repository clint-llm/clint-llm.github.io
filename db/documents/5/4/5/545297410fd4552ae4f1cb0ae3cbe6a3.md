Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) disorders are most commonly associated with a history of a previous cesarean section. This is likely due to the abnormal placentation secondary to the loss of decidua in the cesarean section scar. However, there are other risk factors associated with placenta accreta, including advanced maternal age and multiparity. Placenta previa is present in approximately 80 percent of placenta accreta cases. Placenta accreta has also been linked to other types of uterine surgery, such as myomectomy, uterine curettage, hysteroscopic surgery, prior endometrial ablation, uterine embolization, and pelvic irradiation.
