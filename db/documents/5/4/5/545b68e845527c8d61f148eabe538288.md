The mammography screening method is not accurate. Data suggests that it can be less sensitive in detecting cancer in mammographically dense breast tissue. Mammography may lead to false-negative results leading to missing cancer when it is present.

Additional treatment is associated with screening, which may not be effective and needed. Those who are screened are more likely to have surgical and radiation therapy.

And the treatment may harm economically, psychologically, physically, or productively. There has been uncertainty in estimating expectancy of life along with decreased quality-adjusted life expectancy due to overdiagnosis.

Depending on the age of initiation, frequency, and cessation of screening, the overall lifetime radiation exposure increases as women have exposure of about 3.7 mGy per digital mammography. They are hence increasing****radiation-induced breast cancer risk of 125 cases per 100,000 women in those aged 40 to 74 years. And thus, an increased number of deaths due to breast cancer screen.

Ultrasonography is generally considered to be a highly operator-dependent modality and supplemental screening test that requires a skilled practitioner, high-quality examination, and state-of-the-art equipment. Given the results of these studies, a prospective, multicenter study is warranted to examine the role of this modality of imaging in breast cancer screening.
