The tibiofibular syndesmosis is very important in ankle stability and transmission of load during gait and other activity. Thus, patients with syndesmotic injury frequently present with ankle instability and difficulty bearing weight, in addition to anterolateral ankle pain.

Two tests are commonly used to assess the syndesmosis on physical exam, including the external rotation test and the squeeze test. The external rotation test involves the patient sitting with the knee flexed to 90 degrees while the foot is gently grasped and rotated laterally with the ankle locked in neutral. This test helps demonstrate the integrity of the syndesmotic ligaments. The squeeze test is performed by placing a thumb on the tibia and fingers on the fibula at the midpoint of the lower leg and subsequently squeezing the tibia and fibula together. This test helps identify a fracture or if the test elicits pain, indicating a positive test.

The most common mechanism for tibiofibular syndesmotic injury is external rotation of the talus, which causes the fibula to separate excessively from the tibia, followed by hyperdorsiflexion of the foot.

The primary goals in managing syndesmotic injury are to restore proper fibular length and ensure a proper position in regards to rotation and proximity of the fibula to the tibia.
