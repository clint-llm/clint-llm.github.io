Screening results will be reported qualitatively: negative or positive, or with some variations. Sometimes, an 'indeterminate' result might be given when results approach the cut-off value. In serum, chromatographic techniques can give quantitative determinations of the specific drugs and metabolites. Several lists exist with therapeutic and toxic concentrations of drugs.

Users of POCT devices should understand any limitations of the devices; a thorough understanding of the sensitivity and specificity is imperative. Device nomenclature can be misleading; some POCT tests labeled 'morphine' detect all opioid medications, including codeine. In addition, in addiction medicine settings, the user must be aware of the possibility of sample adulteration or manipulation.

Again, clear guidelines should be established regarding confirming positive test results using a more sensitive and specific laboratory method, particularly for situations where definitive punitive action will be taken based on the result. In clinical settings where treatment may be based upon unconfirmed results, staff using the data should be educated concerning the limitations of the testing.
