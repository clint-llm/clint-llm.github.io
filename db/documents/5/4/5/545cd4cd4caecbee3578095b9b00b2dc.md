Scanning electron microscopy can also provide a more detailed three-dimensional examination of stratum corneum. Skin biopsies of the cells are first coated with a carbon layer and then mounted onto glass slides. Under the microscope, the clarity of the cells' surface characteristics like grooves, folds, and convolutions can help differentiate healthy individual stratum corneum cells from their pathological counterparts, such as psoriatic cells and bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma.
