Injury to the distal ulnar nerve may occur through compression, inflammation, trauma, or vascular insufficiency.

- Ganglion Cyst

- The hook of hamate Fracture/Displacement

- Tumors (e.g., lipoma)

- Repetitive trauma (e.g., Cyclist's handlebar external compression)

- Aberrant Muscle (e.g., abductor digiti minimi) or excess fat tissue within the canal

- Ulnar artery thrombosis or aneurysm (e.g., Hypothenar Hammer Syndrome)

Hypothenar Hammer Syndrome (HHS) is a unique mechanism of ulnar nerve injury secondary to ulnar artery thrombosis or an aneurysm, which results in inflammation and subsequent compression of the ulnar nerve at the Guyon canal. The etiology of hypothenar hammer syndrome is similar to that of Guyon canal syndrome where repetitive trauma to the hypothenar area eventually results in injury to the ulnar artery.

Some studies estimate that 30% to 40% of Guyon canal syndromes result from ganglion cysts. Another study estimates 45% of cases to be idiopathic.
