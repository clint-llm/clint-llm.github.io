Alveoli represent the most distal portion of the respiratory tract. There are approximately 500 million alveoli in the human body.

- Type 1 pneumocytes

- Type 2 pneumocytes

- Alveolar macrophages

**Type I pneumocytes**cover 70% of the internal surface of each alveolus. These cells are thin and squamous, ideal for gas exchange. They share a basement membrane with pulmonary capillary endothelium, forming the air-blood barrier where gas exchange occurs. These pneumocytes joined one another and other alveolar cells by tight junctions, forming an impermeable barrier to limit the infiltration of fluid into the alveoli.

**Type II pneumocytes**cover 7% of the internal surface of each alveolus. These cells have a mean volume that is half that of the type I pneumocyte with apical microvilli. Within their cytoplasm are characteristic lamellar bodies containing a surfactant, a substance secreted that decreases the surface tension of alveoli.

**Alveolar macrophages**are mononuclear phagocytes that are residents in alveoli. They derive from blood monocytes. The cell membrane of these cells can utilize a network of microtubules to change shape during chemotaxis or phagocytosis.
