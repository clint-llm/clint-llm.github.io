Case management encompasses a wide range of activities; therefore, it is challenging to define case management as a discrete intervention precisely. Besides, the definitional variability of case management and the clinical setting in which case management occurs is also ample. Lukersmith et al., in their review of 79 articles, identified a variety of service sectors and service settings that utilize case management.

Depending on the service sector and the service setting, case management occurs across a continuum of involvement ranging from a relatively brief episodic type interaction that might be offered to a patient during and after an inpatient orthopedic procedure to a much more holistic, longitudinal interaction as might occur in the context of a patient with a severe mental health disorder who is served by a community-based organization over many years.

The evolving and expansive nature of what to include in case management has led to variability definitions and variability in what constitutes a case management intervention. This ambiguity is often observable in the literature. Hudon et al. conducted a systematic analysis involving 21 articles and 89 other related documents and identified at least five different service delivery configurations classified as case management in the healthcare setting.
