Septic shock is a serious illness and despite all the advances in medicine, it still carries high mortality which can exceed 40%. Mortality does depend on many factors including the type of organism, antibiotic sensitivity, number of organs affected, and patient age. The more factors that match SIRS, the higher the mortality. Data suggest that tachypnea and altered mental status are excellent predictors of poor outcomes. Finally, prolonged use of inotropes to maintain blood pressure is also associated with adverse outcomes. Even those who survive are left with significant functional and cognitive deficits.
