**Preparation and Positioning**

The patient is laid supine with head secured in a Mayfield head holder. Catheterization is mandatory for accurate fluid balance management, especially with the risk of diabetes insipidus. Topical vasoconstrictive agents are used to decongest both nasal cavities. The abdomen and/or thigh are prepared as a graft donor site. In cases using the endoscopic technique, the navigation transmitter is attached to the patient’s forehead, and the patient is registered.

**Nasal Stage**

**Endoscopic Endonasal Transsphenoidal Approach**

Bilateral nasal cavities are decongested, and anatomical obstructions, such as a deviated nasal septum or concha bullosa, are corrected. A medial corridor between the nasal septum and middle turbinate is widened by lateralizing the latter. A pedicled septal flap, popularly known as Hadad Bassegastegay flap and based on the posterior nasal artery, can be raised if extended pituitary approaches are anticipated.

**Microscopic Sublabial Transsphenoidal Approach**

The gingival mucosa and nasal mucosa are infiltrated with a local anesthetic containing a vasoconstrictor. Sublabial incision is made from one canine fossa to the other, followed by subperiosteal dissection to expose the piriform aperture and the rostrum of the maxilla. Mucoperichondrium and mucoperiosteum from one side of the nasal septum and nasal floor are elevated, and the quadrangular cartilage is disarticulated from the vomer and perpendicular plate of the ethmoid. A handheld retractor is introduced, and the elevated mucosa is retracted laterally to expose the rostrum of the sphenoid. Once the sphenoid ostia are identified, a self-retaining Hardy bivalve speculum is introduced, allowing bimanual instrumentation henceforth. The operative microscope is employed now to improve magnification. The rostrum is resected now with rongeurs to gain access into the sphenoid sinus.

**Microscopic Transnasal Transsphenoidal Approach**

This approach is through a single nostril to reach the sphenoid sinuses. An incision is made at the posterior and inferior margin of the quadrangular cartilage. After submucosal dissection, quadrangular cartilage is disarticulated at its posterior margin, and a bivalve speculum is introduced. Subsequent steps are similar to the sublabial approach. While this approach offers advantages like lesser soft tissue dissection, better cosmesis, lesser postoperative morbidity, and no upper jaw numbness, it can be a difficult approach in patients with a small nostril, necessitating an alotomy or external rhinoplasty incision, which can lead to scarring or nasal deformities.

**Sphenoid Stage**

Sphenoid sinus mucosa is stripped off to prevent postoperative mucocele formation and prevent further mucosal bleeding. Inter-sinus septations are removed carefully with a diamond drill or rongeur. Medial and lateral OCRs, anterior genu of carotid arteries, and optic nerve need to be identified, and their location limits the exposure of sella. Using diamond burr, bone over the sella is ‘egg-shelled’ and fractured. A Kerrison punch can be used to remove the bone, to expose the underlying dura from one carotid artery canal to the opposite canal, and from planum sphenoidale to the clivus.

**Sellar Stage**

Dura is opened with a U-shaped or cruciate incision to expose the fossa. The normal pituitary gland is yellow and solid, while the tumor appears amorphous and white. An extracapsular resection of the tumor should be attempted. The tumor delivery is often facilitated by the CSF pulsations through an intact arachnoid from above. The angle between the arachnoid and the carotid artery needs to be ascertained. The arachnoid (diaphragma sella) is the limit of superior and posterior dissection. In the case of the parasellar extension, 30-degree endoscopes are used to ensure comprehensive clearance. The pituitary fossa is filled with gel foam paste, and the dura is reposited back. The mucosal flaps are placed over the dura, fixed with a surgical cellulose product and a layer of fibrin glue.

**Reconstruction Options**

Regardless of the reconstructive material, a multilayer closure and complete defect coverage are critical. The edges of the defect must be denuded of mucosa to prevent mucocele formation and promote graft revascularization. Free tissue grafts are commonly used to reconstruct small to moderate skull base defects (i.e., <1 cm) and for low-flow CSF leaks. Fascia lata or collagen matrix is used as a subdural or epidural inlay graft as the first layer of closure. A subsequent layer of onlay graft is then bolstered with a free fat graft, harvested from the abdomen, or a free fascial graft. These layers are finally supported with a non-absorbable gelatin sponge or the balloon of a Foley catheter.
