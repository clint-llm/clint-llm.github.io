Doxorubicin is one of the cytotoxic anthracycline agents derived from Streptomyces spp. The anthracycline class of agents has similar mechanisms of action and works by intercalating between the DNA base pairs causing uncoiling of the DNA helical structure. This action causes inhibition of DNA synthesis and affects the activity of DNA topoisomerase II.

Doxorubicin is a major substrate of cytochrome P450, CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and P-glycoprotein (Pgp). Several clinically significant interactions have been reported with other inhibitors of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, and/or Pgp that can increase doxorubicin concentration, resulting in more or worsening side effects and toxicity at lower levels dosages.
