Glanders is rare in humans, but those in close contact with infected solipeds such as horses, mules, and donkeys may become infected. The bacteria enter through the eyes, nose, mouth, or wounds in the skin. Burkholderia mallei is an obligate mammalian pathogen and must cause the disease to be transmitted between hosts. Melioidosis may present in an acute form with an incubation period of one day to three weeks. However, latent melioidosis may not present for decades. Melioidosis often infects those with underlying risk factors such as diabetes, kidney disease, alcohol abuse, and thalassemia, although healthy patients may also contract the disease. Burkholderia pseudomallei live in soil and water, and patients almost always report exposure to mud or pools of water.
