Different brands of metolazone are not therapeutically equivalent. FDA labeling recommended not to interchange formulations of metolazone.

Therapy is contraindicated in those with known metolazone hypersensitivity. Although this medication is a thiazide-like diuretic, cross-reactivity is rarely seen between metolazone and other diuretics.

Anuric patients should have metolazone withheld. As the kidneys excrete metolazone, renal impairment can cause a dangerous accumulation of the metolazone. Metalozone is safe to use in mild to moderate renal impairment, unlike other thiazide diuretics, but extreme caution should be used in those with severe renal impairment or anuria. Concurrent electrolyte imbalance is a contraindication to metolazone therapy, as these should be corrected before initiating metolazone.

Drug-Drug Interactions: Metolazone should be avoided in patients on lithium and digitalis as it can aggravate lithium and digitalis toxicity.
