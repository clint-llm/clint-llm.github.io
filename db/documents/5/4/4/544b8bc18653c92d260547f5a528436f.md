The primary lesions of EMPD are erythematous and scaly plaques, usually well delineated, and measure around several centimeters. One may observe crusting, weepy erosions or even ulcerations at a later stage. Scattered areas of erosion and white scale can give rise to a “strawberries and cream” appearance. The involved areas usually slowly expand, with a sharp demarcation between normal and involved skin. The lesions in EMPD can be nonspecific [commonly misdiagnosed as an inflammatory or infective skin condition (eczema, psoriasis, candidiasis)] and multiple topical therapies are often applied before the diagnosis is made. A median delay of 2 years in proper diagnosis has been reported. The most common presenting symptom in extramammary Paget disease is pruritus, but burning, tenderness, and edema may be experienced as well. Lesions occasionally show hypopigmentation or hyperpigmentation. Long-standing lesions may be modified by repeated trauma/excoriation or superimposed infection.

Hard nodules and regional lymph node enlargement may develop, resulting from the presence of an underlying carcinoma. ‘Underpants-pattern erythema’ is a specific clinical aspect of genital extramammary Paget disease starting in the groin and spreads peripherally to areas covered by underwear. This particular pattern is due to invasion of the lymphatic system by tumor and has an ominous prognosis, since it is associated with rapidly fatal distant metastases.
