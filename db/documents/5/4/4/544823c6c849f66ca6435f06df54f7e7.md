Leukocoria means ‘white pupil.’ Leukocoria is an abnormal pupillary reflex usually more prominent after pupillary dilation. It is often the first sign of a range of serious intraocular disorders. Leukocoria is commonly seen in congenital cataracts, Coats disease, retinoblastoma, retinopathy of prematurity, toxocariasis, Norrie disease, retrolental fibroplasia, and other disorders. Immediate diagnosis and management are mandatory as most conditions are vision-threatening, and retinoblastoma may be life-threatening. Immediate referral to an ophthalmologist, an interdisciplinary liaison with a pediatric ophthalmologist, retina specialist, and ocular oncologist will help in the management of eyes with leukocoria in an appropriate manner.
