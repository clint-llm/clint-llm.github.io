Chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and targeted therapy are the systemic therapies used in breast cancer management. A 25 percent reduction in the risk of relapse over a 10 to 15-year period using a first-generation chemotherapy regimen such as cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) in a 6-month cycle. Anthracyclines (doxorubicin or epirubicin) and the newer agents such as the taxanes are modern regimens used for breast cancer. Three to 6-month period is used for adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant treatment of early-stage HR+ breast cancer with tamoxifen for at least 5 years has been shown to reduce the recurrence rate by about half throughout the first 10 years and reduces breast cancer mortality by about 30% throughout the first 15 years.

More recently, studies have shown that extended use of adjuvant tamoxifen (10 years versus 5 years) further reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality, so clinical practice guidelines now recommend consideration of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy for 10 years. The mainstay of treatment for most premenopausal women with HR+ tumors is tamoxifen. Some women may also benefit from surgical removal (oophorectomy) or chemical suppression of the ovaries, which are the main source of estrogen before menopause. Treatment guidelines recommend aromatase inhibitors (AIs) such as anastrozole should usually be included in the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+ breast cancer. Targeted therapy is usually indicated in about 17% of breast cancers that overproduce the growth-promoting protein HER2/neu. Trastuzumab, the first approved drug, is a monoclonal antibody that directly targets the HER2 protein. It reduces the risk of recurrence and death by 52% and 33%, respectively, if combined with chemotherapy in HER2+ early breast cancer if compared to chemotherapy alone.
