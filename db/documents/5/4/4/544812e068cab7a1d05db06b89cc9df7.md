In a world of evolving disease, accidental industrial or commercial contamination, as well as foreign and domestic terrorism, emergency providers must be able to provide safe and efficient resuscitation procedures to victims while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Contamination events can take the form of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats (CBRN) that are often compounded by explosions and trauma (ET). This activity describes resuscitation during contamination and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for PPE during resuscitation.
- Describe the PPE equipment used during the resuscitation of contaminated patients.
- Review the clinical relevance of PPE during resuscitation.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination of contaminated patients.
