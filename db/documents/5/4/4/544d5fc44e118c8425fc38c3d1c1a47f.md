The femoral nerve block includes motor and sensory nerves. Patients will exhibit difficulty with mobility due to the weakness of the quadriceps muscle. Mitigation of this motor weakness is achievable by using a reduced concentration of local anesthetics. Importantly, patients should not be ambulating without assistance following femoral nerve block as they may be at risk for falling.
