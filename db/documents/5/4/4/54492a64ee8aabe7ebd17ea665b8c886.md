- Solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura are usually benign and originate from the lining around the lungs called the pleura.

- The main treatment is surgery to remove the tumor. In some cases, part of the lung is removed during surgery if the tumor is near the lungs.

- Symptoms will improve after surgical removal of the tumor.

- The tumor can reoccur after surgery.

- Most patients will need another surgery to remove the recurring tumor and, in some cases, radiation treatment.

- Smoking has not been linked to solitary fibrous tumors, but it helps to discontinue smoking to reduce to risk of lung cancer and improve recovery after surgery.
