If the lesion is superficial, then a solo healthcare provider may perform the fine-needle aspiration by themself. As with many minor procedures, it may still be helpful to have an assistant available in case extra supplies or an extra set of hands become necessary.

If the procedure is to be performed laparoscopically, endoscopically, or percutaneously then the additional personal necessary to anesthetize and monitor the patient will also be required.
