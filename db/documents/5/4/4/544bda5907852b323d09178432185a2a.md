The gingiva, also known as the gums, is the pink-colored keratinized mucosa that surrounds and protects the teeth. It is perfused by multiple small arteries that originate from branches coming off of the carotid artery. It receives innervation by nerves derived from the mandibular and maxillary divisions of the trigeminal nerve. The gingiva is part of the periodontium, which includes the investing and supporting structures of the teeth. Additionally, signs of systemic disease frequently manifest in the mouth, and poor oral gingival health can worsen many systemic conditions. This article provides a comprehensive review of the anatomical features and embryological origins of the gingiva. Physiological variants in the gingiva and key surgical and clinical considerations are also covered.
