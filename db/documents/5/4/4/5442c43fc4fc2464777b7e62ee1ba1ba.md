Membranous nephropathy (MN), also known as membranous glomerulopathy, is one of the many glomerular diseases causing nephrotic syndrome. It is characterized by proteinuria, presenting with peripheral edema and frothy urine. The etiology can be primary or secondary. A kidney biopsy is used to confirm the diagnosis of membranous nephropathy. Immunosuppressive therapy plays a major role in the treatment of this disease. This activity highlights the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, histological findings, diagnosis, and management of this condition and highlights the importance of an interprofessional team in improving outcomes in patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of membranous nephropathy.
- Describe the various clinical findings that are typical of membranous nephropathy.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with membranous nephropathy.

- Review the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with membranous nephropathy.
