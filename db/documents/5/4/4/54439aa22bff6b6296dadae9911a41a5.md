Advance directives fall primarily under the medical ethics concept of autonomy or self-determination. Other ethical concepts such as beneficence (do good for the patient), nonmaleficence/non-malfeasance (do no harm), and distributive justice (appropriate distribution of finite resources) are also involved.

End-of-life scenarios can introduce conflict between these ethical principles. Advance directives serve as written instructions to allow the patient to express their wishes and retain some control of their treatment plan in the event they may be incapacitated near the end of life. This is based on the concept of precedent autonomy or following the patient's directives documented at an earlier time when they still possessed capacity.

Additional ethical complexities arise when the patient is a child or has advanced dementia.

Congress enacted the Patient Self Determination Act in 1990, which mandated that healthcare institutions receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds provide patients with information regarding their right under state law to be involved in decisions regarding their own medical treatment. It also mandates that patients be asked if they have advanced directives or be given information regarding advance directives and that the advance directives be implemented if necessary as long as they are compliant with state law.
