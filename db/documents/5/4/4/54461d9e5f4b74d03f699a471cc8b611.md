When internal hemorrhoids prolapse, they can become incarcerated and strangulated. Patients present with acute pain and may have urinary retention. Urgent treatment with excision hemorrhoidectomy is the treatment of choice.

Rectal varices can be seen in patients with portal hypertension but note that this is a distinct entity to hemorrhoids.

It is preferable to manage hemorrhoids in pregnancy medically and only perform operative therapy in severe cases such as a strangulated internal hemorrhoid.

One should exercise caution when considering operative management for hemorrhoids in patients with Crohn disease because of the subsequent prolonged wound healing and ulceration.

Complications of hemorrhoidectomy include bleeding (severe bleeding occurs in less than 5% of cases), urinary retention (0.2 to 36%), infection (0.2 to 6%), fecal incontinence (2 to 12%), fecal impaction (0.4%), and anal stenosis (0 to 6%).
