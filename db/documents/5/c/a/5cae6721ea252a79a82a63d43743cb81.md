The success of lipid-lowering medications to prevent cardiovascular events depends on the patient's medication adherence. It is common for patients to stop taking statins when they start to experience muscle aches. It is critical to reiterate the need for patients to continue statins in these situations. Alternatives such as switching to a different statin, adding coenzyme Q10, or an alternate day dosing is an option, which has demonstrated to help to a certain extent.

Lipid-lowering therapy is best delivered by an interprofessional team consisting of physicians (both primary care and cardiologist), pharmacist, and cardiovascular specialty trained nursing staff to guide and monitor the therapeutic course and ensure the best possible patient outcomes. [Level V]

In patients with severe HTG, particularly triglyceride levels greater than 1000 mg/dL, fibrate therapy and/or niacin and fish oil can be useful to lower triglycerides to under 500 mg/dL and to help reduce the risk of pancreatitis. Intravenous insulin can help to prevent pancreatitis in the hospital.

FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk) study showed no mortality benefit but lowered the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke.

IMPROVE-IT found in a follow-up of 6 years that patients with an acute coronary syndrome randomized to ezetimibe/simvastatin had a lower rate of cardiovascular events than those randomized to simvastatin alone.

A recent 2018 Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT) trial used 2 g of icosapent ethyl twice daily (4 g daily). The patients in the study had established atherosclerotic heart disease or other risk factors such as diabetes and were already on pre-existing statin therapy with residual hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride level 135 to 499 mg/dL). The intervention group was associated with an absolute 4.8% reduction in cardiovascular events and a 0.9% absolute reduction in cardiovascular death at 4.9 years.

Fish oil (omega-3 fatty acids) is a common supplement used to prevent cardiovascular events, but a recent large randomized controlled study showed no benefit of omega-3 fatty acids in the incidence of major cardiovascular events.
