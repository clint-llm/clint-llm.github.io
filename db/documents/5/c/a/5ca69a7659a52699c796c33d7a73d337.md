The diagnosis of acute rejection is based on clinical data including the patient's symptoms and signs and confirmed by laboratory studies of blood and a tissue biopsy. After a few days or weeks of successful transplantation surgery, the patient complains about tenderness at the site of the graft and pyrexia. There may be an abnormal function of the organ or tissue graft, for example, in renal transplantation, this presents as anuria, an increasing serum creatinine levels, and metabolic problems including hyperkalemia.

A rejected pancreas may manifest by the production of only a small amount of insulin, which is not sufficient for healthy glucose metabolism. A rejected lung shows hypercapnia and hypoxia. Acute rejection can be associated with a high incidence of infections and other complications such as the lethal graft-versus-host disease. A single episode of acute rejection is diagnosed and promptly treated, often preventing organ or tissue failure, but the recurrence can lead to chronic rejection.
