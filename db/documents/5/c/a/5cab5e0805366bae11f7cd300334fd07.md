There are studies evaluating the differences among methods of vascular access for ultrafiltration that are done long term and intermittently. Issues related to cost and technical difficulty should be considered when choosing the access site. Central venous access is required with a preference for internal jugular access. Access, especially long-term, for UF patients increases the risks of adverse events. An arteriovenous communication is usually used in chronic dialysis patients but is also used in UF and can be associated with an increased risk of high output HF and right ventricular HF. Peritoneal dialysis access is also an option but can cause a rare complication of peritonitis.
