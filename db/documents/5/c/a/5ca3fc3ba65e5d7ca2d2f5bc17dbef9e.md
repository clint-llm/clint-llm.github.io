Otalgia (ear pain) divides into two broad categories: primary and secondary otalgia. Primary otalgia is ear pain that arises directly from pathology within the inner, middle, or external ear.  Secondary or referred otalgia is ear pain that occurs from pathology located outside the ear. A complex neural network innervates the ear as a result of complex embryologic development. The ear shares this neural network with other organs, which leads to numerous potential causes of referred ear pain.

Cranial nerves V (trigeminal), VII (facial), IX (glossopharyngeal), X (vagus), and branches from the cervical plexus (C2 and C3) all innervate the ear.

- The auricle is innervated by cranial nerves V, VII, X, C2, and C3.

- The ear canal is innervated by cranial nerves V, VII, and X.

- The tympanic membrane is innervated by cranial nerves VII, IX, and X.

- The middle ear is innervated by cranial nerves V, VII, and IX.

Cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X, C2, and C3 also innervate organs outside of the ear, leading to numerous potential causes of referred ear pain.

- Cranial nerve V (trigeminal) is composed of the ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2), and mandibular (V3) branches.  It provides sensory innervation for the face, sinuses, palate, and teeth.  The auriculotemporal branch of cranial nerve V innervates the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). This branch is most commonly implicated in temporomandibular joint disease. Dental and TMJ pathology are common secondary causes of otalgia.

- Cranial nerve VII (facial) innervates the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, sublingual, and submandibular salivary glands.  It also innervates the muscles of facial expression.

- Cranial nerve IX (glossopharyngeal) innervates the posterior third of the tongue, carotid body, and oropharynx.

- Cranial nerve X (vagus) innervates the sinuses, thyroid gland, pharynx, and larynx.  The superior laryngeal branch of the vagus nerve innervates the vocal cords.  It also innervates distant organs such as the heart, lung, and parts of the gastrointestinal tract.

- C2 and C3, which are branches of the cervical plexus, innervate the back of the head, sternocleidomastoid, and cervical paraspinal muscles.
