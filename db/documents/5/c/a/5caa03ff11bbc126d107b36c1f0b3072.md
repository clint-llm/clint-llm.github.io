**Recommended dose:**

Empagliflozin is an oral medication dosed at either 10 mg daily or 25 mg daily. The recommended dose is 10 mg once daily in the morning, taken with or without food. If tolerated initially, dosing may increase up to 25 mg. Correct volume depletion, if present, before starting the drug.

**In patients with renal impairment:**

No dose adjustment is necessary if eGFR is ≥ 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2, but precautions are necessary if it falls below this level.
