As mentioned in the previous sections, it is important to discuss with parents if and when surgery is necessary. Surgery is indicated for syndactyly if it is felt the function of the affected extremity can be improved. It is also important to educate parents that delaying the surgery until the patient is older will improve outcomes unless specific situations, as previously discussed, are involved (border digit involvement and multiple fused digits). Although repeat surgery is relatively uncommon, it is important to discuss with the family complications such as scar formation and contracture, webspace creep, possible devascularization of the digit, and digital nerve injury.
