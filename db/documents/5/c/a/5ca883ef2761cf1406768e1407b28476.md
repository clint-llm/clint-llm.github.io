Surgical approaches to the carpus can be divided into general and specific carpal exposures. General exposures, done either from a dorsal approach or a volar approach, provide broad exposure to large areas of the wrist and allow surgeons access to pathology that involves multiple joints or carpal bones. Specific exposures provide limited exposure and permit access to a single bone, most commonly the scaphoid, or joint for situations where the diagnosis is clear and management is precise.

Because of the proximity between the deep structures of the hand and the carpus, surgical approaches to the hand and wrist require meticulous care. Close attention to the anatomical relationship between important ligaments, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels begins with the initial skin incision. The design of the incision must consider the intimacy between these structures to avoid damage to integral components of the hand and wrist. These include the sensory nerves to the hand that make up much of the sensory homunculus, the creases of the skin to prevent contracture, the blood supply to the skin or skin flaps for primary wound healing, and even the cosmetics of the hand for the sake of the patient.
