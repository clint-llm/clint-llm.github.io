Malignant hyperthermia is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by skeletal muscle hypermetabolism following exposure to halogenated anesthetics, depolarizing muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine, or, occasionally, physiologic stressors. The gene for the ryanodine receptor RYR1 is the primary site for mutations linked with malignant hyperthermia. Other genetic loci have been identified, such as CACNA1S and STAC3, as causative for malignant hyperthermia.

The uncontrolled release of calcium from the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum leads to sustained muscle contraction. The sustained muscle contraction produces a depletion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and dramatically increases oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and heat. The depletion of ATP stores leads to membrane integrity failure and cell content leakages such as potassium, creatinine kinase, and myoglobin into the circulation.
