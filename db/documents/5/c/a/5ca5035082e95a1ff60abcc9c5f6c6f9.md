Adductor Canal Block

- Peripheral nerve blocks are becoming increasingly common in the management of postoperative pain. An ideal block provides adequate analgesia while maintaining motor function.

- An adductor canal block (ACB) involves the injection of local anesthetic into the adductor canal to provide analgesia for surgeries of the knee, ankle, and foot.

- The human knee receives innervation by two groups of sensory nerves: an anterior group and a posterior group. A properly performed ACB anesthetizes the anterior group of sensory nerves without affecting motor nerves and can be used in conjunction with another block to target the posterior nerve group. The sparing of motor nerves following knee surgery, such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA), accelerates postoperative ambulation, and likely improves recovery.

- Knowledge of the exact location of the adductor canal is crucial in performing a correct ACB; multiple studies demonstrated that “estimating” the location of the adductor canal often resulted in a femoral triangle block (FTB). An FTB is not motor-sparing because it often leads to weakness of the quadriceps muscles, which may be inferior to an ACB in some clinical situations.
