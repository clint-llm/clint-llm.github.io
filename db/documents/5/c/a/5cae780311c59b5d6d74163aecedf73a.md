Maintenance of weight loss in patients with obesity or who are overweight remains a difficult objective. Clinicians should utilize a multidisciplinary approach to gain maximum benefit for the patient. Treatment should involve input from medical, nutrition, and physical therapy experts to provide detailed and patient-oriented PA and diet plans.

In cases where weight loss maintenance has been unsuccessful with diet and exercise plans, referral for assessment of bariatric surgery may be appropriate.

Increased PA has been shown to improve weight loss and maintenance of weight loss when combined with calorie restriction.

Little evidence from well-designed randomized controlled trials shows PA will promote maintenance of weight loss independently of calorie restriction. However, several prospective cohort studies have produced results that indicate PA is beneficial in weight loss maintenance.
