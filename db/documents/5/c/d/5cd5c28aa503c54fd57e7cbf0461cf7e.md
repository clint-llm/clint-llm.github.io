The corticospinal tract controls primary motor activity for the somatic motor system from the neck to the feet. It is the major spinal pathway involved in voluntary movements. The tract begins in the primary motor cortex, where the soma of pyramidal neurons are located within cortical layer V. Axons for these neurons travel in bundles through the internal capsule, cerebral peduncles, and ventral pons. They stay in the ventral position within the medulla as the pyramids. A majority of the axons cross the midline at the pyramidal decussation between the brainstem and spinal cord to form the lateral corticospinal tract (Figure 1A). This crossover causes the left side of the brain to control the right side of the spinal cord and the right side of the brain to control the left side of the spinal cord. A small number of axons remain on the ipsilateral side to form the anterior corticospinal tract. Axons of both anterior and lateral corticospinal tracts move into the gray matter of the ventral horn to synapse onto lower motor neurons. These lower motor neurons exit the spinal cord to contract muscle.
