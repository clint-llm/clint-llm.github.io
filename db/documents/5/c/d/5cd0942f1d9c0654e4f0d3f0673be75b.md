It is recommended that physicians take the following steps in the management of such a patient:

- Create a list of complaints with priorities, and accentuate HPI and physical examination during the evaluation.

- Evaluate the patient’s symptoms while providing patient education

- Order imaging and diagnostic testing based on findings of the physical exam; if a physical exam is normal, additional testing is not required

- Minimize the use of medications with dependency potential, especially short-acting medications that are used as needed.

- Reduce the use of passive modalities options for therapy.

- Schedule the patient's visits routine instead of as needed visits.

- Effectively treat any comorbid axis I (i.e., major psychiatric) disorders.

- Include cognitive therapy within the treatment plan
