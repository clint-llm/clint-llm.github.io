Procedures within the thoracic cavity risk injuring or obstructing the duct which could result in chylothorax. The long course of the thoracic duct predisposes it to traumatic injury during thoracic, cardiac, or head and neck surgeries. Frequent physiologic variants also make avoiding the duct during surgery somewhat difficult. The thoracic duct is particularly vulnerable to trauma during esophageal surgery. Certain noninvasive procedures also risk iatrogenic duct injury such as a central line placement. Occlusion of the thoracic duct also results in chylous extravasation although this is much less common compared to injury.

Dietary changes, including decreasing intake of fat and increasing intake of medium chain triglycerides, can be used as an initial conservative approach to treating low chyle output of less than 1 L/day. Bowel rest and lipid-free total parenteral nutrition is another option. If chyle output is over 1 L/day, thoracic duct ligation or percutaneous embolization must be considered.
