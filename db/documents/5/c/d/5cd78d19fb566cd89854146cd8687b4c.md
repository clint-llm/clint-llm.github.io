The fifth metacarpal bone is one of the five metacarpal bones of the hand. The fifth metacarpal is associated with the fifth digit. The metacarpal bone consists of a head (distally located), neck, body, and base (proximally located). Axial load via direct trauma to a clenched fist transfers energy to the metacarpal bone, causing fractures most commonly at the neck, and typically resulting in apex dorsal angulation due in part to the forces exerted by the pull of the interosseous muscles. The interosseous muscles, responsible for adduction and abduction of the fingers, originate from the metacarpal shafts and insert onto proximal phalanges. The collateral ligaments also join the metacarpal bones to the proximal phalanges and must be taken into consideration during splinting to minimize the risk of loss of motion due to shortening of the ligaments. The ligaments are taut in flexion, and more slack in extension, therefore the MCP joints should be splinted in flexion to prevent shortening (intrinsic plus positioning)
