Early diagnosis is essential since oral melanomas show a very aggressive evolution with a poor prognosis. However, there are still no criteria to aid the diagnosis in the oral cavity. Clinical examination can be supported by dermoscopy, but the complex oral mucosa anatomy and irregular surface represent a technical limitation.

**Dermoscopy**

The most common dermoscopic features include diffuse and irregular pigmentation with pseudo-network, regression structures, and a blue-white veil.
