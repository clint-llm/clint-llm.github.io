The treatment of lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) is best undertaken in specialized centers utilizing multiple disciplines under one roof and comprises

**1) Enzyme Replacement Therapy (ERT)**:

Human recombinant enzymes are manufactured in Chinese hamster ovary(CHO) cells using DNA technology. They enhance the metabolism of the accumulated substrate by replacing the deficient/absent enzyme when given intravenously. However, cerliponase is administered via the intraventricular (brain) route for CLN2 lipofuscinosis. Some preparations are tagged to mannose 6-phosphate to target them to the lysosomes. Some enzymes may be co-administered with chaperones to enhance clinical effects.

ERT improves cardiac, and lung function reduces disease burden in the viscera, bone, and improves the blood picture. It can reduce the disease's bio-markers' excretion and improve joint and functional mobility and quality of life. For maximum benefits, ERT works best when started early before organ damage occurs.

ERT is not without disadvantages. It is expensive, time-consuming, and does not penetrate the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) or tissues with poor vascularity. In very young children, the immaturity of some transport systems prevents adequate drug delivery to affected tissues.

To overcome many of these disadvantages, "Next-Generation" ERT is in the pipeline. Modifications to ERT in this modality include:

- Pegylation to increase the half-life

- Antibody tagging to recognize specific receptors and thereby penetrate the BBB

- Direct tissue administration of ERT and,

- Implantation of enzyme-rich capsules into tissues to supply enzyme directly to target and concomitant shielding from antibodies.

- Principles of pharmacogenomics applied to the treatment of LSDs

**2)****Pharmacological Chaperone Therapy (PCT)**:

An enzyme in its final form has a tertiary structure. This involves proper folding of the protein molecule that renders it resistant to degradation. A specific mutation in the lysosomal associated protein involved in the folding process renders the enzyme fragile. In such instances, the catalytic site is intact. Small molecules that traverse cellular organelles' membranes and correct the misfolding and render the enzyme resistant to degradation are termed chaperones. When used, they are invaluable in some LSDs.

**3)****Proteostasis Regulators**:

Unlike in PCT, the proteostatic regulators are not ligands (they do not bind to the enzymes) but shift the equilibrium away from protein (enzyme) degradation by controlling several steps in the metabolic pathways. They thus preserve the enzymes. Although an attractive option, they have significant toxicity that precludes their use.

**4) Substrate Reduction Therapy (SRT)**:

Some substances reduce the formation of substrates by inhibiting the enzyme that catalyzes its synthesis. Their onset of action and clinical improvements are slower than ERT. Slowing the progression of neurological symptoms is seen with miglustat in neuropathic LSDs. Other SRTs in clinical trials are genistein, ibiglustat, and lucerastat.

Using antisense oligonucleotides to bind to mRNA of mutant enzymes' genes and reducing the defective protein's formation help reduce substrate accumulation and rescues the physiological enzymes.

**5)****Small Molecule Assisted Substrate Transportation (SMAST)**is a modality where an accumulated substrate, due to a lack of transporter, is converted to another compound that is, transported with ease out of the lysosome.

**6)****Anti-Inflammatory Agents**:

The pathogenesis of LSDs includes inflammation. Anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents reduce inflammatory cytokines like IL-1 and TNF-alpha and reduce organ damage.

**7) Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)**:

Stem cells from donors or umbilical cord blood are used and are fast replacing bone marrow tissue due to ease, rapidity, and increased success. These stem cells can migrate to various organs, including the brain, and differentiate into the cells of the respective tissues and continuously produce the deficient enzyme. They also reduce inflammation and consequent tissue damage. There have been reports of improved visceromegaly and preservation of neurocognitive function. Since engraftment takes time, the neurocognitive function may decline early after HSCT, and ERT acts as a bridge therapy during this period. This ERT-HSCT sequential modality has become the standard of care in some LSDs. Fortunately, ERT does not mitigate the benefits of HSCT in any way. HSCT is FDA approved for MPS I

HSCT is suboptimal in reducing the pathology in some tissues like the cornea, heart valves, and the bone. HSCT has been unsuccessful in some LSDs, but one cannot conclude the outcomes due to delays in initiating therapy in these conditions.

**8)****Gene Therapy**:

The autologous ex-vivo method involves harvesting the affected patient's stem cells and introducing the correct version of the gene using viral vectors (lentivirus and retrovirus) into those stem cells in-vitro. This process is called transfection. The next step is bone marrow ablation using chemotherapy. Hematogenous, hepatic, CSF, or direct CNS routes form the final step to re-introduce the corrected cells into the patient.

The in-vivo method is the direct transfer of the gene to the tissue that serves as a depot for the viral vectors (adeno-associated virus, AAV).

Much benefit has been demonstrated in clinical trials using this modality and promising therapy in the future.

**9)****Manipulation of Gene Expression**:

In some LSDs, a gene encoding a lysosomal enzyme has a premature termination codon that prematurely stops transcription. It can be overridden by reading through the stop codon using small molecules. It corrects the gene defect and, the unhindered transcription restores the deficient enzyme. This technology has been studied in some degenerative disorders but not in LSDs. It has much promise for the future.

Genome editing delivers the corrected gene version directly to the target organ using several nucleases. It has advantages over gene therapy in that no viral vectors are involved, and the transfer is targeted rather than random.

**10)****Ancillary Care**:

Apart from therapy directed at the defective enzyme, accumulated substrate, and the mutant genes, individual treatments can tackle the complications in the various organ systems that occur in the LSDs. These include:

- Medications for seizures, movement disorders, and psychosis

- Shunts for hydrocephalus

- Special learning skills for children with subnormal intelligence

- Cardiac valvular replacements

- Drugs for heart failure, arrhythmias

- Cardiac pacemakers for rhythm disorders

- Ventilatory support for respiratory failure

- Renal replacement therapy, including transplantation

- Medications for endocrine dysfunction

- Orthopedic braces and corrective surgeries for deformities, fractures

- Speech pathology for swallowing disorders and preventing aspiration

- Vision and ENT issues

- Psychiatry, psychological counseling, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, hospice, and social services.
