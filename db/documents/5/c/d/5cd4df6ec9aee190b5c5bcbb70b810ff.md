Primary hyperparathyroidism is a relatively common disorder that can cause significant renal and skeletal complications. Surgery remains the definitive treatment. However, alternative therapies may be appropriate for select patients. Basic knowledge of normal calcium homeostasis is essential in diagnosing and managing patients with hyperparathyroidism. A basic understanding of normal calcium homeostasis as well as the natural history of primary hyperparathyroidism is essential in diagnosing and properly managing patients with this disorder. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of primary hyperparathyroidism and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this disorder.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of primary hyperparathyroidism.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism.
- Review the management options available for primary hyperparathyroidism.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to advance the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism and improve patient outcomes.
