The arytenoid cartilages help move the vocal folds allowing tension, relaxation, or approximation of these because the vocal folds, being attached to the arytenoids, move along with them. Several intrinsic laryngeal muscles and ligaments are also attached to the arytenoids and can move them around. As stated above, the arytenoid cartilage articulates with the cricoid ring through several anterior and posterior ligaments forming the capsule of the cricoarytenoid joint. This last allows two types of movement: a sliding motion of the arytenoid along its longitudinal axis and a rocking of the arytenoid cartilage throughout vocal fold abduction and adduction. The lateral cricoarytenoid muscle allows inward rotation of the arytenoid on the cricoid cartilage, closing the laryngeal airway during deglutition, vocalization, and expiration. The interarytenoid muscle augments this activity, which pulls the arytenoids together. This last muscle is likely more important during vocalization than during respiration. The contraction of the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle allows outward rotation of the arytenoid on the cricoid cartilage opening the airway during inspiration.
