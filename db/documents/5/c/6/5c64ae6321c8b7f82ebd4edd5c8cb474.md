Toxoplasma gondii oocysts transmission occurs by ingesting the infected tissue or inhaling the fecal particles. Transplacental transmission causes congenital toxoplasmosis. This is most commonly occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy. However, earlier the infection, more severe will be the congenital malformations.

Syphilis is transmitted through the placenta or vertically in the birth canal. The transmission rate is more than 80% in recently infected mothers.

Rubella is transmitted to the mother by aerosols and to the fetus through the placenta.

CMV transmits to the mother by blood transfusion, organ transplants, or most commonly through the mucus membrane exposure. It then passes either through the placenta, birth canal, or breast milk to the fetus or neonate. CMV infection rates in primary infection have long been proposed to be greater than secondary infection, but there has been some recent analysis that this may not be as significant as previously thought.

HSV transmits to the mother by sexual contact and later to the fetus via either ascending infection or exposure during parturition. Maternal primary infection during the third trimester has the highest percentage of neonatal infection.

HIV transmission to infants can occur either in transplacentally in utero, during parturition, or via post-natal maternal exposures like breast milk.
