A person experiencing tonic-clonic seizures should be rolled over to the recovery position to decrease the risk of asphyxiation and aspiration. Most generalized tonic-clonic seizures resolve spontaneously, and antiseizure medications are not usually required. Patients presenting with seizure it is recommended to have intravenous access, in case if seizures are prolonged or recur. Metabolic and infectious etiologies should be investigated and treated. Seizures lasting more than 5 minutes or recurrent seizures without return to baseline consciousness meets the definition of status epilepticus. Patients who are critically ill with ongoing seizures should have antiseizure medication administered intravenously to achieve therapeutic plasma levels. The decision to start antiseizure medications is individualized based on numerous factors, including the chance of event being seizure, confirmation of seizure based on history and physical examination, patient stability, and risk of recurrent seizures. Epilepsy surgery is an option for patients with focal onset seizures that are refractory to medical therapy.
