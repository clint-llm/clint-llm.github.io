Coronary artery disease prevalence has not decreased for decades. Modifying the risk factors is the mainstay for reducing the risk of CAD. Primary clinicians should educate patients about the likelihood of CAD associated with these risk factors. A team approach involving primary clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, behavioral therapists, and social workers can help the patient in the optimization of risk factors. Anterior MI, like any other MI, benefits from early intervention and optimal medical therapy after reperfusion. Hospital teams involving emergency clinicians, hospitalists, cardiologists, and emergency and intensive care unit (ICU) nurses can work together to provide early intervention and reduce the time from medical contact to PCI. Post- reperfusion care in the ICU and patient education immediately after the event helps in improved patient compliance. Referral to cardiac rehabilitation and timely communication with the primary clinician at the time of discharge helps to close the loop and ensures the patient gets appropriate care after a significant cardiovascular event.
