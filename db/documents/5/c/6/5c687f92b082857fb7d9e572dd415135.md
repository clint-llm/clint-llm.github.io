Retinal folds which can accompany choroidal folds are important in the differential diagnosis.Â Retinal folds usually have a normal fluorescein pattern. Retinal folds are usually narrower than choroidal folds, and they seem to radiate from pathological lesions in the retina. There is usually an abnormal vitreous or vitreoretinal interface associated with it. They may show increased tortuosity of retinal blood vessels. Retinal folds may occur with an epiretinal membrane, subretinal scar, subretinal neovascular membrane, subretinal fluid, uveal or scleral thickening, or with optic nerve disease.
