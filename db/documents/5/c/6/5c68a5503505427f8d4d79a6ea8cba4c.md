To prepare for a culdocentesis, have the supplies ready on a table near the proceduralist. Use good sterile technique when preparing supplies. Have a nurse or nursing aide present in the room to help hand over supplies. The patient should lay in the lithotomy position, preferably on a cart with stirrups for patient comfort.
