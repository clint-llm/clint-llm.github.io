Within the femoral region, two clinically significant anatomical associations are noted, which are heavily utilized by anesthesiologists for perioperative pain management in lower extremity procedures and intensivists and ED physicians in accessing central venous circulation via the femoral vein. Â Known as the femoral triangle and adductor canal, these anatomic associations serve as landmarks for important neuro-vasculature connected to tissues of the femoral region - providing motor/sensory innervation and blood supply.

For perioperative pain management of the lower extremity, a nerve block can be administered to the femoral triangle, or in many cases both the femoral and adductor canals. Using ultrasound-guided needle insertion, space around the femoral and saphenous nerves within these neuro-vascular bundles can be infiltrated with analgesic agents.

Due to the typical location of the femoral vein within the femoral triangle and canal, ease of access allows providers to insert central IV lines if indicated. Though not the primary site for central catheter placement, this being the internal jugular vein, central venous access via femoral vein has been proven as an efficient alternative.
