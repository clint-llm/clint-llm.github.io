Prompt and thorough fluid resuscitation is critical when managing patients with severe burns. The Parkland formula is a well-established protocol to determine the initial fluid administration required for these patients. However, the fundamental critical elements in burn resuscitation have progressively evolved as more information is unveiled through decades of research. Many formulas and their respective modifications have been modeled to reflect the changes in knowledge. No single formula is comprehensive enough to include the true complexity of burns, as there are many unaccounted clinical variables. This activity will delve into the purpose, indications, potential complications, and modifications of the Parkland formula. Moreover, the activity highlights the crucial roles played by each interprofessional team member in managing fluid resuscitation for critical burn injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Correlate the pathophysiology of severe burn injuries to fluid status and management in patients with critical burns.
- Recognize the appropriate clinical indications for applying the Parkland formula and any pertinent modifications.
- Apply best practices when monitoring fluid resuscitation in patients with severe burns and the potential complications of under- and over-resuscitation.
- Apply effective strategies to promote collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination and improve outcomes in patients with critical burn injuries.
