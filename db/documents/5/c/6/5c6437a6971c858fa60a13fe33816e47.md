The majority of patients with Ehrlichia infections present to the emergency department or the primary care provider/nurse practitioner. Because the symptoms and signs of Ehrlichia infection are not specific, it is essential to consult with an infectious disease expert early on. The infection can involve the skin, CNS, GI tract, and muscle or even present with shock. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports mortality rates of 1% to 3%, since 2000, in patients who present for medical care of ehrlichiosis. Importantly, many patients may be infected with ehrlichiosis but not present for medical evaluation, and thus this may be an overestimate of mortality. Patients who are immunocompromised, elderly, or have received pretreatment with sulfonamide antibiotics are predisposed to more severe illness

There is no vaccine available for any of the Ehrlichia species. Avoidance of tick bites remains the mainstay of prevention, with the application of insect repellents, avoidance of high-risk areas, covering all exposed skin, and checking carefully for ticks after outdoor activities in endemic areas. As ehrlichiosis is not transmitted directly person-to-person, no isolation is needed.
