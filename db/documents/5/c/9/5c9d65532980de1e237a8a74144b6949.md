PGE2 is administered vaginally as a suppository, gel, or insert.

The vaginal suppository is for the evacuation of uterine contents. One 20 mg suppository is inserted into the posterior fornix of the vagina every three hours until abortion occurs. If the abortion does not occur within twenty-four hours, or if there are severe side effects, the clinician should stop the drug.

The endocervical gel and vaginal inserts are agents for cervical ripening induction. The cervical gel has a more rapid release than the vaginal insert but might be less convenient, as the procedure requires more vaginal examinations.
