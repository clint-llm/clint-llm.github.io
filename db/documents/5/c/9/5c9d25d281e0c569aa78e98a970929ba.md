The average age of onset of the sign of Leser-Trelat has been quoted to be approximately 61 years of age. There is no reported increased predilection amongst either sex or any race. Reports of the sign of Leser-Trelat in patients in the second decade of life in association with malignancy do increase the legitimacy of this sign as an accurate predictor of internal malignancy given the relative rarity of seborrheic keratoses in patients of this age.
