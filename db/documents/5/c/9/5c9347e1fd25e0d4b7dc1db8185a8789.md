The two most common inciting events include infection or immune alteration. Cases of ITP associated with infection usually have a preceding viral infection, the most common bacterial infection.

Cases of ITP associated with immune alteration occur due to autoimmune conditions causing loss of peripheral tolerance and promoting the development of auto-antibodies.Â The most common autoimmune conditions include antiphospholipid syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, Evans syndrome, hematopoietic cell transplantation, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, common variable immunodeficiency, and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome.

There is a long list of medications known to cause ITP. The most common ones are mentioned here:

- Abciximab

- Beta-lactam antibiotics

- Carbamazepine

- Eptifibatide

- Gold compounds

- Heparin

- Phenytoin

- MMR vaccine
