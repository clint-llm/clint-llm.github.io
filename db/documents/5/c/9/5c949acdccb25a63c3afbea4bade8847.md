Though not a common occurrence, an understanding of the incidence, presentation, etiology, and management of dextrocardia are essential for all providers, identification of this disorder might be pivotal to recognize rare presentations of Kartagener syndrome or heterotaxy. Due to the possibility of other congenital anomalies associated with dextrocardia, diagnosing dextrocardia could be a bridge to the diagnosis of other cardiac anomalies. Due to the advances in medicine, patients with complex congenital heart disease often live a long healthy life. Understanding the pathophysiology behind this condition is important for anesthetic considerations when these patients undergo cardiac or non-cardiac surgery. Thus, awareness and knowledge about dextrocardia and its implications are vital in improving the care provided to patients.

Patients with dextrocardia benefit from care by an interprofessional team consisting of primary care, radiologists, cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons, and infections disease specialists. [Level 5]
