Blood pressure requires close monitoring whenever vasopressors such as norepinephrine are used; this is possible via invasive or non-invasive measurement techniques. If following non-invasive measurements, it is recommended to obtain values every 2 to 3 minutes during initial titration and then at least every 5 minutes following the determination of the appropriate maintenance dose.

When being used in low doses for its inotropic effect, it is preferred to titrate the dosage via cardiac output instead of blood pressure changes. Therefore, a method of measuring cardiac output (e.g., echocardiography, pulmonary artery catheter) would be required.

Similarly, anÂ indwelling arterial catheter (A-line) should be used to monitor the patient's hemodynamic status in MICU/SICU settings.
