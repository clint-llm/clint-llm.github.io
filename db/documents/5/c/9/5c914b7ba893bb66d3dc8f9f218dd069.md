Melanosis coli is caused by chronic laxative use. Anthraquinones in laxatives have a direct toxic effect on the epithelial cells of the colon. When these laxative molecules turn into their active form in the large bowel, they can cause cell damage to the lining of the large bowel, leading to cell death. As the cells die, they create a dark pigment, which is lipofuscin deposition in the macrophages within the lamina propria, that is visible under colonoscopy. Melanosis coli is more common in the proximal bowel and much rarer in the distal colon. This is probably due to the difference in the macrophage distribution in the colonic wall. Once laxative use is halted, the dark pigmentations may resolve.
