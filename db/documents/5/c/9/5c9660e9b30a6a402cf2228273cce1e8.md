In patients with localized synovial sarcoma, radiation therapy (RT) is used either in the preoperative or postoperative setting. In patients with metastatic or those with locally advanced, unresectable tumors, RT can be given for palliative purposes (pain relief, cord compression).

**Localized Synovial Sarcoma**

- Preoperative RT: Delivered prior to surgery targeting a vascularized, well-oxygenated tumor (which helps in the generation of free oxygen radicals). 

- Advantages

- Smaller target and the need for a lower dose of RT (usually 50 Gy over 25 fractions)
- The option of delivering intra-operative RT or postoperative boost remains open (in case of R1 resection), and so does the prospect of postoperative RT in case of an R2 resection (gross residual disease).
- Long-term side effects are fewer.


- Disadvantages

- Wound healing can be compromised/ delayed.
- Potential delay in surgery (3 to 6 weeks cooling period after finishing RT)

- Postoperative RT

- Advantages

- Lesser wound healing complications
- RT dose can be tailored according to histology


- Disadvantages

- A higher dose is needed for long-term disease control (Up to 76 Gy may be required in patients with R2 resection)
- A wider area is irradiated.
- There is a higher risk of long-term complications like pathological fracture, lymphedema, fibrosis, and secondary sarcoma.

Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) has become the preferred choice for delivering radiation.
