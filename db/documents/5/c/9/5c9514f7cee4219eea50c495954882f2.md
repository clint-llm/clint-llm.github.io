There are multiple factors associated with the development ofÂ seborrheic dermatitis, and their disparate nature has led to many proposals about its cause and pathogenesis, but the onset of SD appears linked to the interplay of normal microscopic skin flora (especially Malassezia spp.), the composition of lipids on the skin surface and individual susceptibility. Neither the level of sebum produced nor the amount of yeast appears to be significant factors.
