Aortofemoral bypass surgery has been used in the management of aortoiliac occlusive disease since the 1950s. Today, revascularization with endovascular intervention has largely replaced aortofemoral bypass surgery and is accepted as first-line therapy. However, in cases where endovascular techniques are not appropriate, aortofemoral bypass continues to have an important role. Practitioners should be familiar with this technique, as it may be a viable option for patients who are not candidates for or have failed revascularization with endovascular intervention. This activity describes the relevant anatomy, indications, and contraindications and reviews important technical considerations of the aortofemoral bypass procedure. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients undergoing aortofemoral bypass surgery.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for aortofemoral bypass surgery.
- Review the contraindications for aortofemoral bypass surgery.
- Outline the steps involved in performing an aortofemoral bypass surgery.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional teamwork in ensuring the appropriate selection of candidates for aortofemoral bypass surgery and in providing effective post-operative management.
