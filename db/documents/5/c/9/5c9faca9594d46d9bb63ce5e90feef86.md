Atypical hyperplasia of the breast refers to abnormal epithelial proliferative breast lesions that are not qualitatively or quantitatively abnormal enough to be classified as carcinoma in situ. These lesions can occur in male and female breast tissue, but they are rare, incidental findings in male gynecomastia specimens. This article will focus on atypical hyperplasia of both ductal and lobular types of the female breast. Both of these lesions are considered pre-malignant or high-risk lesions for the development of more advanced neoplasia.

Atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) is a relatively common lesion reported to be found in about 5% to 20% of breast biopsies. Although not carcinoma, it is classified as a high-risk precursor lesion due to its association with and potential to progress to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) as well as invasive carcinoma.

Atypical lobular hyperplasia (ALH), like ADH, is another high-risk breast lesion that has been associated with a four-fold to five-fold increased lifetime risk of developing breast cancer in either the ipsilateral or contralateral breast.
