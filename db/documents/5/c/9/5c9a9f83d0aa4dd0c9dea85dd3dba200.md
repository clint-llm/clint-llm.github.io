As with most fractures, the potential for complications exist. One concern complication is a malunion; this may occur with a residual volar displacement or shortening of the distal radius. A malunion can result in a cosmetic abnormality known as a garden spade deformity. It may also narrow or distort the entryway into the carpal tunnel, with resultant delayed carpal tunnel syndrome. In the elderly population, there appears to be a correlation between decreased bone density and trouble maintaining closed reduction. This situation increases the risk for further displacement despite appropriate immobilization In the instance of malunion.

As stated above, volar angulation of the distal radius may also result in ACTS, but even conservative management with excess flexion or extension may also cause compression to the median nerve.
