A skilled practitioner, familiar with pressure control ventilation, in conjunction with a respiratory therapist, should manage patients on the mode as it does differ from conventional volume control in a very important way. In pressure control ventilation, the setting of inspiratory pressure, and therefore peak pressure, is protective against barotrauma. However, pressure control does have an independent variable of tidal volume. Excess pressure can cause a significantly elevated tidal volume, resulting in volutrauma, or the opposite can occur in which after setting an adequate and safe pressure, the tidal volume is too low for a patientâ€™s ideal body weight resulting in increased dead space ventilation and ultimately ventilatory failure.
