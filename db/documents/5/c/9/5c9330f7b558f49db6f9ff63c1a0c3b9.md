The patient is most likely to complain of pain or foreign body sensation for small corneal abrasions, and presentation can be delayed for several hours after the inciting event. For acute ocular chemical injuries symptoms are likely to be immediate. Healthcare practitioners should ask about the work environment and specifically, the use of high-speed machinery and metalworking, as these injuries are can be associated with corneal laceration and perforation of the globe. A history of eye pain that occurs after hammering metal on metal suggests a metal projectile as the cause of the ocular injury, and the possibility of globe rupture should be thoroughly investigated in this setting. For ocular burns, it is important to identify the chemical(s) the eye was exposed to, as this can impact treatment and prognosis. It is also important to ask if there was any ingestion or inhalation of chemical substances, as respiratory passage edema can lead to asphyxiation.
