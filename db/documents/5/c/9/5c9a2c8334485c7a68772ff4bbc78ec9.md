There are major and minor complications to the thoracic spinal blockade; however, the major complications are rare. The most serious complications of thoracic spinal anesthesia include:

- Direct needle trauma

- Infection (abscess, meningitis)

- Vertebral canal hematoma

- Spinal cord ischemia

- Arachnoiditis

- Total spinal anesthesia

- Cardiovascular collapse

- Death

Minor complications, on the other hand, are common and shouldn’t be disregarded. Some of the more common minor complications include hypotension, nausea/vomiting (typically caused by hypotension), bradycardia, paresthesia, transient mild hearing impairment, backache, urinary retention, and TNS. Lastly, post-dural puncture headaches, which are considered a “minor” complication, can be severely debilitating for patients and are common in occurrence.
