Mortality rates for cryoglobulinemic vasculitis are higher compared to the general population.

Poor prognostic features of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis in association with hepatitis C viral infection include:

- Presence of severe liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis

- In the absence of liver fibrosis, five-factor score (FFS) developed by Guillevin et al.,Â which takes into account- proteinuria greater than 1 g/day, serum creatinine greater than 150 micromol/L, cardiomyopathy, gastrointestinal and CNS involvement, seemed to correlate with prognosis.

- Gastrointestinal vasculitis seemed to have a poor prognosis.

The prognostic factors in non-infectious mixed cryoglobulinemic vasculitis include CryoVas score (age greater than 65, pulmonary and gastrointestinal involvement, and renal failure).

Poor prognostic features in type 1 cryoglobulinemia are old age and renal involvement. Sign of neuropathy on presentation was also found to be one of the poor prognostic indicators in a retrospective study.
