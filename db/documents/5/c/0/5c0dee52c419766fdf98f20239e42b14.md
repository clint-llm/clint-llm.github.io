There is insufficient data on the epidemiology of HHS. Based on some studies, close to 1% of all hospital admission for diabetes is related to HHS.

Most cases of HHS are seen in patients in the fifth and sixth decades of life. Typically DKA is more common in the younger population, with the peak age around the fourth decade of life.

In the United States, because of the increase in childhood obesity which is related to the consumption of high amounts of carbohydrate-rich diet, there is a significant increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes. This may lead to an increased incidence of HHS in the pediatric population.

There is a disproportionally high number of African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics who are afflicted with HHS. This might be related to a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes in these particular population groups. HHS can be fatal in morbidly obese African American males.
