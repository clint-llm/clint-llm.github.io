Traumatic fibromas have various clinical presentations, and they are always preceded by localized irritation or trauma. Typically, fibromas present as smooth, nodular, sessile lesions measuring up to 2 cm in diameter.

TUGSE presents clinically as self-limiting, solitary ulceration with a fibrinopurulent membrane and elevated indurated margins.

Inflammatory papillary hyperplasia presents as a few to innumerable small, reddened concentric papillomas on the hard palate.

Thermal injuries usually present with localized or diffuse tissue damage.

Aspirin-induced oral lesions present as an ulcerated aphthous-like white lesion caused by an immune response to the acidic components of aspirin.
