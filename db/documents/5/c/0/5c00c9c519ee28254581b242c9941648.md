BIS monitoring involves the application of four electrodes on the forehead. The skin on the forehead is cleaned with an alcohol swab, and 2 to 5 seconds of digital pressure applied over the sensor leads.

The BIS view monitor displays:

- BIS number

- Trend graph of BIS values over time

- Raw EEG waveforms in real-time

- Various signal quality indicators as SQI, EMG

- Alarm indicators and messages

The signal-quality-index (SQI) bar predicts the reliability of the signal; the higher the SQI, the more reliable is the BIS number. The electromyographic (EMG) bar indicates EMG activity, which reflects muscle stimulation caused by an increase in muscle tone or muscle movement.
