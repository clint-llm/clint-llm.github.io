Researchers gave a single 200 mg dose of lovastatin to 5 healthy volunteers, and there were no clinically significant adverse effects reported. Cases of lovastatin overdose are reported, but none of the patients reported any specific symptoms. All the patients recovered without complications. The patient should discontinue lovastatin use if severe muscle symptoms or fatigue develops. CPK, creatinine, and urinalysis should be done to assess for myoglobinuria. Mild to moderate muscle symptoms should also call for discontinuation of lovastatin, pending a thorough investigation of symptoms.
