In a newborn, the goal is to reduce the risk of infection of blisters, in addition to standard medical management of skin lesions. Careful monitoring for systemic involvement is prudent during this time. The possibility of retinal detachment, particularly in children under seven years of age, is an important consideration, and ophthalmologic screening is necessary. Head trauma can also increase the risk of retinal detachment; however, no specific recommendations are currently established for avoiding contact sports. A suggested schedule for eye examinations is monthly until age four months, every three months from 4 months to 1 year of age, then every six months between age one to three, and annually after that.****The neurologic function requires routine assessment, and ongoing dental screening is appropriate.
