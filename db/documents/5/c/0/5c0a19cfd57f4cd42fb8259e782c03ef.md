Rotavirus accounted for about 30 to 70% of all hospital admissions in children with acute gastroenteritis prior to the development of a vaccine. This disease tends to peak during winter and in the cooler months. Norovirus is said to be the commonest cause of community-acquired diarrhea, gastroenteritis outbreaks, and foodborne disease in the United States and globally. Noroviruses are efficiently spread from person to person. The recent estimate in the United States for the incidence of norovirus infection accounts for up to 800 deaths, 71,000 hospitalizations, 400,000 emergency department visits, 1.9 million outpatient visits, and 21 million morbidities annually.

The adenoviruses are generally less infectious than rotavirus or norovirus, with an overall lower medical impact. Two known fastidious strains, serotypes 40 and 41, have been shown to be responsible for gastroenteritis in children less than two years old and in daycare.
