Complications of corneal mucous plaque occur mainly secondary to the underlying conditions. If the plaque is associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca, the severe dry eye can result in conjunctival scarring, corneal scarring, corneal vascularization, and in rare cases corneal perforation. Prolonged inflammation associated with sicca can also result in symblepharon formation. If the plaque is secondary to herpes zoster keratitis, the patient might have corneal scarring, vascularization, and corneal ulceration. In very young patients with vernal keratoconjunctivitis, if the plaque is untreated, it might lead to corneal scarring and eventually amblyopia.
