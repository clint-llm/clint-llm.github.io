There are many types of craniotomies described in the literature, and a basic understanding of anatomy and physiology is necessary to perform an adequate craniotomy with fewer complications. The type of craniotomy is named depending on the skull bone, which is opened. Typical skull bones targeted for craniotomy include the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital bones. Depending on the location of the pathology to be addressed, supratentorial or infratentorial (posterior fossa) craniotomies can be utilized.

One of the most traditional craniotomies utilized is the pterional craniotomy, a supratentorial craniotomy that can be utilized for aneurysms of the anterior circulation, basilar tip artery aneurysms, direct surgical approaches to the cavernous sinus, frontal and temporal lobe tumors, as well as suprasellar tumors such as pituitary adenomas and craniopharyngiomas.

The frontal craniotomy is used to access the frontal skull base and the frontal lobe of the brain for approaches to the third ventricle or sellar region tumors, craniopharyngiomas, planum sphenoidale meningiomas, frontal lobe tumors, and repair of anterior cerebrospinal fluid fistulas. Other types of craniotomies include parietal, occipital, and retrosigmoid, among many others.
