Symptoms of coronary artery disease presentations can vary from asymptomatic, stable chest pain (stable angina), and acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, NSTEMI, and STEMI) to sudden cardiac death. Chest pain seen with stable angina is often mid-sternal, squeezing in quality, associated with a feeling of constriction or anxiety, radiating to the arms, neck, jaw, back or upper abdomen. These symptoms worsen with exertion (physical or emotional) because of the increased oxygen demand and improve with rest because of the decreased oxygen demand. The level of physical activity at which the symptoms start to occur is called the "angina threshold."

Unstable angina is defined with similar chest pain as stable angina but is present even at rest with normal EKG, and normal cardiac enzymes. NSTEMI presents as chest pain at rest with elevated cardiac enzymes, and normal EKG or with ST-segment depressions. Similarly, STEMI presents with chest pain with nausea/vomiting, diaphoresis with ST-segment elevation in EKG, and elevated cardiac enzymes. Patients may present with absolutely no symptom of chest pain or angina, and the initial presentation could be an abnormal electrocardiogram or echocardiogram ordered for other reasons. It is necessary for proper evaluation of the history of present illness in these patients, including the past medical history, social and family history that includes the risk factors for coronary artery disease.
