Preventing C. sinensis infection is heavily based on patient education and proper food preparation. Endemic areas promote education with public awareness programs, health guide booklets, and educating school children. These educational programs enforce proper food preparation and avoidance of undercooked or raw fish. Removal of farm animals from nearby fish farms and recognizing symptoms is also essential. These areas must undergo cultural changes to begin the decline of infection rates of C. sinensis, including replanting family farms to move farm animals from water sources and decreasing the consumption of raw fish in their diet.
