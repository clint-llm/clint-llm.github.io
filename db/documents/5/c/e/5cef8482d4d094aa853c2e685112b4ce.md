The masseter muscle is relatively well conserved across the human population as well as the animal kingdom as a muscle of mastication. The most noticeable difference is masseteric hypertrophy which is characteristic in populations of Asian descent. Masseteric hypertrophy characteristically shows as a benign condition of enlargement of the masseter muscles leading to a square jawline shape, which is a frequent target for esthetic treatments and botox requests.
