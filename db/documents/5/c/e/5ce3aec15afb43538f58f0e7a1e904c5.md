Prospective trials of chemotherapy as a treatment for vulvar cancers is lacking. Recommendations are largely extrapolated from therapeutic trials for metastatic cervical or anal cancers. The agents commonly used are platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents.

More recent studies have investigated targeted agents. One such agent, Erlotinib, is an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor and has been tested in vulvar SCC. A partial response was observed in 27% of patients and an additional 40% exhibited stable disease, but the progression-free survival was poor.

If surgical excision of SCC or BCC is contraindicated, an alternative treatment option that has proven to be effective in HPV-associated VIN is topical 5% imiquimod cream applied 3 times weekly for 16 weeks.

In patients with melanoma, medical management with novel CTLA-4-, PD-1-, BRAF- and MEK-inhibitors such as nivolumab and ipilimumab has improved overall survival. These therapies are now considered first-line therapy in patients with stage III diseaseÂ but limited data is available for the response of vulvar melanoma. One of the differences between cutaneous melanoma and vulvar melanoma is the relatively high number of receptor tyrosine kinase proteins (KIT) mutations. This creates the potential to explore tyrosine kinase inhibitors as a treatment for vulvar melanoma in future studies.
