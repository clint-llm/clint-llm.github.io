Contact lenses are artificial prosthetic devices worn on the eye's front surface to substitute for the anterior corneal surface. Contact lenses help correct the refractive error and irregularities of the corneal surface.

The various indications of contact lenses can be optical, therapeutic, preventive, diagnostic, operative, cosmetic, and occupational. The action of contact lenses depends on wettability, water content, oxygen permeability, transmission, light transmission, refractive index, resistance to temperature, dimensions, and flexural stability.

Based on material, contact lenses are divided into focons and filcons. An ideal contact lens should be biocompatible, gas permeable, have good optical properties and tolerance, be mouldable, sterile, stable, and have good surface chemistry. Each type of contact lens has various advantages and disadvantages.

The complications associated with contact lens use can be conjunctival, corneal, and mechanical. This activity deals with the anatomy and physiology of contact lenses, indication, contraindications, preparation, complication, and clinical significance of contact lenses.
