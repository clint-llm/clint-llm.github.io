Several conditions resemble oral lichen planus both clinically and histologically. These include oral lichenoid drug reactions, oral lichenoid contact hypersensitivity reactions, mucous membrane pemphigoid, chronic graft-versus-host disease, lupus erythematosus, lichen planus pemphigoides, chronic ulcerative stomatitis, proliferative verrucous leukoplakia, and oral epithelial dysplasia.

The most common medications implicated in oral lichenoid drug reactions include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antihypertensives, anticonvulsants, antimalarials, and antiretrovirals.

Lichenoid drug reactions may not necessarily occur immediately, with some lesions developing even years after introducing the medication.

Oral lichenoid contact hypersensitivity reactions are typically seen on mucosal surfaces in direct contact with the offending agent. These agents may include dental restorative materials (e.g., metals, composites, and glass ionomer cement) or flavoring agents (e.g., cinnamon, menthol, eugenol).
