The human coccyx is the final portion of the vertebral column, typically comprised of three to five vertebral segments.

However, the coccygeal vertebrae do not contain any pedicle, lamina, or spinous processes. The coccyx serves as the attachment site for multiple pelvic ligaments and tendons and contains an extensive plexus of coccygeal nerves. Damage to any one of these components can have implications in several clinical conditions.
