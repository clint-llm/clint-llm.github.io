Complications from sternal fractures are frequently due to associated injuries. Displaced or unstable sternal fractures result in an increased risk of pulmonary injuries, pericardial effusions, rib fractures, and spinal compression fractures.

Chest pain after the injury can persist for 8 to 12 weeks. Pain on inspiration can result in atelectasis, pneumonia, and other pulmonary complications.

Sternal fracture nonunion, false joint, and overlap deformities are rare. These complications may require delayed surgical repair. Advanced age, osteoporosis, prolonged steroid use, and diabetes increase the risk for a delayed union.

Osteomyelitis, sternal abscess, and mediastinitis are rare. Large hematoma formation, intravenous drug abuse, and a staphylococcal infection elsewhere increase the risk of these infectious complications.
