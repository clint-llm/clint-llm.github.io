Initial treatment of tarsal tunnel syndrome is non-operative. These measures include immobilization and night splinting for between 6 to 12 weeks, ant-inflammatory medications and shoe wear modification. If these measures fail, patients may merit consideration for surgical intervention. Pre-operative workup may include radiographs and/or MRI studies to evaluate for tarsal coalition or space-occupying lesions, respectively. Some authors contend that surgical options be limited to those with space-occupying lesions

Some authors have proposed ultrasound-guided release of the tarsal tunnel.

If a patient opts for an open approach, an incision is made beginning plantar to the navicular tuberosity and extending proximally between the medial malleolus and the calcaneal tuberosity. After careful dissection through superficial veins, the flexor retinaculum is encountered. The midportion of the flexor retinaculum is excised carefully to liberate the underlying structures.

Additionally, the posterior tibial nerve is susceptible to injury with fracture of and during subsequent fixation of medial malleolus fractures along with the tibialis posterior tendon, flexor digitorum longus longus tendon, the posterior tibial artery, and the flexor hallucis longus tendon.
