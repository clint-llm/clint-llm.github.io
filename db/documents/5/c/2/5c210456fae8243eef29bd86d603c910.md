The tetanus toxoid is generally safe for the human population; however, there are specific contraindications. One contraindication includes past anaphylaxis reaction to the tetanus toxoid. Further, in the case where encephalopathy occurs within seven days of administration of the tetanus toxoid and no other cause is found, this can also be a contraindication for future injections.
