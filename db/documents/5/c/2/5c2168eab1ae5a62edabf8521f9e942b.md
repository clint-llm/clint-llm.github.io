Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common form of heart disease. It is the result of atheromatous changes in the vessels supplying the heart. CAD is used to describe a range of clinical disorders from asymptomatic atherosclerosis and stable angina to acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina, NSTEMI, STEMI). In the US, it is still one of the leading causes of mortality. Initial evaluation of risk factors is the first step in the prevention of coronary artery diseases.
