Vinca alkaloids, which belong to a class of cell cycle phase M specific anti-tubulin agents are one of the first plant alkaloids to be developed for use as anti-cancer agents in humans. This activity describes the incidence, etiology, clinical features, examination findings, differential diagnosis, assessment, and management of systemic effects of vinca alkaloids, with an emphasis on vincristine-induced neurotoxicity.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism underlying the use of vinca alkaloids as anticancer agents.

- Summarize ways to assess as well as prognosticate vinca alkaloid associated neurotoxicity. 
- Review the available modalities of prevention and management of vinca alkaloid associated neurotoxicity.
- Outline the impact of vinca alkaloids on the hematopoietic system.
