The suboccipital muscles cover the vertebral artery as it enters the transverse process of C1. The vertebral artery is divided into four segments, which are separated based on anatomical positioning within the body. The origin of the vertebral artery is from the subclavian arteries, after which it ascends superiorly alongside the cervical spinalÂ vertebrae until, at the level of C6, it traverses the foramina of the remaining vertebrae until C2, where it exits.

The suboccipital venous plexus is the main venous structure surrounding and draining the suboccipital muscles. These surrounding veins are located posterior to the suboccipital muscles and anastomose with a venous sinus that surrounds the V3 segment of the vertebral artery.
