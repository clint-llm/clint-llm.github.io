Adverse effects of tenecteplase, including bleeding, anaphylaxis, thromboembolism, and arrhythmia,Â are similar to other thrombolytics.

Bleeding is the most common complication of tenecteplase and thrombolytic use. Bleeding can occur anywhere in the body, as well as at puncture and surgical sites. Intracranial hemorrhage poses the most significant concern for increased mortality. The incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in patients receiving tenecteplase (2.9%) is comparable to patients receiving alteplase (2.7%), another thrombolytic agent.

Thromboembolic events and cholesterol embolization have been reported using thrombolytics, including tenecteplase. In addition, cardiac dysrhythmias have been associated with thrombolytic use in STEMI as an occurrence of tissue reperfusion.

In the ASSENT-4 study, higher incidences of mortality, cardiogenic shock, congestive heart failure, and recurrent myocardial infarction requiring repeat revascularization were observed in the cohort receiving tenecteplase with PCI versus PCI alone.
