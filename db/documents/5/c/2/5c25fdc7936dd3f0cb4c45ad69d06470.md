In 2013, researchers proposed an algorithm for the management of category II fetal heart tracings.

- Variable decelerations reaching a nadir more than 60 beats per minute below the baseline and lasting longer than 60 seconds

- Variable decelerations reaching a nadir of fewer than 60 beats per minute regardless of baseline and lasting longer than 60 seconds

- Any late deceleration

- Any prolonged deceleration (lasting 2 minutes or longer)

Initial management of recurrent variable decelerations should have a target of relieving potential cord compression.

In specific clinical scenarios that may result in concerning variable decelerations, management should be directed by the etiology of those decelerations. For example:

- If the examination of a patient under evaluation for concerning decelerations reveals a prolapsed umbilical cord, the presenting portion should remain elevated while making preparations for urgent cesarean delivery.

- In the second stage of labor, maternal pushing efforts may also lead to variable decelerations with pushing. Depending on the presence or absence of other signs of reassuring fetal status, the patient might be directed not to push with every contraction to allow for adequate fetal recovery between pushes.

- If a patient is having uterine tachysystole, reducing the number of contractions be decreasing oxytocin or administration of a beta-agonist may be appropriate.

- If a patient is being monitored for preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes, recurrent variable decelerations may be a sign of worsening fetal and maternal status. In the setting of preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes, delivery is necessary with nonreassuring fetal status, chorioamnionitis, or placenta abruption.

Ultimately, if the fetal heart tracing is persistently abnormal, facilitating delivery is indicated. In the term, laboring patient, an operative vaginal delivery may be considered. If the patient is remote from delivery, it may indicate the need for cesarean delivery. In a patient with preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes, induction or augmentation of labor may be the next step if the fetus is in the vertex presentation. Alternatively, cesarean delivery may be indicated if the fetus is in the breech presentation.
