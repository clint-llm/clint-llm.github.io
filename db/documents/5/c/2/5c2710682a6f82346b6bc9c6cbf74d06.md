**Nonoperative modalities**

The general consensus for managing AIN syndrome includes a period of rest, observation, and splinting of the elbow near 90 degrees of flexion (or position of most comfort for the patient).  The majority of patients will experience improvement between 6 and 12 weeks of activity modification.

Other modalities to consider include NSAIDs and physical therapy modalities (including pain modalities and massage techniques if tolerated)

**Surgical decompression**

Surgical treatment consists of exploration, neurolysis, and decompression after several months of failed nonoperative modalities.  The literature reports 75% or greater positive outcomes following surgery, with higher rates reported in patients with an identifiable, clear space-occupying mass.

Unless a clear cause is identified, surgical intervention is typically offered only in select cases, and the option is discussed following at least three months of failed conservative treatment.

During median nerve surgical decompression, meticulous dissection is necessary to establish exact sites of compression. It is critical in the identification and release of compressing edges or fibrous bands.
