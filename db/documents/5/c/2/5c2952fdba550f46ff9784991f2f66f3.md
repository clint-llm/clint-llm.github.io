Because most femoral vascular devices are evolving and data is still being gathered, many of these devices do not have strict contraindications. However, there are certain issues of concern and times when these devices are not used.

The following properties of the access site make them less suitable for the use of novel femoral vascular closure devices:

- Access obtained above the inguinal ligament

- Access obtained through the superficial or deep femoral arteries

- Access obtained from the lateral surface of the artery wall

- Multiple attempts required to obtain an access site in any part of the artery

- Bacterial infection around access site

- Heavy calcification in the area of the access site

Caution should be taken during the below mentioned clinical situations:

- Anticoagulation with warfarin

- Thrombolysis

- Bleeding diathesis

- Peripheral vascular disease
