Monitor fasting plasma glucose and A1c at three months in patients taking glipizide. Some experts recommend monitoring liver enzymes and renal function in patients who are prescribed glipizide for more than two months. There are reports that the drug can cause mild elevations in SGOT, LDH, and creatinine levels. Actual liver damage is infrequent, but if the liver enzymes remain persistently high, discontinue the drug.

Regular weight measurings are a recommendation given glipizide's potential side effect of weight gain.
