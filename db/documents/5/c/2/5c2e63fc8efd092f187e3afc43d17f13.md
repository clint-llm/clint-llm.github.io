The majority of cases of myopericarditis are idiopathic as no definitive cause is identified even after extensive work up. Causes are divided into infectious and non-infectious causes. Most of the infectious causes are viral, and they are often attributed to the following viruses:

**Infectious Causes**

- Viruses: Coxsackievirus, adenoviruses, herpes viruses, echovirus, Ebstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, parvovirus B19

- Bacterial: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Haemophilus, Legionella, Mycoplasma

- Fungal: Histoplasma, Aspergillus, Blastomyces, coccidioidomycosis

- Parasites: Toxoplasma, amebic, Chaga disease

**Non-Infectious Causes**

Drugs (cardiotoxic effects or hypersensitivity reactions): procainamide, isoniazid, hydralazine, alcohol, anthracycline, heavy metals

- Post-radiation to the chest cavity

- Systemic inflammatory diseases: Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, Sjogren, mixed connective tissue  disease

- Other inflammatory conditions: Granulomatosis, inflammatory bowel disease

- Metastatic cancers: Especially lung cancer, breast cancer, melanoma

- Primary cardiac tumors: Rhabdomyosarcoma

- Metabolic: Hypothyroidism, Renal failure/uremia

- Vaccine-associated myopericarditis
