The presentation of symptoms for these dysbarisms frequently is vague and delayed. Because of this, it is important to have a low threshold for treatment. In cases of DCI, the definitive diagnosis is often not made until there is a witnessed response to treatment.

For DCI, treatment starts with assessing and stabilizing the airway, breathing, and circulation in the emergency setting. Begin administration of high-flow 100% oxygen early and contact the closest hyperbaric center. Recompression should always be done in a hyperbaric chamber; in-water recompression is dangerous and requires significant advanced planning and equipment. These interventions will shrink bubbles, prevent ischemic damage to tissues, and reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury.

In the setting of tympanic membrane rupture, management includes keeping the ear canal dry and allowing drainage. Ear drops are not recommended unless an infection develops. The patient should follow up with an otolaryngologist. Usually, no other interventions are necessary since the perforations typically heal within 6 weeks. Membrane grafting is rarely needed.

Treatment of inner ear barotrauma is similar to the treatment of middle ear barotrauma. It is important for the patient to avoid blowing their nose. Rest and anti-vertiginous medications are helpful. For both middle ear barotrauma and inner ear barotrauma, Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) recompression and oxygen are unnecessary unless the patient also has signs of DCS or AGE.
