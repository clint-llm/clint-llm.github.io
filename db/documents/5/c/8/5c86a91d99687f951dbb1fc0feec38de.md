Initial evaluation with anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs of the elbow are sufficient for most fractures to determine fracture pattern.  A dedicated radiocapitellar view may also be performed to evaluate for radial head and capitellum fractures.  Images should be examined for associated coronoid, radial head fracture or dislocation, and ulno-humeral congruity

There are several classification systems of olecranon fractures.  The most commonly used is the Mayo classification first described by Morrey in 1993.  The goal of this system was to simplify the classification of olecranon fractures based on fracture comminution, displacement, and stability of the ulno-humeral joint. There are three types, each one further subdivided into type A and B, indicating non-comminuted and comminuted respectively
