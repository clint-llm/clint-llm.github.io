Toxic effects of insulin aspart include hypoglycemia, which is treated by giving glucose, dextrose, or oral carbohydrates to increase blood glucose concentrations. To treat the hypoglycemic episode, patients who can consume oral carbohydrates, including glucose gel, tablets, or glucose-containing food, should consume 15 grams of carbohydrates. Wait 15 minutes after eating the glucose to recheck blood glucose, and if it remains hypoglycemic, repeat the treatment. Once the glucose returns to normal, the patient should eat a meal within the next hour to prevent the recurrence of hypoglycemia.
