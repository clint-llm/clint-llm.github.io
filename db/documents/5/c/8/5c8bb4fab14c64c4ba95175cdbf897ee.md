Accurate epidemiological data are not available due to the rarity of this syndrome. The available information is mainly based on case reports or small case series. BS usually has an onset in childhood or puberty. The episodes repeat every 3 to 4 months over a few years, becoming less frequent as the patient ages. Eventually, the inflammatory attacks cease, and the disease enters a quiescent stage. The largest review of blepharochalasis by Koursh et al. reported on 45 female and 22 male patients. The average age of onset was 11.4 years.
