- Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is an idiopathic, non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic, vascular disease affecting young females.

- FMD commonly affects renal and carotid arteries.

- It traditionally presents as renovascular hypertension but can also manifest as stroke in young adults.

- Diagnosis is by classical â€œstring-of-beads" appearance on angiography.

- Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty without stenting is the primary modality of choice for revascularization.
