Fluoropolymers are ultrafine particles ranging in size from 0.02-0.2 µm

The compounds used in waterproofing products reportedly underwent a formulation change after the passage of Title IV of the Clean Air Act amendments and transitioned from a fluoroalkane structure to the more toxic fluoroalkene structure

Fluoroalkanes contain only single bonds and are more chemically stable and therefore of lower toxicity than fluoroalkenes, which contain double bonds

Because these products have been associated with multiple occurrences of respiratory illness, with hundreds of victims involved in some outbreaks, fluoropolymer-related respiratory illness has become a public health concern. Despite this, a review of the literature on this topic fails to yield a clearly elucidated mechanism to explain why illness develops after exposure to some products and not others.

The most convincing evidence to date regarding a mechanism of disease is the change in fluoropolymer structure (from fluoroalkane to fluoroalkene)
