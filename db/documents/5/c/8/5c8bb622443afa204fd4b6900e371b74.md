Liver lesions have a broad spectrum of pathologies ranging from benign liver lesions such as hemangiomas to malignant lesions such as primary hepatocellular carcinoma and metastasis. Imaging is a crucial step in diagnosing these conditions as liver enzymes can be elevated in up to 9% of individuals in the USA.

**Focal liver lesions generally fall into three main clinical categories.**

- Benign lesions that do not need treatment if they are asymptomatic, including hepatic hemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasias, and benign liver cysts

- Benign lesions that require treatment, including hepatic adenoma, hepatic abscess, and hepatic adenomas

- Malignant lesions, including hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, hepatic angiosarcoma, and liver metastases

**Diffuse liver lesions can be categorized into vascular, inflammatory, and storage diseases.**

**Benign liver lesions can be classified into three categories based on their tissue origin:**

- Cholangiocellar: hepatic cyst, biliary cystadenoma, intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile ducts, peribiliary cyst, intrahepatic bile adenoma

- Hepatocellular: focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatic adenoma

- Mesenchymal: hemangioma, lipoma

Liver ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the primary imaging modalities to diagnose liver lesions. Postcontrast imaging can help distinguish lesions depending on their degree of vascularity and composition. Postcontrast hepatic imaging falls into three distinct phases: the arterial phase, the portal venous phase, and the delayed venous phase.
