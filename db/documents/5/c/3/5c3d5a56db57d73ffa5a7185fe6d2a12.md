The dive reflex can be used to manage and treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).  Though the therapeutic benefit of this reflex has been a known fact since the early 1970s, it is now starting to be used in prehospital settings, offering a simple management option for individuals with regular narrow complex tachyarrhythmias.  When triggering the dive reflex in humans with cold water facial immersion, the primary result is a reflex bradycardia response.  The resultant bradycardia and a related increase in myocardial refractoriness is useful as a non-invasive maneuver for the cessation of PSVT.
