**Use of AMG in Ophthalmology**

The uses of AMG in ophthalmology include

1) Corneal diseases:

- Chemical injuries:

- Acute chemical injuries with a corneal epithelial defect
- As a basement membrane for allo-limbal graft /SLET (simple limbal epithelial transplant) in acute chemical burns
- As a basement membrane for auto-limbal graft /SLET in chronic cases for LSCD (limbal stem cell deficiency)

- In the acute stage of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)

- For surface healing/ perforations/ thinning in long-standing SJS

- Bullous keratopathy

- Aphakic/pseudophakic bullous keratopathy for pain relief with or without anterior stromal puncture
- Epithelial defects

- Persistent epithelial defects
- Neurotrophic ulcers
- Recurrent corneal erosions
- Non-healing ulcers

- Small perforations and thinning

- Multi-layered AMG for tectonic purposes

- After superficial keratectomy for

- Salzmann nodular degeneration 
- Climatic droplet keratopathy
- Superficial corneal scars

2) Conjunctiva

- Chemical and thermal injuries

- To help the healing of epithelial defect in acute burns
- Surface reconstruction in chronic cases

- After trabeculectomy to repair leaking cystic bleb with bleb-thinning using subconjunctival AMG draping with the advancement of the conjunctiva

- Surface healing in acute SJS

- After pterygium excision to cover the bare sclera

- After OSSN (ocular surface squamous neoplasia) excision to cover the bare sclera

- Fornix and eyelid margin reconstruction

- Symblepheron release

3) Socket reconstruction

4) Cultivation of limbal stem cells

- In vivo as SLET

- In vitro as CLAT (conjunctival limbal autograft transplantation)

5) Retinal disorders

- To aid in the closure of recurrent macular holes, post-traumatic chronic macular holes, and recurrent macular holes in pathological myopia

- To promote the repair of retinal breaks
