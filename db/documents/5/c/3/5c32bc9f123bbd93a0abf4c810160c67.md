Bile made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder can lead to gallstone formation. In some patients with gallstones, the stones will pass from the gallbladder into the cystic duct and then into the common bile duct. Most of the choledocholithiasis cases are secondary to the gallstones passage from the gallbladder into the CBD. Primary choledocholithiasis which is the formation of stones within the common bile duct is seen less commonly. Primary choledocholithiasis occurs in the setting of bile stasis, which results in intraductal stone formation. The size of the bile duct increases with age. Older adults with dilated bile ducts and biliary diverticula are at risk for the formation of primary bile duct stones. Less common sources of choledocholithiasis include complicated Mirizzi syndrome or hepatolithiasis. Bile flow is obstructed by stones within the common bile duct, which leads to obstructive jaundice and possibly hepatitis. The stagnant bile can also lead to bactibilia and ascending cholangitis. Cholangitis and sepsis are more common in patients with choledocholithiasis than other sources of bile duct obstruction because a bacterial biofilm typically covers common bile duct stones. The pancreatic duct joins the common bile duct near the duodenum, and therefore, the pancreas may also become inflamed by the obstruction of pancreatic enzymes. This is termed gallstone pancreatitis.
