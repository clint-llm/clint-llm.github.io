EKG can aid the diagnosis of focal atrial tachycardia. EKG features may also inform the origin of focal atrial tachycardias.

- Atrial rate: 100 to 250 BPM

- Ventricular conduction can be variable

- Irregular or irregularly irregular in the setting of variable AV block
- Regular if 1 to 1, 2 to 1, or 4 to 1 AV block

- P wave morphology

- Unifocal, but similar in morphology to each other
- Might be inverted
- Differs from normal sinus P wave

- May exhibit either long RP or short PR intervals

- Rhythm may be paroxysmal or sustained

- May demonstrate an increase in the rate at initiation (i.e., “warm up,” or “rev up”)
- May demonstrate a decrease in the rate at termination (i.e., “cool down”)
