The diagnosis of ACA is often delayed as patients do not report significant symptoms or seek medical attention, and due to the natural history of the disease developing months to years after a tick bite.

Cutaneous lesions in ACA mostly present on the extremities but may be located in other areas, including the abdomen or face, necessitating serologic and histopathologic confirmation. Treatment should be implemented as early as possible to prevent irreversible skin damage.

Lyme borreliosis can be primarily prevented by avoidance of tick bites. When walking in wooded areas, individuals should use personal protective measures to keep safe. These include applying repellents, wearing long sleeves, tucking pant legs into socks or long boots, and wearing light-colored clothing to allow ticks to be more readily visible.
