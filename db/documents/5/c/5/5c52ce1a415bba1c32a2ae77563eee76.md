Papuloerythroderma of Ofuji (PEO) is aÂ rare skin disorder most commonly found in Japan, which is characterized by polygonal, flat-topped erythematous-brown papules coalescing into sheets which often cover the entire skin surface but spare the skin folds. PEO was first discovered in Japan in 1984 by Ofuji, Furukawa, Miyachi, and Ohno.
