While there are few absolute contraindications to muscle or myocutaneous flaps, relative contraindications to include personal or family history of thrombotic or bleeding events, prior radiation to donor areas, history of surgeries potentially compromising the vascular supply of the proposed muscle, and when the sacrifice of the donor muscle would lead to unacceptable disability. For example, when considering either pedicled or free latissimus dorsi flaps, a history of axillary dissection or radiation may have compromised the thoracodorsal vessels, and a different flap may be a consideration. Similarly, in patients who have undergone abdominal surgery through subcostal incisions or had a prior sacrifice of their internal mammary vessels for coronary surgery, pedicled rectus-muscle-based flaps may not have an intact blood supply.Â  In these instances, different options merit consideration. Tobacco use has been implicated in delayed wound healing and is a relative contraindication to flap surgery.
