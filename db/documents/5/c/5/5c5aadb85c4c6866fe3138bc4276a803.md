Treatment predominantly consists of two phases: acute management and definitive treatment once the acute phase has been resolved. Acute treatment aims to alleviate the symptoms and reduce the risk of the spread of infection.

Postoperatively, warm salt water rinses are encouraged, and copious fluid intake to reduce the swelling. Dental practitioners must reassess the lesion and develop a long-term treatment plan as necessary, usually consisting of periodontal therapy.

Exodontia is indicated when the clinician deems tooth prognosis poor or hopeless, whether from periodontal disease or the destruction caused by the abscess.

If the cause of the abscess is an embedded foreign object, this must be removed through debridement, and drainage through the gingival sulcus should be performed either with a periodontal probe or by smooth scaling. Finally, a warm saline rinse is indicated. Follow up after one to two days.

Antimicrobial therapy is only recommended as an adjunct to mechanical treatment in patients with a compromised immune system or with systemic spread.

Patients with multiple periodontal abscesses should be referred for further assessment due to the likelihood of an underlying systemic condition, such as diabetes mellitus.

Periodontal surgery, including gingivectomy or flap procedures, can be used in cases of chronic periodontal abscesses.
