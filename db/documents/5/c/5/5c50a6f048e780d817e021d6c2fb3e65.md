Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare and unpredictable reaction to medication that involves drug-specific CD8+ cytotoxic lymphocytes, the Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) pathway of apoptosis, and granule-mediated exocytosis and tumor necrosis factor-alfa (TNF–alpha)/death receptor pathway.

Current theories address the following mechanisms, among others.

- Granulysin, found in the cytotoxic granules, is the main cause of keratinocyte apoptosis.

- Fas–FasL, expressed on the activated cytotoxic T cells, can also destroy keratinocytes via the production of intracellular caspases.

- Cytotoxic T cells exocytose perforin and granzyme B, which create channels in the target cell membrane activating the caspases.

- TNF–alpha may cause apoptosis or protect from it.

- Nitrous oxide (NO) induced by TNF–alpha and interferon (IFN)–alpha may stimulate caspases.
