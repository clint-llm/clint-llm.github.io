Epiglottitis is an inflammatory condition of the epiglottis and/or nearby structures including the arytenoids, aryepiglottic folds, and vallecula. Epiglottitis is a life-threatening infection that causes profound swelling of the upper airways which can lead to asphyxia and respiratory arrest. This activity reviews the cause, presentation, and pathophysiology of epiglottitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the presentation of a patient with epiglottitis.
- Summarize the treatment options for epiglottitis.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with epiglottitis.
- Explore modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by epiglottitis.
