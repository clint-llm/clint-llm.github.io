Patients should be counseled on the risks of metformin overdose and the importance of adhering to the prescribed dose. Caution should be used in chronic renal disease, and appropriate dose decreases made if metformin therapy is continued. Metformin can still be used in patients with chronic kidney disease without dose adjustment if glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is above 30 ml/min/1.73 m^2, but kidney function must be monitored every 3 to 6 months.

Metformin use should be withdrawn in the setting of hypoxia or hypoperfusion, such as myocardial infarction or shock. It is recommended to withdraw metformin three days after using intravenous iodinated contrast and restart only after kidney function has stabilized. It is also advised to stop metformin two days before general anesthesia.
