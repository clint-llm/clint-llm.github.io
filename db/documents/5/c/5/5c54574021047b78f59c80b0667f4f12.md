Recognizing and diagnosing malaria can be challenging as the symptoms are nonspecific and the diagnosis is uncommon in non-endemic areas. Thus, it is vital that all members of the healthcare team including nurses, midlevel providers, and physicians receive education and training in malaria diagnosis and management. Additionally, skilled laboratory technicians, trained in malaria parasite recognition is key to diagnostic accuracy. If uncertainty exists, a pathologist review may be required. Consultation with infectious disease specialists is often warranted especially in the setting of severe disease.Â Communication and coordination between healthcare providers (primary care provider, nurse practitioner, pharmacist) are critical to patient care.
