Once antibiotic treatment has started, improvement is gradual and may take several weeks. Imaging studies need to be repeated in 4-6 weeks to determine if the lesion is decreasing in size.

Long-termÂ therapy is continued at low doses. If the CD4 count improves and the lesion is resolving then one may consider discontinuing the therapy.
