Currently, there are no universal guidelines for screening for anti-IgA antibodies. Since the presence of anti-IgA antibodies is not a direct predictor of anaphylactic risk, patients who test positive for anti-IgA antibodies may be unnecessarily labeled as “at risk.” These patients would be subject to a lifelong policy of IgA deficient blood products and potentially harmful delays. Therefore, one approach is to only test patients who are at high risk of developing anti-IgA antibodies prior to transfusion of blood products.
