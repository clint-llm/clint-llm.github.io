The origin of TGA is thought to arise from the hippocampus, particularly the CA-1 and Sommer sector, and mediobasal temporal lobe. The hippocampal region noted is a watershed area of the brain that is especially subject to impact from various metabolic stresses, possibly due to sensitivity to cytotoxic glutaminergic uptake or release. These areas can be affected bilaterally or unilaterally, but are most common on the left side.  In functional imaging, however, such as functional MRI, reversible defects were seen bilaterally. The patient transiently develops difficulty forming as well as retrieving new memories.

The presentation seen with TGA correlates with the affected side of the brain.  In bilateral cases, the patient will exhibit both visuospatial and speech-related memory deficits. Dominant brain lesions will demonstrate related speech deficits.
