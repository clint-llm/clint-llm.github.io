Osteofibrous dysplasia is limited mostly to the cortex, and its color is mainly yellow to white with a gritty, fibrous consistency. Microscopically, the characteristic finding is distinct osteoblastic rimming of woven bone trabeculae. A central osteolytic area characterizes it, the tissue being mainly fibrous with some scanty, thin, immature trabeculae of woven bone. Proceeding from the center to the periosteal and medullary spaces, the bone trabeculae became progressively more massive, more numerous, mature, and lamellar, until they join with each other and finally merge with the bone. Osteoblastic rimming shows features of fibrous dysplasia.
