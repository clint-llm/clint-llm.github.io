Any graft or flap needs sufficient wound healing to be successful. Therefore, flaps that have had radiation treatment to them is a contraindication, since this significantly impairs wound healing. Furthermore, any tumor requires complete resection before attempting any reconstruction. An eyelid that is still positive for a residual tumor is a contraindication to repair. Approaches to reconstruction may differ based on whether it is more likely to hide an occult recurrence of the malignancy.
