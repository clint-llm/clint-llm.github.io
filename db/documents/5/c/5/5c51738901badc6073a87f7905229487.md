A complete history of all patients in motor vehicle collisions should be obtained as soon as feasible. Use of restraints, airbag deployment, vehicle velocity, position in the vehicle, etiology of the collision, time of extrication, loss of consciousness, and injury level of others individuals in the accident are all valuable pieces of data in the evaluation of these patients.

Patients should be interviewed as to the presence ofÂ any pain with attention to the potential distracting nature of many injuries.

Complete past medical and surgical history, along with medications and drug allergies, are the high yield in these patients, as many will require an operation.
