Acute alcohol intoxication causes several metabolic abnormalities, including lactic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Laboratory analysis should include a full electrolyte panel as well as liver function tests. Alcohol can cause acute effects on the cardiovascular system, such as atrial and ventricular tachydysrhythmias. An EKG should be obtained. One particular syndrome is known as “holiday heart syndrome,” can develop, which is characterized by new-onset arrhythmias following acute ingestion of alcohol and can include new-onset atrial fibrillation. Serial EKGs should be done if an arrhythmia is found, as the majority will resolve with the elimination of alcohol. If the EKG changes persist, an alternate cause should be considered. In the case of altered mental status, when a full history cannot be elucidated, a CT scan of the brain should be obtained to rule out any intracranial pathology contributing to the patients’ mental status. Many intoxicated patients may state suicidal thoughts or make such gestures. A psychiatric evaluation should be performed and may have to be repeated as the patient becomes more lucid.
