Tetanus is a condition caused by the exotoxin tetanospasmin from Clostridium tetani. Tetanus causes painful muscle contractions, especially in the jaw and neck. Tetanospasmin inhibits the release of glycine and GABA, which are inhibitory neurotransmitters. Without inhibition of the skeletal muscles, sustained contraction occurs.

A stroke is when a portion of the brain does not receive sufficient blood. As a result, stroke symptoms can manifest as motor function deficits should parts of the motor cortex be infarcted. However, this often presents with other symptoms such as speech or vision deficits. A pure motor stroke is possible and is symptomatic of a lacunar stroke, causing infarct of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. This infarct can present with hemiparesis, which is a weakness of one side of the body.
