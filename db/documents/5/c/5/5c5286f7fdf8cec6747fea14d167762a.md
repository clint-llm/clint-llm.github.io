Managing the administration of abacavir to HIV patients requires an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals that includes a nurse, laboratory technologists, pharmacists, social workers, and several physicians in different specialties. After HIV diagnosis, prompt admission into HIV medical and adherence/retention in that care is fundamental to the administration of effective antiretroviral therapy. Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is one of the top factors of favorable HIV treatment outcomes and is necessary to decrease the occurrence of drug resistance within the patient. Common obstacles to successful ART stem from an absence of social support and alcohol or substance abuse, which prevent patients from having sustained therapy.

The emphasis on adherence cannot be overemphasized. Clinicians, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists all must share in the effort to educate the patient and monitor pharmacotherapy adherence. For example, if the patient is chronically late in picking up their prescription, meaning there will be days without therapy, the pharmacist must call the physician's office and share this information with the nurse or prescriber. The pharmacist is also responsible for medication reconciliation and verifying dosing parameters. On follow-up visits, the nurse must verify adherence and should do so by asking open-ended questions that encourage the patient to reveal familiarity with their regimen. Failure to take the drugs in ART correctly can result in therapeutic failure for the entire drug class, as the virus can obtain adaptive drug resistance; this is why any type of ART requires open, interprofessional team communication to ensure the best chance for therapeutic success.

**Recommendations for Increasing Successful Outcomes in Antiretroviral Therapy**

- Initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with a high degree of adherence, defined as greater than 95% refills and plasma drug concentrations above the therapeutic steady-state concentration, is associated with low levels of antiretroviral resistance.

- Individual-level monitoring of entry and retention is a strong recommendation for all people diagnosed with HIV.

- Systematic retention monitoring in HIV care is also strongly recommended for all HIV patients.

- Strengths-based case management from trained social workers increases entry to HIV medical care.

- Self-report adherence should be obtained routinely in all HIV patients.

- Regimens of similar efficacy and tolerability, once-daily regimens are recommended in treatment naïve patients starting ART, as well as experienced patients receiving poorly tolerated/complex regimens.

- Reminders and the use of communication technologies with an interactive component are recommended to increase adherence

- Combining education and counseling using specific adherence-related tools is recommended for all patients with HIV.

- Directly administered ART (DART) is the recommended course of action in individuals with substance use disorders.

- Cognitive-behavioral therapy is recommended in patients with depression to improve adherence.
