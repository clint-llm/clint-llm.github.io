Solitary spider nevus in otherwise healthy individuals or pregnant women does not warrant further workup. A detailed history and focused physical exam can help to attribute multiple spider angioma to liver disease. As a general rule, number and size of spider angioma correlate with the severity of liver disease. In some occasions, history and exam might not point towards nevi and can lead to concerns of skin malignancy, such as basal cell carcinoma. A skin biopsy will be useful in these situations to exclude skin cancer or other conditions.
