KCN has been known since the early days of ophthalmology. The term keratoconus was established later on; originally, there were various names, such as hyperkeratosis or conically formed cornea, all of which described an abnormally deformed and thin cornea, one way or another.

The original description of KCN dates to the early 18th century.  It was first (1854) adequately described and distinguished from other ectatic conditions in the milestone treatise by Nottingham.
