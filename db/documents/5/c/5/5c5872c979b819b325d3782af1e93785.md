On history, the caregivers will report an asymptomatic, scaly eruption on the scalp, and sometimes face, usually by the thrid year of life, that is resistant to at-home remedies. The patient may have a family member with eczema and/or asthma. On physical exam, notable findings include accumulation of greasy yellow scale on the vertex and forehead of the scalp. The face may also be involved, presenting as erythematous scaly plaques on the forehead, eyebrows/eyelids, nasolabial folds, cheeks, and post-auricular areas. Nonetheless, other areas may be implicated such as the umbilical area, diaper zone, and intertriginous areas. The areas affected away from the scalp tend to have less scale with more erythema. In rare cases, the condition can present as an erythrodermic eruption. In this situation, immunodeficiencies and vitamin deficiencies should be considered by the clinician.
