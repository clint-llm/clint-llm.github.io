Overdose can be life-threatening. The presentation can be delayed for up to 30 hours since the drug decreases gastric emptying and hence takes time to reach toxic levels in the blood. Symptoms vary from anticholinergic to opioid toxidromes, like respiratory depression, tachypnea, coma, delirium, lethargy, hyperthermia, tachycardia, dryness of mucous membranes, mydriasis or miosis, encephalopathy, seizures. The respiratory depression might correlate with the accumulation of difenoxin, which is an active metabolite of diphenoxylate. The recommended treatment for toxicity is naloxone if the patient exhibits respiratory depression. Considerations may be given for gastric lavage and administration of activated charcoal if indicated.

Close monitoring for 24 hours is advisable in significant overdose or those with concerning symptoms. Naloxone is a pure mu (opioid) receptor antagonist which reverses the opioid toxicity effects caused by diphenoxylate toxicity. Recurrent episodes of respiratory depression require repeated doses of naloxone or infusion.
