There are many potential causes of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. When a patient is being worked up for an underlying cause of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, the interprofessional healthcare teamÂ may need a consultation to determine the proper diagnosis and treatment for a patient. An internal medicine team will often begin the workup or discover the diagnosis. Neurology may need to assist with neuromuscular disorders and to help determine the location of lesions and the underlying cause. Surgery teams can assist in treatments, or the condition may result from previous surgery. Pulmonary and cardiology teams may be consulted, as dyspnea and respiratory failure can ensue if the condition remains untreated, and it will often mimic cardiac disorders. If respiratory failure does occur, a critical care team should be on board for closer monitoring and ventilator management.

Once considered in a differential, an X-ray was traditionally used to screen, and fluoroscopy was then used to confirm the diagnosis. This process took time and caused patient radiation exposure. With ultrasound being so radially available and advanced, radiation has been replaced by bedside ultrasound with similar diagnostic outcomes in most instances.
