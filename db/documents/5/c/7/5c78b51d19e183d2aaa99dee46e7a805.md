An important topic of debate amongst physicians in regards to treatment for otitis media is the sequela if left untreated. As discussed above, otitis media can progress to mastoiditis, which can have fatal complications. Many cases of otitis media are viral; however, patients are still receiving antibiotic therapy. From the prescriber perspective, it is extremely difficult to tell based on physical examination if the patient's infection is bacterial or viral. Of course, the patient's history can aid in the diagnosis, but it is still challenging. Furthermore, the physician must consider the sequela of the infection if left untreated.

Ultimately, this can lead to overprescribing antibiotics and poor stewardship, which can lead to resistant infections. To enhance patient outcomes, the physician must take a thorough history, adequate physical, discuss with the patient or patient family, and specialist, if possible, because something as simple as an ear infection can ultimately lead to death. Finally, to enhance outcomes of the healthcare system as a whole, there should be further studies and additional consideration given to outpatient management non-complicated acute mastoiditis. Avoiding hospital admissions prevents iatrogenic complications, increases patient satisfaction, and reduces healthcare costs.
