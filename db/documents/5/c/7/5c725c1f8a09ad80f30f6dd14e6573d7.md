Adenosine has uses as both a diagnostic and therapeutic agent. Adenosineâ€™s use as a pharmacological drug works through receptors called purinergic adenosine receptors found throughout the body. As a diagnostic agent, adenosine can be utilized in myocardial perfusion stress imaging due to its vasodilatory effects. As a therapeutic agent, adenosine can be used due to its antiarrhythmic properties in supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, activity, adverse events, and other critical elements of adenosine use and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing the care of patients receiving adenosine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of adenosine, and explain how it works in treating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
- Outline the diagnostic significance of adenosine in cardiac stress testing.
- Summarize the most common adverse events associated with adenosine.
- Review the importance of coordinating and collaborating among various disciplines in an interprofessional health team to coordinate care and management to enhance outcomes for patients receiving adenosine.
