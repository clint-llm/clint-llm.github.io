Androgen insensitivity syndrome and individuals with cryptorchid testes have an increased risk of tumorigenesis. Cryptorchidism in partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS) should be corrected surgically soon after diagnosis to maintain testicular function and minimize the risk of malignancy. These tumors may be germ cell tumors and gonadoblastomas. They tend to occur in approximately 1.5 to 2 percent of undescended testes and may become malignant.
