**Pectus Excavatum**

Exact etiology is unknown. The current hypothesis focuses on collagen metabolism impairment; this causes a sternal cartilage overgrowth that results in the sternocostal joint deformity (sternum protrusion). Pectus deformities are mostly isolated diseases; however, research has linked genetic mutation involvement. In inheritance scenarios, syndromic association highlights are; autosomal dominant (Marfan and Noonan syndromes), autosomal recessive (osteogenesis imperfecta I, III, IV types), and X-chromosomal inheritances with an underlying connective tissue strong association. Non-syndromic familiar inheritance highlight is autosomal dominant inheritance.

**Pectus Carinatum**

The same pectus excavatum etiology hypothesis has been proposed. However, a mutation in the COL2A1 gene (collagen type II encoding impairment) links to pectus carinatum deformity. The familiar genetic trigger association is the same as in pectus excavatum.

**Poland Syndrome**

Etiology is thought more to result from an in utero event than an inheritance situation, but familial cases should not be dismissed. The exact etiology remains undefined. The hypothesis with greater acceptance favors an intrauterine vascular insult that consists of embryonic blood supply interruption in subclavian or vertebral arteries, leading to different malformations (limb and chest wall). Another important proposed hypothesis is a lateral plate mesoderm development disruption. Lately, some research has related teratogenicity with drugs, misoprostol, and tobacco use during pregnancy.

**Sternal Clefts**

Sternal cleft etiology consists of ventral cell migration and sternal bands fusion failure in the sixth to the ninth gestational week. This embryonic developmental disorder carries an association with Hoxb gene mutations with dominance possibility.

**Ectopia Cordis**

Etiology is unknown. The deformity core is an embryonic VFM (ventral folding morphogenesis) impairment. Early chorionic and/or yolk sac rupture at third or four gestational weeks have been the most accepted hypothesis to explain this event. Lately, in genetic etiology pathways terms (gene mutation), BMP2 (bone morphogenetic protein 2) expression impairment has been linked to VFM impairment. Genetic trigger association is unknown; however, it has links with major chromosomal anomalies (e.g., Turner syndrome, 18 trisomies). The genetic risk depends on the underlying syndrome association.

**Jeunes Syndrome**

The etiology is an autosomal recessive mutation on chromosome 7 genes, which encode proteins that participle in ITF (intraflagellar transport), specifically IFT80. However, lately, DYNC2H1 gene mutation, which encodes the dynein-2 protein complex (cilia structure component), has been reported as the main etiology core. Genetic risk is 25% (1 in 4), 50% 1 in 2), and 25% do not have the deformity.

**Jarcho-Levin Syndrome**

Etiology depends on the Jarcho Levin syndrome phenotypes. Spondylocostal dysostosis links to DLL3 and MESP2 gene mutations, which can be a dominant or recessive autosomal inheritance. Spondylothoracic dysostosis is an autosomal recessive inheritance without DLL3 gene mutation. PAX1 and/or PAX9 (family PAX genes) mutation also has been linked to Jarcho Levin syndrome. The genetic risk depends on positive genetic carriers.
