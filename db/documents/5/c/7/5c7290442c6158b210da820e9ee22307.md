Penile fracture is uncommon, but it is essential to note this specific urogenital injury. The majority of penile fractures occur with direct trauma during sexual intercourse. Direct trauma to an erect penis results in increased pressure in the cavernosa. This increased pressure, in turn, results in the rupture of the tunica albuginea. Delay in the treatment of penile fracture can lead to long-lasting sexual and anatomical dysfunction. Penile fracture is considered a urological emergency. Given the sequelae of this injury, this article will review the identification, prompt treatment, and long-term management of penile fractures.
