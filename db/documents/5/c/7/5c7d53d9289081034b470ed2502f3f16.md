Cardiovascular disease is consistently cited as a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide.  Maternal heart disease is a comorbidity in 0.2 to 3% of all pregnancies. As this subset of patients is increasingly encountered, institutions are choosing to develop management pathways to minimize morbidity and mortality through highly coordinated multidisciplinary teams.  In addition to an increasing magnitude of mothers with co-existing cardiovascular disease (i.e., pulmonary hypertension, mitral regurgitation, aortic aneurysm, etc.), patients with congenital heart disease who underwent corrective surgery are surviving longer and choosing to become pregnant.  This creates an interesting subset of the patient population that requires an intentional and frequently multispeciality approach to their anesthetic management during labor, delivery, and cesarean section.

**Risk Stratification**

Ideally, developing an anesthetic plan for a high-risk cardiac patient should begin preconception or early in pregnancy so the patient can better comprehend the risks involved with pregnancy and the anesthetic plan that may be best for the expectant mother.  Risk stratification and discussion amongst an interprofessional team of physicians are especially important for patients with congenital heart disease.

A wide array of risk stratification tools are available to help the physician direct the intensity of an anesthetic plan and the patient towards hospitals of varying resources.  Examples of these risk stratification tools include Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy (CARPEG) I & II, Zwangerschap bij Aangeboren Hartafwijking (ZAHARA), and World Health Organization (WHO) risk stratification calculators. CARPREG I & II and ZAHARA determine the likelihood of a significant cardiac event based on individual maternal risk factors. In contrast, the WHO risk stratification system divides individuals into four risk categories.
