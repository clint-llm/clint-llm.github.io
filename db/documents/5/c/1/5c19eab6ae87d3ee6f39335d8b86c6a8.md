Wallenberg syndrome is the most prevalent posterior ischemic stroke syndrome. There are nearly 800,000 patients who suffer from acute stroke each year in the United States. Of these, 83% are ischemic strokes. Twenty percent of ischemic strokes occur in the posterior circulation. If clinicians assume that about half of these suffer from Wallenberg syndrome, it can be estimated that there are more than 60,000 new cases of Wallenberg syndrome each year in the United States.

The condition shows a predominance for men in their sixth decade. Large artery atherothrombotic causes account for about 75% of the cases, followed by cardioembolism in 17% and vertebral dissection in 8%.
