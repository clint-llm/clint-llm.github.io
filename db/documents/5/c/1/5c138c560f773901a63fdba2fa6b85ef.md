In most patients, treatment halts the disease progression and results in clinical and radiological improvement of neurological deficits. However, the degree of improvement varies. While 86 % show clinical resolution after treatment, only 14 % attain complete clinical resolution. The degree of anemia and level of serum vitamin B12 does not affect the prognosis of subacute combined degeneration. However, patients with the following characteristics tend to have better short-term neurological outcomes:

- Age < 50 years

- Short disease course

- Absence of sensory deficits

- Absence of Romberg's sign

- Absence of Babinski's signs

- Involvement of ≤ 7 spinal segments on MRI

- Presence of spinal cord edema

- Contrast enhancement of the spine

- Absence of spinal cord atrophy
