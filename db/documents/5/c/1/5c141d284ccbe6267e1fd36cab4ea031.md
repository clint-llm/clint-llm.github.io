The differential diagnosis is broad and includes conjunctivitis, corneal abrasion, uveitis hemangiomas, dermoids, nasal gliomas, and infantile glaucoma. The absence of associated signs and symptoms distinguishes congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) from other causes of persistent tearing.

Most infants with congenital NLDO can be diagnosed and managed by the primary care practitioner. Referral to an ophthalmologist is warranted if the diagnosis is uncertain, particularly if there is any concern of glaucoma or signs or symptoms of dacryocystitis or dacryocystocele.
