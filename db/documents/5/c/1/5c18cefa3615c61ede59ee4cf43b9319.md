Trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus (TSPyV) is classified under theÂ family: Polyomaviridae, genus: Alphapolyomavirus, and species: Human polyomavirus 8.

Polyomaviruses are about 45 nanometers in size, with an icosahedral capsid enclosing a circular, double-stranded DNA genome.poly, meaning multiple, and the suffix oma, meaning tumor, based on the ability of certain polyomaviruses to induce tumor formation in immunocompromised animals.

Human polyomaviruses are ubiquitous in the human population but typically asymptomatic.
