The cardiac cells can only propagate action potentials because of an electrochemical potential gradient across cellular membranes. Ions, mainly sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), and calcium (Ca2+), are present in different concentrations inside the cells vs. their surrounding environments. Sodium and calcium concentrations are more extracellular, while potassium is present at a higher concentration inside the cell.

**Pacemaker Cells**

Characteristically, a pacemaker action potential has only three phases, designated phases zero, three, and four.

- Phase zero is the phase of depolarization. This phase starts when the membrane potential reaches -40 mV, the threshold potential for pacemaker cells. There is the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels on reaching the threshold, causing the influx of Ca2+ ions. This influx of cation results in an upstroke in membrane potential from -40 mV to +10mV. Because calcium channels are slow channels (compared to sodium channels), the upstroke is not as steep as that of cardiomyocytes.

- Phases one and two are not present in pacemaker cells. As a result, phase zero is followed by phase three.

- Phase three is repolarization, involving the closing of Ca2+ channels, blocking the flow of Ca2+ ions. Voltage-gated K+ channels open, allowing for efflux of K+ ions. This efflux of cation contributes to a rapid decrease of membrane potential from +10 mV to -60mV.

- Phase four, a phase of gradual depolarization, is unique to the pacemaker cells. This gradual depolarization mainly occurs via a depolarization current or pacemaker current (If). Pacemaker current occurs due to the slow influx of Na+ ions through the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN channel).

**Cardiomyocyte**

The myocardiocyte action potential is different from that of pacemaker cells and has five phases, zero through four. Phase 0 is the phase of depolarization; Phase 1 through 3 is the phases during which repolarization occurs; Phase 4 is the resting phase with no spontaneous depolarization.

- During phase zero, the phase of rapid depolarization, voltage-gated Na+ channels open, resulting in a rapid influx of Na+ ions. Because of the influx of the cation, the membrane potential changes from -70mV to +50mV. The voltage-gated sodium channels are faster channels than calcium channels, and hence we get a steep upstroke of the action potential.

- In phase one, there is inactivation of the previously opened voltage-gated Na+ channels along with the activation of transient outward potassium current (Ito). A slight drop in the membrane electrochemical potential results in the initiation of phase two.

- During phase two or the Plateau phase, Ca2+ influx occurs through an opening of voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels. This calcium influx balances the K+ efflux, creating a plateau at around an electrochemical potential of +50mV. This plateau is a component of the Effective refractory period, during which the influx of Ca2+ also stimulates the calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, initiating muscle contraction. No initiation of new action potentials can occur during this period (Absolute Refractory Period)

- Repolarization follows in phase three, involving K+ efflux through the opening of rapid delayed rectifier K+ channels and closing of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels.

**Dispersion of Repolarization**

- In the heart, the wave of depolarization current originates in the SA node under normal conditions and reaches the ventricular myocardium via the conduction system. Anatomically the ventricular depolarization travels from apex to base and from endocardium to epicardium. The wave of repolarization moves in the opposite direction from epicardium to endocardium. Thus the action potential duration is not the same across the thickness of the ventricular wall, with cardiomyocytes near the epicardium depolarizing last and repolarizing first. Time taken by M cells for repolarization is the longest, while that of endocardial cells is intermediate between epicardial and M cells. This difference is due to an intrinsic difference in the activity of the various ion channels between the three cell types. Hence there is a transmural dispersion in the process of repolarization. Thus dispersion of repolarization is defined as a difference in repolarization time (activation time plus action potential duration).

- Transmural dispersion of repolarization is significant clinically because it can lead to arrhythmia by forming re-entry circuits. These re-entry circuits are an essential factor in maintaining Torsades de pointes.

**Repolarization Reserve**

Roden coined the concept of repolarization reserve to address the difficulty in predicting the development of Torsades de pointes with the use of drugs that prolongs repolarization in different individuals. Repolarization reserve means that under normal physiologic conditions, there is a significant reserve in outward repolarization current. Thus repolarization is not controlled by the action of a single ion channel, and there are considerable overlap and redundancy between the opening and closing of different ion channels. Thus a drug that blocks one channel, for example, IKs, will not cause the failure of depolarization or marked QT prolongation unless there is also a concurrent blocking of another channel; this shows that when one channel fails, other channels take over.

Some of the crucial currents that affect Repolarization reserve are

- Persistent inward sodium current (INa) – Normally, after phase 0, the current through the sodium channel decreases and does not contribute significantly to cardiac action potential duration. However, it does not entirely cease, and a small inward current exists during the plateau phase. There is an increase in this inward current in certain conditions like heart failure and Long QT syndrome Type 3 (LQTS 3). Because of this, more potassium should move outside the cell to balance this and cause repolarization, thus decreasing the outward repolarizing current reserve. INa is inherently more prominent in the M cells than the epicardial and endocardial cells

- Rapid delayed rectifier outward potassium current (IKr) – This channel activates rapidly on depolarization, but its inactivation precedes depolarization mediated activation. Then around the end of phase 2, it opens rapidly when membrane potential becomes more negative and then inactivates slowly. This current is the primary repolarizing current, which contributes to phase 3 of the action potential. A drug that only blocks this channel, when given in higher concentration, can cause QT prolongation by itself (Class 3 anti-arrhythmic). It shows that this is the primary current responsible for maintaining the repolarization reserve. This channel's activity is affected in many conditions, like in long QT syndrome type 2. Serum potassium levels also affect this current. When serum potassium levels decrease, more of these channels are internalized and hence decrease the strength of the current. Thus hypokalemia causes QT prolongation, while in hyperkalemia, QT interval becomes shortened. Also, due to the specific kinetics of this channel, when any cause prolongs the action potential duration, the activity of IKr decreases, thereby forming a positive loop and hence causing more QT prolongation

- Slow delayed rectifier outward potassium current (IKs) – This channel activates slowly during phase 2 and deactivates rapidly. Under normal physiologic conditions, IKs do not significantly contribute to Phase 3 of repolarization. However, during conditions like increased sympathetic stimulation or blocked IKr, the current passing through this channel increases. Thus IKs provide a repolarization reserve or a physiologic check to prevent excess action potential duration lengthening and QT prolongation. This current is defective in Long QT syndrome type 1. This current is more active in the epicardial and endocardial cells and intrinsically weak in the M cells. Thus any physiologic or pathologic conditions that increase or decrease this current will affect the cells in these regions differently and increase the transmural dispersion of repolarization.

- Inward rectifier potassium current (IK1) - This channel is open during diastole. Its primary function as repolarization reserve is to prevent spontaneous delayed after depolarization during Phase 4 of the action potential.

Other channels like Sodium Potassium ATPase, L-type Ca channel also affect the repolarization reserve. Thus, the degree of QT prolongation when we block a particular potassium channel by either cardiac or non-cardiac drug is dependent on which channel we are blocking and the functioning of the other channels that affect the repolarization reserve.
