Symptoms of heart failure include those due to excess fluid accumulation (dyspnea, orthopnea, edema, pain from hepatic congestion, and abdominal distention from ascites) and those due to a reduction in cardiac output (fatigue, weakness) most pronounced with physical exertion.

Acute and subacute presentations (days to weeks) are characterized by shortness of breath at rest and/or with exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and right upper quadrant discomfort due to acute hepatic congestion (right heart failure). Palpitations, with or without lightheadedness, can occur if patients develop atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Chronic presentations (months) differ in that fatigue, anorexia, abdominal distension, and peripheral edema may be more pronounced than dyspnea. The anorexia is secondary to several factors, including poor perfusion of the splanchnic circulation, bowel edema, and nausea induced by hepatic congestion.

Characteristic features:

- Pulsus alternans phenomenon characterized by evenly spaced alternating strong and weak peripheral pulses.

- Apical impulse: Laterally displaced past the midclavicular line, usually indicative of left ventricular enlargement.

- S3 gallop: A low-frequency, brief vibration occurring in early diastole at the end of the rapid diastolic filling period of the right or left ventricle. It is the most sensitive indicator of ventricular dysfunction.

- Peripheral edema

- Pulmonary rales

**New York Heart Association Functional Classification**

Based on symptoms, the patients can be classified using the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification as follows:

- Class I: Symptom onset with more than ordinary level of activity

- Class II: Symptom onset with an ordinary level of activity

- Class III: Symptom onset with minimal activity

- Class IV: Symptoms at rest
