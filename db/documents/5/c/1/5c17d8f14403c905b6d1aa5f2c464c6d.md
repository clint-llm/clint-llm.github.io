Brachycephaly is an infant skull deformity characterized by a shortened anteroposterior skull length and a widened biparietal diameter. This condition may be non-synostotic (positional) or synostotic (craniosynostosis). Accurate diagnosis of the type of brachycephaly is paramount in determining the appropriate treatment options. Positional brachycephaly and/or plagiocephaly are the most common head-shape abnormality, affecting between 20% and 50% of infants in the United States. The incidence of infant positional skull deformities has been on the rise since 1992. This activity reviews the evaluation and management options for brachycephaly and highlights the role of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of positional brachycephaly.
- Summarize the pathophysiology of synostotic brachycephaly.
- Identify the indication for neck physiotherapy in infants with brachycephaly.
- Outline the importance of interprofessional team coordination in the management of patients with brachycephaly.
