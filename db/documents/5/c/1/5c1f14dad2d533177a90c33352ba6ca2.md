The surgeon can prescribe adequate pain medication, as patients often report mild pain for about 3 days post-operatively. To minimize edema and ecchymosis, the patient should intermittently ice the bridge of the nose and eyes for the first 24 hours, sleep with the head elevated for 1 week, and avoid rigorous activity for 2 weeks. The patient may be given a low-dose corticosteroid taper and/or Arnica montana to help lessen bruising and swelling. Patients are asked to return at 7 days for cast and suture removal, at which time they may be given “nasal massage exercises” to help resolve swelling. The patient may be instructed to continue nasal taping if residual supra-tip fullness, external deviation, tip edema, and nostril deformities are present. The patient should avoid putting direct pressure on the bridge (e.g., with glasses) until 6 weeks postoperatively. Return visits occur at 6 weeks and 6 months for further wound assessment. Photographic documentation should occur at around 12 months postoperatively.

Patients should understand that it may require several weeks for the majority of edema to resolve postoperatively, particularly in thick-skinned patients and/or patients where the surgeon performed excessive tip manipulation. Moreover, incremental nasal refinement occurs for up to 1 to 2 years after surgery. The patient may benefit from steroid injections to the tip if significant swelling lingers post-operatively.
