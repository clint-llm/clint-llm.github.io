Mucoceles and ranulas result when there is a disruption of the flow of secretions of the salivary glands mostly due to trauma and present as asymptomatic swellings in the oral cavity. Usually, they tend to resolve spontaneously but sometimes may interfere with swallowing, speech, or respiration. Therefore, in such cases, these lesions must be promptly diagnosed and treated. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of mucoceles and ranulas and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of mucocele and ranula.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of mucocele and ranula.
- List the management options available for mucocele and ranula.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance mucocele and ranula and improve outcomes.
