While transverse myelitis cannot be prevented, patient education will help in understanding the prognosis, disease course, diagnostic workup, and treatment options. Counseling of the risks and benefits of high dose steroids is very important. Education of the natural course of the disease that approximately one-third have a full recovery, one-third will have a partial recovery, and another third will have permanent disabilities is very important. It is also important to educate that the disease is often a monophasic illness and that the disease will only not recur unless it is secondary to a chronic comorbid condition. Steroids and immunosuppression are the only potential treatments for acute TM at this time, but there is potential for monoclonal antibody drugs that might alter the disease course. Recovery from the disease will require intensive physical therapy and occupational therapy to maximize good outcomes.
