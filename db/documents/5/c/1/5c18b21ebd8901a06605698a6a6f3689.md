The pathogenesis of all types of mastocytosis is the result of chronic and episodic discharge of mast cell mediators and excessive accumulation of mast cells in one or more tissues. Mast cells contain a range of vasoactive mediators and usually operate by releasing these chemicals to produce inflammatory reactions to safeguard the body from microbial invaders and other insults. The signs and symptoms connected with the sudden and widespread release of the mast cell mediator are comparable to allergic and anaphylactic reactions.

Mast cell production is under the regulation of a gene named KIT, which encodes CD117 transmembrane tyrosine kinase. CD117 helps in the growth, survival as well as the migration of mast cells. Once the progenitors get produced, they migrate to various tissue and acquire different phenotypes specific to the tissues. Activating and inactivating mutations of KIT are implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic mastocytosis. mutation is associated with eosinophilia. Other mutations, namely TET2, IgE, JAK2V617F, and RAS, have associations with systemic mastocytosis as well.
