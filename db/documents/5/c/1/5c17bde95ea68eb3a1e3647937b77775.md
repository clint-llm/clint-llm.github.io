Prescribing spherical equivalents is contraindicated for the following classes of individuals:

- Young children with moderate to high astigmatic errors, which have been proven to pose a great risk of amblyogenesis

- In cases of accommodative anomalies, especially accommodative infacility and accommodative excess, neglecting manifest astigmatism. The recommendation of equivalent spherical correction would only fail to account for innate accommodative impulses like blur and diplopia.

- Conditions that precipitate visual impairment via irregular astigmatism require consideration of their cylindrical errors for rigid contact lens fitting. This includes individuals with clinically evident corneal ectasia, as well as subclinical cases that are only observed via keratometry or keratography.

- Cases of refractable (early-to-moderate) pathological myopia also require a full sphero-cylindrical prescription.

- Refractive correction in the presence of co-existent moderate or large angle ocular deviations (chiefly strabismus).

- Correction of refractive error prior to ptosis surgery.

- Individuals fitting the low vision criteria that gain better LogMAR visual acuity with full sphero-cylindrical correction.

- Spherical equivalent prescriptions are also contraindicated for correcting moderate to high oblique astigmatic errors, even amongst adults.
