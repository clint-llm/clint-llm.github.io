Traumatic injury, malignancy, infection, or congenital deformity of the upper extremity can lead to amputation. Surgeons have different surgical options to improve the potential of using prosthetic technologies for this group of patients. Targeted muscle reinnervation is a surgical procedure to enhance the control of myoelectric upper limb prostheses, and it helps to prevent and treat painful postamputation neuromas. This technique was originally described for transhumeral amputations and shoulder disarticulations but nowadays it has also been applied in the treatment of transtibial, transfemoral, transradial, and partial hand amputees.
