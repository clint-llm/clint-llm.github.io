Traditionally, beta-blockers are classified as selective and non-selective depending on the receptor specificity. Specificity is, however, lost in cases involving overdose. To better understand the toxicity, beta-blockers are classified as lipophilic or lipophobic. Highly lipophilic beta-blockers can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and may cause various central nervous system (CNS) manifestations. While CNS manifestations secondary to beta-blocker overdose are primarily attributed to lipophilicity, water-soluble beta-blockers, for example, atenolol, may also cause tiredness and fatigue.

Various metabolic and circulatory pathways are dependent on circulating catecholamine that, in turn, is switched off by beta-blockade. While hypotension, bradycardia, decreased myocardial contractility and oxygen consumption account for the hemodynamic instability, hypoglycemia secondary to inhibition of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis may also occur.
