The exact etiology of otosclerosis is still unclear. The multiple etiologies that have been postulated include:

**Anatomical:**The most commonly affected part seems to be the fissula ante fenestram, where the remnants of the embryonic cartilage persist.

**Genetic:**Many loci on chromosomes 6p, 9p, 1q, 3q, 6q, 7q, 15q, and 16q have been identified. In an open genome-wide analysis, a new locus on chromosome 7q22.1 has also been found. Besides, different genes that are involved including type I collagen (COL1A1 gene), TGF-beta 1 (BMP 2 and BMP 4 genes), angiotensin II (AGT M235T and ACE I/D genes), sex hormones, autoimmune reaction, human leucocyte antigen, inflammatory and regulatory cytokines, parathyroid hormone and expression of parathyroid hormone-related peptides receptors, and oxidative stress have also been regarded as causes of otosclerosis.

**Hereditary:**In more than half of the patients presenting with otosclerosis, there is a positive family history. Also, patients with a positive family history have an earlier onset of otosclerosis. Genetic studies show that an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with reduced penetrance (40%) and a variable expressivity is found in most of the cases.

**Sex:**The prevalence of otosclerosis is more in women compared to men suggesting the role of sex hormones.

**Ethnicity:**Otosclerosis is more common in Whites. However, it is rarer in the Black population.

**Age:**Hearing loss is more commonly seen between the second and the third decade.

**Pregnancy:**Pregnancy does worsen deafness in osteosclerosis; however, the relationship of pregnancy with otosclerosis is still controversial.

**Viral Infections:**The role of measles virus infection in the pathogenesis of otosclerosis has been postulated. Measles virus ribonucleic acid has been detected in the footplate of stapes on electron microscopy and immunohistochemical studies. Moreover, vaccination against measles virus is a protective factor against otosclerosis because of the significant decrease in the incidence of vaccinated populations.

In addition to the above factors, menopause, trauma, or a major operation have been associated with either causing or aggravating otosclerosis.
