Microsurgical instrument sets and either loupe magnification or an operating microscope are necessary for muscle or myocutaneous free flap surgery. Additional pharmacologic agents such as lidocaine or papaverine should be available to address vasospasm. In cases where microvascular anastomoses are the plan (whether free tissue transfer or supercharging pedicled flaps), heparinized saline and IV thrombolytics should be available. Hand-held doppler units should be utilized in the operating room. When available, various tissue monitoring devices or implantable doppler devices may be helpful in the perioperative period.Â  Local or pedicled muscle flaps do not require any specialized equipment beyond a typical plastic surgery set.
