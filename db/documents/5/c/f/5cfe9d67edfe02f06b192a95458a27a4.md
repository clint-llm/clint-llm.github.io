The articular surface of the patella consists of 7 facets: 3 medial and 3 lateral facets that articulate with the femoral groove when the knee is flexed, and a facet on the medial border that only articulates with the medial femoral condyle in deep knee flexion when patellar rotation is beyond 90 degrees. Many variations in facet size and configuration have been identified. The Wiberg classification system is used to describe the shape of the patella based on the asymmetry of the medial and lateral facets. Type I, with a prevalence of about 10%, is characterized by concave, nearly symmetrical facets. A type II patella has a medial facet that is flat or slightly convex and much smaller than the lateral facet. Type II patellas are the most common with a prevalence of nearly 65%. A type III patella, which is found in 25% of people, also has a smaller medial facet like that of type II, but the medial facet in a type III patella is always convex.

Many other anatomical variations of the patella have been described, including hypo and hyperplastic variants, patella parva and patella magna, respectively. A “hunter’s cap” patella is one in which the lateral facet accounts for almost the entire articular surface of the patella. Half-moon and pebble-shaped patellas have also been described.
