Cardiovascular diseases cause 1 in 6 deaths in the US in 2006, and each year about 795,000 people will have strokes.

Major modifiable risk factors include high lipid values, diabetes, overweight, and obesity.

Once the decline in cardiac function becomes evident, assessment by echocardiogram is warranted. When ejection fraction, the SV divided by the end-diastolic volume, is greater than or equal to 50%, the condition is called diastolic heart failure or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).

Acute failure of the heart, with reduced CO, and the ability to perfuse tissue is called shock. Four primary categories exist based on origin: cardiogenic, distributive, hypovolemic, and obstructive.
