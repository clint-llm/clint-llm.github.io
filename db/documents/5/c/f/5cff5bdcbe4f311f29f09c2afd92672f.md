The clinical presentation of a patient with STS is vague and non-specific. Morphologic diagnosis based on microscopic examination remains the gold standard. Ancillary testing (including using IHC, classical cytogenetics, and molecular testing) aids in diagnosis. The WHO recognizes more than 70 different subtypes of sarcoma.

- Meningioma

- Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST)

- Leiomyoma

- Dedifferentiated liposarcoma

- Endometrial stromal sarcoma

- Smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP)Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor

- Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor
