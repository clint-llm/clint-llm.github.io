The incidence of infectious neonatal conjunctivitis ranges from 1% to 2%.

The epidemiology of neonatal conjunctivitis changed when silver nitrate solution was introduced in the 1800s to prevent gonococcal ophthalmia.Chlamydia is the most common infectious agent that causes ophthalmia neonatorum in the United States, where 2% to 40% of neonatal conjunctivitis cases are caused by Chlamydia.

In contrast, the incidence of gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum has been reduced dramatically and causes less than 1% of cases of neonatal conjunctivitis.
