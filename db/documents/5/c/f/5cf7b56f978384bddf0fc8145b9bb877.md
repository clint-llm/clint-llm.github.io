Although the exact pathogenesis of acquired perforating dermatosis is unclear, many hypotheses exist. Patients with APD will often exhibit the Koebner phenomenon, where skin lesions develop at the sites of trauma and are exacerbated by scratching.

Another postulated theory is that self-induced trauma to the skin damages the epidermis or dermal collagen which eventually causes the onset of APD.

Moreover, leukocyte infiltration observed in skin lesions secretes interleukin-1, which is a stimulator of the synthesis of metalloproteinases, resulting in the degrading of the components of the extracellular matrix.

Finally, according to some authors, the interplay of microtrauma, altered wound-healing capacities and tissue hypoxia caused by diabetes and also the microangiopathy and oxidative stress associated with CRF are considered to be theÂ triggers of acquired perforating dermatosis.
