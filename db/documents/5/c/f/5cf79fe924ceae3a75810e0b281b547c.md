The potent zinc proteinase neurotoxin binds to extracellular receptors on cholinergic nerve terminals, cleaving one of the three (SNARE) solubleÂ N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor proteins. This action causes reversible inhibition of the release of acetylcholine by presynaptic vesicles intracellularly, leading to a transient restraint of neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction.
