Heterozygous FH (HeFH) is the most common monogenic, autosomal dominant disorder in humans. It occurs in approximately one in 300  people. Homozygous FH (HoFH) has a prevalence of one in 160,000 to 500,000 people. The prevalence is 18 times higher in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and almost 21 times higher in patients with premature ischemic heart disease. The prevalence of FH is higher in Dutch Afrikaners, French Canadians, Ashkenazi Jews, Christian Lebanese, and some Tunisian groups. There is a “gene dosing effect,” and homozygotes are more severely affected than heterozygotes.
