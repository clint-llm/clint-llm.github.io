Divers using rebreathers are subject to additional risks for oxygen toxicity, hypoxia, and hypercarbia above and beyond those associated with traditional open circuit SCUBA. Divers using rebreathers can also get all forms of decompression illness, including decompression sickness and overexpansion injuries, that an open circuit diver can get. Carbon dioxide absorbents are also limited in their ability to bindÂ CO2, and this limitation also functionally limits the time the rebreather can be used without replenishment. The key to preventing these injuries is education. Healthcare workers, including the primary care physician, sports physicians, hyperbaric specialists, and nurse practitioners, should educate patients on the dangers of deep-sea diving, such as decompression sickness, as well as potential dangers from the use of rebreathers. This interprofessional team can help improve diving safety. [Level 5]
