To improve patient outcomes, a thorough examination of the skin is vital. This exam should include often overlooked surfaces, including plantar surfaces of extremities, web spaces, and acral regions, including the scalp. Plantar melanomas are characteristically late to be diagnosed, have a poorer response to treatment, and have a significantly higher mortality rate when compared to more proximal melanomas. Therefore, a simple clinical evaluation looking for asymmetry, irregular borders, color variation, diameter greater than 6 mm, and change over time or lesion elevation is important. If there is ever a doubt about a skin lesion, a biopsy should be performed. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of melanocytic nevi and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors for melanocytic nevi.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with melanocytic nevi.
- Review the management options available for melanocytic nevi.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of melanocytic nevi and improve outcomes.
