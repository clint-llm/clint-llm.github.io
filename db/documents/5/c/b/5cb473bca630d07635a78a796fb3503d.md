Patients who are exposed to thallium accidentally should wash their skin with tap water and remove contaminated clothing as soon as possible. Patients who intentionally ingest thallium should have a psychiatric evaluation. Mouth hygiene should be closely monitored. Shaving the patient's head may reduce the stress induced by hair loss and improve the patient's morale. All patients should have close follow-up care.
