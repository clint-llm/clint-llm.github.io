Although the muscles of the forearm and hand may have vascular contributions from more than one source, the ulnar artery plays a significant role in the blood supply to the following muscles: flexor carpi ulnaris, palmaris longus, flexor carpi radialis, flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor digitorum profundus, and extensor carpi ulnaris. Branches of the ulnar artery deliver vascular supply to the hypothenar muscles of the hand (abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi, opponens digiti minimi). Some of the other intrinsic muscles of the hand derive a component of their blood supply from the superficial palmar arch, one of the terminal branches of the ulnar artery.
