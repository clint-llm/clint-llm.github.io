EA is typically diagnosed with failure to pass an orogastric tube. The tube will stop short of the stomach and be seen coiled above the level of EA on a chest X-ray. A definitive diagnosis can be made by injecting a small amount of water-soluble contrast material into the orogastric tube under fluoroscopic guidance. Barium should be avoided as it can lead to chemical pneumonitis if aspirated into the lungs. Further diagnosis can be aided using esophagoscopy or bronchoscopy looking for a tracheal fistula.

The neonate with EA and TEF needs evaluation for VACTERL and CHARGE abnormalities, as this can occur in up to 50% of the neonates.
