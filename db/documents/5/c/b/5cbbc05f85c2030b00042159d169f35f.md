Complications are rare with a proper aspiration of the olecranon bursa; introducing infection into a previous sterile bursa is the most common. Occasionally, because of trauma, blood can be introduced into the bursa when it was not present theretofore; this will resolve on its own.

Occasionally, the bursa does not have fluid in it. For this reason, point of care ultrasound can be useful prior to the aspiration to ensure there is a fluid pocket to aspirate.
