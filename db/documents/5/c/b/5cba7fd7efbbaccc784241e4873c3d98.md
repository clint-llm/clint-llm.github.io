Glaucoma refers to a collection of diseases whereby increased intraocular pressure adversely impacts the optic nerve, and subsequently, the visual field. However, not all cases of glaucoma are associated with increased intraocular pressure, a subset includes similar optic nerve damage and visual field damage known as normal pressure glaucoma. The collection of glaucomatous diseases is subdivided into open-angle and closed-angle glaucoma, both of which can have primary or secondary causes. Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is a chronic, progressive, and irreversible multifactorial optic neuropathy that is characterized by open angle of the anterior chamber, typical optic nerve head changes, progressive loss of peripheral vision (typical visual field changes) followed by central visual field loss (blindness) for which intraocular pressure (IOP) is an important risk factor. The disease is usually bilateral, but asymmetry is often seen depending on the etiology. It is important to note that increased intraocular pressure is not a necessary prerequisite for glaucomatous optic nerve damage, nor are the two necessarily correlated as studies have shown individuals witch chronically elevated intraocular pressures being asymptomatic.
