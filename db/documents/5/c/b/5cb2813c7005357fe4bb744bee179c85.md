Muscles that involve the foot are extrinsic (originate above the ankle and insert onto the foot) or intrinsic (originate and insert within the foot). Extrinsic muscles divide into three compartments: anterior, lateral, and posterior. The deep fibular nerve innervates the muscles in the anterior compartment of the leg (i.e., tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus, and fibularis tertius muscles), which manage ankle dorsiflexion, toe extension, and foot inversion.

Intrinsic muscles manage the fine movement of the toes. On the dorsal aspect of the foot, the deep fibular nerve innervates the extensor digitorum brevis and the extensor hallucis brevis.
