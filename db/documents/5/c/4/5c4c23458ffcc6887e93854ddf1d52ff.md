Eosinophilic granuloma (EG) is a rare and mildest form of Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The presentation of EG can be monostotic, polyostotic, or can involve multiple organs. Thus, a multicentric approach is required while evaluating a suspected case of EG. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of EG and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with EG.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of eosinophilic granuloma.
- Describe the physical findings in a patient with eosinophilic granuloma.
- List the treatment options available for a patient with eosinophilic granuloma.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by eosinophilic granuloma.
