Central post-stroke pain, also known as Dejerine Roussy syndrome or thalamic pain syndrome, is a rare central neuropathic pain syndrome occurs after infarction of the ventroposterolateral thalamus. The thalamus is the relay center of the somatosensory pathway, but any lesion that disrupts the spinothalamic tract through its course, including in the subcortical, capsular, lower brain stem, or lateral medullary regions can stimulate the symptoms of Dejerine-Roussy syndrome, resulting in "pseudo-thalamic" pain. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of Dejerine Roussy syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of Dejerine Roussy syndrome.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with Dejerine Roussy syndrome.
- Outline the treatment options for Dejerine Roussy syndrome.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by Dejerine Roussy syndrome.
