Pioglitazone is taken orally, with or without food. It can be taken as monotherapy but is usually used as an adjunct to metformin/sulfonylurea or insulin therapy.

Pioglitazone can decrease hemoglobinA1C by 0.5 and 1.4 percent when used as monotherapy. The magnitude of benefit on glycemic control is variable with combination therapy with other antidiabetics, including insulin.

For adults, the dose starts initially at 15 mg or 30 mg orally once daily. For those who respond inadequately, dose increments of 15 mg of the drug are appropriate as needed. The maximum permissible dose is 45 mg/day by mouth every day.

For adults who do not have symptomatic heart disease but possess any risk factors for congestive heart failure, or those belonging to NYHA Class I or II heart failure category, the recommended dose is no more than 15 mg orally once daily.

Maximum dose:

- Adults - 45 mg/day orally

- Elderly - 45 mg/day orally

- For adolescents and children, the drug's safety and efficacy are unclear.
