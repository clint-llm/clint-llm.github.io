**Neovascular AMD:**PCV shares many similarities with nAMD. It has similar clinical features, increased VEGF expression, similar histology, and expression of growth factors and receptor antibodies. However, PCV has now been accepted as a distinct entity. The VEGF levels in PCV are less than nAMD or myopic CNVM. The clinical signs of PCV are also different from nAMD. The polyps project under the surface of RPE from the plane of the inner choroid. RPE invariably remains intact, unlike nAMD, where neovascular tufts arising from choroid breach Bruch's membrane and grow in sub-RPE or subretinal space. OCT findings of sharp-peaked/ notched PED or the presence of double-layer sign distinguish PCV from nAMD.

**Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC):**CSC is characterized by subretinal fluid and neurosensory detachment of the macula. It has been hypothesized due to an underlying disturbance in choroidal microcirculation. Choroidal hyperpermeability with impaired RPE function leads to the pooling of fluid in sub-RPE space with eventual leakage into subretinal space. Multifocal choroidal hyperfluorescent patches suggestive of choroidal hyperpermeability are seen on ICGA. PCV masquerading as CSC has been reported. In many cases, differentiating between CSC and PCV can be difficult as both show signs of subretinal exudation and RPE changes. ICGA findings play aÂ crucial role in clinching the diagnosis.
