For each classification of azotemia, there are unique etiologies.

- Prerenal azotemia manifests from some insult/injury source before the kidney. Most commonly, we see this in the form of hypoperfusion, or decreased blood flow, to the kidneys from various etiologies of volume depletion, such as the physiologic state shock, dehydration, hemorrhage, over-diuresis, burns, and even intravascular depletion from low-oncotic pressure states, such as congestive heart failure and liver failure.

- Intrinsic azotemia results from damage to the structure of the kidney; the structures affected include glomeruli, renal tubules and interstitium, and renal vasculature. This can result from inflammatory conditions, such as vasculitis, toxins, drugs, infections, and damage from hypoperfusion.

- Post-renal azotemia comes from issues in the ureters and bladder. Usually, a patient has some diagnosis of obstruction, seen if a patient with risk factors such as recurrent urinary tract infections, nephrolithiasis, hydronephrosis, benign prostatic hyperplasia.
