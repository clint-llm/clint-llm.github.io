Intermittent variable decelerations are usually benign and do not result in poor perinatal outcomes.

Recurrent variable decelerations correlate with poor outcomes, including neonatal acidemia.

- Meconium aspiration

- Metabolic and hematologic disturbances

- Cognitive dysfunction

- Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy

- Cerebral palsy

- Death

The presence of variable decelerations alone, even recurrent variable decelerations, is not enough to indicate a poor prognosis. For example, if the fetal heart tracing also demonstrates moderate variability and/or accelerations, the fetal acid-base status may still be normal.
