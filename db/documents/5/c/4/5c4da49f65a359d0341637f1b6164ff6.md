The diagnosis of chronic liver disease depends upon the etiology and complications of the disease. An outline regarding the diagnosis for various CLD appears below.

- Viral hepatitis B and C: Serology, PCR (quantitative and qualitative) with genotype

- Alcoholic liver disease: Elevated levels of AST>ALT with a history of chronic alcohol intake. Usually, AST: ALT ratio is 2 to 1 in alcoholic liver disease.

- Hemochromatosis: Raised serum iron, ferritin, decreased TIBC, and liver biopsy. Genetic testing can detect a mutation in the HFE gene, especially C282Y.

- Wilson disease: Raised urine copper, decreased serum ceruloplasmin, and liver biopsy. Genetic testing for the ATP7B gene.

- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: Diagnosis of exclusion and ALT>AST. Ultrasonography of the liver is informative.

- Autoimmune hepatitis: Raised ANA, ASMA, and LKM-1

- Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency: Decreased levels of alpha one antitrypsin

- Primary biliary cirrhosis: Markedly raised alkaline phosphatase levels with an antimitochondrial antibody

- Budd-Chiari and veno-occlusive disease: CBC, clotting profile, and imaging studies like ultrasound doppler or computed tomography with contrast study

**Laboratory Findings**

In chronic liver disease, there is inflammation and destruction of hepatocytes that leads to the release of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hence the high levels of these markers in the blood. Other parameters (ALP and GGT) of LFTs also appear elevated in cholestatic conditions like PBC. AST and ALT are usually elevated two to three times of normal limit, but normal levels of these markers do not rule out cirrhosis.

Because of hepatocellular insufficiency in cirrhosis, albumin level drops, and ammonia raises, causing ascites and hepatic encephalopathy. The increased concentration of ammonia, tryptophan metabolites, short-chain fatty acids, octopamine, mercaptans, increased oxidative stress, and increase intracellular osmolality are among many which have been proposed as the mechanism of developing hepatic encephalopathy.

**Radiologic Investigations**

It includes an abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, fibro scan, hepatic wedge pressure, endoscopy, EEG, TIPS, triphasic CT, and Doppler scan.

- **Ultrasound abdomen**is one of the most common and affordable imaging studies in the case of chronic liver disease. Ultrasound detects the size, echogenicity nodularity of the liver, thereby diagnosing liver cirrhosis. Other benefits of ultrasound in CLD include measurement of portal vein diameter as portal vein diameter increases in portal HTN and assessment of a clot in the hepatic vein (Budd-Chari) and portal vein in portal vein thrombosis.

- **Computed tomography**scan can show a lesion in the liver or obstruction of biliary channels in a more precise way, but triphasic CT is the test of choice in diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma.

- **Transient elastography**(TE) detects early stages of cirrhosis. It can also detect cardiovascular damage in patients with NAFLD.

- **Wedge hepatic venous pressure**measures portal venous pressure in CLD.

- **Doppler scan**can help in diagnosing Budd-Chiari and portal vein thrombosis.

- **EEG**shows delta waves in hepatic encephalopathy.

- **An upper endoscopy**can diagnose and treat esophageal varices. On endoscopy, we can measure the size of varices. Small varices are less than 5 mm, and large varices are greater than 5 mm.

- **A liver biopsy**can confirm the diagnosis of chronic liver disease. Various techniques to perform a liver biopsy are by laparoscope, transjugular, or percutaneously.
