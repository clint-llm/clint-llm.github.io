A Lisfranc injury occurs as a traumatic injury without underlying pathophysiology. There is a small subset of patients who may be more susceptible to this injury. This subset includes people with diabetes or individuals with nerve damage that causes decreased sensation to the feet. Decreased pain sensation can lead to repetitive injury or wear and tear causing the patient to be more susceptible to a Lisfranc injury from a minor mechanism.
