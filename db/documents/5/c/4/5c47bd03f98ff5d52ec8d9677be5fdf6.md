The eye is the only structure in the human body whose internal structures can be examined non-invasively. Examining the eye may provide information about a person’s general well-being and various systemic disorders. The iris, lens, retina, and blood vessels can be directly viewed to reflect the local or systemic pathologies. Slit lamp lenses are used to visualize the internal structures of the eye. They are simple, affordable, and portable.

Although high-end devices like fundus cameras and optical coherence tomography have revolutionized how practitioners detect eye diseases, they can never replace these handheld lenses. This article will discuss the different types of diagnostic and therapeutic slit lamp lenses.
