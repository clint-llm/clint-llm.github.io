Close to 80% to 90% of renal calculi pass spontaneously. About 3% of patients need admission because of pain, inability to pass the stone, or dehydration. A few patients may develop urinary tract obstruction and an upper urinary tract infection. This can result in urosepsis or pyelonephritis. Most of these patients require an urgent procedure to bypass the stone until the infection is resolved, at which time an elective procedure can be performed to remove the stone.

The recurrence rate of renal calculi has been reported to be about 50% within 5 years. Individuals with ongoing malignancy or metabolic disorders are at a higher risk for recurrence. The key for all patients with renal calculi is to stay hydrated; no medical therapy is successful without adequate hydration and sufficient urinary fluid output.
