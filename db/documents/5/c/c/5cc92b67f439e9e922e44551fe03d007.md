The morbidity and mortality of Nocardia depend on the site and extent of infection as well as underlying host factors. Prognosis varies based on the site of infection.

- Skin and soft tissue infections: approximately 100% cured

- Pleuropulmonary infections: approximately 80% cured

- In the 1940s, pulmonary nocardiosis had a fatality rate of 100%, but with the advent of sulfonamide antibiotics and more recently combined antibiotic therapy, the mortality has decreased dramatically.

- Disseminated nocardiosis: 3% cured

- CNS involvement: 50%Â to 85% cure rate
