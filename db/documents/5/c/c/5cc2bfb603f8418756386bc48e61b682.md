Myocarditis is a significant cause of sudden death and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy, especially in the young. It was recently ranked as the third leading cause of sudden cardiac death in competitive athletes by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, and it is considered the most common known cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in children less than 18 years of age.

Whereas neonates and children are more susceptible to viral-induced fulminant myocarditis,

Unlike viral myocarditis, there is a lot of variation in the distribution of non-viral pathogens causing myocarditis. Rheumatic heart disease and tertiary syphilis are rare in the developed nations because of better access to healthcare and early administration of antibiotics. Enteric pathogens and parasitic infestations are more prevalent in regions with poor sanitation, whereas diphtheritic myocarditis is limited to populations with poor immunization coverage.

Some pathogens are endemic to certain geographic regions, such as follows:

- Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia, and Anaplasma species, associated with Ixodes tick (northeastern United States)

- Trypanosoma cruzi (rural areas of Central and South America)

- Coccidioides immitis (the southwestern United States and northern Mexico)

- Histoplasma capsulatum (central and eastern United States, most prevalent in the Ohio and Mississippi river valley

-  Blastomyces dermatitidis (eastern North America, around St. Lawrence and Mississippi river systems)
