The most worrisome complication involved in follicular thyroid cancer is metastasis. Studies have reported metastases mostly to bones, lungs, and lymph nodes. In a study done by Parasmeswaran et al. (2017), they found that 42% of their subjects had metastasis to the bones, 33% to the lungs, and 8% to the lymph nodes.

Other complications correlate with surgery. The external and recurrent laryngeal nerves are near the thyroid gland and can mistakenly get damaged during surgery or resected due to invasion.

Because the patient is undergoing total thyroidectomy, hypothyroidism will always develop, and patients will require thyroxine replacement therapy.
