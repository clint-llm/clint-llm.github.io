Glomus jugulare are slow-growing tumors; therefore, long-term follow-up is necessary. Follow-up is given by an interprofessional team, which should include primary care physicians, neurosurgeons, otolaryngologists, and neuroradiologists. Other healthcare providers dealing with rehabilitation and complications, will also be part of the team, such as physical medicine and rehabilitation physicians and physical therapists. Patients should be well educated in terms of the disease, particularly those with a family history because genetic screening of high-risk individuals in affected families allows early detection and management of multifocal disease.
