The structural organization of the vessel wall is easily appreciated with a light microscope, being observed most clearly in large vessels. The tunica intima appears as a single layer of simple squamous cells on light microscopy. The internal elastic membrane which surrounds the intima presents as a dark basophilic line that undulates close to the lumen. The tunica media is easily appreciated in some vessels as the cytoplasm of the abundant myofiber stains pink, while the nucleus stains blue and normally appears long and stretched to a prolated spheroid.
