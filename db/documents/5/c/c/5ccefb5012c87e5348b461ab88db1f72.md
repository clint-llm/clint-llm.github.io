Goiters are not very common in the USA because of the fortification of the salt with iodine. However, when they do occur, their management can be difficult depending on their size and functional status. Thus, these lesions are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes clinicians, nurse specialists, pharmacists and surgeons. Goiters usually come to clinical attention when they are large; at this point, the clinician should first determine if the patient has symptoms and if the goiter is functioning.

Most nontoxic goiters can be managed with conservative care but large ones may require surgical excision. Others may require a trial of levothyroxine therapy. The pharmacist should educate the patient on symptoms of hyper and hypothyroidism which may occur following the use of levothyroxine and surgery, respectively.Â  These patients need to be followed up for several months to ensure that the TSH has stabilized. However, long term monitoring is necessary as some goiters may become hyperactive or become malignant. The primary care providers and nurse practitioners should examine these patients thoroughly so that no complication is missed. If the thyroid function tests fail to stabilize, the patient should be referred to an endocrinologist for further workup.

**Outcomes**

The outcomes for most patients with a goiter are excellent.
