Based on the clinical appearance and distribution of the skin lesions in a child or adolescent, the diagnosis of pityriasis alba is, in most cases, straightforward.

The differential diagnosis of pityriasis alba includes postinflammatory hypopigmentation from any cause, fungal infections (tinea versicolor and tinea corporis), vitiligo, nevus depigmentosus (a stable congenital leukoderma), psoriasis, seborrhea, the ash-leaf macules of tuberous sclerosis, mycosis fungoides (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma), and hypopigmentation secondary to topical medications such as retinoic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and corticosteroids. In the proper geographic and clinical setting, the diagnosis of leprosy also should be considered.

If the diagnosis is uncertain, several diagnostic procedures may be useful. On examination with a Wood's lamp, the lesions of pityriasis alba may be accentuated but are nonfluorescent. This finding is in contrast to vitiligo, which will fluoresce more brightly and have edges with sharper demarcation. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of a skin scraping will be negative for fungal elements. This result is in contrast to tinea versicolor or tinea corporis, which will be positive for fungal elements. Skin biopsy is usually not necessary, but when performed, it can distinguish pityriasis alba from mycosis fungoides.
