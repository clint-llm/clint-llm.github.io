Mesna in oral and IV administrations is commonly associated with gastrointestinal side effects, including nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, and bad taste.

**Laboratory Test - Interactions**

- No clinical drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with mesna in clinical trials.

- False-negative CPK levels may be reported due to interference with enzymatic creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity tests that utilize a thiol compound for CPK reactivation.

- A false-positive reaction for ascorbic acid can be observed in the presence of mesna (Tillman's reagent-based urine screening tests).

- False positive tests for urinary ketones may occur in patients who are given mesna when using nitroprusside sodium-based urine tests (dipstick tests).
