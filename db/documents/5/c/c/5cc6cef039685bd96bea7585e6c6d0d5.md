There are no standard treatments for patients with retinitis pigmentosa. The most widely recommended treatment for many years has been supplementation with vitamin A, which some studies have shown to slow the rate of retinal deterioration.

In recent years genetic causes of RP have been better understood, and novel treatments are being developed to combat the disease. Gene-specific or mutation-specific investigations point to the possibility that gene augmentation therapy might be designed to restore normal gene expression in photoreceptors. Other research involves cell replacement therapy, which involves transplanting retinal progenitor cells (or non-ocular stem cells) into the eye to repopulate the retina with functional photoreceptors.

Multiple types of electronic retinal implants exist and have shown great promise in restoring partial vision in patients with end-stage disease.Â A kind of technology that has been of interest uses auditory information to substitute for visual sensory input.
