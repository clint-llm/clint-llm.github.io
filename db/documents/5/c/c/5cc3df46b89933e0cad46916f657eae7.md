While there are no complications likely to occur from the use of this simple physical examination maneuver, theÂ most feared complication that can be avoided by performing an AT or MAT is catastrophic hand ischemia and subsequent tissue loss if the radial artery is disrupted and the ulnar artery is insufficient to maintain perfusion of the hand. Tissue loss would be most likely to occur in the thumb and thenar eminence, as these areas are farthest from the ulnar blood supply. In the event that iatrogenic interruption of radial arterial blood flow leads to hand ischemia, the artery may need to be reconstructed with either primary anastomosis or with a vein graft.
