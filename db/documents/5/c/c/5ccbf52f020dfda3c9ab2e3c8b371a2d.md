Lymphedema can be managed clinically with complex decongestive physiotherapy, consisting of compressive bandages and manual lymphatic massage. Compression is provided using 30Â to 40 mm Hg compression stockings as well as pneumatic compression devices. If lymphedema is refractory to traditional compression and massage management, surgery with bypass or debulking procedures may resolve lymphedema.
