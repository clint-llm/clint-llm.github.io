Amoxicillin-clavulanate is a mainstay antibiotic in emergency departments and primary care offices throughout the country. It is a combination of two separate drugs: amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Amoxicillin is a penicillin derivative and has a similar activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, with the addition of clavulanic acid, the spectrum is increased to include beta-lactamase-producing strains as well as broadening the coverage to include other bacterial species. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, administration, and adverse effects of amoxicillin-clavulanate, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the effective use of this drug.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the antimicrobial coverage of amoxicillin-clavulanate based on its mechanism of action.
- Outline the indications for the use of amoxicillin-clavulanate therapy.
- Summarize the adverse effects and toxicity of amoxicillin-clavulanate.
- Explain the importance of antimicrobial stewardship and how it affects antimicrobial selection as it pertains to improving care coordination among the interprofessional team when initiating amoxicillin-clavulanate antimicrobial therapy.
