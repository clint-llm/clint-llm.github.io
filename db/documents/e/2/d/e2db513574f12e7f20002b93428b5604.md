The peroneus longus muscle arises from the head and proximal and lateral side of the fibula and inserts on the base of the first metatarsal and medial cuneiform. Its location is adjacent to the peroneus brevis muscle on the lateral side of the lower limb coursing inferiorly and tapering into a long, slender tendinous portion that descends into the foot posterior to the lateral malleolus before crossing under the foot and attaching to the bones on the medial side of the foot.

The primary function of the peroneus longus muscle is to plantarflex and evert the foot at the ankle. Due to its insertion on the medial aspect of the foot and course down the lateral part of the leg, muscle contraction lifts the foot upward (plantar flexion) and outward (eversion). This movement is critical to the eversion of the foot and can be injured commonly from forced inversion and dorsiflexion of the ankle in the setting of trauma.
