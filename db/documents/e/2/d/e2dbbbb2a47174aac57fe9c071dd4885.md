- Primary congenital megalocornea is characterized by enlarged corneas and deep anterior chambers without an increase in intraocular pressure.

- This rare genetic defect has been localized to the chordin-like 1 (CHRDL1) gene, which synthesizes the protein ventroptin, a BMP antagonist expressed in ocular structures early in development.

- This defect is located at the X chromosome, and the disease is generally inherited in an X-linked recessive pattern, though other inheritances have been reported

- Since megalocornea is associated with numerous other genetic syndromes and diseases, a thorough workup should be completed to assess for potential underlying causes.

- Patients may be asymptomatic or have astigmatism at birth. Presenile cataracts, ectopia lentis, and glaucoma may arise and are the most serious complications.
