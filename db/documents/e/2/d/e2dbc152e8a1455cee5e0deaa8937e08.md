**Earthquakes**

Earthquakes can appear suddenly without warning. The timing of the event may be significant in terms of numbers of casualties. An earthquake that suddenly strikes in the evening when people are asleep at home will be more devastating than one during the day when people are awake and can flee. Aftershocks may also lead to casualties. Initial injuries include fractures, lacerations, and crush injury. Many of those who suffer from crush injury develop crush syndrome which may include rhabdomyolysis and renal failure. A significant proportion of these patients will require dialysis. Some victims with crush injury will need to undergo a fasciotomy.  There are subsequent risks of infectious disease epidemics.

**Hurricanes and Floods**

Theoretically, there is a certain amount of time to plan, including the ability to evacuate. However, one still has to deal with the issue of damage to the medical infrastructure itself. Victims suffer from similar injuries to those from an earthquake. Bacterial infections by Vibrio vulnificus or leptospirosis can be caused by contaminated flood water.

**Radiation Emergencies**

Radiation emergencies can be from an accident in a healthcare facility or nuclear site, terrorist attack, or act of war. Terrorist attacks could theoretically include the detonation of a radiological dispersal device (RDD) also known as a dirty bomb. Many will be killed by the initial blast and subsequent fires. The immediate health effects from radiation include bone marrow failure and damage to the gastrointestinal tract. Higher doses of radiation will lead to death.

**Infectious Disease**

Infectious disease disasters can be primary such as the Ebola epidemic between 2013 and 2016

**Terrorist Attacks**

Although terrorist attacks can often result in an MCI, they rarely result in a catastrophic event such as occurred on 9/11. In a terrorist bombing, deaths are caused by the four stages of blast injury: the blast wave, shrapnel, propelling of the victim, and secondary causes such as fires or building collapse. This was magnified on 9/11 by the massive explosion caused by airplanes crashing into the Twin Towers as well as the collapse of two of the tallest buildings in the world.

**Complex Humanitarian Emergencies**

Complex humanitarian emergencies (CHE) are crises due to political instability or armed conflict. They can lead to violent death, malnutrition, and disease. This includes recent conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, Bosnia, Rwanda, Kosovo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and East Timor. Over many years, these have caused more deaths than all disasters combined. Violent deaths can be due to shootings, shrapnel, or landmines. Infectious diseases have often been the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CHE in Asia and Africa. These include diarrheal diseases, acute respiratory tract infections, measles, meningitis, and malaria. Malnutrition, mental health disorders, and sexual violence are also prevalent.
