Hydrogen sulfide is a highly flammable, colorless, and toxic gas found naturally in sewage, swamps, manure gas, hot springs, geysers, and volcanoes. It is found in the oil and gas industries and is used in activities such as food processing, paper mills, and tanneries. It is also found in some homemade cleaning mixtures that are occasionally employed in suicide attempts.
