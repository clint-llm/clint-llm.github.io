Recent advances in genetic techniques have allowed a more detailed analysis of the virulence ofÂ group A streptococci and how these factors function to promote infection with GAS. On the surface of GAS cells are found molecules of lipoteichoic acid and protein F, which help with adherence to host cells and successful colonization. GAS also produces chemicals called streptolysins and hyaluronidase, which function to destroy host tissues, thereby allowing GAS to spread through the host. Additionally, GAS has several factors, including its capsule, protein G, C5a peptidase as well as protein M, which function to protect GAS from host immune defenses. M protein, in particular, is thought to cause much of the virulence of GAS as it inhibits phagocytosis by host immune cells.
