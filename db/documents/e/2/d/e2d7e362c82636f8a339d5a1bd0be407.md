Due to the extensive clinical presentation and heterogeneous etiology, diagnosing amniotic band syndrome could be challenging, especially prenatally. ABS can be suspected prenatally as early as the first trimester if constriction, amputation, or deformation of major anatomic structures are present. Distal limb edema can help make a diagnosis of ABS prenatally. In very few cases, a strand of amniotic fibrous tissue could be seen attached to tissues and restricting the free movement of the fetus in-utero.

Postnatally ABS should be suspected in newborns with visible constrictions, amputations, non-midline, and unusually located craniofacial or body wall defects. Investigation of the fresh fetal membranes and placenta is important in cases where amniotic bands are not visibly present in newborns.
