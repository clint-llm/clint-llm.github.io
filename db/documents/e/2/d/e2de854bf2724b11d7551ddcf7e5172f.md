Lower third molars are the most frequently extracted teeth, accounting for 18% of dental extractions.

Indications for extraction of a lower third molar include recurrent episodes of pericoronitis, unrestorable caries, or caries extending into the pulp. Furthermore, a horizontal or mesioangular lower third molar causing disto-cervical caries in the lower second molar is indicated for extraction to facilitate restorative treatment in the lower second molar. In addition, extraction is also indicated in third molars with odontogenic cysts or tumors, those impeding surgery (such as in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery), or in the line of a mandibular fracture.

Lower anterior crowding is not an indication of extraction of lower third molars. Crowding of the lower anterior teeth is sometimes observed simultaneously with the eruption of lower wisdom teeth. This has led to the belief that the erupting third molars cause a mesial migration of teeth, consequently moving the incisors, resulting in crowding.
