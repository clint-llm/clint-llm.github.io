Multivisceral transplant combines the anatomy and physiology of multiple systems requiring a robust and active multidisciplinary team. Each provider, from dietitian to therapist, plays a critical role in the profound improvement in the quality of life that MVT provides. Leading institutions have been more aggressive at transplanting earlier due to the life-changing improvements. Over the past three decades, patient outcomes have improved by over two-fold â€“ largely due to establishing a dedicated interdisciplinary team. The team must be proactive in following up with pre and post-transplant patients. Patients from lower socioeconomic environments and pediatric populations benefit from close surveillance, this improves compliance and early recognition of potential complications.
