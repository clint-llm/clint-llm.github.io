According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statistics, there were 88,042 reported new diagnoses of syphilis in 2016. Out of all syphilis cases, 27,814 were primary and secondary syphilis. In 2016, most syphilis cases occurred among gays, bisexuals, and other men who have sex with men. Men aged 20 to 29 years have the highest rates of primary and secondary syphilis.

Among sex workers, the worldwide incidence of active syphilis in 2019 was 10.8%.

From 2008 to 2012, rates of congenital syphilis declined, but the incidence in adults increased by 38%. In 2016, 628 cases of congenital syphilis were reported, with rates 8.0-times and 3.9-times higher among infants born to Black and Hispanic mothers, respectively, compared to White-race mothers.

Syphilis is endemic in the developing world and is especially common among those who are poor and have limited access to health care.

Syphilis is an important synergistic infection for HIV acquisition and has been closely linked with HIV infections.

The incidence of congenital syphilis has nearly quadrupled between 2015 and 2019.
