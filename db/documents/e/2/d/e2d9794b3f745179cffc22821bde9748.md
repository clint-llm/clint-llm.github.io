Medical management of the underlying etiology of the ectropion should be attempted before consideration of surgical correction. If inflammation or infection is not controlled before surgical intervention, the prognosis worsens, as there is a higher risk of complications and disease progression.Â Patients who cannot tolerate general anesthesia or who cannot tolerate a local anesthetic for medical or psychological reasons should not undergo surgical correction.
