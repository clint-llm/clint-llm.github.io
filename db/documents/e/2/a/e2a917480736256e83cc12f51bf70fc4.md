Since the blood supply in the lips is from the labial arteries, the lips appear pink with adequate perfusion and blue in ischemia or hypoxia. The appearance of the lips can be a supporting indicator of the perfusion and oxygenation status in a patient.

The lip is a vascular region of the face formed from the network of arteries. When it comes to lip laceration or trauma, compressing the bleeding lip may require more pressure and time to achieve hemostasis.
