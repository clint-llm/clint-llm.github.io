Pattern recognition of white matter lesions (WMLs) in MRI is crucial as it may make the diagnosis in many conditions.

The differential diagnosis for symmetric WMLs:

- Bilateral Hemispheres: Toxic encephalopathy, HIV encephalopathy, autoimmune encephalopathies, and Vitamin B12 deficiency

- Periventricular Lesions: Small vessel disease, HIV encephalopathy, vitamin B12 deficiency, metachromatic leukodystrophy, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, and vanishing white matter disease

- Subcortical Including Arcuate Fibers: Alexander disease, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, and CADASIL

- Frontal Predominance: Alexander Disease, and metachromatic leukodystrophy

- Parietal/Temporal/Occipital Lobes: PRES (posterior reversible encephalopathy), heroin abuse, and Krabbe disease.

- Corpus Callosum: Marchifava-Bignami disease, metachromatic leukodystrophy, and Krabbe disease

- Cerebellum: Toxic encephalopathy, and mitochondriopathies

- Central Pons: Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM)

The differential diagnosis for asymmetric WMLs:

- Patchy Multifocal Confluent Lesion: MS, autoimmune encephalopathies, and CADASIL

- Parieto-Occipital Regions: PMLE
