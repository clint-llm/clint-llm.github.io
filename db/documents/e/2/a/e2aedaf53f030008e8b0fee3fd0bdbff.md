Globally, hypercholesterolemia has recently been discovered to be much more prevalent than previously thought. Approximately 90 to 95% of those with high cholesterol have not yet been diagnosed **31.7%**of adults in the United States have high LDL-C levels and are at twice the risk for heart disease than people with normal levels. Only 48.1% are receiving treatment to lower LDL-C levels.Â Recent data suggests that the classic disorder, familial hypercholesterolemia has a prevalence of an estimate of 1/300,000 as homozygous and 1/250 as a heterozygote. In certain populations such as the French Canadians, Lebanese, and Afrikaners, it could be as high as 1/100.
