There are varying treatments available for extrapyramidal symptoms. Parkinsonism is treatable with benztropine or amantadine. Benztropine or diphenhydramine can treat acute dystonia. Akathisia is treatable with beta-blockers, benztropine, or benzodiazepines. Tardive dyskinesia is treatable by switching to atypical antipsychotics such as clozapine. Tetrabenazine is another option. For neuroleptic malignant syndrome, the healthcare provider should immediately discontinue prochlorperazine and give dantrolene (0.8 to 2.5 mg/kg given four times per day; up to 10 mg/day may be provided).
