As previously mentioned, the hallmark of PD is the tunical fibrosis of the corpora cavernosa resulting in plaques. The tunica is responsible for the pliancy and rigidity of the penis when it is flaccid and erect, respectively. Ultrasound and histological changes in the tunica have been described in animal and cadaveric studies. The main features include collagen deposition in unusually dense clumps with disordered, fragmented, and sparse elastin fibers.
