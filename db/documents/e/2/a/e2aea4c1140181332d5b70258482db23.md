Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is a mitochondrial diseaseÂ primarily affecting the nervous system and muscles. MELAS presents in children or young adults as recurrent episodes of encephalopathy, myopathy, headache, and focal neurological deficits. Because the condition is relentlessly progressive, resulting in neurological impairment by adolescence or early adulthood, it is best managed by an interprofessional team. In most patients the treatment is supportive but the overall prognosis is poor. It is important to get a social worker and physical therapy involved early in the course of the disease because these professionals can help improve the quality of life.
