Adrenal myelolipoma is aÂ  benign adrenal neoplasm predominantly composed of mature adipose tissue and intermixed myeloid tissue. They comprise 6-16% of adrenal incidentalomas and are the second most common cause after adrenal adenomas. The increased prevalence of adrenal myelolipomas is due to increased detection because of the wider accessibility of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Rarely myelolipomas are encountered outside the adrenal glands and are termed as extra-adrenal myelolipoma. The pathogenesis of adrenal myelolipoma is either believed to be due to metaplastic change in the mesenchymal cells or as a result of overstimulation by adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). Clinically, they may be asymptomatic or present with abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting. On CT scan, they appear as well-circumscribed, hypodense masses with an attenuation of -90 to -120 HU. Surgical resection is indicated in cases of significant growth or hormonal hypersecretion.
