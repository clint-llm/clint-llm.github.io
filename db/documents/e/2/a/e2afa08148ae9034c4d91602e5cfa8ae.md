It is theorized that headache in the setting of ICH occurs secondary to the traction of sensory innervated meningeal and intracranial structures. Also, the vasodilatory response of cerebral blood vessels to compensate for the decrease in CSF volume is believed to be a factor as well. There is evidence to support the fact that venous sinus distension induces pain and is a likely cause of headache in ICH cases.
