A diagnosis of exclusion of other causes is employed and confirmed with imaging. A stepwise approach includes history and physical examination, doppler ultrasonography (DUS), computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), venography, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS).

Diagnostic imaging criteria include: a renocaval pullback gradient ≥ 3 mmHg, a maximum flow velocity five times increased in the LRV passing the SMA compared to the renal hilum, or an angle less than 45º between the Ao and SMA on CTA or MRA.

CT has been recommended more recently because of its accuracy and ability to investigate abdominal findings. Of the CT parameters, the most accurate is the "beak sign" and LRV diameter ratio (hilar-aortomesenteric) of ≥4.9.
