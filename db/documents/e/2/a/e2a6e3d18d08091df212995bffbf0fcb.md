According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over 11% of the population, over 6 years of age are infected with T. gondii in the United States.

- High seroprevalence of T. gondii is observed in warm and humid areas as oocysts survive better in these environments.

- Areas with livestock as they can be a direct source of infection and a possible reservoir.

- SeroprevalenceÂ increases with age.

The factors affecting the prevalence of toxoplasmosis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are similar to that of the general population. Patients with AIDS are at risk for developing reactivated disease, particularly when the CD4 count drops below 100 cells/microL.
