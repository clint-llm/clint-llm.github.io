For proper use, the maternal cervix should be fully dilated, the head engaged in the birth canal, and the head position known. The baby should not be preterm, previously exposed to sampling from the scalp, or failed forceps delivery. If the attempt fails, it may be necessary to deliver the infant by cesarean section or forceps.  The bladder should be empty, and the facility should be able to accommodate a stat cesarean section should operative delivery attempts be unsuccessful.
