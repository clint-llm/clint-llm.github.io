Patients with normal renal function (GFR over 60 ml/min) and mild asymptomatic hypermagnesemia require no treatment except the removal of all sources of exogenous magnesium. One must consider that the half-time of elimination of magnesium is approximately 28 hours.

In more severe cases, close monitoring of the ECG, blood pressure, and neuromuscular function and early treatment are necessary:

- Intravenous calcium gluconate or chloride [Dosage: 1 g in 2 to 5 min (repeatable over 5 minutes)]. The rationale is that the actions of magnesium in neuromuscular and cardiac function become antagonized by calcium.

- Intravenous normal saline (e.g., at 150 ml/hour)

Severe clinical conditions require increasing renal magnesium excretion through:

- Intravenous loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide 1 mg/kg), or

- Hemodialysis, when kidney function is impaired, or the patient is symptomatic from severe hypermagnesemia. This approach usually removes magnesium efficiently (up to 50% reduction after a 3- to 4-hour treatment). Dialysis can, however, increase the excretion of calcium by developing hypocalcemia, thus possibly worsening the symptoms and signs of hypermagnesaemia.

The use of diuretics must be associated with infusions of saline solutions to avoid further electrolyte disturbances (e.g., hypokalemia) and metabolic alkalosis. The clinician must perform serial measurements of calcium and magnesium. In association with electrolytic correction, it is often necessary to support cardiorespiratory activity. As a consequence, the treatment of this electrolyte disorder can frequently require intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

Particular clinical conditions require a specific approach. For instance, during the management of eclampsia, the magnesium infusion is stopped if urine output drops to less than 80 mL (in 4 hours), deep tendon reflexes are absent, or the respiratory rate is below 12 breaths/minute. A 10% calcium gluconate or chloride solution (10 mL intravenously repeatable over 5 minutes) can serve as an antidote.
