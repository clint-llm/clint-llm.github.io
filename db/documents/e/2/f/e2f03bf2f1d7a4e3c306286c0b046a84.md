Sinus bradycardia is a cardiac rhythm with appropriate cardiac muscular depolarization initiating from the sinus node and a rate of fewer than 60 beats per minute (bpm). The diagnosis of this condition requires an ECG showing a normal sinus rhythm at a rate lower than 60 bpm. The majority of patients are asymptomatic, while others may present with fatigue, lightheadedness, dizziness, exercise intolerance, syncope or presyncope, worsening of anginal symptoms, worsening of heart failure, or cognitive slowing. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of sinus bradycardia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the key features of sinus bradycardia.
- Outline how the diagnosis of sinus bradycardia is made on ECG.
- Review how a patient with sinus bradycardia will most likely present.
- Describe the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team in educating patients at risk for sinus bradycardia and making a closed-loop communication between them and their providers to further help improve the management of sinus bradycardia.
