The male reproductive organs, the testes, serve two primary functions in the human body, including the production of the male gametes, sperm cells, and testosterone, which is the primary male sex hormone. Located inside the testes are groups of convoluted tubules called seminiferous tubules, where sperm cell production takes place.

At embryonic day ten, the bipotential gonad is first visualized as a thickening of the mesonephros located on the ventral side. Gender specificity acquisition occurs over the next two days, primarily driven by “SRY” gene expression. Expression of this gene allows cells to differentiate and become the Sertoli cells, which are cells of the testis. In contrast with females, if SRY gene expression is absent, granulosa cells will form in a developing ovary. For sex determination to be complete and for male testis formation requires primordial germ cells to interact with embryonic Sertoli cells, myoid cells, and Leydig cells. This process occurs by embryonic day twelve and a half. Primordial germ cells appear within the epiblast at embryonic day six, where they undergo cell migration. They arrive and infiltrate the developing gonadal ridge at embryonic day 11. Once the cells are in close approximation to one another, they can form the seminiferous cords, which eventually form the seminiferous tubules.

The primordial germ cells undergo mitotic proliferation within the cords of an embryonic testis. They are then called prospermatogonia or gonocytes. After replication of this population of cells, prospermatogonia enter a dormant non-proliferative phase until birth in the rodent. The initial location of the prospermatogonia is closer to the center of the seminiferous cords; however, eventual migration occurs to the periphery after birth. Several essential processes arise at this location, producing the morphologically distinct spermatogonia.

Oocytes in females and sperm in males are derivatives of primordial germ cells. Their production is dependent on a derivative of vitamin A, known as retinoic acid. During fetal development in females, meiosis is initiated by germ cells in the ovary in response to retinoic acid. However, in the testis, germ cells do not receive the signal from retinoic acid. Hence meiosis is not initiated until after birth. The period corresponds to the resumption of male germ cell proliferation and the transition to spermatogonia. Eventually, spermatogenesis occurs, and haploid spermatozoa get created.
