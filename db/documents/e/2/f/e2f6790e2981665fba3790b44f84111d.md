Clinical heart failure is a diagnosis based on a patient's history and physical on initial assessment. Though the type may not be clear, most patients present very similarly, if not the same. Hypervolemia, dyspnea on rest or exertion, orthopnea, and fatigue are the general symptoms of heart failure. Different types of heart failure include heart failure with reduced ejection fraction and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and can be differentiated from high-outputÂ cardiac failure by measuring the cardiac output and/or cardiac index and low systemic vascular resistance.
