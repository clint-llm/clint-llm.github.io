Impairment of cardiac function can arise through a variety of pathophysiologic mechanisms. Common etiologies include hypertension, coronary disease, congenital problems, myocardial ischemia and infarction, congestive heart failure, shock, arrhythmias, genetic diseases, structural abnormalities, pericardial effusions, emboli, tamponade, and many others. Depending on the temporal course, not all of these ailments present with clinically apparent effects. It may take decades for chronic problems like hypertension or coronary atherosclerosis to cause noticeable symptoms. However, it is important to understand that all diseases due to cardiac dysfunction share a compromised ability of the heart’s ability to supply oxygen to the body effectively.
