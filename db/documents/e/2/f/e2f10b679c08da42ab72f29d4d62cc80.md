Musculoskeletal disorders constitute a significant cause of disability and morbidity globally. Musculoskeletal disorders have a broad differential diagnosis and also more diverse presentations. Many functional diseases can also present with physical symptoms leading to delay in diagnosis or misdiagnosis. Therefore clinicians should have clear and comprehensive knowledge about the musculoskeletal examination. The musculoskeletal exam helps to identify the functional anatomy associated with clinical conditions, thereby differentiating the underlying system involved and could correctly point towards the condition helping in early diagnosis and intervention. Early intervention is essential in the treatment effectiveness of chronic musculoskeletal medical conditions and thus preventing unnecessary costs for the health and social care systems.
