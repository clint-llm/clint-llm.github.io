A uterine rupture must prompt immediate action. A delay in delivery, resuscitation, or surgery increases maternal and fetal risk.

A uterine rupture requires simultaneous delivery and treatment of maternal hemorrhage.

A midline abdominal incision, as opposed to the Pfannenstiel incision, should be considered when intraperitoneal bleeding is suspected. A midline incision provides better surgical exposure for the identification of the bleeding source and may shorten the time interval between surgical incision and delivery.
