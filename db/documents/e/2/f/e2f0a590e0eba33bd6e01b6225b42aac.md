Patients receiving topical cocaine should have cardiac monitoring in case of dysrhythmia, and frequent vital signs are necessary to check for cocaine-induced hypertension and tachycardia. Clinicians should use the lowest dosage that results in effective anesthesia to avoid high plasma levels from mucosal absorption and potential adverse effects. The fatal dose of cocaine has been estimated to be 1.2 g, but there are reports of severe adverse effects from doses as low as 20 mg.
