Isolated alexia without agraphia is uncommon, and statistics are limited. However, it is often associated with other types of strokes and neurological deficits caused by cerebral vascular accidents. Strokes cause a significant amount of morbidity and mortality worldwide in both women and men. Statistics from 2017 show an incidence rate of stroke at 140.3 to 161.8 per 100,000 in 2017.
