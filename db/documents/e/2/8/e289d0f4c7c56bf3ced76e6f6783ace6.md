While aminoglycosides are an older class of medication, they continue to be clinically valuable. Aminoglycosides have a broad spectrum of activity covering aerobic organisms, including gram-negative bacteria and mycobacteria. There are several drugs within the aminoglycoside class, including gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, neomycin, plazomicin, and streptomycin, and FDA-approved indications vary between the for these individual aminoglycosides. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent to members of the interprofessional team who wish to prescribe aminoglycosides.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of the aminoglycosides.
- Outline the indications for different aminoglycosides.
- Summarize the adverse effects and monitoring requirements of aminoglycosides.
- Explain the importance of antimicrobial stewardship and how it affects antimicrobial selection as it pertains to improving care coordination among the interprofessional team when initiating aminoglycoside therapy.
