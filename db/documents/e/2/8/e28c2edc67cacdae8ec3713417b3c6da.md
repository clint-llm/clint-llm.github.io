Managing uremic pruritus is difficult because of a lack of consensus recommendations and many large randomized controlled trials. Optimized care requires an interprofessional approach involving nephrologists, dermatologists, nurses, pharmacists, and clinical psychologists. A dermatologist can help rule out other causes of the itching and recommend treatment strategies. Pharmacists can verify dosing and perform medication reconciliation, reporting to the prescriber or nurse if they have any concerns. All team members are responsible for keeping accurate records regarding all interventions and interactions with the patient so that all team members have access to the same updated patient data.

Given the high rate of underreporting, clinicians and nurses play a vital role in detecting the presence of itching in patients and encouraging conversation about itching. Nurses also educate and monitor the patient. The pharmacist monitors to ensure drugs that can trigger, worsen or potentiate itching are not added to the patient's regimen. Given the relationship between uremic pruritus and depression, consultation with a clinical psychologist may be needed.
