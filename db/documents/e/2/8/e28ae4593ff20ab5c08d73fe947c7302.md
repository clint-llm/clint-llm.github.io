One of the most common dentoalveolar surgical procedures is removing mandibular third molars, which have a close anatomical relationship to the inferior alveolar nerve that returns sensation from the lower lip and chin.

Panoramic imaging is often the primary modality of choice to investigate the proximity of mandibular third molars to the inferior alveolar canal. If high-risk features are identified, such as loss of cortication, diversion or narrowing of the canal, deflection, darkening and narrowing of the roots, or a bifid root apex, then cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) may be indicated to evaluate the risk and aid treatment planning.

The maxillary posterior teeth lie near the antrum, and several complications can result from this relationship. Oro-antral communication formation is a recognized complication of extraction of maxillary posterior teeth, which requires prompt closure to prevent sinus contamination, formation of an epithelialized fistulous tract, and development of chronic sinusitis.

Wrong tooth removal is a preventable complication of exodontia, and precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of its occurrence by implementing protocols such as the World Health Organisation surgical safety checklist.
