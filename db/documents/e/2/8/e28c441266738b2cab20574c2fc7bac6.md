Pilomatrixoma, or calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe, are benign tumors of the hair follicle matrix. In 1880, Malherbe and Chenantais originally called the calcifying lesion "epithelioma" because they thought the cell of origin was sebaceous. Forbis and Helwing proposed the term pilomatrixoma in 1961 because further studies have elucidated that the origin is the hair follicle matrix. Some authors are now suggesting a pan-follicular differentiation. These tumor cells can differentiate into hair matrix, hair cortex, follicular infundibulum, outer root sheath, and hair bulge. It commonly occurs in the pediatric patient on the hair-bearing areas of the head and neck but can also involve the extremities and trunk. On the head, the preauricular region is most commonly involved. The tumors only occur in hair-bearing areas. Case studies report the tumor occurring in other areas of the body including the periocular and on the scrotum and vulva.
