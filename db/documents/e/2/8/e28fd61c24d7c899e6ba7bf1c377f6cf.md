Barrett's esophagus is the condition in which a specialized columnar epithelium replaces the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus. Prolonged acid injury to the squamous epithelium can cause this metaplastic change in about 10% to 15% of individuals suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This activity describes the evaluation and management of Barrett's metaplasia and emphasizes the interprofessional team's role in treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the role that gastroesophageal reflux disease plays in the development of Barrett metaplasia.
- Summarize the multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms that predispose to acid reflux leading to Barrett metaplasia.
- Describe the use of biopsies to rule out esophageal adenocarcinoma and diagnose Barrett metaplasia.
- Identify the role of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to enhance lifestyle changes like smoking cessation, weight reduction, and elevating the head of the bed in treating patients with Barrett metaplasia.
