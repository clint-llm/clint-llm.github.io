Rearrangement of gene sequences in the DNA of JC viruses is essential for the reactivation of these latent forms, particularly in immunocompromised states.

Due to a failing cellular response in conditions such as AIDS, such patients are more prone to this demyelinating disease.Â The focus of latent infection begins in the oligodendrocytes of the CNS and results in a lytic infection upon reactivation that destroys the myelin it produces. This severe demyelinating leukoencephalopathy commonly presents as white matter lesions in the CNS.
