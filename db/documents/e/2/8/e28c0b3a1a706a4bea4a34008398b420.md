Lipemia retinalis (LR) is a retinal manifestation of chylomicronemiaÂ (hypertriglyceridemia). Ophthalmoscopic features are creamy-white discoloration of the retinal vessels, which start in the peripheral vessels in mild cases and involves central retinal vessels in established cases. In severe cases, the fundus takes salmon color. Though lipemia retinalis does not affect the visual acuity, the associated severe but easily treatable metabolic disorders merit discussion.
