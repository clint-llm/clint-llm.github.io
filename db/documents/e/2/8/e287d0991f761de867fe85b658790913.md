In the CICO situation, there are no absolute contraindications to emergent cricothyrotomy.

Relative contraindications include possible or known tracheal surgery, fractured larynx, laryngotracheal disruption, and children. Patients with an acute laryngeal disease may have a higher rate of subglottic stenosis, making elective cricothyrotomy relatively contraindicated.
