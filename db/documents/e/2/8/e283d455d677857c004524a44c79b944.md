A simulation scenario is an artificial representation of a real-world event to achieve educational goals through experiential learning. Designing an effective simulation scenario requires careful planning and can be broken into several steps. Simulation scenarios are designed to assess, educate, and help learners to self-identify gaps in their understanding of material or application of knowledge. Simulation may also be used to address patient safety issues, clinical cases, teamwork opportunities, communication challenges, procedural competencies, and leadership skills. Designing an effective scenario requires planning, including knowledge of the target learners, goals and objectives, intended outcomes, and context. Knowledge of educational principles, including Bloom's Taxonomy, which describes the progression from novice to expert, helps develop educational goals. Scenario design must also include consideration of the level of fidelity, use of props, moulage, embedded participants, simulators, and standardized patients.
