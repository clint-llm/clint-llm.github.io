Face and brow presentation is a malpresentation during labor when the presenting part is either the face or, in the case of brow presentation, it is the area between the orbital ridge and the anterior fontanelle. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of these two presentations and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing delivery safely for both the mother and the baby.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of labor in the face and brow presentation.
- Summarize potential maternal and fetal complications during the face and brow presentations.
- Review different management approaches for the face and brow presentation.
- Outline some interprofessional strategies that will improve patient outcomes in delivery cases with face and brow presentation issues.
