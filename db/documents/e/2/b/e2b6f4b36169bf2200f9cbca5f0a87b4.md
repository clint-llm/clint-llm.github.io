Fetal movements felt by pregnant women are a sign that the fetus is growing in size and strength. The mother is usually the first to feel these movements, which can later be perceived by others. Women are often taught by their health care provider to monitor or be aware of the movements of the fetus. Decreased fetal movement can be a warning sign of potential fetal impairment or risk, and may warrant further evaluation. This activity reviews the evaluation of fetal movement and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in educating patients on how to track fetal movement which can improve patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the significance of maternal self-monitoring of fetal movement.
- Identify methods for self-monitoring of fetal movements.
- Review the warning signs of decreased fetal movement.
- Summarize the importance of coordination of care amongst the interprofessional team to improve the education of pregnant patients regarding self-monitoring of fetal movements to improve outcomes.
