History will include a patient who has had progressive worsening of respiratory status and increasing dyspnea. Depending on the specific etiology, this could happen very rapidly. A thorough evaluation should occur as disease processes such as ARDS can occur in the setting of an increased inflammatory response in the body, such as sepsis, trauma, pneumonia, and pancreatitis. History should also include medication review, specifically opioid and salicylateÂ use, as these can rarely cause noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. Recent or current blood transfusions, risk factors for pulmonary embolism, and recent thoracic surgery should be considered. With appropriate geography, rapid ascent with increasing altitude may cause noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and this should warrant further inquiry if suspected. The physical examination can rule out a cardiogenic source of pulmonary edema. Flat neck veins, appropriate fluid balance, lack of peripheral edema are findings in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema.
