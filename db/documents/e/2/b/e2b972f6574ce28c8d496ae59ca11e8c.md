Healthcare outcomes can be enhanced by sustained coordination and communication between health professionals team, which consist of physicians, nurses,Â physical and occupational therapists, neuropsychologist, social workers, language therapists, and dieticians. Maximum effective rehabilitation is achievable only when there is no communication gap, and when a strong doctor-patient relationship exists. Lack of coordination makes it unlikely to achieve full recovery.
