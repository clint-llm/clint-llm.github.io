It is important to stress the importance of regular follow up and medication compliance after a recent heart transplant. Patients should receive education about the risk and benefits of immunosuppressive therapy, including the potential for rejection despite using immunosuppressive therapy. Teaching patientsÂ about early symptoms and signs of rejection can help prevent dangerous consequences. Knowledge about the increased risk of atrial arrhythmia and lymphoproliferative disorder due to immunosuppressive therapy should be provided to all heart transplant patients.
