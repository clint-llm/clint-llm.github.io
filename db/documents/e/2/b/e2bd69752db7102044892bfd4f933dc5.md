Classically, tongue carcinoma is a condition of older males with a history of smoking and/or drinking alcohol. It has a slight male predominance, and the estimated frequency of disease varies widely with geographic location. In the past, there had been a steady decrease in the incidenceÂ of the disease, perhaps attributable to a worldwide overall decrease in smoking.

However, studies suggest an alarming increasing incidence of both oral and base of the tongue squamous cell carcinoma during the last decades, specifically in women and younger patients without the traditional risk factors of alcohol or tobacco use.
