Albumin has two essential physiologic functions

- Contribute to colloid osmotic pressure

- Aid in the transportation, distribution, and metabolism of endogenous and exogenous molecules (fatty acids, thyroid hormones, metals, oxide nitric, peptides, and drugs)

The principal mechanism of action of albumin infusion is to increase the colloid osmotic pressure. It drives the interstitial fluid into the intravascular compartment and increases the effective volume of the circulatory system.
