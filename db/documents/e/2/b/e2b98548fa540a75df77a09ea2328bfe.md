**Electromyography:**most patients are not subjected to electromyographic tests. However, electromyography demonstrates high-voltage discharges which are prolonged.

**Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):**all patients presenting with SOM are not investigated with MRI as the yield of brainstem tumors is low. However, patients who do not respond to medical treatment and present with intractable symptoms or worsening symptoms should undergo neuroimaging with specific MRI protocols (flow imaging using steady acquisition -FIESTA, or constructive interference in steady-state sequence - CISS) with imaging through the midbrain.

Magnetic resonance angiography is also requested, looking for vascular compression of the root of the trochlear nerve. This neuroimaging will detect posterior cerebellar artery compressionÂ of the trochlear nerve and detect tumors or signs of prior trauma.
