The aorta develops during the third gestational week.

The aortic arch forms through the development of the branchial arch arteries. There are six branchial arch arteries, also known as the pharyngeal arch vessels. These develop into the following

- The first branchial arch artery forms the maxillary and external carotid arteries

- The second branchial arch artery leads to the formation of the stapedial arteries

- The third branchial arch artery contributes to the formation of the right common carotid arteries and proximal internal carotid artery

- The fourth branchial arch artery forms the main portion of the aortic arch, as well as the proximal right subclavian artery - the left subclavian artery arises from the left seventh intersegmental artery, which describes a set of arteries that develop from the dorsal aorta

- The fifth branchial arch does not form vessels and regresses

- The sixth branchial arch leads to the formation of the main pulmonary artery, left and right pulmonary artery, and ductus arteriosus
