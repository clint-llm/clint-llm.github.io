Febuxostat is a non-purine selective inhibitor of the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is involved in purine catabolism.

**Pharmacokinetics**

- **Absorption:**Febuxostat is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations(Cmax) attained after 1 to 1.5 hours of oral administration. Approximately 49% of the orally administered dose of febuxostat is absorbed orally.

- **Distribution:**The steady-state volume of distribution of febuxostat is approximately 50 liters. Febuxostat has high plasma protein binding(PPB) and binds primarily to albumin. The PPB of febuxostat is approximately 99%.

- **Metabolism:**Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by conjugation via UGT( uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase) enzymes, including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7. Febuxostat is metabolized by CYPs1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and non-CYP enzymes. Febuxostat also inhibits breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) activity.

- **Elimination:**The apparent mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of febuxostat is approximately 5 to 8 hours. Metabolites of febuxostat are eliminated by both hepatic and renal routes. The percentage of febuxostat excreted unchanged in the urine is less than 5%.
