Any patient presenting with diabetic retinopathy should not receive treatment from an ophthalmologist in isolation. It requires a multispecialty evaluation by an endocrinologist, nephrologist, cardiologist, and neurologist. Interprofessional communication can lead to better patient management. The patient most often presents to the primary health care provider or nurse practitioner, and these professionals should be aware of the condition as it is treatable. Prompt referral to an ophthalmologist is necessary. These patients can then be followed by their primary clinicians and should ensure correct dosing on the medication management aspect of the condition.

NursingÂ is the first department to come in contact with the patients on follow-up. The nurse can assess the treatment progress, evaluate compliance with both medication and lifestyle measures, and report any issue to the primary care physician. This collaborative, interprofessional approach to care can ensure optimal patient outcomes.
