The muscular layer of the fallopian tubes gets sandwiched between the inner mucosa, which contains longitudinal cilia extending into the lumen, and the outermost serosa. This layer is also known as the muscularis mucosa and comprises an inner circular layer and outer longitudinal layer.

The contractions of this muscular layer work in conjunction with cilia movements and tubal secretory fluids to achieve ovum or gamete transport along the length of the fallopian tube. Short, frequent contractions help mix tubal fluid, while continuous tonic contractions not only contribute to anterograde transport of ovum or gamete but also allow the admission of an embryo across the utero-tubal junction at the most hormonally optimal point in time during the menstrual cycle.
