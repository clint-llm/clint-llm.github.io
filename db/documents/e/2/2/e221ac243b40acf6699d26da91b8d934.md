Cobalamin can be administered orally or intramuscularly depending on the cause, presentation, and demands of the patients. A patient with severe cobalamin deficiency is treated initially by the intramuscular route. If the deficiency is less severe, then oral formulation is also helpful in replenishing the B12 level. Intramuscular cobalamin remains in two forms, cyanocobalamin and hydroxocobalamin. Cyanocobalamin requires conversion to metabolically active cobalamin, which is available in the United States, whereas hydroxocobalamin is the preferred agent in parts of Europe. In the United States, cobalamin injections are usually given 1 mg daily for 1st week of treatment, then once weekly in the following month, and then every month.

Sublingual or nasal routes are expensive and inadequately studied; hence these routes cannot be recommended.

If cobalamin deficiency develops due to a strict vegan diet, oral formulation is enough in this case. High-dose oral cobalamin is also sufficient to replenish the B12 level absorbed through passive absorption or if the patient refuses to take injections. Oral daily 1-2mg of cobalamin seems to be suitable in these scenarios. The benefits of oral therapy include patient compliance, cost-effectiveness, as well as to reduce the bleeding risk in a patient taking anticoagulation.

If a patient receives a diagnosis of pernicious anemia, then treatment should be for life. If there are other causes rather than pernicious anemia, treatment should continue until hematological indices improve.

Due to cobalamin sensitivity, an intradermal test is necessary before any parenteral treatment. Because of the tendency to develop anaphylaxis, cobalamin administration is never via the intravenous route.
