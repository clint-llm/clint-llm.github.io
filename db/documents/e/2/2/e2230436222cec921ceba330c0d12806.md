Iron poisoning is commonly seen in the emergency room. The key reason why children overdose on iron tablets is because they appear as chocolate candy. In adults, the cause may be suicide or chronic blood transfusions. Iron toxicity has significant morbidity and mortality.

The management of patients with iron toxicity is usually done with an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, poison control specialist, internist, intensivist, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, and a hematologist. The acute toxicity requires reversal of the hypotension and hypovolemia. The use of the chelating agent, deferoxamine may be used in severe cases of metabolic acidosis. Patients with hemodynamic instability should be admitted to the ICU. The nurses should be fully aware of the potential toxicity of iron and closely monitor the patient. The nephrologist should be consulted in case dialysis is required.

The key is to prevent iron toxicity. The pharmacist should educate parents on keeping all iron tablets in locked cabinets and away from the reach of children. Those patients who undergo multiple transfusions should be followed by the hematology nurse and regular blood work should be done to ensure that iron toxicity is not present.

Prior to discharge, a mental health nurse should see the patient if there is suspicion of an intentional overdose. Finally, it is important to educate patients that empirical consumption of iron without any medical indications is not recommended.

Only through a team approach can the morbidity of iron be reduced. [Level V]
