As per the Fact SheetS for Healthcare Providers provided by the US FDA on granting emergency use authorization (EUA) for the use of sotrovimab, adult and pediatric patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 illness are considered to be at high risk if they meet at least one of the following criteria:

- ≥ 65 years of age

- Have chronic kidney disease (CKD)

- Pregnant women

- Have underlying diabetes mellitus (DM)

- Have underlying immunosuppressive disease

- Are currently on immunosuppressive therapy

- Have a body mass index (BMI) ≥ of 35 kg/m^2

- Cardiovascular disease or hypertension or****COPD/other chronic respiratory diseases

- Aged between 12 to 17 years and****have a BMI ≥ 85 percentile for that age and gender-based on CDC growth charts, OR

- Have sickle cell disease, or****

- Have congenital or acquired heart disease, or

- Have neurodevelopmental disorders, or****

- Have dependence on a medical-related technology device (e.g., tracheostomy, gastrostomy, or positive pressure ventilation unrelated to COVID-19, or

- Have underlying asthma, reactive airway, or chronic respiratory disease that requires daily medication for control.

The authorized dosage under the FDA issued EUA is 500 mg of sotrovimab by IV infusion over 30 minutes in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kgs) who have a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and who had symptoms for ten days or less and are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 disease

Based on the fact sheet by the FDA EUA sotrovimab is not authorized for use in patients hospitalized with COVID-19,****or who require supplemental oxygen therapy due to COVID-19, or who require increasing baseline oxygen therapy due to COVID-19 in those who were previously on chronic oxygen therapy at baseline due to non-COVID-19 related comorbidity. It must not be administered to patients with known hypersensitivity to sotrovimab.

The FDA also cautions against the use of sotrovimab in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 requiring high flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation as it may be associated with worse clinical outcomes.

Patients treated with monoclonal antibody therapies should continue self-isolation measures and follow infection control measures such as wearing masks, practicing social distancing, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces and washing hands frequently according to CDC guidelines.
