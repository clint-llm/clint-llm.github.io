The primary goal of treatment in the case of myoglobinuria is to prevent acute kidney injury (AKI), and for that, the initial therapy is mainly focused on rehydration to facilitate the renal clearance of myoglobin. The patient is started on normal saline or Ringer's lactate, and it is titrated to maintain a urine output of 200 to 300 mL/hour.

As we know, acidic urine facilitates cast formation; therefore, some specialists recommend alkalinization of urine using intravenous sodium bicarbonate. It is hypothesized to prevent cast formation and crystallization of uric acid.

Similarly, the use of diuretics in such patients is debatable. There is no substantial evidence in favor of their use.

If the patients do not respond to rehydration, hemodialysis is used as a last resort. It removes the nephrotoxic substances as well as corrects the electrolytic abnormalities. There is some evidence that the early initiation of dialysis in patients with rhabdomyolysis may improve the outcome of kidney injury.
