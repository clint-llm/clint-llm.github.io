Key histopathological features of eumycetoma are the formation of epithelioid granulomas with microcolonies and grain. Grains are conglomerates of fungal hyphae. In eumycetomas, foreign body reaction to fungal elements results in granuloma formation with epithelioid cell hyperplasia and multiple nucleus giant cells. In eumycetomas, H&E, PAS staining should be performed. The illustrated figure illustrates Aspergillus niger showing wide, branching septate hyphae and well-formed conidial heads [Figure 1].
