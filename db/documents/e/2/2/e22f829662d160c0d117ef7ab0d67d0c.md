Megestrol is a progestin, a modified derivative of the naturally occurring female hormone progesterone, indicated primarily to stimulate appetite for the treatment of significant, inexplicable weight loss in HIV/AIDS patients and anorexia or cachexia syndrome.

Megestrol has been studied heavily for various off-label uses, such as anorexia-cachexia syndrome in cancer patients, endometriosis, ovarian cancer, and advanced prostate cancer.

According to product labeling, therapy with megestrol for weight gain should be initiated after treatable causes of weight loss are ruled out. These etiologies include systemic infections,  malabsorption syndromes, and renal, endocrine, or psychiatric disorders.
