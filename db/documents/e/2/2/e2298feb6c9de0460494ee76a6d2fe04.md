Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) is a radiographic technique used to diagnose, stage, and survey hypermetabolic tissue, primarily cancer. This activity summarizes guidelines for when PET-CT is appropriate for evaluating head and neck cancer. PET-CT requires specific patient preparation and understanding of potential false positive and false negative test results depending on whether PET-CT is used for diagnosing, initial staging, or post-treatment staging of different head and neck cancer subtypes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify when PET-CT is appropriate according to the NCCN guidelines: National Comprehensive Cancer Network. Head and Neck Cancers (Version 1.2021). 
- Outline causes for false-positive PET-CT interpretations for head and neck cancer.
- Explain causes for false-negative PET-CT interpretations for head and neck cancer.
- Review next steps after an uncertain interpretation of PET-CT for head and neck cancer.
