Since the 1960s, with the development of chlordiazepoxide and shortly thereafter diazepam, benzodiazepines quickly became popular medications secondary to their vastly superior safety profiles when compared to previous sedative-hypnotics such as barbiturates and other non-barbiturates used for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia. Since their initial development, multiple benzodiazepine drugs have been developed over the course of several decades. Benzodiazepines are currently used to treat anxiety, seizures, withdrawal states, insomnia, agitation, and are commonly used for procedural sedation. Due to their many uses and addictive properties, benzodiazepines have been widely prescribed and abused since their development several decades ago. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, presentation, and etiology of benzodiazepine toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of benzodiazepine toxicity.
- Review the presentation of a patient with benzodiazepine toxicity.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for benzodiazepine toxicity.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of benzodiazepine toxicity and improve outcomes.
