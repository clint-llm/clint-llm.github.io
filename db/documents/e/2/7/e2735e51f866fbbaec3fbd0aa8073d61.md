The incidence of VITT is extremely low. The true causal relationship between this novel clinical entity and the vaccines has not been established yet but is considered plausible based on a statement issued by  The World Health Organization(WHO) on 7 April 2021. As per the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the incidence of VITT  after vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is estimated to be between 1 in 125,000 and 1 in 1 million. Notably, more than 80% of the patients in reported cases of VITT were females and aged between 20 to 55 years of age.

After a brief pause in the administration of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) completed internal reviews and favored resuming vaccination with this vaccine, emphasizing that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risk of developing thrombosis. However, the causal relationship was not described by either agency. Recently, of the nearly 6.8 million doses of Ad26.COV2. S, a small number of female patients aged between 18 and 48 developed a similar clinical constellation of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that occurred 6 to 13 days after vaccination**.**
