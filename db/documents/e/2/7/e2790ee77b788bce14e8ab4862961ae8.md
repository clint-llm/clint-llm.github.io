Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a process that involves using selective antibodies to target and stain certain antigens known to be specific to a particular condition. This creates a color signal that can be visualized on light microscopy. IHC can be used both for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Immunohistochemical stains are routinely used to help diagnose melanocytic, hematolymphoid, histiocytic, vascular, and cutaneous adnexal neoplasms.

However, their use has limitations because of the variability in sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, in most cases, multiple stains must be used to narrow the diagnostic possibilities. For example, in the diagnosis of melanocytic tumors, some stains such as S100, SOX10, and Mart-1 stain are highly sensitive and are often used not only to confirm the lineage of the neoplasm but also to highlight its overall architecture.

Another stain, PRAME is mostly positive in melanoma; however, it is not completely sensitive and can be falsely positive in some nevi. Regarding prognosis, the proliferative marker Ki-67 stain has been shown to be associated with prognosis, as it is a marker associated with the vertical growth of melanoma.
