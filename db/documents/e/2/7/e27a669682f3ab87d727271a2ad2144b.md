Before starting a PSA, the operator should have available, open, or immediately at hand and checked for operational readiness:

- IV, running or functional saline lock

- Medications and equipment for cardiac resuscitation

- Oxygen administration equipment rangingÂ from the nasal cannula to high-flow oxygen mask (nonrebreather)

- Suction device

- Airway equipment including bag valve mask, laryngeal mask airway, bougie, direct or video-assisted laryngoscopy with appropriate blades, appropriately sized oral airways, and endotracheal tubes, surgical and needle airways

- Reversal drugs if using drug-reversible agents such as opioids and benzodiazepines. Naloxone and flumazenil effectively terminate the effects of fentanyl (or of other opioids) and midazolam (or of other benzodiazepines), respectively. Of note, personnel should consider that flumazenil use can be associated with status epilepticus, mainly in patients with unidentified benzodiazepine abuse or affected by a seizure disorder.

- Monitoring equipment, usually including cardiac, blood pressure, pulse-oximetry monitors (SaO2), respirations. EtCO2 monitor is highly desirable
