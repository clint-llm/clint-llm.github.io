Blood pressure (BP) is an essential clinical value because it describes the status of the vasculature in acute and chronic states. If a patient has elevated blood pressure in the clinic on more than two occasions, the clinician can diagnose the patient with essential hypertension. BP can also be significant in acute settings, such as in the emergency room, after a patient is brought in by an ambulance due to a motor vehicle accident. At this point, it is important to assess the patient's BP because if it is low, it might indicate the patient is bleeding somewhere, and the clinician must determine the location of the bleeding as soon as possible.

S1 and S2 heart sounds are normal heart sounds heard on auscultation of the heart. S1 is the sound made due to the closure of the mitral and tricuspid valves. This is followed by systole. Then the S2 sounds are heard, which are the closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves. Diastole follows this. It is important to recognize these normal heart sounds on auscultation because abnormal heart sounds such as S3, S4, and murmurs can be signs of a pathological condition.
