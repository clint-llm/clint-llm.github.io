The congenital smooth cell hamartoma does not display any malignant transformation risk. Therefore, no treatment is necessary. However, some measurements may serve for cosmetic reasons.

Surgical excision is a possible first-line treatment, performed in different locations such as the scrotum with excellent results. In certain areas such as the face or large hamartomas, reconstruction is challenging and complicated. Therefore, other therapeutic options merit consideration.

Laser therapy may also be a consideration. Hair removal laser can be indicated to treat hypertrichosis. In congenital smooth muscle hamartomas that present as an erythematous plaque, pulsed dye laser showed interesting results in decreasing redness. This superficial laser acts by destroying blood vessels and does not have direct effects in the hamartoma.
