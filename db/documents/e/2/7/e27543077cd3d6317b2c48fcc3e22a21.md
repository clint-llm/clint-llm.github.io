Biosimilars are biological agents that are highly analogous to their reference products currently approved and licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Biosimilars can be used in various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease: adult Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis), microscopic and polyangiitis (MPA). With the latest advancements in biosimilars agents, it is now also indicated for use in specific malignancies, anemia, and diabetes mellitus—patients suffering from such conditions prompt care and oversight from an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals.

The interprofessional team should consist of a primary care clinician, specialists such as a rheumatologist, gastroenterologist, dermatologist, oncologist, and endocrinologist, alongside mid-level practitioners, nurses, a physical therapist (PT), and a pharmacist. Efficient care and communication within the interprofessional healthcare team concerning patients suffering from such ailments receiving biosimilars can improve patient access to biotherapeutics, resulting in clinical improvements, decreased disease progression, and a greater quality of life.

Prescribing clinicians and the healthcare team should be up to date with the latest guidelines, advancements, and latest FDA-approved indications for biosimilar use. Although FDA-approved biosimilars have extrapolated indications of their original biologic agents, some FDA labels of biosimilars do not designate all indications of their reference products and may potentially be considered off-label use.

Patients should be educated on biosimilars and their comparison to original biologics and reassured that FDA biosimilars possess no clinically meaningful differences in terms of their safety, purity, potency, or effectiveness compared to their respective reference biologic agents. The healthcare team should also advise patients about the potential adverse effects while receiving treatment as similar adverse effects are anticipated as the reference products. Immunogenicity should also be discussed when prescribing immunotherapeutics in a clinical setting, as it may also alter desired patient results. Additional educational material on biosimilars can be provided to patients from the FDA website.

Clinicians can expand their knowledge base and awareness of advances in biosimilars and their use in specialty practices from their respective specialty associations. Additional information can also be attained from the FDA website. The cost-saving potential of biosimilars should be taken into account and analyzed for the best treatment options for the patients. Biosimilars use in a clinical setting should be patient-focused and beneficial to the patient and not limited to provider and managed care plans. A thorough, open-ended discussion on biosimilars use for therapy between the interprofessional team, primarily the PCP and specialists, and their patients, is crucial as education on treatment with biotherapeutics in the management of inflammatory diseases can further increase medication trust and compliance and better clinician-patient rapport.
