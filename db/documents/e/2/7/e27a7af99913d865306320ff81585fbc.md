Worldwide, a significant number of patients have coronary artery disease (CAD). Many such patients end up with heart failure or impaired myocardial function from ischemia or obstruction resulting from multivessel atherosclerosis.

A subgroup of ischemic heart disease and angina patients can not be treated successfully despite optimal medical management and standard revascularization. For these patients, some advanced therapeutic options have been clinically tested, including transmyocardial laser revascularization, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, or angiogenesis by gene or cell therapy.

Transmyocardial laser extravascular angiogenesis (TMLR) has emerged as an option in patients suffering from chronic refractory angina that can improve both patientsâ€™ symptoms, exercise capacity, quality of life, and decrease their cardiac rehospitalization.

It is important to note that recently all the trials pertaining to TMLR have been closely examined. It was also found that many studies that assessed subjective improvement fromTMLR lacked blinding. Many randomized clinical trials that examined TMLR also did not use important pre-defined outcomes such as myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure, which are examined in most practice-changing RCTs in cardiology. Based on current guidelines, for the management of refractory angina, the ACC/AHA guidelines do not recommend TMLR with or without CABG.
