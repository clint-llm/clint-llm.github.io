As mentioned, the blood supply to the external nose is complicated and redundant, which permits reliable healing and infection resistance even after extensive trauma or surgical intervention. The anterior lateral nasal arteries represent the primary perfusion to the tip of the nose, and without their contribution to blood flow, division of the columellar artery during open rhinoplasty would likely lead to more healing complications.

Internally, the posterior and anterior lateral nasal arteries comprise the major blood supply to the inferior turbinate. The inferior turbinate, in addition to serving a major role in warmth, humidification, and regulation of nasal airflow, also provides a significant amount of soft tissue that is available for use in regional flap reconstruction. The inferior turbinate can be raised as an anteriorly-based flap, perfused by the anterior lateral nasal artery, and inset to repair nasal septal perforations, nasal cavity mucosal defects, and skull base defects.
