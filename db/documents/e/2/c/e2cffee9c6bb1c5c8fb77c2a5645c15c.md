Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic Gram-positive spore-forming bacillus associated with acute gastrointestinal infections ranging in severity from diarrhea to necrotizing enterocolitis and myonecrosis in humans. This pathogen possesses an arsenal of toxins responsible for disease pathogenesis and can form spores resistant to environmental stress. C. perfringens spores can survive normal cooking temperatures. Therefore, it can proliferate in foods that are improperly stored. Outbreaks are most commonly associated with improperly heated or reheated gravy, poultry, or meats. This activity will highlight the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and other key factors pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with Clostridium perfringens infections.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of Clostridium perfringens.
- Review the major toxins released by Clostridium perfringens.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Clostridium perfringens.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with Clostridium perfringens infection.
