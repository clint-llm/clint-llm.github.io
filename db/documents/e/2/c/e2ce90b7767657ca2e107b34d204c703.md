The biceps brachii muscle has two heads, one originating from the coracoid process (short head) and the other from the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula and superior labrum (long head). The distal biceps tendon attaches to the bicipital tuberosity of the radius. The biceps tendon is a strong supinator of the forearm and serves as a weak elbow flexor. The long head (proximal biceps tendon) contributes to the stability of the glenohumeral joint. The majority of biceps rupture involves the long head.

Rupture of the proximal biceps tendon can be treated conservatively, while injury to its distal attachment usually needs surgical intervention. Patients generally recover successfully if they receive a timely diagnosis and treatment.

Distal biceps tendon rupture can be complete avulsion or partial detachment from the lateral side of the radial tuberosity. Also, intersubstance muscle transaction has been reported as in cases of a rope wrapped around the muscle (tug-of-war).
