One of the most frequent surgical interventions performed in the posterior neck triangle includes radical neck dissection of lymph nodes along the sternocleidomastoid muscle after removal of head or neck squamous cell carcinoma. Performance of this surgery is routinely due to the prominence of metastasis from head and neck carcinomas through the lymph nodes found in the posterior neck triangle.

The most commonly reported complication from this surgery involves cervical stiffness and appearance-related issues resulting from fibrosis of tissue. Another more severe complication of surgery in this area is known as “shoulder syndrome” and results from damage to the spinal accessory nerve. This complication results in paralysis of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles and causes shoulder droop and pain in the neck and shoulders. Further complications include accidental transection of the transverse cervical and great auricular nerves resulting in numbness over the angle of the jaw and ear. One of the most serious complications from surgical intervention in the posterior neck triangle includes damage to the internal jugular vein.

Aside from complications due to radical neck dissection in the posterior neck triangle, arteries in this area are frequently used for flap design in plastic and reconstructive surgery.
