The pathophysiology behind TM rupture depends on the etiology of the rupture itself. For instance, perforation secondary to barotrauma is related to large or rapid changes in pressure gradients between the middle and external ear. For example, with scuba diving, the pressure in the middle ear is unequal to the pressure in the external auditory canal, creating an air squeeze. The difference across the membrane can ultimately lead to eardrum rupture.

Perforation from a foreign body (FB) or ear cleaning is from direct penetration to the eardrum itself, usually in the area of the pars tensa. The pars tensa is the largest and thinnest area of the TM, only a few cell layers thick, located in the inferior and anterior region of the eardrum. Therefore, it is the most commonly and easily torn area, especially secondary to blunt and noise trauma.

Otitis media causes necrosis and ischemia of the TM leading breakdown and rupture. The most common region for rupture is in the central membrane, followed by the anterior central and posterior central regions, correlating to the pars tensa being most frequently injured, as noted above.
