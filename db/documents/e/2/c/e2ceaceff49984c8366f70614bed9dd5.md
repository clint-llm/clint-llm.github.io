Interferons are glycoproteins that have antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory functions. They are used widely for the treatment of many conditions like hepatitis C, cancers, and immune-mediated disorders like multiple sclerosis. However, their use is associated with numerous adverse effects like fatigue, influenza-like syndrome, toxicities related to the central nervous system, the gastrointestinal tract, endocrine system, and cardiovascular, renal, and musculoskeletal systems. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of interferon-induced retinopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of interferon-induced retinopathy.
- Review the presentation of interferon-induced retinopathy. 
- Summarize the treatment of interferon-induced retinopathy. 
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by interferon-induced retinopathy.
