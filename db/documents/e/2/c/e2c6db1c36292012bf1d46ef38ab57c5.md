Clinical studies published to date on BVN ablation utilized a similar patient population, including patients with chronic axial LBP greater than 6 months of duration that has been refractory to non-operative treatment for at least 6 months, in addition to the confirmed presence of MCs type 1 or type 2 on MRI in at least one vertebral endplate, at one or more levels from the L3 to S1 region. Some studies excluded subjects with a history of spinal surgery, spinal stenosis, and use of opioids, while other studies included these, allowing for a more generalizable patient population more similar to daily clinical practice.

Additional requirements when selecting patients for BVN ablation include documented evidence of significant impairments in function, debilitating pain unresponsive to conservative care, confirmed skeletal maturity on diagnostic imaging, and a history and physical exam supporting other potential primary sources of pain have been ruled out, and vertebral pain is likely. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared the procedure in 2016 for patients that meet the above criteria.
