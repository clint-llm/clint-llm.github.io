Laboratory evaluation for azotemia includes a basic metabolic panel (BMP), BUN/Cr, urinary sodium (Na), protein, Cr, urea, urine osmolality (Ur Osmo), urinalysis (UA). Radiographic evaluation can be with a renal US (ultrasound), CT of the abdomen and pelvis with or without contrast, or renal Doppler examination.

**Diagnosis of Azotemia can be made by a BUN greater than 21 mg/dL**

Significant findings for prerenal azotemia

- BUN: Cr ratio greater than 20:1

- Fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) less than 1, fractional excretion of urea (FeUr) less than 35%

- Urine osmolality 500 mOsm/kg

- UA can show hyaline casts

**Intra-Renal Azotemia**

- BUN: Cr ratio less than 20:1

- FeNa greater than 2, FeUr greater than 50%

- Ur Osmo less than 300 mOsm/kg

- UA: Cellular debris, muddy brown casts red cell casts, eosinophils, + proteinuria

**Post-Renal Azotemia**

- BUN: Cr ratio less than 20:1

- FeNa greater than 2

- Ur Osmo less than 300 mOsm/kg

- UA: WBC casts

- Imaging findings: pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, bladder mass
