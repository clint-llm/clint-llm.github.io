Healthcare professionals should understand the most common sexually transmitted diseases in their area and should be comfortable with counseling patients on modifiable human behavior while providing a gold standard of care in line with the presenting disease. Patients should be provided information on prevention, counseling, and proper treatment for sexually transmitted infections.

**HPV Vaccine:**There is a vaccine for HPV that is over 99% effective. It requires two dosages given 6 to 12 months apart. According to the CDC, these can be given starting at age 9, are optimal at ages 11 to 12, and are recommended for everyone not previously vaccinated up to age 26.

Between 27 and 45 years, the vaccination is not automatically recommended but may be reasonable for those at high-risk for HPV infections as the benefits of prophylactic vaccination decrease as people age.

Beyond age 45, vaccinations are not recommended as most adults of this age have already been exposed and will see minimal, if any, benefit.

**HIV Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis:**While not a vaccine, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is 99% effective in preventing HIV infections in those taking the medication. Ideal candidates would be those at high-risk such as individuals with multiple sexual partners or open relationships. Patients must test negative for HIV-1 before starting this therapy and at least every three months while on prophylaxis (or every two months if receiving injections).

Of the 1.2 million individuals in the US who are considered at high-risk for HIV, where PrEP is recommended, only about 25% are taking the therapy. Strict compliance is essential to maintain the protective effects. The treatment is not considered adequate as the sole therapy for active HIV infections and will not prevent other STIs. Current recommended PrEP treatments include:

- Oral emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is FDA-approved for PrEP.

- Oral emtricitabine with tenofovir alafenamide is FDA-approved for PrEP except for people born as females who engage in vaginal intercourse, as this group has not been adequately studied.

- Injectable cabotegravir is given every two months after the first two monthly administrations.
