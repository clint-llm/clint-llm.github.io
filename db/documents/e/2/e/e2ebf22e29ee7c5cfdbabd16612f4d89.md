After diagnosis, patient education, and a prescription for conservative treatment, patients can typically follow-up as needed. Sometimes more chronic cases will need additional follow-up to consider more advanced therapies. Posterior interosseous nerve entrapment (radial tunnel syndrome) may coexist in up to 15% of cases. Keep this diagnosis in mind as a coexisting condition or alternative diagnosis if radicular symptoms are present. Corticosteroid injections have demonstrated benefit in the short-term (less than six weeks) but ineffective in the long term.

Topical nitrates are thought to increase blood flow to the area and, as a result, promote healing to the tendon. There has been some suggestion that extracorporeal shockwave therapy can be used to treat this condition chronically. However, there have been no significant improvements using this therapy thus far. Although evidence has been mixed, platelet-rich plasma and dextrose prolotherapy are pro-inflammatory agents designed to cause inflammation or irritation to the tendon and trigger a healing response. Platelet-rich plasma seems to have better evidence to date as compared to dextrose prolotherapy. Most notably, patients with chronic pain due to this condition report decreased levels of pain and increased levels of functionality compared to corticosteroid injections.
