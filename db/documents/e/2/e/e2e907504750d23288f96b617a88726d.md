Effective use of therapeutic hypothermia in neonates demands an interprofessional team of healthcare professionals working in a coordinated manner. Therapeutic hypothermia is time-sensitive management.

A therapeutic window of 6 hours from birth is crucial. If an eligible neonate is born in a setup without the cooling facility, the transport team has to transport the neonate as soon as possible to the neonatal intensive care unit with the cooling facility. Neonates on therapeutic hypothermia need interprofessional intervention, including neonatologists, neurologists, cardiologists, and nutritionists. Also, the neonate needs continuous monitoring to look for complications.

Though therapeutic hypothermia is well-tolerated, short-term adverse effects are common with therapeutic hypothermia. The healthcare team should be aware of the exclusion criteria and complications of therapeutic hypothermia.
