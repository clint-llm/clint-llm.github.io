Patients taking any antipsychotic medication require close monitoring for the appearance of side effects. Baseline electrocardiograms should be obtained in all patients with preexisting cardiac conduction abnormalities starting fluphenazine; close monitoring for electrocardiogram changes is necessary. Assessments for the appearance of extrapyramidal side effects should be routine for patients taking fluphenazine; the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale is a well-studied, easy-to-administer assessment for the emergence of extrapyramidal effects.

Clinicians should routinely obtain complete blood counts and metabolic panels to monitor for changes in white blood cell counts, liver transaminases, and blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels. Patients taking multiple medications also require monitoring for fluphenazine interactions; this medication is a major substrate of the CYP-2D6 system and is a weak inhibitor of CYP-2C9 and CYP-2E1 systems. Although serum levels of fluphenazine are not a routine part of therapy and dosing typically depends on clinical response, the therapeutic reference range is 1 nanogram to 10 nanograms per milliliter.

Monitoring a patient is also essential when discontinuing fluphenazine, which should be done gradually. Evidence exists that discontinuing antipsychotics can actually result in psychosis.
