The ophthalmic artery is intimately associated with the optic nerve (e.g., Cranial Nerve II). Additional important neurovascular structures in proximity to the ophthalmic artery include the following structures:

**Nerves**

- Lacrimal Nerve (Cranial Nerve Va)

- Frontal Nerve (Cranial Nerve Va)

- Trochlear Nerve (Cranial Nerve IV)

- Superior Division of the Oculomotor Nerve (Cranial Nerve IIIs)

- Nasociliary Nerve (Cranial Nerve Va)

- Inferior Division of the Oculomotor Nerve (Cranial Nerve IIIi)

- Abducens Nerve (Cranial Nerve VI)

- Ganglionic Branches (from Pterygopalatine Ganglion to Maxillary Nerve)

- Infraorbital Nerve (Cranial Nerve Vb)

- Zygomatic Nerve (Cranial Nerve Vb)

**Veins**

- Superior Ophthalmic Vein

- Inferior Ophthalmic Veins

- Infraorbital Vein

**Arteries**

- Infraorbital Artery
