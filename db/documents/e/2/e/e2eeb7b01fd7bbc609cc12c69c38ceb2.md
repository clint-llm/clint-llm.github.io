The goals of evaluation of TIA are

- To prove the vascular origin of the symptoms either directly or indirectly. This means to find evidence of hypoperfusion and/or acute infarction or identify a presumptive source such as a large-vessel stenosis

- To exclude an alternative nonischemic origin

- To determine the underlying vascular mechanism, for example, large-vessel atherothrombotic, cardioembolic, small-vessel lacunar. This determination allows selecting the optimal therapy for secondary prevention of TIA pr stroke.

- To identify prognostic outcome categories.

The 2009 AHA/ASA guidelines include "neuroimaging within 24 hours of symptom onset and further recommend MRI and diffusion-weighted MR imaging as preferred modalities." A head CT preferably with a CT angiogram is recommended if an MRI cannot be performed. Brain MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging has a greater sensitivity than CT for detecting small infarcts in patients with TIA. The practitioner should assess the patient's cervicocephalic vasculature for atherosclerotic lesions using carotid ultrasonography/transcranial Doppler ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography, or CT angiography. These lesions are treatable. In candidates for carotid endarterectomy, carotid imaging should be performed within 1 week of the onset of symptoms. Cardiac assessment should be done with ECG, Echocardiogram/TEE  to find a cardioembolic source and the presence of patent foramen ovale, valvular disease, cardiac thrombus, and atherosclerosis. Holter monitor or more prolonged cardiac rhythm monitor in the outpatient setting is reasonable for patients with cortical infarct without any clear source of emboli, primarily to evaluate for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Routine blood tests including complete blood count (CBC), PT/INR, CMP, FBS, lipid panel, urine drug screen, and ESR should be considered.

National Stroke Association has established guidelines for TIA evaluation as follows in 2006:

CBC = complete blood countCEA = carotid endarterectomyTCD = transcranial Doppler TEE = transesophageal echocardiogramTTE = transthoracic echocardiogram

The ABCD2 score is very important for predicting subsequent risks of TIA or stroke. The ABCD2 score was derived from providing a more robust prediction standard. The ABCD2 score includes factors including age, blood pressure, clinical symptoms, duration, and diabetes.

- Age: older than 60 years (1 point)

- Blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg on first evaluation (1 point)

- Clinical symptoms: a focal weakness with the spell (2 points) or speech impairment without weakness (1 point)

- Duration greater than 60 min (2 points), or 10 min to 59 min (1 point)

- Diabetes mellitus (1 point).

The 2-day risk of stroke was 0% for scores of 0 or 1, 1.3% for 2 or 3, 4.1% for 4 or 5, and 8.1% for 6 or 7. Most stroke centers will admit patients with TIA to the hospital for expedited management and observation if the score is 4 or 5 or higher. For those patients who have a lower score, expedited evaluation and management is still warranted. This expedited approach has been proven to improve the outcome.
