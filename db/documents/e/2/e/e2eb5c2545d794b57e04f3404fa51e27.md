During gestation, the limbs appear at theÂ fourth post-ovulatory week, approximately embryonic stage 13 (3 to 6 mm long).

The limbs develop from the proliferation of the mesoderm of the somatopleure in the lateral region of the body, which forms outgrowths in correspondence with the lumbar tract (third through fifth lumbar somites) for the hind limbs.
