Simple cysts typically do not cause any symptoms. They are most often detected incidentally during a radiological study performed for other reasons such as abdominal pain. Simple cysts usually do not interfere with kidney function and do not typically affect renal function tests.Â On rare occasions, simple cysts can lead to impaired renal function. Most people are not aware of having them. Rarely, a simple cyst can rupture and bleed, become infected, or grow so large that it causes a mass effect on other organs and abdominal pain and discomfort. There is an association between simple cysts and high blood pressure, but a causal relationship has not been proven.
