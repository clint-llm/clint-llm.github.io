The prognosis of MPS depends on symptom duration.  In acute MPS, symptoms usually resolve spontaneously or after simple treatments (heat physical modalities, stretching exercise, TrP needling or local anesthetic injection).

Chronic MPS may become recalcitrant if the underlying medical condition is not corrected
