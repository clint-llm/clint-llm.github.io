UntreatedÂ thyroid cancer can be locally invasive into the airway, esophagus, or other nearby neurovascular structures. Distant metastasis most commonly involves the lung, bone, and other soft tissue structures.

Both thyroid lobectomy and total thyroidectomy carry the potential for neurovascular injuries, with the most common involving the recurrent laryngeal nerve, leading to hoarseness of voice and potentially respiratory failure with bilateral injuries.

Treatment of thyroid cancer during pregnancy, mostly with thyroidectomy, did not show any significant increase in the complications of pregnancy.
