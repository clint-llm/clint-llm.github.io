Radiation is useful for cancer treatment due to its ability to interfere with DNA synthesis and stop rapidly dividing cancer cells from completing mitosis. It also has this same effect on healthy, normally dividing cells surrounding the tumor. Another effect is decreasing blood supply to the irradiated area by causing edema and fibrosis of the vessels (obliterative endarteritis) which can, in turn, lead to necrosis of tissue reliant on those vessels.
