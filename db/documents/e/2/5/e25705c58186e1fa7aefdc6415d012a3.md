A physical exam with a comprehensive history is paramount in making the diagnosis of cholecystitis. A complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel are also important. In cases of chronic cholecystitis, these results may be within the reference range. In acute cholecystitis or severe disease, white blood cell count may be elevated. Liver enzymes may also be elevated. If the bilirubin level is above 2 mg/dL, then consider a possible common bile duct stone. Even in the presence of severe gallbladder disease, lab values may be within the reference range. Amylase and lipase must also be checked to rule out pancreatitis. Often a CT scan is ordered in the emergency department as the first test in the workup. This imaging often shows findings of cholecystitis and gallstones. A gallbladder ultrasound is the best test to evaluate gallbladder disease initially. A distended and edematous gallbladder with gallstones or an impacted nonmobile stone in the cystic duct or Hartman pouch is a common finding with this condition. In cases of acute cholecystitis, a HIDA scan is recommended. This scan will diagnose gallbladder function or cystic duct obstruction. The addition of cholecystokinin in cases of no gallstones may also diagnose acalculous cholecystitis. This is indicated by an ejection fracture less than 35% but results in hydrops are most often 0%.
