The history will often reveal an antecedent URI, though not always. Symptoms may be very mild for a period of hours to days, until they dramatically worsen, mimicking a sudden onset. This will usually have occurred within the past 24 hours, or sometimes the last 12 hours. The patient will appear very uncomfortable, and possibly overtly toxic. Most children have no prodromal symptoms. In the emergency department, the child will likely be sitting upright with the mouth open in a tripod position and possibly have a muffled voice. Adults may be minimizing symptoms, but will likely be reluctant to lie flat or be uncomfortable when doing so. Drooling, dysphagia, and distress, or anxiety may be present (especially in children, but also in adults). These are often referred to as the 3 Ds. Swelling of the upper airway results in turbulent airflow during inspiration or stridor. Signs of severe upper airway obstruction such as intercostal or suprasternal retractions, tachypnea, and cyanosis are concerning for impending respiratory failure and should signal the provider to act quickly. Avoid an exam of the throat with a tongue blade or a flexible laryngoscope, as it may result in the loss of the airway.

Anterior examination of the neck may reveal lymphadenopathy. If cyanosis is present, it is indicative of advanced infection and poor prognosis.
