Abdominal veins bring blood lacking in oxygen from the abdomen to inferior vena cava, which then drains to the right atrium. Abdominal organs have two venous systems, the systemic one which drains directly to inferior vena cava and the portal one which drains to the hepatic portal vein and then inferior vena cava through the liver.

The systemic venous system includes common iliac, lumbar, renal, right testicular/ovarian, right suprarenal, inferior phrenic, and hepatic veins. The portal venous system includes: right and left gastric, cystic, para-umbilical, splenic, inferior mesenteric (via a splenic vein), and superior mesenteric vein. The splenic and superior mesenteric merge to form the portal vein.

Blood clotting in these venous systems can lead to splanchnic venous thrombosis. It includes thrombosis in the splenic vein, mesenteric vein, portal vein, or hepatic vein (Budd-Chiari syndrome). The most common site of venous thrombosis is a portal and mesenteric vein, with the least common being hepatic vein.
