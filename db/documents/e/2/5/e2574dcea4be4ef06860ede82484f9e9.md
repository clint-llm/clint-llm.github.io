Colchicine has been used off-label to treat several other conditions, including hepatic cirrhosis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and pseudogout. Colchicine has primarily anti-inflammatory properties. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of colchicine for gout and other indications for interprofessional team members.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various hypothesized mechanisms of action of colchicine.
- Outline the primary and secondary indications for colchicine.
- Review the potential adverse events profile of colchicine.
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional communication improving care coordination among the interprofessional team when initiating antibiotic therapy with colchicine.
