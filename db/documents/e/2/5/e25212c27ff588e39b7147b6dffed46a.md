Here are important points to take note of:

- Managing the patient's expectations is crucial in the treatment plan. Hyperesthesia and other neuropathic pain symptoms are difficult to control, and complete resolution will most likely never be achieved. It is essential to discuss this with the patient early on during the treatment course.

- Hyperesthesia and other neuropathic pain symptoms are best managed with an interdisciplinary team. This provides the best possible pain control and has the best outcomes.

- Treatment should proceed in a stepwise manner.

- Interventional procedures should be offered to patients who are not adequately managed with pharmacotherapy or wish to wean off high-risk medications such as opioids.

- It is vital to manage comorbid conditions, such as mood disorders and sleeping difficulties.

- The current treatment plan and possible treatments should be discussed with the patient regularly.
