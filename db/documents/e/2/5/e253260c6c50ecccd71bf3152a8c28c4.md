# Definition/Introduction

Osler nodes and Janeway lesions are cutaneous manifestations of endocarditis, a disease most commonly arising from a bacterial or fungal infection of the cardiac endocardium.

Dr. William Osler first described Osler nodes in 1893 and Janeway lesions by Dr. Edward Janeway in 1899. The hypothesis is that Osler nodes and Janeway lesions share similar pathogenesis and arise from micro-emboli embedding in different anatomical sites.

As per the modified Duke criteria, Osler nodes are considered immunologic phenomena of infective endocarditis, and Janeway lesions, vascular phenomena. Osler nodes more commonly correlate with subacute endocarditis, whereas Janeway lesions typically occur in acute infective endocarditis.

Osler nodes and Janeway lesions are typically differentiated based on their morphology, location, distribution, histology, and, importantly, clinical context. The differential diagnosis includes palpable purpura as found in various types of small and medium vessel vasculitis, including microscopic polyarteritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, immunoglobulin A vasculitis, cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and polyarteritis nodosa. Palpable purpura may also be a finding in paraneoplastic or malignancy-associated-vasculitis, disseminated gonococcal disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation, meningococcemia, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Buerger disease. Other causes of purple macules and patches include drug eruptions (glucocorticoid-induced purpura), arthropod bites, sun exposure (actinic/senile purpura), and rarely calciphylaxis.

# Issues of Concern

The pathogenesis of Osler nodes and Janeway lesions is a contested topic in the literature. Universally accepted clinical definitions for both skin findings do not exist either. Earlier studies of Osler nodes revealed perivasculitis with no bacteria or micro-emboli.

# Clinical Significance

Identification of Osler nodes and Janeway lesions may aid in diagnosing the underlying condition, often infective endocarditis. As per the modified Duke criteria, cutaneous manifestations are minor supporting criteria for infective endocarditis. In the pre-antibiotic era, the presence of Osler node reportedly presented in 40 to 90% of infective endocarditis cases.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

In the appropriate clinical context, patients presenting with Osler nodes and Janeway lesions should have blood cultures immediately and echocardiography. The lesions may also undergo biopsy if blood cultures are negative, and the suspicion of infective endocarditis remains high. All health care professionals need to examine the skin thoroughly when performing an assessment. If there is any uncertainty, prompt dermatology consultation is in order.
