Three branches supply the TFCC. The ulnar artery itself via small dorsal and volar radiocarpal branches and the palmar and dorsal branches of the anterior interosseous artery, a branch of the ulnar artery.

Blood supply originates from the surrounding joint tissues and variably penetrates the TFCC. Although there are different degrees of vascular penetration observed, the inner portion of the triangular fibrocartilage disc proper is considered avascular. The blood supply is limited to its peripheral zone and resembles the knee meniscus vasculature pattern.
