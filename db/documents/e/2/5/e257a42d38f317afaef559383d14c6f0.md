Lidocaine has been used to reduce propofol injection pain.  It is usable either mixed with the propofol or before propofol administration.  Either technique has demonstrated effectiveness.

Due to the severe progression of PRIS, clinicians must have a high degree of suspicion of the disease to treat it properly.  The first step to prevent worsening conditions is to discontinue the propofol infusion.  If the patient still requires sedation due to other factors, another class of sedative should be substituted.  The patient should then be hemodynamically stabilized.  In severe cases, patients may require advanced cardiorespiratory support such as extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (ECMO).  Severe bradycardia may require cardiac pacing.  Propofol can inhibit calcium channel blockers, thus making the heart resistant to catecholamine interventions.

The following steps to treat PRIS involve resolving the derangements caused by propofol.  Any electrolyte abnormalities need to be either replaced or reduced.  Hyperkalemia is treatable with calcium, insulin, beta2 agonists, or K-binders.  Metabolic acidosis often needs to be normalized with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT).  CRRT, therapeutic plasma exchange, hemodialysis, and hemofiltration are options that may help reduce serum levels of propofol, propofol metabolites, and elevated electrolytes.  Additionally, carbohydrate substitution has been shown to support fat metabolism.
