Epstein Barr Virus establishes itself as aÂ  latent infection in B cells. EBV infects naive B cells that will then undergo germinal center reactions, so the virus ultimately resides in memory B cells. Once the B cells get infected, proliferation occurs. Lymphomas associated with EBV are of germinal center B cell origin. They include Hodgkin lymphoma, and about 40% of the RS cells are infected. There is an increased risk of Hodgkin lymphoma after infection with EBV. However, this association is not new. What is new is the restriction of increased risk of Hodgkin disease to EBV positive patients without increased risk demonstrated in EBV negative patients.
