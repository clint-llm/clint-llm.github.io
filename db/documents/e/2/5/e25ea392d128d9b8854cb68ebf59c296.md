Seborrheic keratosis displays hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and some degree of papillomatosis on histological preparation. By definition, the squamous cells that make up the lesion do not show dysplasia. One characteristic finding in some seborrheic keratosis are the pseudo-horn cysts. These are circular collections of surface keratin in the acanthotic epithelium of the seborrheic keratosis lesion.

Squamous papillomas display benign squamous epithelium consisting of variable levels of acanthosis and hyperkeratosis, and focal parakeratosis overlying a fibrovascular core. These have been shown to occasionally demonstrate features of chronic inflammation.

Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia demonstrates invasive elongated processes of hyperplastic epithelium and often has inflammatory cells; however, signs that indicate malignancy are absent such as dysplasia and atypical mitoses.

Inverted follicular keratoses display endophytic proliferation of basal and squamous elements. Pigmentation, acantholysis and chronic inflammation can occur in these lesions.
