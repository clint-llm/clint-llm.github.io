Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is caused by mutations that disrupt the keratin network of the epidermis. Keratin proteins are the most important proteins necessary for the structural development of the epidermis.

Mutations in epidermolytic hyperkeratosis occur in the highly conserved a-helical rod domains of keratin 1 and keratin 10. Mutations in helix boundary sequence motifs affect helix initiation and termination motifs and lead to significantly disrupted filament assembly, tonofilament aggregation and generally, more severe phenotypes. The compromised epidermis is in turn prone to cytolysis and blistering, leading to disruption in the skin barrier function, causing increased transepidermal water loss and bacterial colonization.

Chipev et al. discovered via electron microscopy a leucine to a proline point mutation in the H1 sub-domain of the intermediate keratin 1 filament that significantly disrupted the structure and organization of keratin filaments.
