There are three main indications to perform a gastrojejunostomy:

- It can be performed to bypass an obstruction of the distal stomach or proximal small bowel such as in the setting of cancer orÂ scarring from an ulcer or other cause.

- It can be performed to bypass much of the small intestine as part of a weight-loss procedure, as is the case when a Roux-en-Y procedure is performed.

- It can be performed as part of a reconstruction procedure after subtotal gastrectomy for cancer.
