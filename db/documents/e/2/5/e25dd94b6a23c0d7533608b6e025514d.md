The set-up for olfactory training includes four sniff bottles or jars (the volume of each container should be approximately 50 ml). Inside each container is 1 ml of an odor solution soaked into cotton pads. The different scents are typically phenylethyl alcohol (rose scent), eucalyptol (eucalyptus scent), citronella (lemon scent), and eugenol (clove scent­).
