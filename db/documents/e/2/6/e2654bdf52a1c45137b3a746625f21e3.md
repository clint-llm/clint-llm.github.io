Salmonella typhiÂ infection is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes infectious disease nurses and clinicians. A pharmacist should assist with antibiotic selection, checking for interactions, and monitoring compliance as well as assisting with patient education. The key to treatment is ensuring hydration. Because of the high morbidity of the infection, prevention should be the goal. Although easily treated through current antibiotic therapies, prevention of the disease should be the mainstay of treatment. In endemic areas, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a vaccination program that should include the conjugate vaccine due to its longer-lasting immunity and safety profile in children. Travelers to endemic countries should be aware of the transmission of the disease, be advised on behavioral precautions, and should receive the vaccine whenever possible. The outcomes for patients who are treated are good but lack of treatment can lead to dehydration, multiorgan failure, and even death.
