At the cellular level, CGD can be diagnosed by measuring phagocytic leucocytes' capacity to form superoxide or hydrogen peroxide. Neutrophilic granulocytes are usually used to detect NADPH oxidase activation in the cells. Additionally, NADPH oxidase assays include cytochrome c reduction assay and the nitroblue tetrazolium slide assay, both of which measure superoxide. Other assays exist to measure hydrogen peroxide, including the dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR) assay and the Amplex Red assay. While clinical history may help indicate the patientâ€™s genetic inheritance pattern, genetic testing can identify genetic mutations.
