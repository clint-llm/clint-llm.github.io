SC must always be in mind when treating a patient with unilateral resistant blepharoconjunctivitis, or a chalazion or stye that does not resolve or recur after treatment. An incisional biopsy might be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Excisional biopsy with wide margins is considered the gold standard treatment, which is also useful to confirm the diagnosis. Routine histologic staining with hematoxylin and eosin will generally provide a diagnosis and is useful for staging of the lesion. Immunohistochemistry may also be useful to confirm the diagnosis and to differentiate from other non-melanoma skin cancers. Sebaceous carcinomas can exhibit nearly 100% EMA, ADP, and AR positivity.

While the majority of sebaceous carcinomas occur sporadically, some experts recommend screening all patients with this diagnosis for Muir-Torre syndrome.

A comprehensive physical exam to assess the globe and the periocular region for disease, as well as palpation of the preauricular and cervical areas for enlarged lymph nodes, should be performed. If the eyelid lesion appears to be diffuse or if there is any evidence of lymphadenopathy, then head and neck or even systemic imaging are warranted to evaluate the degree of disease spread. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of suspicious lymph nodes can help diagnose sebaceous carcinoma.
