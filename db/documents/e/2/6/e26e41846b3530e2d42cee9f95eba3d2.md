Medical professionals involved inÂ extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) include the performing provider, an assistant, and an anesthetist. The role of the anesthetist is essential in ensuring adequate anesthesia/analgesia to reduce the patient's stress and prevent movement of the patient due to pain during the procedure that may result in decoupling.

The provider should be present to localize the stone at the beginning of the procedure and ensure proper targeting throughout the procedure. It is common for the stone to disintegrate, move, or even start with multiple stones. Therefore it is paramount that the provider is present to primarily plan the treatment session as well as to adapt the targeting to any variation during the procedure itself.
