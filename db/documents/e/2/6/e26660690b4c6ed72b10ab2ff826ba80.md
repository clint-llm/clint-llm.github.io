In 2016, TB was estimated to be responsible for 1.3 million deaths among HIV-negative individuals and remained one of the leading infectious causes of death globally.

Approximately 1.7 billion people are estimated to have latent pulmonary TB, but only 5% to 15% of these individuals may develop active TB.

Imaging interpretation can be challenging, as tuberculosis can mimic many conditions, including malignancy and sarcoidosis.
