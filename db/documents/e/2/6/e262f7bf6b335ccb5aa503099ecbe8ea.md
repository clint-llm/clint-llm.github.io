Astrocytes can form scars following injury as they hypertrophy or divide to fill spaces resulting from cavitation of neural tissue. Astrocytes also assist microglia in the regulation of the immune response to pathological insult in the nervous system by secreting interleukin-1 (IL-1) and prostaglandins, among other factors. Astrogliosis can cause the release of inhibitory molecules that prevent nervous system recovery. However, its impairment correlates with defects in the blood-brain barrier. While reactive astrocytes are the predominant cell type involved in glial scar formation, microglia, and endothelial cells and fibroblasts also play a role.

In demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome, oligodendrocytes and/or Schwann cells degenerate in clusters. The myelin in such conditions is replaced by plaques that inhibit the transmission of action potentials along the axons. Remyelination of axons is possible in certain situations.
