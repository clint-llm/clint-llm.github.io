The cause of kyphoscoliosis is multifactorial and varies based on a patient’s demographics.

- Idiopathic causes account for a large majority of cases and remain multifactorial with unclear etiology.

- Secondary and disease-related causes include degenerative and senile changes, inflammatory disease, posttraumatic fractures, iatrogenic post-surgical changes, and repetitive microtraumas from overuse. As discs naturally degenerate, these changes can lead to alterations of normal biomechanics of the spine resulting in increased anterior wedging.
- Scheuermann disease, also known as juvenile kyphosis or juvenile discogenic disease, is a slowly progressive disorder of the spine most commonly affecting adolescents and involves the wedging of 3 or more adjacent vertebrae at an angle of more than 5 degrees.

- Congenital sources may result from malformation or segmentation of the spine during embryonic development and may be associated with spinal cord or urinary abnormalities. Defects may include rib abnormalities, absent vertebrae, or hemivertebrae.

- Functional causes are typically reversible and may be attributed to muscle spasms or malpositioning, whereas structural causes are typically irreversible.
