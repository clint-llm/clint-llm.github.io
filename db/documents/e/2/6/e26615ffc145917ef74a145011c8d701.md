The neuro-ectoderm will form the neural tube and the neural crest. The neural tube will form the central nervous system (CNS: brain and spinal cord) and control most functions of the body and mind, including control of body movement, thoughts, and homeostasis. The peripheral nervous system (PNS) includes the nerves and ganglia outside of the CNS and divides into the somatic and autonomic nervous system. The primary function of the PNS is to connect the organs to the CNS, and it forms from the neural crest. The neural crest also gives rise to Schwann cells, chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla, inner ear, cornea, odontoblasts, melanoblasts, pharyngeal arches, and the meninges of the brain and spinal cord. The surface ectoderm will give rise to the epidermis, external glands, hair, nails, anterior pituitary, and the apical ectodermal ridge amongst others. The functions of the surface ectoderm include hormone regulation by the adenohypophysis, acting as a barrier against the external involvement, and homeostasis.
