Knowledge of the brachial plexus anatomy is critical in choosing and administering an effective upper extremity anesthetic block.

The brachial plexus is derived from the C5 to T1 nerve roots. The nerve roots exit their respective intervertebral foramina, travel between the anterior and middle scalene muscles, and begin to form the brachial plexus. At the most proximal portion of the brachial plexus, the nerve roots form three trunks: the upper, middle, and lower trunks. The 3 trunks pass over the first rib, forming 2 divisions as they pass under the clavicle: the anterior and posterior divisions. Distal to the clavicle, the divisions form 3 cords: the lateral, posterior, and medial cords. Each cord gives off a branch and ultimately becomes a terminal nerve.

Choosing a regional upper limb block requires consideration of the targeted anatomy. The roots, trunks, divisions, cords, and branches require an interscalene, supraclavicular, infraclavicular, or axillary block, respectively. Particular cutaneous portions of the upper extremity may need additional, separate blocks; for example, the anterior shoulder, which has contributions from the superficial plexus (C1 to C4).
