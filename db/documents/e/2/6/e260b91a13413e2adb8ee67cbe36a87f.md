When using omeprazole, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease.

Physicians should also monitor for C. difficile-associatedÂ diarrhea and hypomagnesia when patients are on omeprazole long-term.

Omeprazole is listed in Beers criteria, and care should be taken when used in the geriatric population for more than eight weeks and reassess the need for continuation of treatment.

Monitor INR and prothrombin time in patients using warfarin and omeprazole.

Caution should be exercised when co-administered with CYP2C19 substrates (e.g., clopidogrel, citalopram, cilostazol, phenytoin, diazepam, digoxin).
