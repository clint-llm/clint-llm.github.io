Patients should be educated on the importance of prevention and ocular safety. Appropriate eye protection, especially in high-risk areas (construction, sports, military, etc.), should be prioritized.Â The use of helmets, face shields, and safety goggles should be encouraged in the appropriate situation. Eye protection should especially be advocated for in monocular patients.
