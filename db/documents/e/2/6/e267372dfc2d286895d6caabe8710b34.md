Cherry hemangiomas are common benign cutaneous vascular proliferations. They are also known as cherry angiomas, adult hemangiomas, or senile angiomas as their number tends to increase with age.****According to the current classification by the International Society for Vascular Anomalies (ISSVA) for benign vascular tumors, cherry hemangiomas are not included although they have distinct clinical and histopathological features and are highly prevalent in adults.

In the international literature, Campbell De Morgan spots have variously been known as senile angiomas, angioma eruption, angioma tuberosum, senile ectasia, angioma nodulare cutis, perles sanguines, ruby spots, and cancerodermes. Although De Morgan (1811Â to 1876) associated these spots with the presence of cancer, this is not a common finding.

According to light and electron microscopic study of telangiectasia, cherry hemangiomas are a type of papular telangiectasia. These true capillary hemangiomas consist of newly formed capillaries that have narrow lumens and prominent endothelial cells that are arranged in a lobular pattern in the papillary dermis.
