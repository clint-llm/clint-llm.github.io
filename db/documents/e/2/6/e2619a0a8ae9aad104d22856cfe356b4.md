A standardized protocol for monitoring female patients after childbirth, prolonged anesthesia, and major pelvic surgeries is highly recommended as it can help identify individuals with acute urinary retention before there is extensive detrusor damage. A bladder ultrasound to check residual volume at 4 to 6 hours post-op has been suggested as a minimal, reasonable protocol. With the wide availability of bladder ultrasound equipment in recovery rooms and hospitals, a bladder residual can easily be checked, especially in higher-risk individuals.

Rehab centers should emphasize the teaching and reinforcement of intermittent self-catheterization techniques for female patients with urinary retention. They should also be able to customize a schedule based on each patient's individual clinical situation, bladder capacity, comorbidities, capabilities, and urine production.
