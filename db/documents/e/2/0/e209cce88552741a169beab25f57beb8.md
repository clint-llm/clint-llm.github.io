The lateral femoral circumflex artery supplies blood to the head and neck of the femur. Damage to the artery itself or injury of the hip joint may compromise the blood supply to the joint and lead to ischemia and necrosis of the supplied bone and soft tissues.

Recent studies have suggested that the lateral femoral circumflex artery contributes to the blood supply of the anteroinferior femoral neck. Hence, femoral neck fractures may damage the terminal branches of the lateral femoral circumflex, compromising the blood supply to the femur and surrounding soft tissues.

The lateral femoral circumflex artery may be at risk during intramuscular injections of the anterior thigh as well as ultrasound-guided hip joint injections.

The lateral circumflex femoral artery along with its septocutaneous branches and musculocutaneous perforators are the main blood supply of anterolateral thigh flaps, a soft-tissue flap used in reconstructive surgeries.

Surgeons can use the descending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery in bypass grafting and vascular reconstructions. It also has utility in posterior inferior cerebellar artery revascularization,
