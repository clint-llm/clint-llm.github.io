The middle cerebral artery (MCA) is a critical artery which has an extensive clinical significance. The MCA is part of the circle of Willis anastomotic system within the brain, which forms when the anterior cerebral arteries anastomose anteriorly with each other through the anterior communicating artery and posteriorly with the two posterior communicating arteries bridging the MCA with the posterior cerebral artery on each side. The MCA is the most common pathologically affected blood vessel in the brain.
