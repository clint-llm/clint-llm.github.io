In developed countries, ischemic cardiomyopathy due to atherosclerotic coronary artery disease accounts for about 70% of HFrEF patients. Studies have shown that 50% of patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure with reduced ejection have a significant volume of viable myocardium.

The overall mortality in patients with HFrEF due to ischemic cardiomyopathy is 39%, which is lower in patients with viable myocardium than with non-viable myocardium, ie, 37% vs. 51%.
