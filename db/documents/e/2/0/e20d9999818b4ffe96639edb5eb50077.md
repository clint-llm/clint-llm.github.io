Airway protection remains the foremost focus. If the patient is requiring a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube placement, they have likely already been intubated for airway protection, but if not, endotracheal intubation should be performed prior to placement. Following intubation, the patient should be placed in the supine position with the head of the bed elevated to 45 degrees. If this position is not possible, the next best positioning is left lateral decubitus. Next, the gastric and esophageal balloon should be inflated to check forÂ leaks. The balloons should then be fully deflated and lubricated. Nasogastric tube marking should be done prior to placement. Hold the distal end of the nasogastric tube 2 cm above the gastric balloon and mark at the level of the 50 cm line on the tube. Do the same 2 cm above the esophageal balloon.
