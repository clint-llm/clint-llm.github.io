Bimatoprost is one of the most effective first-line treatments for both open-angle glaucoma and hypotrichosis of the eyelashes. Several large, double-masked randomized control trials have shown bimatoprostâ€™s superior efficacy in lowering IOP in primary open-angle glaucoma [Level 1], and treatment efficacy of hypotrichosis has been demonstrated.

Ultimately, collaboration and communication amongst an interprofessional team of ophthalmologists, ophthalmic technicians, nurses, and the patient will ensure the best care for the patient. A well-educated patient will, in turn, improve patient acceptance and compliance with the prescribed medication, resulting in optimized outcomes.
