Cerebellar-projecting neurons transmit proprioceptive information through the central nervous system. ATOH-1 is a transcription factor implicated in forming these neurons. Research has determined that ATOH-1 lineage neurons contribute to the reception of unconscious proprioceptive information from both the hindbrain (non-Clarke's division of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract) and those from the forelimb (cuneocerebellar tract).
