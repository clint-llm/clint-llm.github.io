Z-plasty is a commonly employed transposition flap utilized in plastic and reconstructive surgery to revise scars.

The earliest records of this technique date back to the early 1800s in a publication at the Philadelphia Hospital Department of Surgery, when Horner described using single transposition flaps. The geometry of what clinicians considered the Z-plasty then was not the same as it is today. At the turn of the century, the “Z-plasty method” became more popular when a publication by Berger in 1904 suggested the use of equal limbs and equal angles. In 1914, Morestin proposed using multiple Z-plasties to address more extensive scarring. However, it was Limberg, in 1929, who delved into the rotational and advancement dynamics of the flaps commonly employed today.
