In familial cases that constitute the majority of the reports to date implicate a genetic abnormality involving chromosome 2. A hypothesis of altered expression of a gene-protein complex akin to p34 involvement in PPKP1 has been previously mentioned (vide supra). In sporadic cases, factors like excessive sun-exposure and chronic trauma may serve as possible triggering factors.

Elastorrhexis is the histo-pathophysiological hallmark of the disorder. Exaggerated production and accumulation of filaggrin in the form of a dense band over stratum granulosum, before getting incorporated into the protein matrix of mature epidermal keratin has been postulated to result in the formation of the characteristic keratotic papules.
