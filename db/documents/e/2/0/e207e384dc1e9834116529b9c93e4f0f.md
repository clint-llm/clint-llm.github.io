Clinicians should educate patients about the causes and risk factors of miliaria, including hot, humid climates, and wearing non-breathable clothes. If a patient is predisposed to miliaria, the clinician should create a personalized plan for the patient that includes methods of avoiding overheating, andÂ what to do when the rash appears. Clinicians should also educate patients on the signs and symptoms of heat exhaustion if they develop anhidrosis secondary to miliaria.
