During embryogenesis, vertebrae generally develop from three primary ossification centers: one in the centrum of the vertebral body and one in either vertebral arch. However, during the first year of life, five ossification centers can be identified. One is located at either transverse process, one at the edge of the spinous process, and one at both the superior and inferior portions of the body. The bone that is ossified from these five areas contributes to the development of growth plates. Consequently, the absence or asymmetry of growth plate development can be a contributing factor to congenital defects of cervical vertebrae.
