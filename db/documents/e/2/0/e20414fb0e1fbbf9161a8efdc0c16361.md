These include:

- Examination of the normal pelvic contents including the uterus, ovaries, and adnexal structures.

- Masses palpated on physical examination can be further evaluated with US. Some commonly palpated masses include large ovarian tumors, congenital abnormalities of uterine shape (often noted in pregnancy), and uterine fibroids.

- Patients who present with pelvic pain can be evaluated by US. Often the diagnoses of pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, and normal pregnancy are made. Less often during pelvic US, appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or diverticulitis is diagnosed.

- Abnormal vaginal bleeding can be related to possible pregnancy, known pregnancy, menses, precocious puberty, and postmenopausal bleeding.

- Evaluation for appropriate positioning of an intrauterine device.

- Evaluation for polycystic ovarian syndrome and infertility.

- US can be utilized for proof of ascites or other free fluid.

- In the male patient, pelvic US can evaluate the prostate and seminal vesicles. The prostate, particularly when looking for malignancy, is best assessed with a transrectal probe.

- US can be utilized for assistance in performing needle biopsies and aspiration of free fluid.
