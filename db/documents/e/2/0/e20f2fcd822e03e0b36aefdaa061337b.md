Often, when scapular winging is present due to injury to the long thoracic nerve, other nerves and structures near the anatomy can be affected as well. The long thoracic nerve, which is usually the nerve affected in this condition and leads to scapular winging, branches from the brachial plexus, a network of nerves formed that initiates at the lower four cervical nerve roots and the first thoracic nerve root (C5 - T1). Damage to the brachial plexus can cause neurologic problems in the upper extremities and the trunk.
