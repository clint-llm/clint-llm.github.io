Elbow dislocations are fairly common in clinical practice, however, they can be associated with neurovascular compromise. Hence, the primary care provider, nurse practitioner and emergency department physician should always refer these patients to the orthopedic surgeon. The prognosis for most elbow dislocations is good but in some cases, recurrence is a problem.
