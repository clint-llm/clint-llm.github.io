The triple arthrodesis is considered a definitive procedure for many pedal deformities and gait disturbances.  Conditions it may be performed in include

- End-stage flatfoot deformities due to loss of soft tissue structures or joint adaptive changes of surrounding joints and pain

- Degenerative or Posttraumatic Arthritis due to pain

- Cavus foot deformities due to joint adaptive changes of surrounding joints and pain

- Charcot arthropathy after coalescence with risk for ulceration, or an apropulsive gait.

- Tarsal coalitions due to pain or degeneration of the ankle joint/surrounding joints

- Residual clubfoot deformities causing pain, joint degenerative disease or an apropulsive gait

- Certain neurological conditions resulting in neuromuscular imbalances and an apropulsive gait
- Charcot-Marie-Tooth
- Poliomyelitis
- Friedreich ataxia
- Spina bifida
- Cerebral palsy

Many conditions may be treated using other motion-preserving procedures, so the decision to perform the triple arthrodesis is always dependant on patient condition, disease progression, and surgeon preference.
