Epidemiologists estimate the prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), conduct disorder (CD), intermittent explosive disorder (IED), concomitant ODD and CD, and kleptomania to be 3.3%, 4%, 2.7%, 3.5% and 0.6%, respectively. Pyromania has proven rarer than its other impulse control disorder (ICD) counterparts; a study investigating those incarcerated for arson found that only 3% met the criteria for pyromania.

Most ICD diagnoses occur more frequently in boys than girls, besides kleptomania, which occurs three times more frequently in females. ODD has the greatest incidence before adolescence, whereas CD peaks in middle adolescence. IED tends to vary more greatly, but studies suggest persons are usually younger than 35 to 40 years old.
