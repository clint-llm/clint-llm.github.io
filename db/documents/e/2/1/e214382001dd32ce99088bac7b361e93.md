Tendons of the cubital tunnel, as well as all parts of the cubital tunnel, are visible via ultrasound of the elbow. With this technique, Osborne's band can be appreciated covering the ulnar nerve in the cubital tunnel. The ulnar nerve is also visible if the probe moves slightly distal to the band. At this point, the ulnar nerve can be noted lying between the two bellies of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle.
