Different approaches can be useful for evaluating STM domains. For instance, the verbal component investigation is through simple tests based on the recall of words, or digits. The simple span tasks approach, also known as STM tasks, examines the storage of either verbal (phonological) or visuospatial information. Alternatively, more complex methods such as those based on serial position effects in the immediate serial recall are options. Population-specific approaches are used, for example, in children. In this setting, the performances of the STM are investigated, within the WM, through the Automated Working Memory Assessment,

Memory evaluation and cognitive decline

Although memory gets investigated among cognitive performances by validated instruments such as the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), research has led to the design of specific tools for assessing STM impairment alone and provide information about the degree of the memory impairment. The Short-Term Memory Recall Test and its simplified version can be useful for identifying memory impairment as a pre-dementia state,
