Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is a rare heterogeneous condition described as a series of recurrent life-threatening infections. Defective phagocyte NADPH oxidase causes the disease. The ultimate result is the inability of phagocytes such as neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages to destroy certain microbes.  This disorder is best managed by a hematologist and an infectious disease specialty. Primary care providers and nurse practitioners may follow up on these patients, but open communication with the specialist is highly recommended since these patients can quickly develop fulminant infections, leading to death. Pharmacists should evaluate medications prescribed, check for dosage and drug-drug interactions, and provide patient education. Nurses administer ordered treatments and report changes in condition to the team. These examples show how interprofessional teamwork will drive improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
