Achalasia is an esophageal smooth muscle motility disorder that occurs due to a failure of relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. This condition causes a functional obstruction at the gastroesophageal junction. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of this condition, and highlights the need for collaboration amongst interprofessional team members to improve care coordination and in turn improve the diagnosis and treatment of this condition, leading to better outcomes for patients with achalasia.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of achalasia. 
- Outline what components go into the Eckardt symptom score and what each score means.
- Identify the best first test for achalasia with the most sensitive test for achalasia. 
- Describe how collaboration amongst interprofessional team members to improve care coordination and minimize oversight, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment and better outcomes for patients with achalasia.
