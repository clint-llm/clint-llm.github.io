An interprofessional team best treats osteoma cutis. This team should include a primary care clinician, a dermatologist, a plastic surgeon, and a dermatopathologist. The primary care clinician can further evaluate and treat the underlying causes in secondary osteoma cutis. Patients will have better outcomes when the team communicates effectively.
