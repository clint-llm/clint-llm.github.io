Evaluation for evidence of local tumor spread should be performed immediately after diagnosis. Regional lymph nodes should be palpated for evidence of metastasis, with a biopsy performed on concerning lymph nodes. Ophthalmologists usually diagnose patients diagnosed with SC of the eyelids; a comprehensive ophthalmic examination is mandatory to assess for the clinical tumor extension.

There is no clear consensus and guidelines concerning the systemic evaluation of these patients; however, patients with large tumors, or those where there has been delayed diagnosis, should undergo imaging with CT or MRI to evaluate for a distant extension. Patients with Muir-Torre may also receive benefits from a PET scan for early detection of visceral malignancies.
