The adenoviruses are DNA viruses common in animals and humans, occurring frequently in both adults and children. There are more than 100 serologically different types of adenovirus, with 49 types that infect humans. The virus infects multiple organ systems; though, most infections are asymptomatic. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of adenovirus and highlighting the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of adenovirus disease.
- Outline the pathophysiology of adenovirus.
- Review the epidemiology of the classic adenovirus disease.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients affected by adenovirus.
