Several studies have tested age-related peanut exposure in the development of peanut allergy. One studyÂ evaluated the prevalence of peanut allergy in Israeli Jewish children compared to Jewish children living in the United Kingdom (UK). Peanut introduction differs in these two populations whereby peanut-containing food is not restricted in Israel while it is typically delayed until the age of 2 in the UK. The results showed that Israeli children have a decreased frequency of developing a peanut allergy compared to the UK group, suggesting that the early introduction of peanuts may offer protection from developing a peanut allergy.

Risk factors include:

- History of atopy

- Family history of peanut allergy

- Maternal consumption of peanuts during pregnancy

- Use of certain oils to fry/roast peanuts
