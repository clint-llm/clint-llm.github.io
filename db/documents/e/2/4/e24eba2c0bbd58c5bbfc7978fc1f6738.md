Around 50% of patients with Torsades de Pointes are asymptomatic. The most common symptoms reported are syncope, palpitations, and dizziness. However, cardiac death is the presenting symptom in up to 10% of patients.

Patients with Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome may have a history of deafness.

Today one needs to be aware that drug-induced long QT syndrome is common and hence, a thorough medication history must be obtained.

Patients with torsade may be hypotensive, have a rapid pulse and have loss of consciousness.
