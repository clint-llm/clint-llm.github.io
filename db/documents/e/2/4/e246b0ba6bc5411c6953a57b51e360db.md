The definition of anemiaÂ is either a decreased amount of circulating red blood cells (RBCs), the amount of hemoglobin (Hgb), or volume of packed RBCs (hematocrit).

Anemia classifies as either acute or chronic:

- Acute anemia occurs when there is an abrupt drop in RBCs, most often by hemolysis or acute hemorrhage.

- Chronic anemia, on the other hand, is generally a gradual decline in RBCs, and causes include iron or other nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, drug-induced, and other causes.
