Compression of the nearby structures due to the "mass effect" of the growing tumor can lead to various compressive issues. Synovial sarcoma rarely metastasizes to the brain and can lead to seizures and other neurologic complications. Clot-formation can occur due to compressive effects or secondary to the presence of a tumor in the body. The complications from the use of chemotherapy include myelosuppression, hair loss, nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia.

Many adverse events are specific to the class of the drug used. For example, anthracycline can cause cardiac complications, ifosfamide can cause neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, pazopanib can cause cardiac and hepatic toxicity, and trabectedin can lead to cardiac, hepatic, and myelotoxicity. All providers must be aware of potential toxicities from the various chemotherapy regimens.
