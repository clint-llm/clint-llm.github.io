Patients should not receive anti-TNF agents if there is a history of hypersensitivity reaction to the agent. Clinicians should not initiate and should discontinue ongoing therapy in the presence of an active infection or sepsis. Anti-TNF agents are also contraindicated in patients with NYHA Class III or IV congestive heart failure.

While conventional non-biologic DMARDs such as methotrexate, leflunomide, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine can be used in combination with anti-TNF agents, concomitant use of an anti-TNF agent with another biological immunosuppressive agent is contraindicated.
