One of the clinical significance of knowing different areas, functions, and arterial supplies of the cerebral hemispheres is knowing which area of the brain suffered damage in a stroke. The anterior cerebral artery supplies the motor and somatosensory of the contralateral lower limb. Therefore, anything affecting the normal flow of blood to the anterior cerebral artery will result in motor weakness and sensory loss in the contralateral lower limb. The middle cerebral artery supplies the motor and somatosensory of the contralateral face, lip, and upper limb. Therefore, anything affecting the normal flow of blood to the middle cerebral artery will result in motor weakness and sensory loss in the contralateral face, lip, and upper limb.

Aneurysm of the cerebral arteries can affect blood flow and compress the cerebral hemispheres and present differently depending on which area is affected. The most common site of an aneurysm is the anterior cerebral and the anterior communicating artery. Aneurysm of the anterior cerebral artery can present with contralateral lower limb numbness and weakness, while aneurysm of the middle cerebral artery can present with contralateral facial and upper limb numbness and weakness. Most aneurysm, however, is clinically silent until rupture resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage and present with a severe headache.
