Postoperative rehabilitation protocols for SCFE are poorly described in the literature. However, it follows the same pattern for postoperative rehabilitation following hip preserving procedures, e.g., hip arthroscopies.

**Phase 1**

It involves using appropriate walking aids and performing gait analysis to assess the patientâ€™s heel-to-toe pattern. The main focus of the phase is the reduction of joint inflammation, protection of soft tissue repair, synergistic muscle activation, and range of motion.

**Phase 2**

Weaning off crutches once the patient has a normal pain-free gait pattern and can perform pain-free straight leg raises and abduction.

**Phases 3 and 4**

Increasing range of motion and aerobic conditioning. In addition to strengthening functional movement patterns.

**Phase 5**

Ensuring adequate functional power is crucial for returning to daily activities or playing. The time frame for a return to play is variable and set by the treating surgeon based on the case.
