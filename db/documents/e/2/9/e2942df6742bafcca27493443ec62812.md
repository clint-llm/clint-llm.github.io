Refusal to attend school was not a stand-alone clinical entity, but instead, it can be a manifestation of an underlying affective or behavioral disorder defined in the DSM-5. Apprehensive school refusal and truancy are symptoms, rather than distinct diagnoses.

Diagnosis often depends on history. Physical examinations are generally unremarkable.
