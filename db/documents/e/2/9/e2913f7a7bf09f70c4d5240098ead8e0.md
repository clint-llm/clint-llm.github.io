Therapeutic levels: 5 mcg per mL

Supportive treatment for the more commonly experienced adverse side effects of difelikefalin, including vomiting and diarrhea, will increase positive patient outcomes. The health care team needs to avoid dehydration, acid-base disturbances, or an electrolyte imbalance when managing patients receiving difelikefalin. Providers should ensure adequate hydration status and assess patients with routine labs, administering electrolyte repletion as indicated.

If the adverse effect of dizziness is experienced in patients taking difelikefalin, fall risk measures must be taken to avoid injury, especially in patients who are elderly or frail.

Opioid withdrawal symptoms were not observed after the cessation of treatment with difelikefalin.
