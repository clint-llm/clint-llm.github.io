Nasolacrimal duct obstruction causes epiphora. Epiphora can be caused by problems with the secretory part of the lacrimal system or the excretory part. A combination of a detailed history and examination, together with appropriate investigations, will allow the surgeon to determine the cause of the epiphora. A detailed discussion of the history, physical findings, and relevant investigations is presented in the articles "Epiphora" and "Epiphora - clinical testing." Nasolacrimal duct obstruction may present with epiphora together with a mucoid discharge, and there may be a mucocele if there is a collection of mucous within the lacrimal sac. In the presence of dacryocystitis, there may be pain in the medial canthal region.

A detailed history is taken, and an ophthalmic and endoscopic nasal examination performed preoperatively.

Several pertinent points must be elicited as the clinical history of epiphora can often be diagnostic.

- Epiphora characteristics

- Laterality
- Duration
- Variability through the day
- Variability indoors vs. outside (often patients have a component of reflex tearing)
- Location (epiphora related to NLDO will result in overflow of tears medially or centrally over the lower lid, whereas lateral epiphora is more likely related to the "wick syndrome")
- Effects (previous dacryocystitis, repeated antibiotic prescriptions, repeated health care presentations, excoriation of the skin)
- In the pediatric patient: has the epiphora been present since birth? If so, has it improved?

- Past medical history

- Previous nose or sinus surgery
- Previous facial trauma or fractures
- Previous rhinitis/rhinosinusitis
- General health
- Current medications, in particular, anticoagulants
- In the pediatric patient: obstetric and birth history, prematurity, diagnosis of other medical issues, or syndromes.

- Previous treatments for epiphora

- Previous ophthalmic history particularly dry eyes, Meibomian gland dysfunction, previous refractive surgery

- Palpation for swelling of the lacrimal sac, mucocele, site of swelling (above or below the medial canthal tendon)
