**Systemic Therapy**

Systemic therapy is limited to a select group of patients but is still of great interest given the increasingly sophisticated understanding of aberrant cell signaling pathways. There are case reports using various targeted agents to help improve and address growth. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF) and its receptor VEGF-R are critical to angiogenesis and have been detected in schwannomas. As a result, Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody VEGF inhibitor, has been utilized in patients with NF-2 that have progressive vestibular schwannomas and are not candidates for standard therapies. It was reported that 9 of the 10 patients treated had tumor shrinkage, with 4 having a hearing response.
