There is a dearth of information regarding the impact of patient education on alopecia. In a 2018 population-based study, half of the participants were provided knowledge about androgenetic alopecia, and treatment willingness was compared between the educated and non-educated groups. Accurate knowledge about androgenetic alopecia showed a 1.7-fold higher tendency to receive treatment.

Whether this data can be extrapolated to other types of alopecia is unknown. A 2022 pre-test/post-test study to “investigate the efficacy of an online social media video library for improving patient knowledge of hair loss disorders” showed that video-based educational content can effectively educate patients about alopecia. The study included both sexes of all ages with androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, telogen effluvium, FFA, and LPP.
