Cervical vertebrae are unique from other vertebrae in many ways. The bifid spinous process is one of Them. But not all cervical vertebrae of all individual has a  bifid spinous process. Many studies show that only C2-C4 possess bifid spinous processes consistently. The prevalence  is  lowest for the C7 spine (0.3% of the population.) Therefore, using this parameter to identify cervical vertebrae is not always reliable.

Secondary ossification centers in the superior and inferior surfaces of the vertebral body contribute to the development of the growth plate. Any interruption in this process can result in a significant congenital abnormality in cervical vertebrae.
