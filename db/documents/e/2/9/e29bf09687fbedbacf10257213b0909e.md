Kyrle disease must be differentiated from other disorders that cause papular or nodular eruptions with hyperkeratotic central plugs. These include the following:

- Prurigo nodularis (some authors argue Kyrle disease is a variant of prurigo nodularis)

- Multiple keratoacanthomas (can also mimic Kyrle disease histologically)

- Excoriated lesions (prurigo simplex)

- Folliculitis

- Arthropod hypersensitivity reaction

- Perforation of exogenous or endogenous foreign material

- Dermatofibromas

If koebnerization occurs, more linearly distributed lesions should be included in the differential. These include the following:

- Psoriasis

- Lichen planus

- Verrucae

Diagnosis can be difficult as patients with acquired perforating disorders often have co-existing folliculitis and prurigo nodularis.
