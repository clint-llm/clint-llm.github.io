Parenteral and enteral feedings are considered in patients with insufficient oral intake or contraindications to anything by mouth. Nutritional support provided includes protein or amino acids, carbohydrates, fiber, fat, water, minerals, and vitamins. Parenteral nutrition refers to the delivery of calories and nutrients via a vein whereas enteral tube feeding refers to delivering nutrition via a tube directly into the gut (stomach, duodenum, or jejunum). Enteral feeding is superior to total parenteral nutrition (TPN) due to fewer infectious complications, reduced cost, earlier gut function, preservation of gut mucosa and immune function, and reduced hospital length of stay.

Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes serve as the favorable route of feeding and nutritional support in patients with a functional gastrointestinal (GI) system who require long-term enteral nutrition, usually beyond 4 weeks.
