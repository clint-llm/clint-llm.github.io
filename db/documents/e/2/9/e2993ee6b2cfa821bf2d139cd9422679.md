Gas gangrene is a highly lethal infection of soft tissue, caused by Clostridium species, with Clostridium perfringens being the most common. This is synonymous with myonecrosis and is characterized by rapidly progressive gangrene of the injured tissue along with the production of foul-smelling gas. This activity explains the evaluation and management of gas gangrene and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of gas gangrene.
- Describe the evaluation of gas gangrene.
- Outline the use of antibiotics, early surgical debridement, intravenous fluid resuscitation, ICU monitoring, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the management of gas gangrene.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by gas gangrene.
