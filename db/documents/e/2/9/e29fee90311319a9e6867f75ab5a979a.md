Nabothian cysts (also called mucinous retention cysts or epithelial cysts) are a common and benign gynecological condition in reproductive age without clinical significance. These cystsÂ are at the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ) of the uterine cervix, which is the targeted anatomical area of brush sampling at the time of cervical screening cytology. They are filled with mucus, but they may also contain proteinaceous material, neutrophils, or neutrophil debris. These cysts usually appear superficially and are easily recognized during colposcopy examination.

Multiple and large cysts, situated in the cervical stroma, can induce considerable enlargement of the cervix, which can lead to symptomatology. Other causes of these large cysts include cystic degeneration of uterine leiomyoma and congenital uterine cysts such as mesonephric and paramesonephric cysts and cystic adenomyosis.
