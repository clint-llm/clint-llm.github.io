The post-ganglionic fibers of the cervical sympathetic ganglia with their respective courses and destinations are as follows:

**Superior Cervical Ganglion**

- Internal carotid nerve: The internal carotid nerve travels with the internal carotid artery, eventually forming a plexus of nerves that innervate the internal carotid artery, pterygopalatine artery critical eye structures (Müller's muscles, pupillary dilator muscles, orbital vasomotor muscles, and lacrimal glands).

- External carotid nerve: The external carotid network of nerves travel with the common and external carotid arteries to innervate the smooth muscle of arteries, with some fibers traveling with the internal maxillary artery to innervate the sweat glands of the face.

- Gray rami communicantes: Some post-ganglionic fibers distribute to spinal nerves of vertebral levels C1-C4 via gray rami communicantes, which essentially serve as conduits.

- Nerve to pharyngeal plexus: One of the post-ganglionic neurons travels to the pharyngeal plexus, where it becomes intertwined with branches from the vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves.

- Superior cardiac nerve: The superior cardiac nerve travels to the thoracic cavity to reach the cardiac plexus.

**Middle Cervical Ganglion**

- Inferior thyroid nerves: Some post-ganglionic fibers travel along the inferior thyroid artery to innervate the esophagus, pharynx, trachea, and larynx.

- Gray rami communicantes: Post-ganglionic fibers distribute to spinal nerves of C5-C6 vertebral levels.

- Middle cardiac nerve: The middle cardiac nerve travels to the thoracic cavity to reach the cardiac plexus

**Inferior Cervical/Stellate Ganglion**

- Nerves to subclavian and vertebral arteries: Branches to these vessels innervate the smooth muscles in the arteries.

- Gray rami communicantes: Post-ganglionic fibers route to the spinal nerves of C7, C8, and T1.

- Inferior cardiac nerve: The inferior cardiac nerve travels to the thorax and contributes to the cardiac plexus.
