- There is extensive published data related to bupropion overdose.

- In intentional overdoses, seizures are pretty common. They occur in up to one-third of overdose exposures, though usually more in the range of 10% to 15%. Seizures typically occur within the first 6 hours after exposure, but one should exercise caution in extended-release preparations. In overdoses of the extended-release form, experts recommend an observation period of 24 hours due to the potential for delayed seizure onset. Though agitation and tremor often precede seizures, there are cases of delayed seizures described with no prior symptoms.

- Other effects include hallucinations, mental status changes, agitation, arrhythmias. Cardiovascular effects are uncommon after an overdose.

- As in any overdose situation, the treating clinician should rule out the presence of coingestants.

- Bupropion abuse is rare, but reports do exist.
