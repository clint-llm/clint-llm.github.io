Careful communication between perioperative stakeholders (surgeon, perfusionist, anesthesiologist, nurse, and scrub technician) is critical during any cardiac surgical procedure. Institution-wide policy involving pharmacists should be implemented regarding the preparation of cardioplegia solutions. The WBC is technically demanding and is often associated with vasodilation, requiring pressors to maintain mean arterial pressure. Close interprofessional communication between the anesthesiologist and perfusionist should be maintained to prevent hypoperfusion and end-organ damage. This type of interprofessional teamwork and open information sharing will drive improved patient outcomes from all cardiac procedures, including warm blood cardioplegia. [Level 5]
