Brown recluse spider venom is cytotoxic and hemolytic. It has many enzymes that contribute to the clinical manifestations. Sphingomyelinase D, one of the more well-studied components, has been shown to direct toxin-mediated hemolysis and complement-mediated erythrocyte destruction. It does this by activating the complement system.  Within the venom, there are additional proteases that degrade collagen, fibronectin, fibrinogen, gelatin, elastin basement membranes that on their own may not be able to cause the local reaction seen with brown recluse bites but seem to have a synergistic effect with sphingomyelinase D leading to many of the cutaneous findings. Hyaluronidase, alkaline phosphatase, esterase, and ATPase also seem to have effects leading to the cutaneous manifestations of bites.
