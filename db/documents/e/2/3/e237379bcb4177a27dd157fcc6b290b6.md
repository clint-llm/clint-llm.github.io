MSICS has revolutionized cataract surgery in today's era, especially in low-income and developing countries. Large-scale studies have quoted similar long results of MSICS and phacoemulsification considering visual acuity and astigmatism.

MSICS offers the advantage under challenging cases where an excellent outcome can be achieved without complication. MSICS has served as a stepping stone for performing good phacoemulsification as the majority of steps of both the surgeries are similar except for the trenching and emulsification in phacoemulsification. MSICS is more of a skill-based surgery that improves surgeons' tissue handling.
