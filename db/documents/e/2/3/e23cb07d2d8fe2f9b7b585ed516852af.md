The etiology of ovarian cysts or adnexal masses ranges from physiologically normal (follicular or luteal cysts) to ovarian malignancy.

Risk factors for ovarian cyst formation include

- Infertility treatment- Patients treated with gonadotropins or other ovulation induction agents may develop cysts as part of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.

- Tamoxifen.

- Pregnancy- In pregnancy, ovarian cysts may form in the second trimester when hCG levels peak.

- Hypothyroidism

- Maternal gonadotropins- The transplacental effects of maternal gonadotropins may lead to the development of fetal ovarian cysts.

- Cigarette smoking

- Tubal ligation- Functional cysts have been associated with tubal ligation sterilizations.
