A comprehensive history of all underlying medical illnesses and any immunocompromising risk factors should be promptly obtained in all cases of bacterial prostatitis. This helps to evaluate the potential risks of developing a prostate abscess. The persistence of symptoms in acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis, especially in patients with high-risk factors or inadequate prior treatment, should alert clinicians to the need to evaluate for an abscess. As this pathology commonly derives from an ascending urinary tract infection, patients present with a range of urinary symptoms like increased urinary frequency, urgency, dysuria, hematuria, and urethral burning. In some cases, patients can present with difficulty in urination or even acute urinary retention.

Physical examination findings that may present in the presence of a prostate abscess are a purulent urethral discharge, painful digital rectal examination, and possible fluctuant areas in the prostate. Unfortunately, the mere finding of a sore, swollen and tender prostate does not distinguish a prostatic abscess from prostatitis, and fluctuance is found in as few as 16% of prostatic abscess cases.
