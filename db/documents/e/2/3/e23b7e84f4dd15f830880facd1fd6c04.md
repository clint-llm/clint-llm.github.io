Impetigo is a common infection of the superficial layers of the epidermis that is highly contagious and most commonly caused by gram-positive bacteria. It most commonly presents as erythematous plaques with a yellow crust and may be itchy or painful. The lesions are highly contagious and spread easily. Diagnosis is typically based on the symptoms and clinical manifestations alone. Treatment involves topical and oral antibiotics and symptomatic care. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology and presentation of impetigo and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Recall the cause of impetigo.
- Describe the presentation of impetigo.
- Summarize the treatment of impetigo.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by impetigo.
