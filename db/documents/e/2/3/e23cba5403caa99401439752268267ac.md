Accommodative dysfunction occurs in the majority of patients with binocular vision problems. Limited data are reported in the literature regarding the actual prevalence of accommodative dysfunction in the general population.

Most data account for the prevalence of accommodative dysfunction amongst school children ranging from 8 to 15 years of age.

Children with cerebral palsy are also reported to have lower accommodative amplitudes as compared to age-matched peers.
