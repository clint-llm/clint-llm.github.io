The prognosis for osteonecrosis is often poor, regardless of the initial management strategy. Progression of the disease includes persistent pain, debilitation, and destruction of the joint beyond repair. Mont et al.reported that 59% of asymptomatic lesions progressed to symptoms or collapse.[2] AVN of the humeral head, in particular, can be even worse, with as many as 81% of patients progressing to total failure and requiring arthroplasty.

Core decompression and bone grafting can prevent the progression of osteonecrosis of the hip. However, with advanced disease or failure of joint-preserving therapies, total hip arthroplasty is needed but is associated with increased complication rates.

Core decompression and hemiarthroplasty of the shoulder have good outcomes in treating AVN in the early stages. However, total shoulder arthroplasty has higher complication rates. Total shoulder arthroplasties are indicated for end-stage AVN but put the patient at risk for postoperative complications.

In Preiser and Kienbock disease, the initial stages of AVN are treated with immobilization, but eventual surgical intervention is usually indicated.
