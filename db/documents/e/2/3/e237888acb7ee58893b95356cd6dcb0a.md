An interprofessional team approach is an optimal approach with mannitol administration. It is essential to monitor cardiac function as the fluid shifts can precipitate heart failure. Additional electrolytes, including sodium, potassium, and osmolality, require monitoring by the nurses and physicians. Abnormalities in these laboratory values necessitate prompt communication to all members of the team. Mannitol administration should stop if significant electrolyte abnormalities develop or the osmolality reaches 320 mOsm or higher. When mannitol is used to treat cerebral edema, serum osmolality should be checked every 4 to 6 hours. If serum osmolality is more than 320 mOsm, alternative agents like the hypertonic solution should be used.

The nursing staff should pay particular attention to urine output and monitor it carefully, reporting any concerns to the treating clinician. The pharmacist can verify dosing and perform medication reconciliation and alert the team if any interactions are present. They can also collaborate with the treating physician regarding potential alternative therapies in the event of therapeutic failure or intolerance of mannitol. With open interprofessional communication between all healthcare team members, any treatment, including mannitol, has the best chance at optimal results. [Level 5]
