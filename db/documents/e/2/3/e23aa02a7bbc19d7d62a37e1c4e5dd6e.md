Patients and their families should be provided resources and educational materials informing them about vaccines, immunoglobulin replacement therapy, prophylactic and therapeutic use of antibiotics, routine and emergency medical care, the importance of keeping follow-up appointments, healthcare team specialists, preparation for traveling, the importance of record-keeping, support, and how to become a good patient advocate.

Reasons for avoiding live virus vaccines, such as oral polio, mumps, measles, rubella, rotavirus, yellow fever, chickenpox, should be explained thoroughly.

Patients and families should be given the following advice when planning a trip:

Carry a portable water filtration system, prophylactic antibiotics, and other medications;

Know the vaccination requirements for traveling to foreign countries; be prepared to comply or obtain formal exemptions;

Carry an approved list of resources, including the locations, contact information, hours of operation, for:

- infusion centers (to avoid interruption in the regular immunoglobulin replacement regimen)

- physicians and pharmacists (to obtain antibiotics needed to combat new infections)

- hospitals, medical specialists, emergency centers, therapists, and other support personnel

Record keeping should be encouraged. All aspects of patient care, management, and follow-up should be included, as well as a list of contacts and resources that are helpful to the patient.
