After oral ingestion of pyridoxine, peak plasma levels are achieved in approximately one hour.

Several drugs have interactions with vitamin B6 and can interfere with their levels. These medications typically lower the level of pyridoxine and leave to vitamin B6 deficiency and not toxicity. Isoniazid, cycloserine, penicillamine, and L-dopa all form complexes with vitamin B6, limiting its bioavailability. Oral contraceptives are associated with lower pyridoxine phosphate levels in a subset of women.
