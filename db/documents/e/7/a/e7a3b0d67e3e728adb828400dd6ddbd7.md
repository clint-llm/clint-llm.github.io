Frataxin is an integral part of many critical mitochondrial functions. It regulates iron homeostasis by chaperoning iron, detoxifying iron, and managing iron stores.

The cells most susceptible to damage are the ones that produce the most frataxin, which mainly includes the neurons and cardiomyocytes.

Eventually, neurons in this area, particularly lumbosacral and nerve cells in the Clarke column, are lost and are replaced by capsular cells. Of note, corticospinal tracts are relatively spared down to the level of the cervicomedullary junction. Degeneration of the posterior column correlates with the loss of proprioception and sensory ataxia. Likewise, the loss of the sensory ganglia is responsible for the loss of tendon reflexes. The complication of kyphoscoliosis is a result of spinal muscular imbalance.

Other affected areas include the dentate nucleus, which typically has mild to moderate neuronal loss, and the middle and superior cerebellar peduncles, which show atrophy. There is a patchy loss of Purkinje cells in the superior vermis of the cerebellum, and neuronal loss in the inferior olivary, pontine and medullary nuclei, along with the optic tracts.

Another major group of cells that have relatively high frataxin production are the cardiomyocytes.
