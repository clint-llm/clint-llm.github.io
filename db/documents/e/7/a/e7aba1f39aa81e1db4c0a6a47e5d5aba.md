Managing ibuprofen overdose requires teamwork from healthcare professionals, including the emergency physician, intensivist, medical toxicologist or poison control center, pharmacist, and nursing staff. The emergency physician is responsible for the following:

- A complete history of the substance ingested, any co-ingestion, time of ingestion, any suicidal intent behind the ingestion, and any previous similar history in the past.

- Initiating management of airway, breathing, circulation, decontamination.

- Ordering initial labs, including acetaminophen levels, aspirin levels, blood gas, complete blood count (CBC), renal and liver function tests, electrolytes, and blood sugar.

- Initiating correction of any electrolyte or blood gas abnormalities

- If the patient is stable enough, obtaining a psychiatric history to assess the risk of self-harm.

- Consulting with toxicology about further management of the patient.

- Consulting with a pharmacist about the use of activated charcoal.

- Consulting with nephrology if there is resistant metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, or renal failure to consider hemodialysis.

The management of ibuprofen toxicity should continue after the patient is admitted to an appropriate level of care. Patients should be admitted to an ICU level of care for respiratory depression, hypotension or shock, depressed mental status, severe metabolic acidosis, severe GI hemorrhage, life-threatening electrolyte imbalances or arrhythmias, or if the presumed clinical course of the patient is predicted to worsen based on the dose of ibuprofen consumed. Symptomatic but otherwise stable patients may be admitted to a general medical floor. Asymptomatic patients may be observed for 4 to 6 hours in the emergency department.

The admitting team shall continue therapeutic interventions initiated in the emergency department in conjunction with consultants such as medical toxicologists or the poison control center, nephrologists, and/or pharmacists. Consult with a mental health counselor or psychiatrist to assess self-harm risk and the potential need for psychiatric admission in intentional or self-injurious exposures. These interprofessional interventions can drive better outcomes irrespective of the underlying cause of toxicity. [Level 5]
