- The scan involves the risk of radiation exposure. However, the risk of radiation exposure is relatively lower than in other modalities like CTPE.

- The total duration of the procedure is about 30 minutes to an hour.

- Patients should be informed about the steps of the procedure. This involves inhalation of radioactive gas in the first part to look at the airways, followed by intravenous injection of a different radioactive material to see the blood flow in the lungs. Laying still in the scanner will enhance the quality of the images.

- Overall, the test is safely tolerated by most patients. Redness and swelling might develop at the injection site. Allergic reaction to the radioactive material is a rare complication and can be treated as needed.

- There is no special preparation except for breastfeeding females.

- Lung scintigraphy is a nuclear medicine modality with low radiation exposure, and dose reduction is considered in the pregnant and pediatric groups.

- The patient must be instructed about the procedure's steps, duration, and the negative impact of repeated movements. Pregnant women should be told about the fetus's minor risk due to radiation exposure, especially during the first trimester. Interruption of breastfeeding is recommended twelve hours before 99mTc-MAA administration only.
