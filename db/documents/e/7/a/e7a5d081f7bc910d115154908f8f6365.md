The bedpan is a useful medical equipment that is used frequently in hospitals. The nurses are primarily involved in the management of the bedpan with assistance from the therapists. The important features of bedpan are not only to provide a functional use for the patient, but comfort and privacy. If a bed pan is to be used, it should be for a short duration. there are countless cases of pressure sores, ulcers and neuropathy from patients being left too long on the bed pan. Unfortunately, managing the bed pan is not easy for the nurse when patients are obese and have limitations in movement; plus spillage of the contents is a major problem.
