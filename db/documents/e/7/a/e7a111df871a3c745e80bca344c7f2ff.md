One survey showed that only 7% of patients with SCD disease who have never experienced priapism were familiar with priapism as a possible complication of the disease.

Educating patients recognized to have a disease putting them at higher risk of developing priapism (like SCD, other hematological diseases, and various cancers) is of paramount importance. This should include some of the techniques that can be done at home to relieve the episode and when to seek medical advice to avoid or minimize complications. In addition, counseling about its effect on the patient's future sexual life might help mitigate its effect on his mental health and on the family.
