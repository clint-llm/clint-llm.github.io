The management ofÂ coccidioidomycosis is with an interprofessional team. The majority of patients present to the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, or internist. Some patients may have an incident x-ray finding of the disease and may have no symptoms.

In 2016, the Infectious Disease Society of America published treatment guidelines for coccidioidomycosis. Symptomatic patients need treatment but asymptomatic patients can be observed. In addition, patients who are immunocompromised or have a transplant need treatment. The outlook for most patients is excellent but those who are immunocompromised may have a guarded prognosis.
