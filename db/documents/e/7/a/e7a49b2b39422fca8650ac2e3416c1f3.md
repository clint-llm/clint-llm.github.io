The subscapularis muscle is a large and powerful triangle-shaped muscle originating at the subscapular fossa and inserting at the lesser tubercle of the humerus. The muscle derives its name from its orientation under the scapula: sub (under) scapula (wing bone). The subscapularis is one of the four muscles which compose the rotator cuff apparatus. The other three are the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor muscles. The subscapularis muscleâ€™s primary function is internal rotation but can also aid in adducting the humerus. The subscapularis nerve innervates the muscle. The subscapular artery provides blood supply, and lymph drainage flows into the axillary nodes. This muscle and tendon are less likely to tear than other rotator cuff muscles.

When there is an insult to the muscle or tendon, loss of function produces weakness in internal rotation. Non-operative management is the treatment of choice for partial tears and tendinopathies. Surgical intervention may be required (1) if conservative management fails, (2) depending on the activity level or profession of the individual, for example, athletes, and (3) in the case of full-thickness tears.
