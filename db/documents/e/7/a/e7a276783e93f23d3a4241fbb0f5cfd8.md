Eruptive seborrheic keratoses have been reported in numerous other clinical scenarios including in patients with erythroderma, pregnant patients, HIV-infected patients, and transplant patients. Also, seborrheic keratoses may be confused with a plethora of other cutaneous growths including verruca vulgaris, acrochordons, nevi, solar lentigos, lichenoid keratoses, and even cutaneous malignancies such as squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma. However, given the abrupt onset of the seborrheic keratoses and their distinctive appearance misdiagnosis as another cutaneous entity would be unlikely.
