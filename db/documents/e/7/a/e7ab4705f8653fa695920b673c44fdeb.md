- The traumatic defect in the iris is not causing any significant effect on vision

- While repairing an open globe injury with a corneal tear, iridodialysis, and lens removal, reconstruction of the iris is not the priority compared to injury to other parts

- The patient doesn't aspire for an iris repair, and it's not making any difference to the patient

- Limited intraocular visibility due to hyphema

- Iris prolapse with necrotic tissue for more than 24 hours

- Iris prolapse with signs of endophthalmitis

- Superior iridodialysis where the lid is protecting from photophobia
