Biceps tendonitis describes a clinical condition of inflammatory tenosynovitis, most commonly affecting the tendinous portion of the LHB as it travels within the bicipital groove in the proximal humerus. The continuum of clinical pathology ranges from acute inflammatory tendinitis to degenerative tendinopathy.

Primary bicipital tendinitis is much less common than cases where it is associated with concomitant primary shoulder pathologies (i.e., secondary cases). The etiologies for primary bicipital tendinitis are not well understood compared to the more common secondary presentations. A particular subset of patients with primary, isolated biceps tendinitis is recognized in the younger, athletic population. Provocative sports include baseball, softball, and volleyball. Beyond this aforementioned athletic cohort, there are only a few cases reports in the literature highlighting patients presenting with spontaneous LHB tendon ruptures secondary to medical comorbidities.

Secondary cases are much more common and have been described in the literature with increasing frequency dating back to at least the early 1980s.  In 1982, Neviaser et al. demonstrated the relationship between increasing LHB tendon inflammatory changes with increasing severity of rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy. Other associated shoulder pathologies include

- Rotator cuff tendinitis and tendinopathy

- Subscapularis injuries

- LHB tendon instability/dislocation

- Often seen in association with subscapularis injuries/tears

- Direct or indirect trauma

- Inflammatory conditions

-  Internal impingement of the shoulder (“Thrower’s” shoulder)

- Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD)
- Superior labral lesions (the “peel-back” mechanism)

- External impingement/Subacromial impingement syndrome (EI/SIS)

- Glenohumeral arthritis
