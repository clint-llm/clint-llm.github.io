Human arboviral disease, when symptomatic, can be divided into three different syndromes: Febrile systemic illness (seen in uncomplicated Dengue fever), Hemorrhagic fever (seen in dengue hemorrhagic fever and yellow fever) and encephalitis. This last category includes EEE but also Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and La Crosse encephalitis.
