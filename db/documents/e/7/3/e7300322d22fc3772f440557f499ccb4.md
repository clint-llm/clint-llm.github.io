The treatment approach should include both management of acute attacks and the prevention of attacks. Treatments include behavioral interventions directed at avoidance of triggers, modification of potassium levels through diet, diuretics, and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Attacks may be treated at the onset of weakness with mild physical activity, oral intake of carbohydrate-rich foods, salbutamol inhalation, or intravenous calcium gluconate.

Individuals may prevent attacks by consuming frequent carbohydrate-rich meals, a thiazide diuretic, or a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Individuals should avoid potassium-rich medications and foods, fasting, strenuous work, and exposure to cold to prevent attacks. Surveillance methods include scheduled evaluation of neurologic status. Individuals who develop permanent muscle weakness may require life long thiazide diuretics and interval MRI of proximal leg muscle every 1 to 3 years.

Prophylactic treatment necessitates serum potassium levels twice yearly to avoid diuretic complications and annual evaluation of thyroid function. It is imperative to avoid factors that may precipitate an episode. These include the ingestion of potassium-rich food or medications, prolonged fasting, intense physical activity, cold environment, and depolarizing anesthetic agents that may be used during general anesthesia.
