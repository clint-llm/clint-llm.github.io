There is no strict set of guidelines for the use of peripheral nerve blocks. However, the general rationale is to implement regional blocks in cases where conservative measures have failed or to avoid the side effects and complications of general anesthesia and oral medications. The following include examples of where peripheral nerve blocks may be preferable:

- Patients who are at high risk of respiratory depression related to general anesthesia

- Patients who want to avoid systematic medications

- Patients intolerant or not responsive to oral medications
