The drug is contraindicated in patients with a known severe adverse reaction.Â Anaphylactic reactions to lidocaine are possible but rare.

Methemoglobinemia can occur due to lidocaine metabolism to O-toluidine.

Lidocaine should not be used as an antiarrhythmic if the dysrhythmia may be secondary to local anesthetic toxicity.

Lidocaine preparations containing epinephrine cause demonstrable cardiovascular effects even if only given in small amounts, and it is prudent for essential hemodynamic monitoring to be carried out before and during use solutions containing vasopressors, particularly if there is any specific concern over the patient's cardiovascular status.
