The most common symptom of meteorism is a bloated sensation. It may be associated with abdominal discomfort. Some individuals may also complain of a distended stomach and excessive belching and/or passage of flatus. The sensation of bloating may last a few minutes or for extended periods of time. Sometimes the abdominal pain may feel dull or sharp and cause cramping. Often the pain of bloating can be confused with bowel obstruction, appendicitis, cholecystitis, or peptic ulcer disease. On physical exam, one may note distension of the abdomen and marked tympany on palpation. Auscultation may reveal rumblings bowel sounds or tinkling sounds. The rectal exam in these patients is unremarkable.
