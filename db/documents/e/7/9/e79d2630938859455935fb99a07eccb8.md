Complications can include physical symptoms and the psychological impact of living with hearing loss. Many patients with SNHL suffer from other associated symptoms such as tinnitus and dizziness, which they often find more challenging to tolerate than hearing loss. Studies have been done to evaluate the impact tinnitus can have on patients' lives. Prevalent responses included inability to concentrate, constant awareness, the effect on sleep, intrusiveness, and overall loss of control over their lives.

Fear was another domain that scored highly when a questionnaire was carried on a cohort of patients. Patients reported fear of the tinnitus itself, fear of living with tinnitus long term, and a fear of doing activities that may exacerbate their symptoms.

Various studies have shown a correlation between uncorrected hearing loss and cognitive decline, strengthening the argument for early auditory rehabilitation with hearing aids.

Many patients struggle in social situations and partake in activities they usually enjoy, leading to increasing isolation from friends and families. Although there are support groups in the community, they may not be easily accessible or available, and some patients perceive a social stigma regarding hearing loss. With an aging population, hearing loss will become increasingly prevalent, and it is already a significant public health issue in the developed world.
