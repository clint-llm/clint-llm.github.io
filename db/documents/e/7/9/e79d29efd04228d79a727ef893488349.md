The pineal gland forms during the seventh week of gestation.

Tumors of the pineal region are diverse in origin due to the proximity of multiple anatomical structures. The pineal gland is commonplace for the sequestration of embryonic germ cells. Thus, germ cell tumors are among the most common pathologies found in this area.

Germ cell tumors typically occur sporadically.

Pineal region tumors are generally classified as:

- Pineal parenchymal tumors

- Germ cell tumors

- Adjacent cell tumors (astrocytes, arachnoid cap cells)

- Metastases
