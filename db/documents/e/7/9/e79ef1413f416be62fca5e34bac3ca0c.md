A detailed history about social conditions, medication use, abuse or trauma, recent Valsalva maneuvers or chest compression injury, flashes or floaters with a sudden transient dimming of vision, are all important to come to a diagnosis. All patients need a slit lamp examination of the anterior segment, dilated fundus examination, and intraocular pressure measurement. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), and fundus photography are all helpful to determine the location and depth of the hemorrhage. One should suspect abusive head trauma if a child less than three years shows retinal hemorrhages with an intracranial injury.
