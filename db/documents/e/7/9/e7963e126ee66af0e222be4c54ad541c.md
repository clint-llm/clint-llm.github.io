Substernal goiters are thyroid goiters, which extend from the cervix into the mediastinum or rarely develop directly into the mediastinum. Although they can be asymptomatic, they usually appear with compression of the trachea, the esophagus, and the large vessels or thyroid cancer. That way, substernal goiters need to be properly diagnosed, assessed, and treated. This activity reviews the evaluation and surgical management of substernal goiters and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the diagnostic evaluation and planning of substernal goiters.
- Review the indications for substernal thyroidectomy.
- Outline the different surgical approaches of retrosternal goiters.
- Describe several interprofessional team activities that can improve patient care and outcomes in cases requiring substernal thyroidectomy.
