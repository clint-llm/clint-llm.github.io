The vast majority of mask squeeze injuries require no treatment. Mild injuries to the skin, including swelling, bruising, petechia, will resolve within one to two weeks with supportive care. Mild eye injuries, including conjunctivitis and subconjunctival hemorrhages, will also resolve without any intervention in a short time. More severe eye injuries such as a subperiosteal orbital hematoma require emergent evaluation by ophthalmology. If this injury involves compression of the optic nerve or evidence of increased intraocular pressure, needle aspiration or orbitotomy with drainage may be required. Otherwise, conservative management of the eye injury with follow-up visits with ophthalmology may be all that is required.

It is important to realize that, unlike decompression-related injuries, mask squeeze is a trauma related to a pressure gradient, not a result of the consequence of microbubbles that occur from decompression. Therefore, treatment does not include oxygen or compression chambers. However, decompression injuries can be coexistent with a mask squeeze, so the examiner should be watchful for signs or symptoms that may suggest this.
