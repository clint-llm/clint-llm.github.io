**Social Relations and Stress**

A widely accepted view of psychological stress defines it as the appraisal of an event as taxing or overwhelming one’s resources. This theory first proposed that appraisal of an event as threatening or exceeding one’s resources activates physiological stress response systems in the body, including the autonomic (fight or flight) system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis responds to central nervous systems signals that regulate the release of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol from the adrenal gland. In a healthy individual, circulating cortisol levels double within 30 minutes to 45 minutes after awakening and then gradually decrease over the course of the day and subsequent night, reflective of the diurnal slope.

Social relationships that are perceived as emotionally supportive have demonstrated their potential to act as a buffer of the effects of stress. Social support makes the demands of a stressor feel more manageable, thereby buffering its impact.

While the size of an individual’s social network, or integration, may not be associated with diurnal cortisol secretion or acute stress responses, supportive relationships have been associated with more rhythmic or healthy-appearing diurnal cortisol expression profiles.
