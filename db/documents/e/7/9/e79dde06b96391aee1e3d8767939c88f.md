The two most common dental abnormalities are dental caries and malocclusion.

**Dental Caries**

Dental caries, better known as tooth decay or cavities, is a multifactorial disease that leads to demineralization of the teeth and subsequent areas of decay, or 'holes.' Symptoms of tooth decay include pain, infection, and tooth loss. In the United States, dental caries is the most common chronic childhood disease, five times more common than asthma.

Dental caries results from the activity of bacteria on teeth, most commonly Streptococcus mutans. The inciting event in the development of dental caries is the deposition of plaque on the tooth, a film of precipitated products of saliva and food. The bacteria which inhabit plaque depend greatly on carbohydrates for activation and multiplication. These bacteria also form acids (lactic acid) and proteolytic enzymes, which cause caries due to the now highly acidic environment dissolving the calcium salts of teeth.

**Malocclusion**

Malocclusion is the term used to describe misaligned teeth. Malocclusion is typically a hereditary abnormality that causes the teeth not to interdigitate appropriately and, therefore, cannot perform the regular cutting and grinding actions. Misaligned teeth can occasionally result in abnormal displacement of the lower jaw in relation to the upper jaw and cause mandibular joint pain and tooth deterioration.

An orthodontist is a dental school graduate with an advanced orthodontic degree specializing in dental development, occlusion, facial growth, and jaw alignment. An orthodontist can correct malocclusions using braces, which apply gentle, prolonged pressure against the teeth. This pressure causes absorption of alveolar jaw bone on the compressed side of the tooth and new bone deposition on the tension side of the tooth, which gradually moves the tooth to a new, desired position.

Additional dental anomalies can occur due to developmental or environmental causes.

**Developmental Dental Anomalies**

- 
**Abnormalities of Tooth Number**

- 
              
- Anodontia is characterized by a total lack of tooth development.
              
              
- Hyperdontia is characterized by an increased number of teeth. Systemic causes of hyperdontia may include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, Gardner syndrome, Sturge-Weber syndrome, Crouzon syndrome, cleidocranial dysostosis, and Apert syndrome.
              
              
- Hypodontia is characterized by the developmental absence of one or more teeth. Systemic causes of hypodontia may include ectodermal dysplasia, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Gorlin syndrome.

- 
              
- Oligodontia is characterized by the absence of six or more teeth.

- 
**Abnormalities of Tooth Size**

- 
              
- Microdontia is characterized by teeth that are smaller than average size. True generalized microdontia, a rare condition where all teeth are affected, often accompanies other systemic syndromes, such as congenital growth hormone deficiency, oro-faciodigital syndrome, or oculo-mandibulo-facial syndrome. Microdontia can also be seen in young patients who have previously undergone chemoradiotherapy, which alters the formation of the developing dentition.
              
              
- Macrodontia is characterized by teeth that are larger than average size. Macrodontia of all teeth occurs in pituitary gigantism and pineal hyperplasia.

- 
**Cleft Lip and Cleft Palate**

- 
              
- Dental abnormalities are commonly seen on the side affected by the cleft and may include supernumerary, discolored, or missing teeth.

**Environmental Dental Anomalies**

- 
**Anomalies Occurring During Tooth Development**

- 
              
- Enamel hypoplasia is characterized by inadequate amounts of enamel formed due to nutritional factors, untreated celiac disease, hypocalcemia, preterm birth, birth injury or trauma, or exanthematous diseases (i.e., congenital syphilis, chickenpox).

- 
**Anomalies Occurring After Tooth Development**

- 
              
- Dental caries
              
              
- Dental infection/abscess may be due to poor oral and dental health, leading to Ludwig angina (LA), a potentially life-threatening bacterial infection occurring in the floor of the mouth. LA often develops secondary to a dental infection/abscess, with over 90% of cases originating from a 2nd or 3rd mandibular molar dental infection.
              
              
- Tooth destruction in the setting of acidic erosion (i.e., bulimia, GERD).

- 
              
- Discoloration of teeth can take many forms. Red-brown discoloration may be due to congenital erythropoietic porphyria causing porphyrins to be deposited on teeth. Blue discoloration may be due to alkaptonuria. Green discoloration is often due to biliverdin deposition and may be seen in erythroblastosis fetalis and biliary atresia.
