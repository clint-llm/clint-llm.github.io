PHH may mimic other DH in clinical presentation. The clinical presentation in parahiatal hernias is often difficult to be distinguished from the more common para esophageal pathology. Characteristically these patients do not share gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms unless hiatal hernia coexists, making it crucial to identify them separately due to their implication on the choice of repair and overall patient outcome. They are either an incidental finding as part of other workup or at the time of hiatal hernia repair. In literature mostly there are case reports of urgent presentation with either incarceration or volvulus.

Although a typical presentation is with epigastric discomfort, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, especially after meals (mimicking angina), early satiety, and in worse cases could develop respiratory symptoms. The patient can be anemic (due to gastric erosions at the neck of hernia),Â with some mild discomfort in the epigastric region and reduce air entry over the left lower chest.
