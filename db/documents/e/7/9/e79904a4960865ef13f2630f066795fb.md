Proper assessment of a patient with exudative retinal detachment involves:

- Careful history

- General physical examination

- Ophthalmic examination

- Anterior segment examination
- Posterior segment examination
- Locating the presence or absence of retinal break or tractional bands.

**History**

The patient may present with dimness of vision, floaters, pain, visual field defects, redness of the eye, leukocoria, and metamorphopsia. The duration of presenting symptoms should be inquired. Children or rarely ignorant adults may sometimes present with squinting of the eye or leukocoria if unilateral blurring is not noticed early. The history of previous intraocular surgeries and systemic or topical medications (including) should be inquired. History of any associated systemic disease (including hypertension), excessive weight loss, and loss of appetite in suspected cases of malignancy should be thoroughly evaluated. A history of flu-like illness in the prodromal phase is seen preceding the acute uveitic phase of Vogt Koyanagi Harada syndrome.

**General Physical Examination**

Exudative retinal detachment is multifactorial in origin. It could occur from local as well as systemic causes. A thorough physical examination is necessary to rule out the systemic causes of exudative retinal detachment like Behçet disease, relapsing polychondritis, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, tuberculosis, syphilis, dengue, Lyme disease, cytomegalovirus retinitis, nematode infection, fungal infection, diabetes, hypertension, hemolytic uremic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count) syndrome, preeclampsia, eclampsia, hematological malignancies like acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid leukemia, chronic lymphoid leukemia as well as to rule out syndromic associations with exudative retinal detachment.

**Ophthalmic Examination**

Best-corrected visual acuity should be evaluated. Intraocular pressure should be monitored. The presence of longstanding amblyopia should be ruled out. There may be ptosis, proptosis, and pain in ocular movements in posterior scleritis and orbital inflammation.

**Anterior Segment Examination**

Anterior segment examination may be unremarkable. Inflammatory etiologies are characterized by circumcorneal congestion, aqueous cells, anterior chamber flare, posterior synechiae, complicated cataracts, keratic precipitates, hypopyon, retrolental (anterior vitreous) cells on slit-lamp examination.

Neovascularization of the iris and angle may be noted in VKH.

**Posterior Segment Examination**

Exudative retinal detachment is characterized by the presence of shifting fluid across the retina.

Other characteristic features of exudative retinal detachment include the smooth surface of retinal detachment without any retinal folds or corrugations, the convex and bullous contour of retinal detachment, and vitreous cells. Optic disc hyperemia may be seen in inflammatory etiologies causing exudative retinal detachment.

Choroidal metastases can present with exudative retinal detachment. The choroidal metastases are small in these cases, but the exudative detachment is relatively more.

**Locating the Presence or Absence of Retinal Break or Tractional Bands**

Exudative retinal detachment is a diagnosis of exclusion. So thorough central and peripheral fundus examination is required to rule out the presence of any fibrovascular proliferation causing traction over the retina leading to tractional retinal detachment, or the presence of any retinal tear, hole, or dialysis which may lead to rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.

Especially in cases of inferior bullous retinal detachment with shifting fluid, the presence of superior small breaks must be ruled out.
