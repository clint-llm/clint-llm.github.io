Elastic fibers comprise approximately 3% of the dry weight of the dermis. Although elastin is a major component of the skin, it fails to stain discernably on standard hematoxylin and eosin preparations. Thus, the Verhoeff stain is often mandatory in the investigation of the organization of dermal elastic fibers and related pathologies, including pseudoxanthoma elasticum and elastosis perforans serpiginous.

In addition to its ubiquity in dermatopathology, the Verhoeff stain is the most widely employed histological stain to evaluate vascular elastic fibers. The Verhoeff stain highlights the elastic laminae of blood vessels and can be utilized to differentiate between arteries, with multiple elastic laminae, and veins, with a single lamina. Fragmentation and atrophy of the elastic lamina may occur in arteriosclerosis and can be identified through the Verhoeff staining technique. The degenerative valvular changes characteristic of aortic stenosis, including displacement and degeneration of the internal elastic lamina, may similarly be visualized. Additional modifications to the Verhoeff stain can be utilized to identify the fine elastic fibers found in small arteries, such as those implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension.
