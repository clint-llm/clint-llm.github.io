Complete radial head dislocation results from a high force injury, such as a significant motor vehicle accident or a fall onto an outstretched arm. It is extremely rare for the radial head to become dislocated without other associated injuries. Injuries associated with a radial head dislocation, include:

- Monteggia fractures

- Elbow dislocations

- Elbow fractures

- Terrible triad injury of the elbow: (fracture of the radial head, fracture of the ulnar coronoid process, and dislocation of the elbow)

The head of the radius may present as congenitally dislocated in association with other congenital abnormalities such as:

- Ehlers-Danlos syndrome

- Nail-Patella syndrome

- Ulnar dysplasia

- Radioulnar synostosis

- Dyschondroplasia
