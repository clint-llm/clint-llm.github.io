A multidisciplinary team approach is recommended to manage complications associated with uterine rupture. An anesthesia provider with familiarity on labor and delivery is necessary to provide anesthesia for cesarean delivery, place lines, lead resuscitation efforts, administer vasoactive medications, and secure the airway (when necessary). A pediatric provider with familiarity with neonatal resuscitation is recommended because many babies born in the setting of uterine rupture will have been deprived of oxygen for an extended period of time. In the setting of massive blood loss or the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation, a hematologist may help secure clotting factor concentrates. A urology consultation is recommended if the uterine rupture extends into the bladder or damages one of the ureters.
