Current guidelines on peripheral vascular disease include the following:

- Obtain ABI as the first non-invasive test to establish a diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease. If ABI is about 0.9 or normal, recommend an exercise ABI

- Routine screening for peripheral vascular disease in the absence of risk factors is not recommended

- Patients who smoke, patients with diabetes mellitus, and those with abnormal peripheral vascular exams should be screened and risk-stratified for preventive care

- Symptomatic patients should undergo an invasive evaluation to determine the location and grade of obstruction. Some of these patients may benefit from angioplasty or bypass. Endovascular therapy is preferred to surgery

- Educating the patient on the harms of smoking

- Considering statin therapy if the patient has elevated lipids

- Optimizing blood glucose levels

- Managing hypertension with beta-blockers

- Starting antiplatelet therapy - aspirin or clopidogrel

- Encouraging patients to walk regularly
