The prevalence of orthostatic hypotension increases with age. According to the literature, orthostatic hypotension is most prevalent in patients aged 65 years or older, partly due to impaired baroreceptor sensitivity. The prevalence can be as high as 18.2% within that age range. A systematic review and meta-analysis (26 studies, >25 000 people) reported that one in five adults over 60 years old based in the community and four people in long-term residential homes have orthostatic hypotension.

Orthostatic hypotension is more likely to be prevalent in geriatric inpatients.

Patients with cardiovascular diseases, such as aortic stenosis, pericarditis/myocarditis, or arrhythmias, are also at increased risk for orthostatic hypotension. It can also occur in younger and middle-aged patients, who, in the absence of volume depletion, usually have a chronic autonomic failure.
