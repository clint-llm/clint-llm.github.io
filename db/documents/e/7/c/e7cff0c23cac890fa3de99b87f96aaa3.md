Many cases of cholangiocarcinoma arise de novo and do not have a specific risk factor, but there are a number of risk factors that have been identified, including primary hepatobiliary disease, genetic disorders, toxic exposures, and infections. Primary hepatobiliary disorders include primary sclerosing cholangitis, fibropolycystic liver disease, cholelithiasis/cholecystitis, and chronic liver disease. Primary sclerosing cholangitis has a strong association with cholangiocarcinoma, with nearly 30% of cholangiocarcinomas being diagnosed in patients with this disease.

Genetic disorders include Lynch syndrome, BAP1 tumor predisposition syndrome, multiple biliary papillomatosis, and cystic fibrosis. The only clear association between toxins and cholangiocarcinoma is Thorotrast, which is a radiocontrast that has been banned. No clear association has been made between smoking/alcohol use with cholangiocarcinoma. Infections that have been linked with cholangiocarcinoma are liver flukes (clonorchiasisÂ and opisthorchiasis), HIV, and Helicobacter pylori. Finally, patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome have an increased risk as well.
