Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic granulomatous infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by several different dematiaceous fungi (brown pigment-producing), resulting in the formation of slow-growing, warty plaques, cauliflower-like lesions which may ulcerate. The fungi produce thick-walled, single, or multicelled clusters ( sclerotic or muriform bodies). The fungi are introduced into the body usually by trauma, and hence, the lesions mostly present on exposed parts of the body. The disease runs a chronic course, and most cases are treatable to the point of cure.
