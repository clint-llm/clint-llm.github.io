External and internal nasal splints should be removed within one week. If true nasal packing is placed, it is commonplace toÂ give patients oral antibiotics to prevent toxic shock syndrome. Strenuous activity is discouraged, and physical activity that could result in further trauma to the nose should be avoided in the acute setting. Nasal hygiene with saline sprays should be performed to prevent recurrent epistaxis. A close follow-up to monitor for residual nasal deformity or obstruction, which may necessitate revision surgery, is essential.
