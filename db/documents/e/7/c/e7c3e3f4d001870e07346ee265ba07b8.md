The treatment of B cell lymphomas depends not only on their staging but also on the type of the disease (indolent or aggressive) and the molecular subtype. Though DLBCL is aggressive, with appropriate chemotherapy, the survival can be long, but with a limited cure rate. Patients with GCB DLBCL respond well to 6 cycles of rituximab along with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) regimen given every 21 days.

Studies have shown that patients with ABC DLBCL be enrolled in clinical trials, and the use of R-CHOP along with lenalidomide or bortezomib or ibrutinib is indicated. The more aggressive approach is rituximab, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vindesine, bleomycin, and prednisone (R-ACVBP), followed by consolidation with methotrexate and leucovorin.

The treatment for indolent lymphomas such as follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and small lymphocytic lymphoma often depends upon the bulk of the disease and in symptomatic cases. Some patients with the aggressive low-grade disease have been treated with allogeneic transplants with curative intent. Radiotherapy should be considered in patients with bulky disease. Mantle cell lymphomas are treated aggressively with immuno-chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplants. Burkitt lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma are considered high grade and need aggressive chemotherapy along with prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy.
