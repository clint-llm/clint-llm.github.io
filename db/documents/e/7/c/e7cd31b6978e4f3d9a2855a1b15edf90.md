Athletes, clinicians, coaches, and athletic trainers need to understand that the treatment forÂ patellar tendinopathy can be a slow and sometimes frustrating process. There are multiple pitfalls to be aware of, including the failure to control pain. The athlete's beliefs about pain and pathology may influence the development and management of unresponsive tendinopathies. Because some athletes may have been told that they have weakened tendons due to tears and degeneration, and hence an increased risk of rupture, they may develop fear-avoidance behavior, which can be associated with poorer functional outcomes in individuals suffering from lower-limb tendinopathy. Over-reliance on non-invasive therapies like shockwave therapy and injections instead of including rehabilitation exercises as part of the treatment plan can also lead to complications. Failure to address the athletes' landing kinematics can also bring difficulties. Athletes should have their jump-landing mechanics retrained after adequate rehabilitation.
