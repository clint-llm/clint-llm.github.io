Vinca alkaloids, which belong to a class of cell cycle phase M specific anti-tubulin agents, were one of the first plant alkaloids to be developed for use as anti-cancer agents in humans. Vinca alkaloids derived from Vinca rosea (Catharanthus roseus) consists of first-generation (vincristine, vinblastine), second-generation semi-synthetic derivatives (vinorelbine, vindesine), and third-generation (vinflunine). Vinflunine has also been classified by some as a second-generation agent.

Vinflunine, the newest, third-generation, fluorinated, anti-microtubule agent, has been used in the setting of transitional cell urothelial bladder cancer.  has been advocated to have a higher potency and lesser frequency of adverse events when compared to the older agents.
