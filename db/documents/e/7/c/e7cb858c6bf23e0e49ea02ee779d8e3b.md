Generally speaking, imaging does not assist with the diagnosis of pes anserine bursitis. However, plain knee radiographs are usually obtained to observe for any underlying bony abnormalities, including osteoarthritis.

**Ultrasonography**may be used as an adjunct to evaluate other causes of localized swelling, including joint effusions.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**Though rarely indicated in an urgent setting, MRI may help assess for knee pathology and rule out alternative diagnoses.MRI scans can demonstrate fluid in the anserine bursa in cases of bursitis. However, fluid has been demonstrated in 5% of asymptomatic knees. Hence, its presence in imaging is not diagnostic.

**Aspiration and fluid analysis:**This has rarely been documented in the literature. When performed showed mononuclear cells or the absence of inflammatory cells and crystals.
