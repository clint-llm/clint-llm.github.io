The differential diagnosis in HHS is divided into 2 broad groups: clinical conditions causing altered mental status and clinical conditions causing hyperglycemia.

The following are some examples of conditions that can cause an alteration in mental status:

- Hypoglycemia

- Hyponatremia

- Hypernatremia

- Hyperammonemia

- Severe intoxication with drugs or alcohol

- Uremic encephalopathy

Hyperglycemia can develop with diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetes insipidus.

A detailed history, thorough physical examination, and use of ancillary studies can help to establish a diagnosis quickly.

HHS is a potentially fatal medical condition. Knowledge of pathophysiology and clinical presentation is necessary for the best management outcome.
