Before 2013, the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder incorporated inhibited and dis-inhibited subtypes; however; the advent of the DSM-5 heralded the separation of each subtype into separate and distinct diagnoses. DSED represents a second clinical course for children exposed to neglect and abuse. While the clinical picture of RAD is of emotionally withdrawn, unemotional, or even callous children; disinhibited social engagement disorder presents with indiscriminate, overly friendly behavior. Typical fear behaviors such as crying, turning away, or seeking comfort from a preferred adult are absent and are instead replaced with a lack of age-appropriate restraint with acquaintances or strangers. The disinhibited nature of the disorder results in children seeking comfort or care indiscriminately, giving and receiving affection, and seeking attention from any available adult without regard for their safety.
