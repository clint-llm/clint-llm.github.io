In 2000, the World health organization (WHO) estimated that injury resulted in 9% of the global mortality and 12% of the worldwide disease burden.

Up to half of the deaths resulting from hemorrhage occur before reaching definitive care. Violence is the leading cause of these injuries, and traffic collisions are second. In 2015, the national trauma institute estimated that in the civilian arena, "severe bleeding accounts for greater than 35% of pre-hospital deaths and nearly 40% of deaths within the first 24 hours of injury."
