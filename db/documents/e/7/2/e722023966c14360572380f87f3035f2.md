Basilar migraines are challenging to diagnose and treat. They require an interprofessional team of a neurologic headache specialist, a nurse experienced with headache management and patient education, and a pharmacist to assist with medication management to obtain the best results. Unlike the traditional migraine, basilar migraine does respond to over-the-counter NSAIDs and hence patient education is vital. It is important to speak to a headache specialist before trying natural alternatives. Open communication between the clinicians and the neurologist is vital to ensure that the patient is receiving the accepted standard of care. [Level 5]
