Myelin is known for having several structural features, most notably, the nodes of Ranvier and myelin incisures (Schmidt-Lantermann clefts). The nodes of Ranvier are the region where two adjacent myelin segments meet and allow for saltatory conduction to occur. Myelin incisures are pouches of Schwann cell cytoplasm, left over from the myelination process, and are believed to play a major role in Wallerian degeneration.
