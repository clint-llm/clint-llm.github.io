No drug has gained FDA approval for the prevention and treatment of delirium. There are limited data on effective prophylactic agents as well as limited data on effective initial therapies. Haloperidol and atypical antipsychotics (olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone) are commonly used despite limited data on efficacy.

Antipsychotics may cause oversedation, respiratory depression, QT prolongation, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and hypoactive delirium. Dexmedetomidine requires an infusion and ICU stay.
