The exact incidence of popliteal artery aneurysm is not known as no population-based study has been published; however, a few series studies issued by different institutions suggest that popliteal artery aneurysm prevalence increases with age and peaks in the sixth or seventh decades of life. The incidence of femoral and popliteal aneurysms in persons with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) appears higher than the general population. In one study of 225 patients, 28% (n=63) had a popliteal artery aneurysm greater than or equal to 10.5 mm, 19% (n=43) had a popliteal artery aneurysm greater than or equal to 12mm and 11% (n=25) had a popliteal artery aneurysm greater than or equal to 15 mm.
