The evaluation of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva begins with clinical suspicion for this life-threatening disease. As such, pediatricians and neonatologists should be adequately informed about the clinical signs and the evaluation strategies for this condition. Also, once the condition is diagnosed, physicians and pediatricians can help in the symptomatic management of the inflammatory disease activity. Also, physiotherapist opinion should be sought regarding appropriate means for managing joint stiffness and deformities.
