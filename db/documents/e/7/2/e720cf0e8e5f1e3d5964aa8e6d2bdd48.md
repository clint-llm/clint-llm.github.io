**Evaluation**

- Uncorrected and corrected distant visual acuity at distance, intermediate, and near

- Different vergences

- Contrast sensitivity

- Stereopsis

- Binocular single vision

- Dysphotopsia

**Visual Acuity**

High and low contrast visual acuity in log Mar units is the standard method to assess clinical visual performance. Fernandes et al., in their analysis, showed that the high contrast visual acuity was better compared to earlier studies with proclear multifocal lenses. However, the high contrast near visual acuity was comparable to other studies by Ferrer-Blasco and Madrid-Costa. Consider simultaneous vision bifocals in cases with small pupils, and in patients with large pupils, choose to translate lenses.

A detailed anterior and posterior segment examination must be performed to rule out any ocular pathology that may hamper contact lens applications.
