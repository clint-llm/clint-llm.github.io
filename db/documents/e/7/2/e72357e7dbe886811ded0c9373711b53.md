In the X-linked disease form, the most common type of Alport syndrome, about 50% of males require dialysis or kidney transplantation by 30 years, and approximately 90% develop ESRD before 40.

By age 60, this rate increases to about 30%, and by 60 years of age, the rate of ESRD approaches 40%. In the female population, proteinuria and hearing loss are risk factors for the progression to ESRD. In comparison, the autosomal recessive form of Alport syndrome can cause kidney failure by age 20. In contrast, the autosomal dominant form of the disease typically has a delay in ESRD until middle age.****
