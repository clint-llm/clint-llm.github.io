The JCC technique of refining the power and axis of a cylindrical prescription is one of the subjective techniques used in refracting a patient with astigmatism.

**Determining/Refining the Astigmatic Axis**

Before using the JCC, one must ensure that the center of least confusion is on the retina. When the JCC is placed in front of the correcting cylinder, there is a resultant change in the net correcting power and axis. Although there is no difference between the cylinder powers of the sides of the JCC presented in front of the eyes, there is a difference in the axes shown when refining the axis. When the minus axis is placed clockwise, there is a net change clockwise of the cylinder axis, while there is a net change counter-clockwise if the minus axis is placed counter-clockwise.

The axis of the cylinder is determined by placing the axis of the JCC halfway between the axis of the correcting cylinder at an angle of 45 degrees. This is easier to do when you just align the handle of the JCC with the axis of the correcting cylinder. The handle is flipped over the correcting lens so that the aforementioned orientation is kept. The patient is asked which side makes the chart appear clearer. The axis of the correcting cylinder is then rotated toward the red mark on the JCC whenever the patient reports the chart is clearer. This process is repeated until the patient reports no difference in the clarity of the chart or when there is a reversal.

The degree of rotation while refining the axis is dependent on the power of the cylinder and the quality of response from the patient. After the initial axis change, the degree of subsequent axis changes is dependent on the magnitude of the initial change and the quality of the response.

In the scenario where there is no prior astigmatic correction of the eye, the JCC is presented at arbitrary angles such as 90/180 degrees. If the patient prefers a flipped position, one can then add a cylinder parallel to the respective axis chosen as the reference point, which in most cases is indicated by the red line and is done until there is no preference. If at 90/180 degrees, there is no preference for any of the positions, the lens can be presented at 135/45 degrees, and the same process is repeated.

Due to the optical effect of the JCC, this method can miss astigmatic corrections if its axis is 45 degrees away from that of the eye. This is why it is important to also test 45/135 degrees when there are no preferences for the flipped positions of 90/180 degrees.

**Refining the Power of the Cylinder**

The refinement of the cylinder power is done by placing the JCC over the corrective lens. The axis of JCC power is set to be parallel to the axis of the corrective lens in the trial frame. The handle is flipped so that the two sides in the JCC swap positions with each 180-degree rotation. If the patient reports no change in the vision, it is safe to say that the power of the cylinder needs no refining; thus, the procedure can end here.

If the patient reports clarity when the red mark is over the corrective lens, then one should increase the cylinder by 0.25 dioptre or reduce the cylinder by 0.25 dioptre if the patient prefers when the black mark is over the corrective lens. When using this method, one must remember that for every 0.50 dioptre change in the cylinder, it is important to add 0.25 to the sphere to keep the circle of least confusion on the retina.
