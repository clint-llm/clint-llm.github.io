Congenital adrenal hyperplasia occurs among all races. The worldwide incidence of classical 21-hydroxylase-deficient CAH is 1 in 15,000 to 20,000 births. Approximately 70% of the affected infants have the salt-wasting form, and 30% have the simple virilizing form.

Nonclassic congenital adrenal hyperplasia has a prevalence of approximately 1 in 1000 in the generalÂ population but occurs most frequently in specific ethnic groups such as Ashkenazi Jews and Hispanics.
