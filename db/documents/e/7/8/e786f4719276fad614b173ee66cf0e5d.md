- Some diseases are related directly to the capillaries and can present with specific signs and symptoms. They can be either hereditary or nonhereditary.

- The hereditary diseases include (HHT) which also known as Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome. It is an autosomal dominant disorder with abnormal blood vessel formation in the mucous membranes, skin, and some organs, including the liver, lungs, and brain.

- Benign nevus or spider angioma are solitary or multiple benign vascular lesions present in 10 to 15% of healthy adults and children.

- Systemic capillary leak syndrome is a disease that causes leakage of fluid and proteins out of tiny blood vessels into surrounding tissues. It presents as hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, and hemoconcentration. Elevated white cell count may also be present.

- A capillary hemangioma is also known as a strawberry birthmark. It is a benign tumor showing abnormal overgrowth of tiny blood vessels. Capillary hemangiomas sometimes appear within the first six months of life and may not be present at the birth.

- A capillary angiosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor involving the capillaries. It is a cancer of the endothelial cells that line the walls of blood vessels. Only a few reports exist in the literature regarding angiosarcomas occurring on capillary malformations.
