As mentioned above, all patients being evaluated for AF should have a detailed history and physical exam. Diagnosis of AF is based on characteristic ECG findings. ECG findings as seen in patients with AF:

- The absence of distinct “P” waves

- Irregularly irregular R-R interval.

- Narrow QRS complex tachycardia, typically with the heart rate between 110 and 160; QRS duration fewer than 0.12 seconds unless accompanied by pre-existing bundle block, aberrant conduction, or accessory pathway

- Fibrillatory waves may be present, which can mimic “P” waves.

Ashman phenomenon: QRS morphology is usually unaffected in AF. However, in cases with aberrant ventricular conduction, bundle branch block can occur due to an abrupt change in length of the cardiac cycle. These aberrantly conducted beats are usually of right bundle branch block morphology.

Further evaluation should include a workup to identify the cause of AF. Patients should be tested for electrolyte abnormalities, endocrine disorders (specifically hyperthyroid), drug-induced causes, infections, drug or chemical withdrawal, and echocardiography to check for structural heart disease. In patients presenting with ischemic stroke and with no prior history of AF, 72-hour Holter monitoring improves the detection rate of silent paroxysmal AF.
