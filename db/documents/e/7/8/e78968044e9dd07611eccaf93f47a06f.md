**Basic Characteristics**

One of the indispensable characteristics of an ideal radiopharmaceutical is a short half-life. Larger doses could be used with minimal radiation burden to the patient for better imaging quality. Besides, the radionuclide produced should have high specific activity with minimal impurities.

The generator consists of an alumina (Al2O3) anion exchange cylindrical column with fission-produced Mo-99 adsorbed onto it, contained within a lead shield for radiation protection. Lead blocks the gamma (Tc) and beta- (Mo) radiations. Around 5-10 g of alumina is used in the column.

After every 23 hours, the maximum activity of 99m-Tc is obtained. It gradually builds up according to the radioactive decay of molybdenum. Therefore, in most laboratories, elution is usually carried out every 24 hours to increase the generator's efficiency. However, elution can be carried out more than once a day for emergency studies since 50% of the maximum activity is reached with 4-5 hours of initial elution.

**Types of Generator**

There are two types of generators available commercially, wet and dry type systems. The wet system has a 0.9% normal saline reservoir, and the eluate is accumulated in a particular sterile evacuated vial at a collection port. In contrast, a dry system is commonly available at imaging labs and has two ports for elution and evacuated vials.

**Theoretical yield of 99m-Tc**

The level of technetium-99m varies according to growth and decay effects. The radioactive decay is continuous within the generator system. A transient equilibrium is attained as the half-lives of Mo and Tc differ by a factor of 11. Approximately 87% of molybdenum decays into 99m-Tc and 13% into stable Tc-99 (2.1 x 10^5years). Also, 99m-Tc decays to Tc-99 by isomeric transition with the emission of 140-KeV gamma rays.

Although 99-Tc and 99m-Tc have similar physical and chemical properties, they differ in labeling efficiency. Nevertheless, it is not problematic from a health standpoint.

Sometimes, it becomes prudent to calculate the theoretical yield of 99m-Tc for add-on emergency studies. Equation 1 provides a theoretical yield of 99m-Tc via the Molybdenum generator at a given time.

- ATc = 0.957(AMo)i [e^-0.0105t - e^-0.1155t] + [(ATc)i (e^-0.1155t)] (Eq. 1)

Because Mo has a half-life of 66 hours (2.8 days), a generator can be used for up to two weeks.

This calculation is often employed by institutional set-up to purchase an appropriately sized generator to calculate enough residual activity on the last day of the workweek.
