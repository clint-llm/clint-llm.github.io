Those patients with unilateral adrenal hyperplasia who meet the following criteria should be scheduled for surgical resection: (1) Suspicious malignancy regarding imaging criteria, (2) Those with greater than 4 to 6 cm size, and (3) Clinical evidence of functional adrenal mass, including every manifestation attributed to cortisol, aldosterone, or catecholamines hypersecretion.****Although there is a debate in discrete defining hypercortisolism due to cortisol hypersecretion, to cover the optimal management of those patients with mild hypercortisolism, there is a consensus in utilizing dexamethasone suppression test to identify those demanding intervention.

In bilateral symmetricalÂ hyperplasia along with an elevated level of urinary cortisol of greater than 3 to 4 times above normal, bilateral adrenalectomy might be recommended.

Those patients affected with bilateral adrenal cortical hyperplasia due to hyperadrenalism might be considered for non-surgical treatment with mineralocorticoids antagonists, however, if the causality of adrenal cortical hyperplasia is supposed to be outstanding hypercortisolism, surgical management with bilateral surgical removal of adrenal glands and lifelong substitution of both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid should be considered.
