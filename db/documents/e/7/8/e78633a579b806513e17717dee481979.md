Acral lentiginous melanoma is a subtype of cutaneous malignant melanoma. It is comprised of malignant melanocytes, which can become invasive with time. It is often diagnosed at a later stage than the other forms of cutaneous malignant melanoma and in populations that are at a low risk for UV-induced melanomas, which highlights the need for early screening and detection. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of acral lentiginous melanoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of acral lentiginous melanoma.
- Summarize appropriate evaluation of acral lentiginous melanoma.
- Review the management options available for acral lentiginous melanoma.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance early detection of acral lentiginous melanoma and improve outcomes.
