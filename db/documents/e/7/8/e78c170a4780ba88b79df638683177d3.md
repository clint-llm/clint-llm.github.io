The diagnosis of BSS requires a high index of suspicion. A diagnosis of BSS must be considered in any bleeding patient with thrombocytopenia and large platelets, especially if they present in childhood. All patients with BSS must be registered in centers that can provide 24-hour, tertiary level care in the event of bleeding. All healthcare providers involved in the management of patients with BSS must be in close communication with each other when managing them for elective or emergent procedures.

Due to the rarity of the condition,Â there is only level 3 evidence at best to support this information.
