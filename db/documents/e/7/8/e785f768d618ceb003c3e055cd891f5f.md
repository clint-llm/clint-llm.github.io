The complete pathophysiology of this disease is not entirely understood but likely results from alcohol’s effects on the small pancreatic ducts and acinar cells.  Alcohol is believed to cause precipitation and increases the viscosity of pancreatic secretions, which leads to the development of protein plugs in the small ducts

The pancreas uses oxidative and non-oxidative metabolism to process alcohol. The oxidative pathway leads to the formation of acetaldehyde, a reactive metabolite that causes detrimental effects in acinar cells through activation of stellate cells, increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and a decrease in NAD+/NADH ratios. The non-oxidative pathway requires the formation of fatty acid ethyl ester (FAEE) synthase, which leads to activation of key transcription factors, sustained increases in intracellular calcium, and inhibition of extracellular matrix proteins, ultimately leading to further cell injury

Alcohol also leads to premature activation of trypsinogen and other digestive and lysosomal enzymes within the acinar cells themselves; this causes the pancreatic tissue to auto-digest and leads to further inflammation. Another contributing mechanism is intra-acinar activation of factor-kB (NF-kB), a transcriptional activator, which further drives the inflammatory response, which can cause up to 50% of pancreatic tissue damage and lead to severe, fatal inflammatory responses
