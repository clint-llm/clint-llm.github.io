The United States Center for Health Statistics defines a fetal death as the delivery of a fetus showing no sign of life, as indicated by absent breathing, heartbeats, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movements of voluntary muscles, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy. Stillbirth is a fetal death after a defined gestational age and/or fetal weight, both of which have historically lacked uniformity. Currently, the most recognized definition of stillbirth is a fetal death that occurs at or greater than 20 weeks gestation or at a birth weight greater than or equal to 350 grams. Standardization of the definition of stillbirth is a current priority.

Comparison of stillbirth rates among and within countries is limited due to the non-uniformity of the definition of stillbirth and incomplete collection of stillbirth data. Globally, less than 5 percent of stillbirths are recorded.

Stillbirth has many causes: intrapartum complications, hypertension, diabetes, infection, congenital and genetic abnormalities, placental dysfunction, and pregnancy continuing beyond forty weeks. This is a catastrophic event with lasting consequences on all of society. We need to learn more about why stillbirths occur. This knowledge can help those impacted deal with grief and, more importantly, prepare to reduce stillbirth risk in subsequent pregnancies. This activity reviews the healthcare team's role in evaluating, managing, and improving care for patients diagnosed with stillbirth.
