Refractory shock is a vasodilatory shock resulting from the impaired responsiveness of catecholamines. Excess amounts of the vasodilatory nitric oxide (NO) and relative or absolute deficiencies of endogenous vasoactive hormones, such as vasopressin, cortisol, vitamin B1, ascorbic acid, and angiotensin II lead to vasorelaxation. Hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate levels lead to activation of adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels present in smooth muscle cells, which prevents calcium entry that is required for vasoconstriction.
