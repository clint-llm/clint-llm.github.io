Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is a medical condition in which there is multifocal arterial constriction and dilation in the cerebral vasculature and which may be associated with nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. This condition can correlate with pregnancy and exposure to certain drugs. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes and reviews the role of the interprofessional healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.
- Summarize evaluation of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome and improve outcomes.
