Iodine toxicity is a rare condition that requires a broad initial diagnosis and heightened suspicion.  These patients may exhibit vague signs and symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. While history taking may reveal the toxicity, the cause is difficult to determine without further evaluation.

While the emergency physician is almost always involved in the initial care of toxicology patients, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include an intensivist, toxicologist, and endocrinologist. The nurses are also a vital part of the interprofessional team as they will monitor the patient's vital signs and assist with the education of the patient and family.

The outcomes of iodine toxicity depend on the cause and severity. However, to improve outcomes, prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended.
