There are two main etiologies of Cushing syndrome: endogenous hypercortisolism and exogenous hypercortisolism. Exogenous hypercortisolism, the most common cause of Cushing syndrome, is mostly iatrogenic and results from the prolonged use of glucocorticoids. Endogenous Cushing syndrome results from excessive production of cortisol by adrenal glands and can be ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent. ACTH-secreting pituitary adenomas (Cushing disease) and ectopic ACTH secretion by neoplasms are responsible for ACTH-dependent Cushing. Adrenal hyperplasia, adenoma, and carcinoma are major causes of ACTH-independent Cushing syndrome.
