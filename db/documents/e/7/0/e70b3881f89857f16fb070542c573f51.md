Patients with active liver disease or a history of hypersensitivity to zileuton or excipientsÂ should not take zileuton. When using zileuton, patients with ALT elevations more than three times the normal upper limit should avoid taking zileuton and consider a different therapy course.

There are no contraindications for use in pregnant patients. However, patients should not use zileuton unless the benefit to the mother justifies the risk to the fetus.

Clinicians should avoid prescribing zileuton under the age of 12 years as its safety and effectiveness in the age group have not been established. Concerns in this group are primarily due to the risk of hepatoxicity.

Female patients over 65 must use zileuton cautiously as they are more susceptible to hepatotoxicity and liver injury.
