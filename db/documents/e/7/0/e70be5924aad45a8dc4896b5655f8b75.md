Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) is a group of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases that involves the interstitium and tubules. Inflammation of the kidney consists of the collection of inflammatory cells, fluid, and extracellular matrix surrounding the interstitium, along with the infiltration of tubular cells by inflammatory cells that define both tubules and interstitium pathology. It is one of the most significant causes of acute kidney injury that leads to renal failure. TIN can be classified into acute and chronic based on underlying etiology, duration, or histology.

Renal impairment with acute TIN is reversible, provided early and appropriate interventions are made, but chronic TIN may be irreversible in severe cases. Drug-induced nephritis is widely described and is the leading cause of TIN. Delay in diagnosis due to nonspecific signs and symptoms is frequently seen; thus, many attempts have been made for effective diagnosis and exclude the other differentials carefully through efficient clinical experts' opinions and assessment and diagnostic tests.
