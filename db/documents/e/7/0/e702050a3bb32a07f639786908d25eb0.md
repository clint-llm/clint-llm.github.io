Aortocaval compression syndrome is also known as a supine hypotensive syndrome.  This pathophysiologic state occurs in a pregnant female, typically after 20 weeks gestation, when the patient is placed in the percent position. The impedance of blood flow back from the lower extremities to the maternal heart and central circulation occurs from compression of the uterus on the inferior vena cava, and also the aorta.  This subsequently limits blood flow out to the placenta, and may result in morbidity and mortality to the mother and fetus alike.  Due to the increased morbidity and mortality to both patients involved, it is critical that the health care team be aware and recognize this entity as a cause of hypotension in the pregnant patient, and immediately initiate maneuvers to correct it if suspected.
