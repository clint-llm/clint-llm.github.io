The structure of the corpus luteum consists of parenchymal and nonparenchymal cells. Due to the vast diversity of cell types of the corpus luteum, gap junctions play an important role in intercellular communication allowing for the coordination of the

function of these different cell types.

The corpus luteum has two fates depending on if there is a fertilized egg or not. If fertilization and implantation occur, by day nine, the syncytiotrophoblast cells of the blastocyst secrete human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), the same hormone tested for the ascertainment of pregnancy. HCG is vital in the continuation of progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum. Progesterone's presence is critical in maintaining the lining of the endometrium, which is necessary for the implantation and growth of the embryo. The corpus luteum is then known as the corpus luteum graviditatis. The corpus luteum will not have this job for the remainder of the pregnancy. Instead, the placenta will assume the role of maintaining the pregnancy through progesterone secretion, and the corpus luteum will degenerate around week 12. The alternate fate of the corpus luteum occurs if the egg does not undergo fertilization. It will stop secreting progesterone and will decay and turn into a corpus albicans. Without progesterone maintaining the endometrium, females will shed the lining resulting in menstruation.
