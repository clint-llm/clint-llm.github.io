The basis for the diagnosis of bullous myringitis is on physical examination via an otoscope

**Laboratory Studies**

Laboratory evaluation is rarely necessary for the diagnosis of bullous myringitis. The occasions that would lead to further laboratory evaluations would consist of infants less than 28 days of age with a fever and acute bullous myringitis. This scenario will involve full sepsis work up per the American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines to confirm or exclude other systemic or congenital diseases.

**Imaging Studies**

Imaging studies are not a routine recommendation unless there are concerns for intertemporal or intracranial complications such as mastoiditis, epidural or brain abscess, meningitis, or cholesteatoma. CT or MRI may be of assistance.

**Tympanocentesis**

Tympanocentesis is rarely indicated but can be of assistance in neonates or toxic appearing children who require culturing due to a higher risk of adverse outcomes, and to provide pain relief.
