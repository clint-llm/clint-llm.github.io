Adverse effects of non-ablative laser options are generally mild and include transient erythema, which resolves within 24 hours. Blistering, crusting, scarring, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation are rare and occur most commonly in darker skin types.

Non-ablative fractional resurfacing laser adverse effects include mild to moderate pain during treatment, and erythema and edema post-treatment lasting up to two to four days.

Side effects of ablative laser resurfacing include temporary burning discomfort, oozing, crusting, ulceration, erythema, edema, acneiform eruptions, eczematous dermatitis, and infections.

Fractional ablative laser resurfacing adverse effects are generally transient and less severe than with fully ablative resurfacing.
