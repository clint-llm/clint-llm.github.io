Follicular lymphoma is the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and the most common among clinically indolent NHLs. It has a diverse clinical trajectory and is a heterogeneous disease. This lymphoma is derived from germinal center B cells, both centrocytes and centroblasts. The growth pattern of this lymphoma is almost always nodular with a follicular pattern. Most people with this disease will have a clinically indolent course, needing only intermittent therapy over decades. Asymptomatic relapsed cases can be observed and monitored closely for symptom development and do not need immediate treatment. The treatment of late relapsed cases depends on several factors, such as comorbidities, disease burden, and performance status. This activity covers the diagnosis and management of follicular lymphoma.

**Objectives:**
- Highlight the etiology and clinical presentation of relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma.
- Discuss the investigations of relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma.
- Outline the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach in treating relapsed and refractory follicular lymphoma.
