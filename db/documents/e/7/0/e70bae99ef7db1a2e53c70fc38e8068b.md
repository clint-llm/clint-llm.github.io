The most effective approach for tuberculosis disease prevention is identifying cases and effective treatment. Medical therapy considerably decreases bacterial load transmission within communities.

Using the FAST approach seems to effectively reduce the burden of nosocomial transmission in a hospital setting. This consists of Finding undiagnosed tuberculosis infections Actively through rapid molecular testing, Separating them safely, and initiating appropriate treatment.

Identifying and mapping "hot sport" within a geographical area and providing preventative INH therapy seems to decrease disease burden within communities.

Socioeconomic development (such as improving public transport settings) and improving nutritional health within communities reduce crowdedness and minimize close contact or prolonged exposure. This reduces the risk of community transmission and decreases the disease burden.

Several vaccine candidates have shown efficacy in animal models compared to the old BCG vaccine. However, none so far have shown efficacy in humans. One trial examined a vaccinia virus-produced M. tuberculosis vaccine has failed to elicit an adequate immune response in human hosts.
