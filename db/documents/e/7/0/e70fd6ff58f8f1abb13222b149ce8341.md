Upper extremity amputations are a procedure commonly done in a variety of circumstances including infection, trauma, cancer, disease progression or congenital malformations. The level at which the amputation occurs can greatly impact a patient's outcomes and level of care required by health care professionals. This activity aims to review anatomy, indications, surgical techniques and special considerations/complications that may arise so that an interprofessional team may provide optimal care to patients who may need this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the functional anatomy of each level of upper extremity amputation.
- Review the complications that may occur postoperatively in amputees and methods of treatment. 
- Summarize the epidemiology of upper extremity amputations.
- Explain the importance of an interprofessional approach when caring for patients with upper extremity amputations.
