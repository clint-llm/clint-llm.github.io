The volume of distribution (Vd) is a pharmacokinetic parameter representing an individual drug’s propensity to either remain in the plasma or redistribute to other tissue compartments. By definition, Vd is a proportionality constant that relates the total amount of drug in the body to the plasma concentration of the drug at a given time.

Volume of Distribution (L) = Amount of drug in the body (mg) / Plasma concentration of drug (mg/L)

Based on the above equation:

- A drug with a **high****Vd**has a propensity to leave the plasma and enter the extravascular compartments of the body, meaning that a**higher dose**of a drug is required to achieve a given plasma concentration. (High Vd -> More distribution to other tissue)

- Conversely, a drug with a **low****Vd**has a propensity to remain in the plasma meaning a**lower dose**of a drug is required to achieve a given plasma concentration. (Low Vd -> Less distribution to other tissue)
