Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is an iatrogenic disease, first identified in 2000. Annually, about 4.5 million Americans are exposed to GBCAs, according to a report by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

NSF has no preference for race, sex, or age.

When the high-risk group 1 GBCAs were used, the estimated incidence was 36.5 cases per 100,000 gadolinium-enhanced MRI examinations; however, the incidence was reduced to four cases per 100,000 tests after the screening for risk was instituted in 2007.

Deo et al conducted a study on a cohort of end-stage renal failure patients in Connecticut over a period of eighteen months. The incidence of NSF was found to be 4.3 patients per 1000 patient-years. A 2.4% risk of NSF was observed in each radiologic study that used gadolinium.

Todd et al observed an exaggerated risk of developing skin manifestations of NSF with exposure to gadolinium as opposed to patients with no exposure to gadolinium.

Interestingly, delayed-onset NSF was reported in a patient with renal failure in Korea who had a "reverse superscan" observed on bone scintigraphy at the age of 19 years. The patient had exposure to gadolinium at the age of 14 years.
