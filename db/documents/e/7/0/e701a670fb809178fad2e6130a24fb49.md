Because it is a histological finding, acute tubular necrosis is diagnosed on a clinical basis. A biopsy is only performed when there is suspicion of an entity other than acute tubular necrosis causing AKI. Histopathological findings include:

**Ischemic Acute Tubular Necrosis**

- Early: Changes range from swelling of the cell to focal tubular epithelial necrosis and apoptosis with desquamation of cells into the tubular lumen; dilated proximal tubules with loss or thinning of brush border; granular, hyaline, and pigmented cases especially in distal and collecting ducts; white blood cells in dilated vasa recta; interstitial edema; and eosinophilic hyaline casts of Tamm-Horsfall protein

- Later: Regeneration of epithelia (dilated tubular lumina, flattened epithelium, large nuclei with prominent nucleoli and mitotic activity)

**Nephrotoxic Acute Tubular Necrosis**

The nephrotoxic agents that lead to acute tubular necrosis can manifest as different features of histological damage, including:

- Ethylene glycol: Calcium oxalate crystals in the tube

- Hemoglobin/myoglobin: Deeply pigmented, red-brown cast in the distal and collecting tubule.

- Carbon tetrachloride: Neutral lipid accumulation in injured cells followed by necrosis.

- Indinavir: Clear intraluminal crystals with mononuclear reaction.

- Lead: Intranuclear, dark inclusions, and necrosis.

- Mercury: large acidophilic inclusions.

- Tenofovir: Proximal tubular eosinophilic inclusions that represent giant mitochondria.

- Vancomycin: Acute interstitial nephritis with eosinophilic and lymphocytic infiltrate and acute tubular necrosis.
