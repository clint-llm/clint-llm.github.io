Periodontal diseases are the most common diseases found in the oral cavity. The majority of risk factors influencing the onset and progression of periodontal diseases are considered to be modifiable. With proper guidance and instruction, the interprofessional healthcare team may be able to reduce the risk of occurrence. These modifiable risk factors include inadequate oral hygiene regimens, tobacco smoking, and diabetic control. It is the responsibility of clinicians to understand the importance and impact of these risk factors when assessing patients on their risk for developing periodontal diseases. Providers are responsible for screening and initial treatment. Referal to periodontal specialists can be considered. Only by practicing effective risk assessment can these patients receive the care they require. Furthermore, because periodontal disease can arise as a result of systemic and genetic diseases, it is not solely the responsibility of the dental professional to be aware of these at-risk populations. Therefore, the diagnosis, treatment, and maintenance of periodontal disease require a holistic approach between hygienists, dentists, and periodontists to most effectively identify and treat the affected patients. With an interprofessional team approach, patients with periodontal disease can experience improved outcomes. [Level 5]
