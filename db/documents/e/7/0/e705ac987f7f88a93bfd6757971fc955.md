RCC is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. It occurs most often in men ages 50 to 70.

Globally, the incidence of RCC varies, with the highest rates observed in the Czech Republic and North America. In the United States, there are approximately 63,000 new cases and almost 14,000 deaths each year.

In the United States, incidence rates of RCC have been on the rise through the mid-2000s. Most of the increases since the 1980s occurred in early-stage tumors.
