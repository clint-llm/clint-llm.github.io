1.**Hereditary fructose intolerance or hereditary fructosemia**is an autosomal recessive inborn fructose metabolism error due to the aldolase B deficiency (mutation inALDOB gene) or fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase in the liver, intestine, and kidney. Affected infants are primarily asymptomatic until they consume fructose or sucrose through their diet (fruits, table sugar, honey) around the time of weaning. After consuming fructose, fructose 1-phosphate builds up in the liver and kidney and causes toxic symptoms. In addition, fructose 1-phosphate inhibits fructokinase and decreases hepatic uptake of fructose results in fructosemia. It is characterized by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, hepatomegaly, and metabolic abnormalities such as hypoglycemia, hyperuricemia, hypermagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia.

- Biochemical basis of hypoglycemia: Fructose converts into fructose 1-phosphate and gets trapped inside the hepatocytes → depletion of inorganic phosphate → impairment ATP synthesis and lack of cellular ATP → impairment in gluconeogenesis → hypoglycemia. In addition, fructose 1-phosphate allosterically inhibits hepatic glycogen phosphorylase leads to postprandial hypoglycemia and accumulation of glycogen in the liver.

- Biochemical basis of liver dysfunction: Liver mitochondria cannot perform oxidative phosphorylation as sequestration of inorganic phosphate in the form of fructose 1-phosphate. The ATP levels plummet, making it impossible for the liver to perform its normal work functions. In addition, the ATP-dependent cation pumps fail to maintain normal ion gradients, causing cell damage by osmotic lysis.

- Biochemical basis of kidney dysfunction: Aldolase B is the predominant form of aldolase in proximal renal tubules. The interaction between aldolase B and vacuolar type-ATPase (V-ATPase) is critical for the proximal renal tubules for proper acidification function in terms of proton transport across the tubules and endosomal acidification. Thus, the absence of V-ATPase-aldolase B interaction may contribute to renal tubular dysfunction in aldolase B deficiency.

- Impairment in protein synthesis, hyperuricemia, and release of magnesium may be responsible for liver and kidney dysfunction. In addition, fructose 1-phosphate is a potent competitive inhibitor of phosphomannone isomer, an enzyme of the first step of N-glycosylation of protein. Thus defective N-glycosylation leads to improper synthesis, folding, and trafficking of the proteins.

Urine is positive for the reducing sugars test but negative for the glucose dipstick test. An aldolase B enzyme assay in a liver biopsy and DNA profiling by allele-specific probes serve as confirmatory tests for the diagnosis. In addition, monitoring of increased carbohydrate-deficient transferrin by transferrin isoelectric focusing and increased activity of aspartylglucosaminidase should be used for disease follow-up to assess compliance with dietary restrictions.

An early diagnosis of fructose intolerance and the prompt implementation of dietary measures to combat fructose intolerance is critical. Therefore, the primary strategy of therapy is to eliminate dietary fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol. During hospitalization, it is not recommended to use fructose-containing intravenous fluids, medications, or infant formulas. Additionally, a sugar-free, water-soluble multivitamin is prescribed daily to prevent micronutrient deficiencies.

2.**Essential fructosuria or benign fructosuria**is an autosomal recessive disorder due to a deficiency of fructokinase that converts fructose into fructose 1-phosphate. Hepatocytes cannot trap fructose in the form of fructose 1-phosphate leads to accumulation of fructose in the blood, and excess fructose readily excretes in the urine because fructose has a low renal threshold. It is not called fructosemia because increased fructose levels in the blood are also metabolized by hexokinase in extra-hepatic tissue. As a result, the level of fructose in the blood is not consistently elevated. It is an entirely benign condition without any symptoms and complications. It is diagnosed accidentally during urine examination, positive for reducing sugar and negative for glucose dipstick test. Urine chromatography for fructose serves as a confirmatory test to diagnose benign fructosuria. There is no need for any treatment and dietary restriction.

3. Increased fructose levels are associated with **myocardial infarction and aging.**Fructose glycates at a rate tenfold that of glucose, and reduced antioxidant activity contributes to myocardial infarction.
