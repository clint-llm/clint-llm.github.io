Cockayne syndrome, first described in 1936 by Dr. Cockayne, is a rare genetic disorder, mainly characterized by growth disorders, intellectual deficit, neuromotor difficulties, and impaired vision and hearing. The children look cachectic with a prematurely aged face.

There are different types ofÂ the syndrome. They depend on the age at which the disease manifests itself and the severity of the manifestations:

- Type 1 is also called "classical form." It usually occurs at one year of age by stunting and neurological disorders, followed by a decline in vision and hearing.

- Type 2 is a severe form of the syndrome. Neurological disorders and some ocular abnormalities are present from the outset at birth.

- Type 3 corresponds to a moderate form.

There are two other rare, special forms of Cockayne syndrome.
