Short stature is defined as height at least two standard deviations below the age and sex-matched mean. Ideally, this should be matched to people of the same race as well, as stature variates depending on ethnic group. In some cases, short stature may be part of the normal growth of the individual. Familial (genetic) short stature and constitutional short stature are by far the most common causes of short stature and constitutional growth delay and are benign. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of constitutional growth delay and the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the features commonly associated with constitutional growth delay.
- Outline the management of constitutional growth delay.
- Review the evaluation findings in a patient with constitutional growth delay.
- Summarize the importance of optimizing coordination amongst the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation of children with short stature.
