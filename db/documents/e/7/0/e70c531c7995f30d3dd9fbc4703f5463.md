Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measure used to determine anemia etiologies. This activity illustrates the categories of anemia with varying MCVs, the causes of microcytic, macrocytic, and normocytic anemias, the use of MCV in the next step of treatment of anemia, and other elements including pathophysiology, histopathology, treatment, and epidemiology of each category of anemia based on MCV. These components are important for the management of patients with varying types of anemia.

**Objectives:**
- Define mean corpuscular volume.
- Describe the history and physical examination findings of patients with varying mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values and anemia. 

- Summarize the complications expected in patients with abnormal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values.

- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance mean corpuscular volume (MCV) use and improve anemia outcomes.
