Chronic coronary occlusion or chronic total occlusion (CTO) has a wide spectrum ranging from subtotal to total coronary involvement. The diagnosis is made by clinical/laboratory findings and angiography. Treatment depends on the extent and severity of the disease, which includes lifestyle modifications, medical therapy, percutaneous intervention, and coronary artery bypass grafting. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of chronic coronary occlusion and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of chronic coronary occlusion.
- Review the appropriate steps for the evaluation of chronic coronary occlusion.
- Outline the management options available for chronic coronary occlusion.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of chronic coronary occlusion and improve outcomes.
