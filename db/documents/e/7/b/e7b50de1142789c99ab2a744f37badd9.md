Scarlet fever can be confused with measles and rubella. However, the absence of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection and confluent rash in measles can help to differentiate these diseases.

Impetigo by S. pyogenes needs to be differentiated from impetigo infection by staphylococcus aureus. S. pyogenes cause non-bullous impetigo while S. aureus leads to bullous impetigo.
