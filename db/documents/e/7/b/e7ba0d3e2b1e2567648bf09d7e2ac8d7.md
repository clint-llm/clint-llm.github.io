The breast skin receives its blood supply from the subdermal plexus; these tiny blood vessels, in turn, communicate with deep underlying arterioles which supply the breast parenchyma. Blood is supplied to the breast from the following vessels:

- The thoracoacromial artery

- Internal mammary perforators (second to fifth)

- Lateral thoracic artery

- Thoracodorsal artery

- Terminal branches of the intercostal perforators (third to eighth)

Overall, at least 60% of the blood supply is from the superomedial perforators which come off the internal mammary artery.

The breast also has profuse venous drainage divided into the superficial and deep veins. The superficial veins are foundÂ along the anterior surface of the fascia; these veins follow the areola path under the nipple areolar complex, often referred to as the venous plexus of Haller. Deep inside the breast are many large veins which drain into the chest wall veins.

**Lymphatic Drainage**

The breast also has extensive lymphatic drainage that runs both superficially and deep within the breast. The superficial lymphatics are the areolar and subareolar plexus. The latter also receives lymphatics from glandular tissues. The superficial lymphatics continue posteriorly and medially and eventually reach the axillary lymph nodes.
