The risorius muscle receives its arterial blood supply via the facial artery and the transverse facial artery at its origin. The facial artery is a branch of the external carotid artery and gives rise to the submental and inferior and superior labial arteries, supplying the chin and lip regions, and proceeds superomedially to the lateral aspect of the nose as the angular artery. Proximally, it passes anterosuperiorly over the mandible and is deep to the risorius. The transverse facial artery arises from the superficial temporal artery just inferior to the zygomatic arch of the temporal bone, where it courses anteriorly down the mandible between the superficial and deep masseter muscles.

The facial and transverse facial veins drain deoxygenated blood from the risorius. The facial vein drains into the common facial vein, then into the internal jugular vein. The transverse facial vein drains into the retromandibular vein, which then drains into the external jugular vein via the posterior branch of the retromandibular vein, or to the internal jugular vein via the anterior branch of the retromandibular vein and the common facial vein. The submandibular and mandibular lymph nodes receive lymph drainage from the risorius.
