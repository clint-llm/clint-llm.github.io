As noted above, this disease represents an imbalance in the coagulation system. Specific levels of antithrombin III, free protein C, and free and total protein S may help confirm the diagnosis especially in the neonatal form of the disease. Otherwise, the evaluation of patients with purpura fulminans mimics the evaluation of the underlying cause. Searching for inciting infection with labs, cultures, and imaging should follow sepsis guidelines. If the clinician is considering necrotizing fasciitis, white blood cell (WBC) count and a sodium level with or without the other components of the LRINEC (Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis) score may help the surgeon decide on an early intervention.  Because of the strong association with disseminated intravascular coagulation, one should also evaluate for thrombocytopenia, elevated coagulation factors (PT, PTT), increased d-dimer assay (or serum fibrin degradation products), and a decreasing fibrinogen level.
