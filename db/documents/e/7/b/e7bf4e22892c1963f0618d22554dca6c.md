Pacemaker mediated tachycardia (PMT) generally refers to all tachyarrhythmias in which the pacing device plays a major role. There are various conditions that can lead to the development of this type of arrhythmia, including tracking of an atrial tachyarrhythmia (atrial tachycardia or sinus tachycardia) or tracking of electromagnetic interference. However, classically PMT or endless loop tachycardia (ELT) usually denotes a form of reentrant tachycardia that is encountered in patients with dual-chamber pacemakers, in which the pacemaker forms the antegrade limb, and the AV node (or an accessory pathway) forms the retrograde limb of the reentrant circuit.
