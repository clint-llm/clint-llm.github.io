Biliary colic is defined as pain in the abdomen, due to obstruction usually by stones in the cystic duct or common bile duct of the biliary tree. It typically occurs after eating a large, fatty meal that causes contraction of the gallbladder. Treatment of this disease is primarily surgical, involving removal of the gallbladder, typically using a laparoscopic technique. This activity describes the risk factors, evaluation, and management of biliary colic and stresses the importance of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk factors, pathophysiology, and clinical features of patients with biliary colic.
- Outline the evaluation in patients with biliary colic.
- Explain the treatment strategies in patients with biliary colic.
- Outline an interprofessional team approach to enhance care coordination for prompt diagnosis and management in patients with biliary colic.
