In infants, the cause is often accidental and may occur in the bathtub or even the bathing pail. Most infant deaths occur within 5 minutes of a lapse in supervision. Older children tend to drown in the swimming pool. Often the gate or the fence to the pool is open and the child just jumps in. Adults tend to drown in lakes, rivers, and the sea. In many adult cases of drowning, there may be an associated injury, like diving in shallow waters and hitting a rock.
