The left atrial appendage (LAA) is a trabeculated long tubular structure connected to the venous portion of the left atrium (LA) through a narrow junction. The size and shape vary widely, but in about 70% of the patients, the appendage has a bent or spiral axis.

During the sinus rhythm, the contraction of LAA causes vigorous blood flow in and out of the appendage cavity. When there is a contractile dysfunction in the LAA, as in AF, it can predispose to local stasis, thrombosis, and systemic embolization. Changes in the left ventricular function (which may be impaired in AF) influence the extent of LAA filling and emptying more than the LAA function.
