The histopathological picture of the condition shows five major features:

- Hyperkeratosis of the superficial layer of the epithelium: This is due to alteration in the pattern of expression of keratin in the squamous cells of the epithelium. This hyperkeratotic thick layer may separate from the underlying cells, resulting in projections producing theÂ typical "hairy" appearance of the lesion. This hyper-keratinized epithelium may get superficially infected with bacteria and/or Candida.

- Hyperparakeratosis of the superficial layer of the epithelium: The abnormal persistence of nuclei of the cell in this layer of the epithelium represents incomplete squamous differentiation. This layer may show the presence of numerous Candida hyphae.

- Acanthosis of the upper stratum spinosum/prickle cell layer: This abnormal expansion of cells occurs with layers of koilocyte-like cells or ballooned cells. The nuclei may show a ground-glass appearance throughout and may contain eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions with a halo (Cowdry type A).

- Absence of inflammation in the epithelium and minimal to zero inflammation in the lamina propria, and even absent inflammatory mononuclear cells infiltrate.

- Normal basal cells of the epithelium histologically: The gene BZLF1 is required to bring about the intracellular transition from the latent state to the productive infectious state. In hairy leukoplakia, the BZLF1 gene is restricted to the .cells of the stratum spinosum and stratum granulosum. The cells of these layers express the gene Blimp1, which acts as a transcription factor during the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. Both Blimp1 and BZLF1 cannot be detected in the basal cell layer of the oral epithelium, due to which it is assumed that the basal cell layer is not involved in hairy leukoplakia.

Although the above features indicate hairy leukoplakia, none of the above histologic features is typical and found only in this lesion. Therefore, the definitive diagnosis of hairy leukoplakia requires histologic appearance along with the demonstration of DNA, RNA, or protein of Epstein-Barr virus within the epithelial cells.
