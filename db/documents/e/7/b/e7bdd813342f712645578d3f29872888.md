Calcium gluconate can be utilized to treat a variety of issues, such as in the treatment of hypocalcemia, cardiac arrest, and cardiotoxicity due to hyperkalemia or hypermagnesemia, or off-label in the management of calcium channel blocker and beta-blocker toxicity, magnesium toxicity, and hydrofluoric acid burns. Indications, route of administration, and dosage can be challenging and requires an interprofessional team approach between various healthcare professionals, including physicians, pharmacists, and nurses. The various dosing units and conversion factors of calcium gluconate are potential sources of medication errors. Pharmacist input is essential to prevent dosing errors. Nursing has a role in determining the extravasation of calcium gluconate in patients who present with symptoms after administration and monitoring EKGs in patients receiving treatment with calcium gluconate. It is imperative to use a team-based approach when handling this medication to ensure that patients have the appropriate treatment and mitigate the adverse effects of the drug. [Level 5]
