Sexual contact is the primary mode of transmission for HIV-2, and patients at risk should be counseled about safe sexual practices and encouraged to get routine testing. Counseling should be culturally competent, sensitive to issues of sexual identity, and tailored to each patient's risk. If other risk factors are present, including the use of intravenous drugs, specific harm reduction strategies or interventions should be offered to mitigate transmission from contaminated equipment.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be offered to patients at substantial risk of acquiring HIV infection. Although there are no data specifically addressing PrEP in preventing HIV-2, the antiretrovirals used for PrEP are active against both HIV-1 and HIV-2, and similarly, high levels of efficacy would be expected.
