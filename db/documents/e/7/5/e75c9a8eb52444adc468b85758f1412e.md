It is well-documented that early diagnosis of a bacterial infection can decrease mortality and morbidity among all patients.

Unfortunately, most first-line tests for determining infection, such as blood cultures and C-reactive protein, lack the efficiency and specificity needed to treat patients promptly. Therefore, procalcitonin (PCT) serum assays have been developed to provide healthcare providers with an earlier detection method to determine the origin of a systemic inflammatory response (e.g., bacterial versus non-bacterial). Early detection, in turn, limits the development of antibacterial resistance and patient exposure to antibiotics when they are no longer warranted.

The prognostic value of PCT has also shown clinical significance by providing clinicians with a positive correlation between disease severity and elevated PCT serum levels, especially within septic patients.
