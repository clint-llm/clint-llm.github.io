Initial biochemical evaluation should include evaluation for PTH resistance (serum calcium, serum albumin, and serum phosphorus). Hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated PTH in the absence of hypovitaminosis D, hypomagnesemia, and renal dysfunction are diagnostic of PTH resistance. In the setting of AHO, PTH resistance should be suspected even when serum calcium is normal if PTH is at high-normal to high with normal 25-hydroxy vitamin D.

Skeletal maturation should be monitored with roentgenography of the left hand at regular intervals. Roentgenography may also reveal short metacarpals, metatarsals, distal phalanges of thumbs, advanced bone age, and ectopic ossification.

Electrocardiogram may reveal prolonged QT in patients with hypocalcemia.

Computed tomography of the brain may reveal basal ganglia calcification and, in more severe cases, more diffuse calcification involving the subcortical white matter (Fahr syndrome).
