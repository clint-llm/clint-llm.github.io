The muscarinic antagonist is a class medication used to manage and treat numerous conditions, including COPD and organophosphate toxicity. This activity outlines the indications, action, and contraindications for muscarinic antagonists as a valuable class of medications used to manage COPD, organophosphate toxicity, and other conditions. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the healthcare team in the management of patients with COPD and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of muscarinic antagonists.
- Describe the adverse effects associated with muscarinic antagonists.
- Review the appropriate monitoring of muscarinic antagonists.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance muscarinic antagonists and improve outcomes.
