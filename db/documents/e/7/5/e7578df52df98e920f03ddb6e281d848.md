Histamine is a biogenic amine synthesized from L-histidine exclusively by L-histidine decarboxylase, which uses pyridoxal-5’-phosphate as a cofactor.

Only basophils and mast cells can produce and store large amounts of histamine in granules, where they are associated with chondroitin-4-sulfate and anionic proteoglycans heparin in basophils and mast cells, respectively.

Two major pathways metabolize most (>97%) of the synthesized histamine, histamine-N-methyltransferase (50 to 80%) and diamine oxidase (15 to 30%) and only 2 to 3% is excreted unchanged.in vitro as well as in vivo.
