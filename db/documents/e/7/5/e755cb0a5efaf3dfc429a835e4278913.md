Blood pressure is remarkably labile. Therefore, the most insignificant activities can result in substantial changes in blood pressure readings. Accordingly, medical professionals should always prepare the patient and environment properly before cuff inflation, regardless of whether a manual or automated method is used to measure blood pressure.

First, the patient should be questioned regarding current caffeine consumption, exercise, or smoking. If any of these activities have occurred within the last 30 minutes, blood pressure measurement should be postponed until this period has passed. Next, the patient should be encouraged to empty their bladder. Upon return, the patient should be seated on a chair with back support in a quiet room. Both feet should be flat on the floor with the legs uncrossed, and this seated position should be maintained for at least 5 minutes.

At this time, a properly sized cuff should be placed directly over the patient’s arm, no clothing should be underneath the cuff, and sleeves should not be rolled above the cuff. Once the cuff is in position, the patient’s arm should be supported so that the middle of the cuff is at the level of the right atrium. Initiation of blood pressure measurement can now occur. The patient should not speak or be spoken to while taking measurements.

There is significant variation among automated devices, and users should refer to instruction guides on how to initiate cuff inflation and blood pressure measurement. If a manual measurement is being performed, the bell or diaphragm of a stethoscope should be placed over the medial antecubital fossa over the approximate location of the brachial artery. The blood pressure cuff should be inflated 30 mmHg beyond the point at which the radial pulse is no longer palpable. Deflation of the cuff should occur in a slow and controlled manner at a rate of 2 to 3 mmHg per second. As mentioned previously, the appearance of Korotkoff sounds signifies systolic pressure, while the cessation of these sounds indicates diastolic pressure.

Invasive arterial blood pressure measurement is the gold standard of blood pressure measurement in intensive therapy units as it is able to take the beat-to-beat readings of blood pressure reflecting the perpetual fluctuations of blood pressure in real-time.
