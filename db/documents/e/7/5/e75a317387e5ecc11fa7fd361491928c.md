Indications of cardiac PET may include:

- Assessment of hibernating myocardium in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction prior to revascularisation procedure.

- Assessment of myocardial viability in patients with a fixed defect on single-photon emission cardiac tomography (SPECT), who might benefit from revascularization.

- Assessment of patients prior to referral for cardiac transplantation.

- Diagnosis and assessment of the physiologic significance of coronary artery disease

- Assessment of coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients where other non-invasive investigations remain equivocal

- Differentiating ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.

- Differentiating underlying mechanisms and causes of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy.

- Differentiation of benign cardiac lesions from malignant lesions

- Identification of an unknown primary tumor when patients present with metastatic disease or paraneoplastic syndrome.

- Adjunct tool in detecting infiltrative diseases such as cardiac sarcoidosis

- Monitoring the cardiac effect of chemotherapy on known malignancies.
