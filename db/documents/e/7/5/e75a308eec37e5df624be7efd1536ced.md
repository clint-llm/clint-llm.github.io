The underlying pathophysiology of diabetic macular edema is secondary to the disruption of the BRB. The BRB isolates the photoreceptors of the retina from the ophthalmic vasculature. The BRB functions in a complex manner that involves several factors that work in tandem; however, many of the specific physiologic processes are poorly understood. The BRB involves two major compartments: an outer and inner barrier. Animal models have illustrated that the permeability of both compartments is disrupted after the onset of diabetes. Disruption of this barrier results in the accumulation of macular edema; however, the process is more complicated than this and also involves various inflammatory markers upregulated by AGEs, hyperglycemia, and diabetes. Diabetes also results in vasoconstriction, which upregulates VEGF expression. VEGF also results in macular edema and results in vasculogenesis, which results in further retinal disease.
