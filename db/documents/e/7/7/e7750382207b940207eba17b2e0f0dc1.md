Due to biloma formation being an uncommon occurrence, it is important to consider the possible differential diagnoses. Right upper quadrant discomfort and abdominal fullness are non-specific symptoms that have a wide variety of possible causes. Biloma should enter the differential where patients present secondary to an iatrogenic or traumatic event that could disrupt the biliary tree. Following this, appropriate imaging should be undertaken.

Differential diagnoses following radiological investigation include hepatic abscess, cyst, pseudocyst, and lymphocele. As most bilomas form post-operatively or post-endoscopic investigation, seroma and hematoma are key differential diagnoses to consider. It is important to correctly identify bilomas as they often require drainage, while many differential diagnoses such as hematoma do not routinely require drainage.
