Digoxin exhibits its therapeutic and toxic effects by poisoning the sodium-potassium ATPase. The subsequent increase in intracellular sodium leads to increased intracellular calcium by decreasing calcium expulsion through the sodium-calcium cation exchanger. Higher intracellular calcium increases inotropy, which can be of symptomatic benefit in CHF. At toxic levels, automaticity can be increased as well. Digoxin also increases vagal tone by decreasing dromotropy at the AV node. This can be used to control atrial tachydysrhythmias.
