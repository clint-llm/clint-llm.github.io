The common notion related to biologic therapy is the necessity for lifelong or long-term treatment, the failure of which can lead to incomplete resolution or recurrences. With secukinumab, relapses and recurrences are less frequent and can be preventable with a maintenance regime of fixed-interval dosing. Also, following patient education by an interprofessional team including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists (e.g., a rheumatologist), nurses, and pharmacists, subsequent doses can be self-administered increasing patient compliance and adherence.

Patients on active secukinumab therapy should avoid live vaccines and contact with infectious agents due to the markedly depressed immunity that can lead to infection. Furthermore, the administration of non-live vaccines is also discouraged due to the unlikelihood of mounting a desired immune response.

A study identified that Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programs could facilitate interprofessional collaboration in managing chronic diseases such as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Interprofessional collaboration between dermatologists, rheumatologists, and clinicians can improve patient outcomes through early diagnosis to prevent joint damage and alleviate long-term socioeconomic consequences in patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.
