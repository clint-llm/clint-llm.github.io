Glucagon-like peptide 1 agonists are analogs of GLP-1, a gut-derived peptide hormone that exhibits a glucose-lowering effect via stimulation of insulin secretion from pancreatic islets in response to an oral glucose load, known as the incretin effect. Unlike the natural peptide hormone, synthetic GLP-1 is resistant to degradation by the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) enzyme, and thus it has a longer half-life. The GLP-1 activity in patients with type 2 diabetes may be decreased.

GLP-1 also slows gastric emptying, suppresses appetite, improves satiety, decreases inappropriate glucagon secretion, and promotes beta-cell proliferation.

The short-acting formulations work by delaying gastric emptying, thus reducing postprandial glucose levels. The long-acting agents affect both fasting and postprandial glucose levels.

Existing evidence suggests roles that GLP-1 analogs can play on receptors expressed throughout the human body, including reducing blood pressure, improvement in endothelial and myocardial function, recovery of failing and ischemic heart, arterial vasodilation, and increased diuresis and natriuresis.

**Comparison Of Different GLP-1 Agonists**

Numerous clinical trials and studies have been conducted between the short-acting and long-acting GLP-1 analogs to gauge their efficacy, safety, and tolerability. In addition, the added benefit of weight loss and improved cardiovascular and renal outcomes was also assessed.**Efficacy and Adverse Effects**

One meta-analysis showed that overall, once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonists were more effective in reducing HbA1c levels and equally as effective in weight loss than exenatide twice-daily injection, but not better than liraglutide once-daily injection.

Another meta-analysis demonstrated that liraglutide decreased HbA1c more than exenatide, and there was no difference in HbA1c reduction between liraglutide and dulaglutide. The adverse effects were mainly gastrointestinal, with less nausea seen in exenatide once-weekly injection, and most adverse effects were seen with short-acting agents.

In the AWARD-1 trial, dulaglutide was shown to be superior to exenatide twice-daily injection. This was followed up by further trials, and in the AWARD 6 trial, once-weekly dulaglutide was shown to be non-inferior to once weekly liraglutide. Liraglutide, however, had greater weight loss potential.

**Cardiovascular Outcomes**Seven cardiovascular outcome trials have been done on the seven GLP-1 receptor agonists. The LEADER-6 trial showed that liraglutide had a cardiovascular benefit in high-risk patients. The SUSTAIN 6 trial demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in death from cardiovascular events with the use of subcutaneous semaglutide, but it also had the highest reduction in HbA1c, and so it was unsure whether the reduction of death from CV events was from the medication or the improved glycemic control.

Out of the seven trials, all have shown noninferiority, and liraglutide, subcutaneous semaglutide, and dulaglutide have shown significant reductions in cardiovascular outcomes.

According to a post hoc analysis done on the SUSTAIN and PIONEER trials, semaglutide has shown a reduced relative risk and absolute risk reduction for major adverse cardiovascular events versus its comparators.

**Renal Outcomes**

GLP-1 agonists have demonstrated the most renal benefit primarily by reducing new-onset severely increased albuminuria. The AWARD-7 trial comparing dulaglutide and insulin glargine was the only trial involving this class of medications to exclusively enroll patients with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease. Patients concurrently on an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker who received dulaglutide experienced significantly less eGFR decline than their counterparts who received insulin glargine. For this reason, patients with an eGFR as low as 15 mL/min per 1.73 m2 can safely be treated with dulaglutide per FDA labeling.

Use of injectable semaglutide in SUSTAIN-6 showed the largest albuminuria reduction (followed by liraglutide and dulaglutide in their respective cardiovascular outcomes trials) and included patients across the spectrum of renal dysfunction except for dialysis patients. PIONEER 6, which evaluated cardiovascular outcomes of oral semaglutide, did not assess the drug’s effect on albuminuria or loss of eGFR.

**Weight Loss**

Recently, weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg became the first approved drug for chronic weight management in overweight adults or those with general obesity with at least one weight-related comorbidity since the approval of high dose liraglutide in 2014. Compared to the SCALE trial comparing weight management in liraglutide versus placebo, the four randomized controlled trials comparing semaglutide to placebo showed greater mean weight loss and also resulted in a greater percentage of patients who lost at least 5% of their body weight.

**Adherence to Therapy**

The once-weekly injections were also compared to one another based on patient persistence and adherence. One retrospective observational study evaluated the adherence of dulaglutide versus liraglutide and exenatide once weekly. The patients taking dulaglutide were remarkably more persistent and adherent than those patients taking exenatide extended-release or liraglutide. Another observational study examined adherence between dulaglutide, semaglutide, and exenatide. At 6 months, more patients preferred to use dulaglutide as compared to exenatide and semaglutide.
