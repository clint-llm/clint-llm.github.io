Diagnosing metastatic disease to the liver is difficult, as this constitutes stage IV disease from another primary site. The prognosis is poor without treatment. It requires anÂ interprofessional approach with medical, radiological, and surgical oncology to coordinate a patient-centered treatment plan with the hope of using chemotherapy and surgical resection to increase overall survival. There is a consensus on chemotherapy agents; however, surgical planning varies based on patient presentation. Although there is no way to prevent metastases, it is essential to see a primary provider annually for screening with physical exams, colonoscopies, and blood work.
