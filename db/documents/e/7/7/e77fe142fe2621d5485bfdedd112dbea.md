MPS is an extremely rare condition, and the prognosis depends on the severity and complexity of the presenting symptoms. The LMPS usually results in stillbirths and intrauterine fetal death. Most newborns that survive through pregnancy may have hypotension, bradycardia, respiratory failure, or early neonatal death in the immediate postnatal life.

The Escobar variant has a better prognosis than the LMPS. Several reports have noted the development ofÂ skeletal anomalies such as kyphoscoliosis during childhood that required surgical evaluation and treatment.

Overall, the prognosis of MPS depends on the severity of the presenting symptoms and the promptness of intervention.
