MVP patients with no symptoms often require no treatment.

MVP patients with symptoms of dysautonomia (chest pain, palpitations) should be treated with beta-blockers such as propranolol.

MVP with severe mitral regurgitation may benefit from mitral valve repair or mitral valve replacement. ACC/AHA guidelines recommend mitral valve repair before symptoms of congestive heart failure develop.

Individuals with MVP are at high risk for bacterial endocarditis. Until 2007, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommended prescribing antibiotics before invasive procedures, including dental surgery. Newer AHA guidelines recommend prophylaxis for dental procedures only should be advised for patients who have other cardiac conditions, which put them at the highest risk of adverse outcomes from infective endocarditis.

The association between MVP and a cerebral vascular event is low. The 2014 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) and 2012 European Society of Cardiology do not comment on antiplatelet/antithrombotic therapy in MVP. The 2006 ACC/AHA guidelines recommend aspirin for unexplained transient ischemic attacks in sinus rhythm with no atrial thrombi. Aspirin may be considered in sinus rhythm with echocardiographic evidence of high-risk MVP. Anticoagulation is recommended for systemic embolism or recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA) despite aspirin therapy. Anticoagulation is not recommended without systemic embolism, unexplained TIA, ischemic stroke, or atrial fibrillation.

Asymptomatic patients with mitral valve prolapse are managed conservatively with observation and monitoring. Patients with no concomitant mitral regurgitation can be followed every 3 to 5 years, and patients with mitral regurgitation can be followed annually. Patient reassurance is essential, along with recommendations for a healthy lifestyle and regular exercise. If the patient is symptomatic with palpitations, anxiety, or chest pain, other etiologies should be ruled out.

Symptomatic patients with severe mitral regurgitation, systolic heart failure, and symptom progression require surgical intervention. Asymptomatic patients with mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurgitation with systolic heart failure are also considered for surgical intervention.

Mitral valve repair is the recommended procedure over mitral valve replacement. Symptomatic patients with significant comorbidities who are surgical prohibitive risk can be considered for transcatheter mitral valve repair.

AHA has recommendations for athletes with mitral valve prolapse. Athletes who participate in high-intensity competitive sports can participate based on their clinical history. They can participate if they do not have a prior history of syncope, sustained or repetitive and non-sustained supraventricular tachycardia, severe mitral regurgitation, prior embolic event, left ventricular systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction < 50, family history of mitral valve prolapse related sudden cardiac death.

Athletes can participate in low-intensity competitive sports with the above-mentioned conditions.
