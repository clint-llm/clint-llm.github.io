The blood supply to the prefrontal association cortex comes from the anterior circulation of the brain. The anterior circulation of the brain forms from the internal carotid artery and its branches, the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA). While the ACA supplies the middle and superior part of the prefrontal association cortex, the MCA supplies the lateral and anterior portions. The basal surface of the frontal lobe, the superior portion of the frontal gyrus, and a major portion of precentral, central, and postcentral gyrus receive vascular supply from the cortical branches of the callosomarginal (a branch of the ACA) and distal peri-callosal artery. A superficial cerebral vein is the main vein drainage of the PFC, which then drains into the superior and inferior sagittal sinuses. Recent studies show that meningeal lymphatic vessels function as the lymphatic drainage of the brain.
