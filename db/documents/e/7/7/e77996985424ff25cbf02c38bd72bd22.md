Dupuytren disease starts as a palpable nodule in the palm, usually at the distal palmar crease. The nodules enlargeÂ into cords and early in the disease, patients may present with just palpable cords along the palm. As the cords thicken and shorten, they cause fixed flexion contractures of the fingers at the MCP and PIP joints. At this stage, patients typically present with loss of range of motion of the hand and palpable cords in the palm extending into the affected digits. Nodules, cords, and finger contractures are pathognomic of Dupuytren disease. Rarely patients report pain.

The 4th digit is most often affected, followed by the 5th digit. Even when the disorder is bilateral, the severity may not be symmetrical. In most cases, palpation of the nodules does not elicit pain unless the ulnar nerve is compressed. Further, the nodules may become tender in the presence of tenosynovitis.

Physical findings:

- Blanching of the skin when the finger is extended

- Proximal to the nodules, the cords are painless

- Pits and grooves may be present

- The knuckle pads over the PIP joints may be tender

- If the plantar fascia is involved, this indicates more severe disease (Ledderhose disease)

- The tabletop test (Hueston) is performed by having the patient attempt to place the palm flat on the exam table. If there is any flexion contracture deformity, the patient will be unable to straighten the fingers, resulting in a positive test.
