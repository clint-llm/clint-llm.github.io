The majority of encephaloceles are congenital. Some cases are acquired secondary to tumors, trauma, or iatrogenic injury. One of the most accepted theories for the origin of a congenital encephalocele is the incomplete separation of the surface ectoderm from the neuroectoderm after the closure of the neural folds. The cranial neuropore usually closes on day 25 of embryogenesis. A problem before this day will produce an incomplete closure with a defect not covered by skin.

Genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the development of an encephalocele.
