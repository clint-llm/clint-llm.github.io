**Medical Treatment**

- GUTB, in general, is treated like pulmonary TB with a four-drug regimen for six months (rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, then isoniazid and rifampicin for four months).

- Patients that may need longer treatment include patients with HIV co-infection, kidney abscesses, or bone infiltration.

- Patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) require treatment with MDR-TB regimens that include fluoroquinolones, bedaquiline, delaminid, aminoglycosides, etc., and the regimen may extend up to 18 to 24 months.

**Surgical Treatment**

- Patients with GUTB complicated with ureteral stricture and hydronephrosis should be treated with early stenting or percutaneous nephrostomy.

- Nephrectomy is considered in patients with non-functioning kidneys, patients with co-existing renal cell carcinomas, and those with extensive disease involving the whole kidney.
