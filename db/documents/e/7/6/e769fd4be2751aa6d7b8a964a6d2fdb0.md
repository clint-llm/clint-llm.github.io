Radiotracers have a very high safety profile because the active component used to target the specific biological process is present in trace amounts. Complications can be related to the intravenous cannulation process. The radiopharmaceutical injection rarely may cause a rash or swell at the injection site in case of extravasation. Very rarely, headaches and nausea have been reported. Additionally, complications/adverse events related to medication injected as a part of the procedure may be encountered, such as acetazolamide, dobutamine, adenosine, captopril, furosemide,Â and others.
