Contraindications to taking pimavanserin include hypersensitivity to pimavanserin or any of its constituents. Other contraindications or cautions include:

- Uncorrected electrolyte abnormalities

- QT prolongation or a family history of QT prolongation, including congenital long QT syndrome

- A history of torsades des pointes

- Ventricular arrhythmias

- Recent history of myocardial infarct

- Bradycardia

- Congestive heart failure

Caution is also recommended in the elderly, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESDRD) or a CrCl below 30, and patients with psychosis related to dementia.

There is presently no human data regarding the use of pimavanserin in pregnancy; clinicians need to weigh the risk vs. benefit in this patient population; animal studies showed no teratogenicity at ten times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Similarly, clinicians should weigh the risk vs. benefit in breastfeeding patients; there is no data available to assess the drug's effect on milk production or the risk of infant harm.

Contraindicated drug interactions include concomitant use with pimozide or thioridazine. As already discussed, caution and dosing adjustments may be necessary with potent CYP450 inducers and inhibitors.
