**Grade 1 Injury (Mild)**

The patients may feel a sharp pain at the time of injury or pain with activity. They are usually able to continue the activity. There may be no or minimal loss of strength and range of motion. One MRI study exposes bright signals on fluid-sensitive sequences with less than 5% feathery appearance of muscle fiber involved. Pathologically, grade 1 injury indicatesÂ less than 10% of muscle fibers disrupted.

**Grade 2 Injury (Moderate)**

The patient cannot walk at the moment of injury. The patient may complain of weakness during ankle dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. One MRI study concedes the change in myotendinous junction as edema or hemorrhage. Grade 2 injury implies 10% to 50% disruption of muscle fibers.

**Grade 3 Injury (Severe)**

There may be a palpable defect on the affected calf. The MRI findings include complete disruption of the continuity of muscle, wavy tendon morphology and retraction, and extensive hemorrhage or edema. Dixon et al. suggested that grade 3 injury indicates 50% to 100% disruption of muscle fibers.
