Anoscopy is a bedside procedure that is inexpensive and can be performed quickly without bowel preparation or sedation. With this method, the examiner can visualize the internal portions of the anal sphincter and the distal rectum. Prospective studies suggest that anoscopy has a higher sensitivity for anorectal lesions such as internal hemorrhoids, proctitis, lacerations, fistulas, ulcers and masses than flexible sigmoidoscopy. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques for anoscopy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with anorectal pathology.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technique involved in performing anoscopy.
- Describe the indications for anoscopy.
- Review the contraindications to anoscopy.
- Explain a structured, interprofessional team approach to alleviate discomfort and provide effective care and appropriate surveillance for patients undergoing anoscopy.
