Patients may present with different signs or symptoms when PCA restricts the blood supply of multiple brain regions (the occipital lobe, the inferomedial temporal lobe, a large portion of the thalamus, and the upper brainstem and midbrain). Signs and symptoms may change in a patient with PCA syndrome based upon the location and severity of the occlusion,

- If there is a deep/proximal occlusion, ischemia may be in the thalamus and/or midbrain, as well as in the cortex.

- If there is a well-developed PCOM for collateral flow, proximal occlusion may not produce significant infarction.

- If there is a superficial/distal occlusion of PCA, ischemia may be in only cortical structures.

- If there is well-developed collateral flow in a chronic intracranial atherosclerosis process, the thrombotic occlusion may not produce whole-territory infarction. Cardioembolic may produce significant infarct due to a lack of collateral flow in the acute process.

It is essential to understand the mechanism of stroke. Acute and chronic management, preventive measures can be instituted.

- Atherothrombosis can cause an artery-artery embolism, complete branch, or in situ occlusion and hemodynamic instability.

- Small artery disease includes lipohylinosis and hyaline arteriolosclerosis of small arteries. It is likely due to hypertension, diabetes, and aging.

Symptoms associated with PCA strokes like diplopia, visual field defects, dysphagia, vertigo, alteration in consciousness, memory impairment, or difficulty reading may help us to understand the localization of stroke.

**Visual Field Defects**

- PCA and deep branches of MCA supply the optic radiations. The lower part of the optic radiations receives blood supply from the PCA. The upper part gets blood supply from the MCA.

- Unilateral infarctions of the occipital lobe may cause contralateral homonymous hemianopia with macular sparing.

- Quadrantanopia may be seen if the defect is limited. If there is an infarction in the temporal lobe involving the Meyer loop or infracalcarine, it may present with superior quadrantanopia. Inferior quadrantanopoia is caused by infarctions in the optic radiation of the inferior parietal lobe or supracalcarine. In a study with pure superficial PCA strokes in 117 patients, 26 (22%) presented with quadrantanopia. Twenty (17%) is superior.

- Visual field defects (hemianopia, quadrantanopia, sectoranopia), hemisensory deficit, and neuropsychological dysfunction (transcortical aphasia, memory disturbances) may be seen after occlusion of the posterior choroidal artery.

- Bilateral infarction of the occipital lobes may cause cortical blindness. The patient may have visual anosognosia.

**Visual Dysfunction**

- Visual Agnosia: Patients may not understand or describe uses for the objects seen. Patients can name objects when they touch them or when the objects are described to them. The two forms of visual agnosia are apperceptive and associative. Apperceptive involves poor perception and ability to understand while associative involves a poor ability to match and use. It is caused by a large left PCA stroke, which likely causes a disconnect between language and visual systems.

- Prosopagnosia is difficulty recognizing familiar faces due to lesions in the inferior occipital areas, fusiform gyrus, and the anterior temporal cortex.

- Alexia refers to difficulty in reading. Alexia without agraphia (pure alexia) is caused by a lesion to the dominant occipital lobe and splenium of the corpus callosum and is often accompanied by right homonymous hemianopia.

- Achromatopsia refers to difficulty perceiving colors. It is due to infarctions in the ventral occipital cortex and/or infracalcarine. The patient may present with hemiachromatopsia if the infarction is unilateral.

**Cognitive and Behavioral Dysfunction**

- Aphasia can be due to an infarction large enough to cover the left parietal lobe or temporal lobe. Transcortical sensory aphasia is caused by infarctions to the parietal-occipital region on the left side. The patient may have amnestic aphasia (inability to name but repetition and comprehension intact) due to infarction to the left temporal lobe of PCA territory.

- Memory impairment is caused by infarction of the hippocampus and parahippocampus.

- Aggressive behavior can be caused by PCA strokes as well. In a study 41 PCA stroke patients, 3 (7.3%) patients showed aggressive behavior such as shouting obscenities and hitting and bitting others.

- Hallucinations are uncommon but may develop from PCA strokes to any side of the brain.

- Palinopsia refers to seeing images persist even after an image has been removed. Infarctions can be in the lingual and fusiform gyri.

**Other Dysfunctions**

- Midbrain infarction may present differently, depending on the location of infarction. Patients may present with ataxic hemiparesis due to an anterolateral midbrain infarction or oculomotor or pupillary problems due to a paramedian rostral midbrain infarction.

- Pure sensory stroke may result from a lesion in the ventral posterolateral nucleus, which receives the blood supply from thalamogeniculate (inferolateral) arteries.

- Infractions to the artery of Percheron infarction can result in bilateral paramedian thalamus infarction with or without midbrain involvement. Patients may present with confusion, hypersomnolence, dysarthria, amnesia, and ocular movement disorders.

- Balint syndrome is caused by infarctions to the bilateral occipitoparietal border. This presents with optic ataxia (inability to reach targets one is looking at), oculomotor apraxia (inability to intentionally move eyes towards an object), and simultagnosia (inability to synthesize objects within a visual field).

- Anton syndrome is due to a sudden onset of bilateral occipital strokes leading to cortical blindness. The patient will deny the blindness.
