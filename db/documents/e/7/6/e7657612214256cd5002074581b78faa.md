If the area to undergo fine-needle aspiration is superficial and palpable, then once the area is sterilized, simply inserting the needle into the lesion while gently aspirating is all that is necessary. If the lesion is not palpable, then ultrasound guidance should ensure an appropriate sample is taken. Even if the lesion is palpable, ultrasound can be useful to guide the needle. CT-guided fine-needle aspiration may be performed similarly except under CT guidance.

If the fine-needle aspiration is to be performed via endoscopy or bronchoscopy, the lesion may be aspirated through direct visualization or with the addition of ultrasound guidance. If the lesion is not visible, for example, if a paratracheal lymph node needs to be sampled, then an ultrasound will be necessary. This requires a specialized scope with an ultrasound probe attached as well as a device on the tip of the scope to deploy the needle. Still, the ultimate technique is the same: inserting the needle into the area under investigation while aspirating.
