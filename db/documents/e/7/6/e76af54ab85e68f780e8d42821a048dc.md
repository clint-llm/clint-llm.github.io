Incisional hernia refers to abdominal wall hernia at the site of a previous surgical incision. It is a type of ventral hernia. Midline incisional hernias are more common than other sites. It can be a definite hernia with all the hernia components of the defect, sac, and content. Or, it can be a weakness of the wall with shallow sac and occasional bulge of content. It is a common surgical problem. Surgeons are often asked to evaluate patients with incisional hernias as they can often be symptomatic to patients. The classical presentation is a bulge with a positive cough impulse at the site of the incision. Complicated incisional. Patients with incisional hernias are also at risk for incarceration, obstruction (if the content is bowel), or strangulation.
