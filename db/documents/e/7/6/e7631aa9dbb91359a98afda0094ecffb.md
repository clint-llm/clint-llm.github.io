Other conditions may cause changes of the skin clinically close to those observed during scleroderma. The differential diagnosis includes:

- Scleredema (scleredema diabeticorum and scleredema of Buschke) is characterized by skin thickening, affecting the neck, upper back, shoulders, and trunk. Raynaud phenomenon and internal organ involvement are absent.

- Eosinophilic fasciitis, often occurring following an unusual effort and characterized by edematous diffuse infiltration of the forearms and legs. It leads to the adherence of the skin to underlying fascia, usually sparing the hands and feet. Raynaud phenomenon is absent.

- Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which is a form of eosinophilia that is caused by L-tryptophan.Graft-versus-host disease, an autoimmune pathology that occurs as a result of bone marrow transplants in which the immune cells from the transplanted bone marrow attack the host's body.

- Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, which is usually caused by kidney failure. Skin changes may be indistinguishable from scleroderma, but Raynaud phenomenon is typically absent. May have internal organ fibrosis.
