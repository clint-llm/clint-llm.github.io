Data regarding the prevalence and incidence of cutaneous leiomyomas is limited. PiloleiomyomasÂ tend to occur much more frequently in adults than children, all races seem to be equally affected, and there is no increase in incidence between males or females. As previously mentioned, angioleiomyomas are thought to be the most common variant, followed by piloleiomyomas, then genital leiomyomas.
