The anesthesiologist plays an important role regardless of the type of anesthesia provided, whether the patient is awake or under general. Their assistance during such procedures could often serve as a challenge, as the bed may be turned 180-degrees away from the ventilator, resulting in the airway being the furthest possible distance from the anesthesiologist. Clear, respectful communication should any issues arise is imperative to a successful operation, mainly when operating in the head and neck region.

While performing middle ear surgery, the surgeon may find it essential to monitor facial nerve functioning. Considering the tympanic segment of the facial nerve crosses immediately superior to the stapes in its boney canal, active monitoring will alert the surgeon of their proximity to the nerve. Nerve monitoring may help to identify a dehiscent facial nerve.

Skilled post-anesthesia care unit nurses are invaluable in the immediate postoperative period, as stapedectomy patients may experience pain, vertigo with nausea and vomiting (the latter posing a risk to prosthesis dislodgement), and facial nerve weakness. These nurses play a crucial role in notifying the surgeon of any early-onset complications associated with the procedure.
