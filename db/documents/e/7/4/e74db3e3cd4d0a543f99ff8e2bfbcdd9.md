# Introduction

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth common cause of cancer death, and its 5-year survival rate is only about 12% despite the advancement in medical care, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and molecular biology. The pancreatoduodenectomy, also known as the Whipple procedure,  is the surgical procedure of choice for the resectable and the borderline resectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas.

Historically, the first pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed by Dr. Alessandro Codivilla, an Italian surgeon, in 1898 and was later modified by Dr. Walter Kausch in 1912. The surgery was then performed as a two-stage procedure, and Dr. Allen Whipple further improved it into a one-stage Whipple procedure in 1940.

Broadly, there are two types of pancreatoduodenectomies; the more extensive "classical Whipple (CW)" and the "pylorus sparing pancreatoduodenectomy (PSD)."

Moreover, the pancreaticoduodenectomy can be performed using the laparoscopic, as well as the open approach.

This article describes in detail the surgical anatomy, indications, contraindications, technical steps in the pancreaticoduodenectomy, and its clinical significance.

# Anatomy and Physiology

The pancreas is a retroperitoneal organ and located within the C-loop of the duodenum. It is divided into the head, uncinate process, neck, body, and tail. The head and the uncinate process are supplied by superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries, which are branches from the gastroduodenal artery and middle colic artery. The neck, body, and tail of the pancreas receive blood supply from the splenic artery through the dorsal pancreatic artery, greater pancreatic artery, and transverse pancreatic artery. The head of the pancreas is primarily drained by the four pancreaticoduodenal veins, whereas they drain into the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or portal vein (PV). The neck, body, and tail of the pancreas have venous drainage into the splenic vein. The main duct of the pancreas (Wirsung) begins in the tail, runs the entire length of the pancreas, and opens into the second part of the duodenum together with the bile duct on the major duodenal papilla.

There are several critical anatomical considerations in pancreatic surgery. The pancreas shares the same blood supply with the C-loop of the duodenum, necessitating the removal of the C-loop of the duodenum together with the pancreas.  The uncinate process which arises from the lower part of the head of the pancreas extends superiorly and posteriorly behind the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) is recognized as essential surgical anatomy.

Variation in vascular anatomy in this region is uncommon compared to biliary variation; however, there is some relevant variation that needs to be borne in mind. Replaced right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery occurs around 12% of the population.

The neck of the pancreas lies behind the portal vein confluence and is also the origin of the superior mesenteric artery(SMA). SMV located to the right of SMA; thus, SMV is the first vascular structure that one will encounter in the duodenal curvature.  In the Cattell-Braasch maneuver, where the right-sided viscera is rotated to the left, the critical structure is inferior vena cava(IVC) and abdominal aorta. The left renal vein crossing across the aorta to drain into IVC is a crucial anatomical observation. The tortuous splenic artery runs along the superior border of the pancreas. The splenic vein runs posteriorly to the body of the pancreas.

# Contraindications

The contraindication for the procedure depends on the presence of variable factors. To better understand the contraindications, it is equally important to understand the resectability criteria. Classically, the three grades of resectability are defined for localized pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma as resectable, borderline resectable, and unresectable.

**A- Localized and Resectable**

No distant metastasis, no radiographic evidence of portal vein (PV) or superior mesenteric vein (SMV) distortion, clear dissection planes around the celiac axis, hepatic artery, and superior mesenteric artery (SMA)

**B- Borderline Resectable**

SMV-PV involvement with distortion, narrowing, occlusion, but the presence of suitable proximal and distal vessels for reconstruction. Gastroduodenal artery encasement up to the hepatic artery with short segment encasement or abutment of the hepatic artery without extending to the celiac axis. Tumor abutment of superior mesenteric artery not extending more than 180 degrees of the vessel wall circumference.

**C- Unresectable for Cancer of the Head (Contraindication of the Procedure)**

- Distance metastasis

- Tumour encasement of SMA more than 180 degrees

- Celiac abutment

- IVC involvement

- Aortic involvement

- Irreparable SMV or PV occlusion.

# Preparation

- Intravenous antibiotics should be given prior to skin incision.

- Octreotide administration depends on surgeon preference.

- Colonic bowel preparation is not necessary unless colonic resection is planned.

- Vascular surgeons should be consulted earlier and alerted in case of potential vascular resection and reconstruction.

# Technique or Treatment

Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is performed using vertical midline incision or with a bilateral subcostal incision. A self-retaining retractor is applied. The first step of pancreaticoduodenectomy is a thorough assessment of the extent of disease to determine the resectability. Staging laparoscopy is currently widely used to determine the resectability, and it either could be done as a separate procedure or performed together with PD. The entire liver is assessed and palpated for the possible presence of metastases. Any suspicious findings on the liver but indeterminate on palpation could be evaluated by intraoperative ultrasound. The parietal and visceral peritoneal surfaces, the ligament of Treitz, the omentum, and the entire small and large intestine are examined for the presence of metastasis. The celiac axis is inspected for lymph node involvement. Any suspicious looking lymph nodes outside the planned field of dissection are sent for frozen section. PD is not performed if the biopsy is positive for metastatic cancer. The porta hepatis is inspected by mobilizing the gallbladder and dissecting the cystic duct down to the junction of the common hepatic and common bile duct. The proper hepatic artery and common hepatic artery are assessed for any presence of tumor tissue.

Kocher maneuver is performed by elevating the duodenum and head of the pancreas out of the retroperitoneum. Cattell-Braasch maneuver (extensive mobilization of the entire right colon and small bowel mesentery) is usually not necessary except for mobilization and resection of SMV or if the tumor extends into the 4th part of duodenum.

The gallbladder dissected from the liver, and the distal common hepatic duct is divided close to the level of the cystic duct entry site. The proximal bile duct is left without a clamp to avoid crush injury, and the distal bile duct is clamped or sutured to prevent the spillage of the bile and tumor cells. The bile duct is retracted caudally, and portal dissection continued at the anterior aspect of the portal vein. During these maneuvers, the portal structures should be assessed for a replaced right hepatic artery and should be protected. If the patient appears to have an accessory right hepatic artery and a significant native right hepatic artery, the accessory vessel can often be taken without consequence. The gastroduodenal artery is ligated to minimize the chance of erosion and bleeding. The division of the gastroduodenal artery also helps to expose the anterior surface of the portal vein and facilitates the dissection of the portal vein behind the pancreatic neck. The surgeon identifies the portal vein above the neck of the pancreas and SMV inferior to the neck of the pancreas. Blunt dissection downwards along the portal vein is aimed to create a plane in front of the portal vein and behind the neck of the pancreas. This plane is crucial in the surgery, and if one is unable to create a clear plane between the portal vein and the neck of the pancreas, the surgery should be aborted.

Extensive Kocher maneuver should reveal the SMV inferior to the neck of the pancreas. The superior mesenteric vein runs anterior to the third part of the duodenum and surrounded by adipose tissue as it receives tributaries from the uncinate process and neck of the pancreas, the greater curve of the stomach, and from the transverse mesocolon. Two ways of identifying the superior mesenteric vein are by following the middle colic veins to their juncture with the superior mesenteric vein or by tracing the course of the right gastroepiploic vein to the point at which it meets the superior mesenteric vein immediately below the inferior border of the pancreas. The plane anterior to the superior mesenteric vein is created under direct vision, and the splenic vein is preserved. The junction between the PV and SMV should be clearly visualized.

The vascular resection is performed if necessary. The segmental resection of the portal vein or superior mesenteric vein is usually done with the help of vascular surgeons. The vascular defect can be closed with primary repair, patch closure, or using an autologous graft (internal jugular vein, left renal vein, splenic vein, or greater saphenous vein) or with a synthetic graft (PTFE). The reconstructed portal vein should be followed up regularly postoperative for the risk of portal vein thrombosis.

For the Whipple procedure, antrectomy is performed by dividing the right gastric and right gastroepiploic arteries and dividing the antrum with a linear stapler. The pylorus is preserved in a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy in which the proximal GI tract is divided 2 to 3 cm distal to the pylorus with a linear stapling device. The jejunum is divided between 15 to 20 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz and brought in dorsal to the superior mesenteric vessels from the left to the right side. A Penrose drain is looped under the neck of the pancreas in the created tunnel to elevate the neck of the pancreas and protect the underlying portal vein. The pancreatic neck is then divided using electrocautery after confirming a free plane anterior to the portal and superior mesenteric veins. Stay sutures are placed superiorly and inferiorly on the pancreatic remnant to reduce bleeding from the segmental pancreatic arteries running in those locations.

The specimen remains only connected by the uncinate process of the pancreas. It is separated from the portal vein, superior mesenteric vein, and superior mesenteric artery. This is performed by serially clamping, dividing, and tying the smaller branches off the portal and superior mesenteric vessels. The specimen is removed en-bloc with the pancreatic neck margin, uncinate margin, and common hepatic duct margins are marked for the pathologists. The common hepatic duct margin and the pancreatic neck margin are essential and may be sent earlier for frozen section analysis to determine the extent of further resection. After the removal of the specimen, metal clips are placed at the margins of the resection field to target postoperative radiation therapy. There are various methods available for reconstruction after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Standard reconstruction involves the pancreatic anastomosis (PA) first, followed by the bile duct, and finally, the duodenum to establish the GI continuity.

PA is the most critical step in pancreaticoduodenectomy and meticulous care given during this procedure to reduce morbidity. Either jejunum or stomach can be used for the reconstruction of the pancreatic anastomosis. There are two ways of constructing PA: duct to mucosa anastomosis or invagination technique. For the pancreaticojejunostomy, the duct to mucosa anastomosis is constructed between the end of the pancreatic duct remnant and side of jejunum in a retrocolic fashion. For the invagination technique, the pancreatic duct is junked into the jejunum. The techniques of pancreaticojejunostomy are diverse such as modified Blumgart, modified Kakita, binding pancreaticojejunostomy anastomosis, and so one. The variety of these techniques help to improve the rate of pancreatic fistula formation, but there is no single superior technique.

After the reconstruction is completed, closed suction drains are placed at Morrison pouch and in the vicinity of the pancreatic and biliary anastomosis. A feeding jejunostomy is usually not needed and depends on the surgeon’s preference. The postoperative management includes keeping the patient with nothing by mouth for day 1 and advancing with clear liquids and then gradually to a low-fat diet in frequent small feeds. The stomach is decompressed overnight after surgery with a nasogastric tube, which is usually removed the next morning if there is no high output. The drains are removed gradually once the output is minimal, there is no evidence of pancreatic fistula, and the patient is tolerating a normal diet.

# Complications

- Delayed gastric emptying, defined as the inability to discontinue nasogastric tube and inability to tolerate a solid diet after the surgery

- Pancreatic fistula, defined as drain output on postoperative day 3 or beyond with an amylase content that is more than three times the upper limit of serum amylase.

- Postpancreatectomy hemorrhage

- Wound infection

- Intra-abdominal abscess

# Clinical Significance

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth common cause of cancer death, and its 5-year survival rate is only about 12 percent despite the advancement in medical care, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and molecular biology.

The morbidity and mortality associated with pancreaticoduodenectomy and its complications are high. Due to the high morbidity associated with this procedure, a more vigilant postoperative care becomes imperative. High suspicion and early detection of the postoperative complication is the critical factor in the care of the patient. Physicians, nurses, and the entire team should be adequately educated, and the organized team approach for patient care must be implemented.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

The involvement of an interprofessional team in the management of cancer patients is of the essence, and pancreatic cancer is no exception. The success of pancreaticoduodenectomy depends on a meticulous selection of surgical patients for resectability using a CT of the abdomen with the pancreas protocol. The nurses, physiotherapists, counselors, oncologists play a crucial role in delivering optimum care to the cancer patient.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Dietary assessment and artificial enzyme replacement therapy should be the standard of care in surgical patients. If left untreated exocrine insufficiency results in severe nutritional deficit. Whenever possible, enteral nutrition is preferred over parenteral. Patients should be monitored to assess pancreatic insufficiency, either endocrine or exocrine. Fecal elastase-1 is a rapid test to detect exocrine insufficiency but it has a low sensitivity and specificity.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Monitoring

Nurse care is directed to the proper assessment of weight, general pain, and symptoms, vital signs. The patient must be monitored for weight loss, liquid balance, nausea, fecal, and urine color. Due to the forced loss of pancreatic enzymes, it is crucial to evaluate the presence of fatty stools to ensure proper adjustment of lipidic intake together. A medical-nursing team should ensure a proper evaluation of dietary balance before and after surgical treatment.
