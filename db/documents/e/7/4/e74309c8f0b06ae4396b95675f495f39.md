Paragangliomas are benign tumors, and a small percentage may become malignant and metastasize; hence, early identification leading to complete surgical resection is usually curative and the key to a favorable prognosis. The metastases are the only true way to assess the biological aggressiveness of paragangliomas. This activity stresses the early diagnosis, staging, and interprofessional team coordination with an endocrinologist and a surgeon, which is of utmost importance in the management of this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of paraganglioma. 
- Review the latest guidelines for the accurate diagnosis of paraganglioma using patient history.
- Summarize the treatment and management options for paraganglioma. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team that can enhance patient care of the patients presenting with the diagnosis of paraganglioma.
