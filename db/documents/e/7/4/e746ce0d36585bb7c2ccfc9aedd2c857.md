The International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) based on surgical resection is used to stage neuroblastomas in the United States.

Stage 1:

- A localized lesion with complete gross excision. There may be microscopic residual disease

- Ipsilateral lymph nodes are negative for cancer

Stage 2:

- Localized tumor with obvious gross tumor not completely excised

- Ipsilateral lymph nodes are negative for cancer

Stage 2B

- Localized tumor with complete gross excision but ipsilateral lymph nodes are positive for tumor

- Enlarged contralateral lymph nodes are negative for cancer

Stage 3:

- Unresectable cancer that has crossed the midline, there is regional lymph node involvement

- A localized unilateral lesion with positive contralateral lymph nodes

Stage 4: Any primary lesion that has spread to distant lymph nodes, liver, bone marrow or skin

Stage 4s:

- Localized primary tumor with spread limited to liver, skin or bone marrow

- Limited to infants

**Subgroup Classification**

The widespread variability in neuroblastoma tumor behavior is linked to multiple factors now linked with patient prognosis. Classic prognostic categorization by Children’s Oncology Group (COG) divides patients into four groups based on patient age, post-surgical stage, MYCN amplification, histology, and DNA ploidy

- Low risk: localized tumor only, greater than 90% survival

- Intermediate risk: localized tumor with regional extension and/or metastases to bone and bone marrow, 90% to 95% survival

- High risk: widely disseminated disease (excluding infants), 40% to 50% survival

- Tumor stage 4S: widely disseminated disease in infants, greater than 90% survival due to spontaneous regression of the tumor.

However, COG classification of neuroblastoma has differed from the European SIOPEN and other cooperative groups. In 2004, the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG), a task force of pediatric neuroblastoma experts worldwide, met with the primary aim of developing a consensus approach to neuroblastoma risk stratification pre-treatment.

- Very low risk: five-year event-free survival (EFS) greater than 85%

- Low risk: five-year EFS 75% to 85%

- Intermediate risk: five-year EFS 50% to 75%

- High risk: five-year EFS less than 50%

Over 50% of newly diagnosed neuroblastoma are very-low or low-risk.
