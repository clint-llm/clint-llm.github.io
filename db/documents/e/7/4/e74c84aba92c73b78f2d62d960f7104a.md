Since fetal CO2 gets carried by the umbilical arteries, the expectation is that arterial cord blood gas will be slightly more acidotic than venous cord blood gas. Studies showed that in term infants with uncomplicated delivery, the mean cord arterial pH is 7.24 to 7.27, and the mean cord venous pH 7.32 to 7.34.

Maternal respirations on room air yielded mean cord venous pO2 of 43.5 mmHg and mean cord arterial pO2 of 31.5 mmHg.

Apart from measuring pH, pCO2, and pO2, blood gas analyzers also calculate base excess. In a term newborn with uncomplicated delivery, cord arterial base excess varies from -5.6 to -2.7 meq/L and cord venous base excess from -4.5 to -2.4 meq/L.

Lactic acid is the final product of anaerobic metabolism that does not cross the placenta. It can give accurate information about the fetal metabolic condition, and its measurement is as helpful as cord arterial pH in predicting poor neonatal outcomes.
