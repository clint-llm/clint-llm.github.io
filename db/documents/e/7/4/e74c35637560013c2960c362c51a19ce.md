Bombesin binds to the G-protein receptor. G protein-coupled reaction occurs, which activates a phosphorylation cascade. Phosphorylation cascade cleaves PIP2. PIP2 separates into inosine-monophosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). IP3 and DAG both increase in concentration within the cell. DAG interacts with protein kinase C (PKC). DAG-PKC interaction activates protein kinase C (aPKC). aPKC phosphorylates serine residues on intracellular target proteins.
