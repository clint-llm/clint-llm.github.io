**Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis**

- The anterior pituitary produces ACTH. It is considered a tropic hormone. Tropic hormones indirectly affect target cells by first stimulating other endocrine glands. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is released from the hypothalamus, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then acts on its target organ, the adrenal cortex.

**Adrenal Cortex**

- The adrenal cortex secretes glucocorticoids from the zona fasciculata and androgens from the zona reticularis.  The secretion of glucocorticoids provides a negative feedback loop for inhibiting the release of CRH and ACTH from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, respectively. Stress stimulates the release of ACTH.

**Memory Tool For Secretory products of Adrenal Cortex**

- “The deeper you go, the sweeter you get.”

- Glomerolusa: salt (mineralocorticoids)

- Fasciculata: sugar (cortisol)

- Retcularis: sex (androgens)
