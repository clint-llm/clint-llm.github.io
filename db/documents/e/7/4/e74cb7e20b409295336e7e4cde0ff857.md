In the clinical setting, the anatomy of the veins is essential for procedures that involve puncturing the veins. These procedures can range from simple venous blood sampling to intravenous catheterization. The median cubital vein is a common site for venous blood sampling. The biceps aponeurosis protects the median cubital vein; it protects the vein and prevents the formation of hematomas.

The presentation of the veins may also be used as clinical clues when treating patients. In rare cases, there could be unilateral or bilateral dilation of the veins in the upper extremities. The dilation in the upper extremities can be due to venous insufficiency or a blockage of the subclavian vein, brachiocephalic vein, or the superior vena cava.
