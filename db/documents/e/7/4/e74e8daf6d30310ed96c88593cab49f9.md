A standard rhytidectomy instrument set should include, at a minimum:

- Facelift scissors, such as Gorney-Freeman, Kaye, Goldman-Fox, and Casta√±ares scissors

- Suture scissors, such as Mayo and iris or tenotomy scissors

- Needle drivers, such as Halsey or Webster; Haney needle drivers may be useful for platysmaplasty, and some surgeons prefer Castroviejo needle drivers for fine suturing

- Forceps, such as Adson-Brown, DeBakey, Gerald, or fine Castroviejo forceps

- #15 blade scalpel and #3 handle

- Ferreira facelift or breast retractor, with or without a light carrier

- Headlight if there is no light carrier on the retractor

- Joseph or Freeman skin hooks

- Suction

- Bipolar and/or monopolar electrocautery

Sutures may include:

- 2-0 polydioxanone, braided polyester, or polyglactin for suspension of the SMAS and platysma

- 4-0 or 5-0 polyglactin or poliglecaprone for deep dermal closure

- 5-0 or 6-0 polypropylene, nylon, or gut for skin closure

- Staples for the portion of the postauricular incision within the hairline

Some surgeons may place drains and a pressure dressing with ice packs; others may avoid drains and consider using a fibrin tissue sealant to reduce dead space under the facial flaps. If other procedures, such as blepharoplasty, brow lift, fat transfer, or laser resurfacing, are to be undertaken during the same anesthetic, additional equipment will be required.
