**What is transient tachypnea of the newborn?**

Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is a condition that causes breathing problems in newborn babies. Babies have fluid in their lungs before birth. The fluid normally goes away when a baby is born. In some babies, the fluid does not go away as quickly as it should. This causes TTN.

A mother who has diabetes, asthma, or a C-section without labor is more likely to have a baby with TTN.

**What are the symptoms of TTN?**

- Fast breathing of more than 60 breaths a minute

- Hard breathing: Nostrils that open wide when the baby takes a breath, skin, and muscles that look like they are caving in; grunting

**How is TTN treated?**

TTN usually goes away by the time a baby is 3 days old. Until that happens, doctors can help the baby get enough oxygen and nutrition if he or she needs it. Treatments might include:

- Extra oxygen

- An intravenous (IV) feeding tube

- Antibiotics
