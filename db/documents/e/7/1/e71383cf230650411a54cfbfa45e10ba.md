Upon determination of the poor quality of sleep, further evaluation is needed to determine potential causes of sleep loss. There will generally be more than one cause contributing to the loss of sleep. It is better to treat the causes directly. If obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a cause of quality sleep loss, it is best to address this with CPAP and/or weight loss. Ignoring the contribution of OSA to the sleep disturbance and prescribing sedating sleep aids could worsen the OSA and quality of sleep. It is also important to identify the symptoms the patient may be experiencing from sleep loss. The symptoms the patient suffers from should be monitored to assess treatment progress. The most common symptom of sleep loss is excessive daytime sleepiness. Also, patients can display depressed mood, poor focus, and impaired memory. Lack of sleep can also exacerbate psychiatric and medical conditions such as OSA, obesity, hypertension, depression, anxiety, etc. Lack of sleep will impair executive functions.
