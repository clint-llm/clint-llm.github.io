Blood supply to the intrinsic hand muscles comes from the ulnar and radial arteries and their anastomotic branches and collateral circulation. The ulnar and radial arteries cross the wrist to enter the hand and send vessels deep and superficially, forming two anastomoses called the superficial and deep palmar arches. The ulnar artery contributes to the majority blood supply of the superficial palmar arch, while the radial artery contributes to the majority of the deep palmar arch.Â Arising from the superficial palmar arch, are distal branches called the common and proper palmar digital arteries.

The thenar muscle is supplied primarily by the superficial palmar arch. The hypothenar muscle is supplied primarily by the ulnar artery.

Lymphatic drainage of the upper limb and hand drain into the superficial and deep lymphatic systems. The superficial system drains the skin of the palm and dorsal hand via the lymphatic plexuses along the cephalic and basilic veins towards the axillary and cubital lymph nodes. The deep system drains the skeletal muscle of the hand via the lymphatic plexuses along the deep veins and terminates in the humeral lymph nodes.
