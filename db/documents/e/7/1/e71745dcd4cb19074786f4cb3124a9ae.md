Optimal screening and diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia are paramount in the prevention of premature cardiovascular events. Management of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia requires an interprofessional approach, including primary care providers, cardiologists, endocrinologists, lipid specialists, dietitians, pharmacists, and nursing care, to improve outcomes. An extensive discussion of treatment strategies should be done at diagnosis. A close follow-up to observe the response to treatment and development of side effects from lipid-lowering agents is essential in optimizing care.
