Myelopathy, or neurologic deficit(s) due to disease of the spinal cord, most commonly results from degenerative changes (spondylosis) involving the intervertebral/uncovertebral discs, facet joints, or vertebral bodies resulting in spinal stenosis in the cervical or lumbosacral spine. Cervical spondylosis is the most common cause of myelopathy in adults above the age of 55, and the incidence of myelopathy with this condition is approximately 5% to 10%.

Metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) develops in 2.5% to 5% of patients dying as a result of cancer, with significant variation by primary tumor type.

Although uncommon, the incidence of spinal epidural abscess (SEA) has increased over the past several decades. A recent study showed an incidence of 5.1 cases per 10,000 admissions at a large U.S. academic hospital.

Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma (SSEH) remains rare, with a reported incidence of 0.1 per 100,000 and 600 reported cases in the medical literature,Â with an age predilection for the 4 and 5 decades of life.
