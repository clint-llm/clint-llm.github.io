Unlike with many other otologic procedures, a patient undergoing a labyrinthectomy is expected to be admitted as an inpatient after surgery. The admission typically revolves around control of the expected postoperative vertigo. Patients who experience a sudden ablation of vestibular function will experience severe vertigo along with nausea and possible vomiting for 48-72 hours after the procedure. During this time, the surgeon will need to work with skilled nursing to control symptoms with medication as well as to ensure proper hydration of the patient. During admission, a referral can be made to physical therapy to begin the process of vestibular rehabilitation and lower extremity conditioning.
