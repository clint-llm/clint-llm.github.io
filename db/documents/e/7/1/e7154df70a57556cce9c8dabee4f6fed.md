Acute tubular necrosis is precipitated by an acute ischemic or toxic event or sepsis.

**Ischemic-Induced Acute Tubular Necrosis**

Prerenal azotemia and ischemic acute tubular necrosis have the same spectrum of causes. Any factor that leads to prerenal azotemia can lead to ischemic acute tubular necrosis. Some common causes include hypovolemic states such as diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding, dehydration, burns, renal losses via diuretics or osmotic diuresis, and third fluid sequestration. Edematous states such as heart failure and cirrhosis cause reduced kidney perfusion. Sepsis or anaphylaxis leads to systemic vasodilation. Coagulopathy, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, can also cause acute tubular necrosis.

**Nephrotoxic-Induced Acute Tubular Necrosis**

The kidney clears and metabolizes many drugs. Some of these drugs behave as exogenous toxins and can cause direct renal tubular injury or crystal-induced acute kidney injury (AKI), leading to acute tubular necrosis. Drugs such as aminoglycoside, amphotericin B, radiocontrast media, sulfa drugs, acyclovir, cisplatin, calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus, cyclosporine), mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR inhibitors (everolimus, temsirolimus), foscarnet, ifosfamide, cidofovir, and intravenous immunoglobulin containing sucrose all can cause acute tubular necrosis.

Heme pigment-containing proteins such as hemoglobin and myoglobin can behave as endotoxins in 3 ways:

- Causing direct proximal tubular injury, tubular obstruction, or renal vasoconstriction.

- Crystal-induced nephropathy due to high cell turnover such as uric acid, calcium phosphate crystals in the setting of ongoing malignancy treatment.

- Light chain accumulation in multiple myeloma is directly toxic to the renal proximal and distal tubules.

**Sepsis-Induced Acute Tubular Necrosis**

Sepsis also plays a role in causing acute tubular necrosis because of systemic hypotension and renal hypoperfusion. Other mechanisms that are incompletely understood include endotoxemia leading to AKI by renal vasoconstriction and the release of inflammatory cytokines causing enhanced secretion of reactive oxygen species and leading to renal injury.
