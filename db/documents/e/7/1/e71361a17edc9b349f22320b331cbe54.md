Despite advances in mechanical circulatory support, cardiac transplant remains the definitive treatment intervention for patients with advanced heart failure and refractory symptoms who cannot be managed with optimal medical therapy. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
- Describe the pathophysiology of cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
- Outline the management options available for cardiac allograft vasculopathy.
- Review the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance cardiac allograft vasculopathy and improve outcomes.
