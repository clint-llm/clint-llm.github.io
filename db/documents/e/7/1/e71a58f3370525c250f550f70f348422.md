All less invasive methods must be exhausted before performing the sural nerve biopsy due to the morbidity associated with the procedure.

Comprehensive patient history and physical exam should be performed, including the identification of nerves affected and functional ability.

Laboratory workup should include a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, rheumatologic panel, as well as lab tests tailored towards specific diagnoses. For example, if vasculitic neuropathy is suspected, inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), urinalysis, and others may be ordered.  Additionally, if diabetic peripheral neuropathy is suspected a hemoglobin A1c level, glucose level, kidney function, and other markers should be ordered.

Nerve conduction velocity testing and advanced imaging (such as ultrasound or MRI to potentially identify diseased nerve segments) should be ordered or performed.

Finally, the patient should be educated regarding the risks, benefits, and expected outcomes after the procedure to establish reasonable expectations in the post-operative state.
