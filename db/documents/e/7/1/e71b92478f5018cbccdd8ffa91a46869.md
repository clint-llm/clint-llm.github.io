Cefepime hydrochloride is a fourth-generation cephalosporin that belongs to a class of antibiotics known as beta-lactams. It is indicated to treat gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections that are susceptible to its activity. These include:

- Pneumonia

- Complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections

- Skin and soft tissue infections

- Complicated intra-abdominal infections (with metronidazole)

- Empiric treatment for neutropenic fever

Selections of bacteria susceptible to cefepime are as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter group, Haemophilus influenza, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococci viridans species, Bacteroides fragilis.

An ever-growing number of bacteria are becoming resistant to the activity of beta-lactam, known as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms. Many ESBL organisms are resistant to cefepime. However, there is a sub-group of ESBLs known as Amp-C producers that are susceptible. Although these organisms may be susceptible to cefepime, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the dosing regimen must be carefully evaluated before treatment to ensure effective coverage.
