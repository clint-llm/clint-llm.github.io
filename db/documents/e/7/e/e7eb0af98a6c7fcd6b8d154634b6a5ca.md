During organogenesis, the fetus is most susceptible to exposure to teratogens. A teratogen is defined as any chemical, infectious agent, or other environmental exposure that canÂ disrupt normal fetal development and lead to congenital abnormalities. For example, the most common teratogen is alcohol exposure in utero, potentially causing fetal alcohol syndrome. This condition can present with growth retardation, neurobehavioral abnormalities, and dysmorphic facial features. The facial abnormalities may manifest in the fetus as short palpebral fissures, a thin upper lip, and a smooth philtrum.

One contributing biochemical process is the ability of ethanol to cause oxidative stress and produce free radicals. This suppresses oxidative phosphorylation and leads to a buildup of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Also, it induces apoptosis of neural crest cells, which are critical for the formation of fetal structures such as the nervous system.
