The appropriate evaluation of a periprosthetic proximal femur fracture includes an x-ray assessment of the extremity from hip to ankle. Adequate visualization of the ipsilateral hip and knee is critical for determining what implants would be available to the performing surgeon. Thompson et al. stressed the importance of determining whether the implant has subsided from its position on primary arthroplasty.

Classification systems play a significant role in orthopedics, and most fractures in the body have a classification system designed to dictate treatment.****The Vancouver classification is a reliable and accurate tool that guides therapeutic plans. Naqvi et al. reviewed forty-five radiographs of patients with postoperative periprosthetic femur fractures and found an 81% interobserver agreement when classifying B1, B2, and B3 fractures.

Intraoperative Vancouver Classification

- A = Proximal

- 
              
- A1 = Proximal metaphysis, cortical perforation
              
              
- A2 = Proximal metaphysis, nondisplaced fracture
              
              
- A3 = Proximal metaphysis, displaced, unstable fracture

- B = Diaphyseal

- 
              
- B1 = Diaphyseal, cortical perforation
              
              
- B2= Diaphyseal, nondisplaced fracture
              
              
- B3 = Diaphyseal, displaced unstable fracture

- C = Distal to stem

- 
              
- C1 = Distal to stem tip, cortical perforation
              
              
- C2 = Distal to stem tip, nondisplaced fracture
              
              
- C3 = Distal to stem tip, displaced unstable fracture

Postoperative Vancouver Classification

- A = Fracture in the trochanteric region

- 
              
- AG = Fracture of the greater trochanter
              
              
- AL = Fracture of the lesser trochanter

- B = Fracture around the stem

- 
              
- B1 = Fracture around the stem or just below, well-fixed stem
              
              
- B2 = Fracture around the stem or just below, a loose stem, with good proximal bone stock
              
              
- B3 = Fracture around the stem or just below it with poor proximal bone stock

- C = Fracture well distal to the tip of the prosthesis
