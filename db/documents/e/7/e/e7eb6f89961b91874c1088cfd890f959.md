Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is a parasitic infection caused by the parasite T. cruzi. It is a vector, and the triatomine becomes contaminated with the organism while taking a blood meal from an infected mammalian host. Greater than 24 mammalian hosts can carry T. cruzi infection and include humans, raccoons, opossums, wood rats, cats, and domestic dogs.Triatomine species that can transmit the disease and 24 known hosts.

After an incubation period, the parasite is located in the gut of the kissing bug. Transmission to subsequent hosts occurs when an infected kissing bug defecates while in contact with mucosa or non-intact skin.T. cruzi enters the blood and travels to various tissues, and differentiates into an amastigote form and multiplies. They then transform back into the infective form and spread through blood and lymphatic systems, where they can be ingested by feeding kissing bugs.

More recently, a variety of additional modes of transmission have been documented. These include blood donation, congenital infections, oral transmission from food contaminated with vector feces, organ transplantation from an infected donor, and the migration of Latin immigrants to non-endemic regions.
