Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), known as hantavirus, is a pulmonary syndrome characterized by pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and hypotension. It is preceded by vague flu-like symptoms or can involve hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome (HFRS). This is commonly due to exposure to mice feces or urine within 1 to 3 weeks of symptom onset. Hantavirus is most common in the Southwest United States and South America. HFRS has a larger incidence in Asia and Europe. The virus is transmitted by inhalation of dried rodent excrement andÂ may be transmitted by a rodent bite.
