Medical management should be the first-line treatment for PCS. This is due to decreased complications of medical management as compared to invasive procedures. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, danazol, combined oral contraceptives, progestins, phlebotonics, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are a few treatment options that have shown effective management for the pain in PCS.

Ligation of incompetent ovarian veins can lead to favorable results. In nearly 75% of women, ligation of the incompetent ovarian or pelvic vessels leads to the resolution of the symptoms. Gynecologists have used bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterectomy as a treatment for pelvic congestion syndrome, but the results were not favorable.

The ablation of incompetent veins can also be achieved by endovascular procedures using a minimally invasive approach. These procedures can be performed in an outpatient setting leading to comparatively quick recovery and fewer complications.
