Breast conservation therapy should be a consideration when the surgeon feels that a tumor can undergo excision with clear margins with an acceptable cosmetic result. Adequate margins if there is "no ink on tumor" seen for invasive carcinomas, and 2 mm margins are the recommendation for DCIS.

Contemporary studies have addressed the role of breast conservation therapy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for lesions greater than 5 cm. However, tumor size relative to breast size may be more important than exact measurements alone. Evaluation of breast size and discussion with the patient regarding postoperative expectations of her breast size is therefore critical to decide the best treatment course. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has demonstrated comparable rates of disease-free survival and overall survival when compared with adjuvant therapy. It may convert patients with large tumors to candidates for breast conservation therapy.

Male patients have historically received the recommendation to undergo a mastectomy. While this is still the preferred surgical procedure, breast conservation therapy can be an option in patients with multiple comorbidities or those who desire to preserve their nipple-areolar complex. While male patients undergoing BCT were less likely to receive standard of care therapy, breast cancer-specific survival was not affected by surgery type.
