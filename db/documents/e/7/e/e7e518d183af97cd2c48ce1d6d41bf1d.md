Nasal fractures can often be managed with closed reduction, and a good outcome should be anticipated in the majority of patients. There are exceptions, of course, often occurring in the elderly and pediatric populations. The amount of time that passes between the injury and the closed reduction greatly influences the chances of a successful outcome. While the diagnosis of a nasal fracture is typically made clinically, without imaging, it is critical for the surgeon to determine the nature of the bony fractures and identify any additional injuries that could complicate the reduction or require repair in their own right. Patient outcomes are improved when the surgeon is experienced in treating nasal bone fractures, communicates well with the primary care or emergency care provider, and is supported by a knowledgeable nurse who can guide the patient through the post-procedure period.
