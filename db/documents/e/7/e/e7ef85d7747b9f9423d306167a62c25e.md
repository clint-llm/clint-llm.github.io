Anemia is a condition with a decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Anemia is very common and caused by different conditions ranging from simple nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid), blood loss, or other complicated causes.

Anemia is a common medical condition and easily diagnosed with complete blood count. Treatment can range from nutritional supplements (iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid) to blood transfusion to treating complex underlying conditions.

It is very important to follow up with the provider and sometimes with a specialist to treat anemia because untreated anemia can be life-threatening and may even cause death.
