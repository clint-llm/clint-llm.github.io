After the electrophoresis run is over, the gel is stained for the analyte of interest. After incubation with the staining solution, excess of the stain is removed by treating the gel with the de-staining solution.

After staining, the gel is visualized with the suitable wavelength of light, and the optical density of each separated band is quantified by densitometry. The optical density of each separated band will be proportional to the concentration of stained analyte present in that band. The report contains the percentage proportion of each stained analyte in the sample.

The following table shows stains utilized for various analytes.

Ponceau S, Comassie blue 250, Silver stain, Amido black

An abnormal electrophoretic pattern of serum or hemoglobin electrophoresis can alert the clinician to emphasize the identification of an abnormal fraction of protein or hemoglobin in the patientâ€™s sample. Critical analysis of electrophoretic patterns can help the clinician diagnose an underlying disorder that led to an abnormal analyte or the absence of a normal analyte in the case scenario.
