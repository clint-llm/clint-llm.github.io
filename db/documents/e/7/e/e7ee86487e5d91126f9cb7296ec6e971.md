**Heat Production**

Heat production is a function of metabolism.

- Basal metabolism

- Muscle activity, by shivering and muscle contractions

- Extra metabolism caused by the effect of sympathetic stimulation and norepinephrine, epinephrine on the cells

- Extra metabolism caused by increased chemical activity in the cells, especially when the cell temperature increases

- Extra metabolism caused by thyroid hormone and, to a lesser extent, testosterone and growth hormone on the cells

- Extra metabolism needed for digestion, absorption, and storage of food

- Most of the heat produced in the body is generated in the liver, brain, heart, and skeletal muscles during exercise.

**Heat Loss**

The rate at which heat is lost is determined almost entirely by:

- How rapidly heat transfers from the skin to the surroundings

- How rapidly heat is conducted from where it is produced in the body core to the skin
