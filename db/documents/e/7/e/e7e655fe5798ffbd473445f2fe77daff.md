The number of gastroparesis-related hospitalizations has been increasing in the United States, and the economic impact of gastroparesis-related hospitalizations is significant and may be increasing.

An interprofessional team approach is essential to improve the morbidity of the disorder. The pharmacist should educate the patient on medications that can help improve gastric motility but at the same time, warn them about the adverse effects. The diabetes educator nurse should inform the patient on control of blood glucose, and the dietitian should recommend smaller meals at each setting. Patients should be encouraged to eat a healthy diet and consume ample water. Any food that triggers gastroparesis should be avoided. Healthy body weight and regular exercise are also recommended interventions. These examples demonstrate how an interprofessional team approach to gastroparesis can improve patient outcomes [Level 5]

One of the main aspects overlooked is the quality of life of the patient. Both patient and healthcare provider education plays a critical role in identifying and managing patients of gastroparesis. Most parts of the diagnostic approach to gastroparesis and recommendations regarding its treatment have their basis on the cumulative experience and opinions ofÂ physicians who specialize in the care of these patients. A more controlled investigation is needed to validate any therapeutic algorithm in managing this challenging condition.

Interprofessional team dynamics can bring about optimal patient results. [Level 5]
