The sex of a fetus is due to the sperm provided by the biological father. Each oocyte, from the biological mother, has an X chromosome and does not influence the sex of the fetus. If the father provides another X chromosome the fetus will be female. There is an incredible amount of development that occurs in the uterus, but female development does not stop after birth.

Puberty begins in females from the ages of 8 to 10 years old. It is characterized by pubic hair development, breast enlargement, and menarche, which starts between the ages of 8 to 14, and 7 to 13 in African Americans.

After menarche, gonadotrophs can react to the effect of estradiol on LH and FSH.Â  Follicles are present in 86% of prepubescent girls and 99% of girls by menarche.

Thelarche, also known as breast development, is typically the first sign of female puberty. One breast may begin growing before the other, and this is considered normal. Thelarche begins 6 to 18 months before pubarche (the onset of pubic hair growth) and an average of 2 years before menarche (the first menstrual cycle). Estrogen is the primary stimulant for all of these changes, and it also causes the labia minora to grow, vaginal mucosa to mature, and alters fat distribution. Female development has an incredible phenotypic variation, and the average age of menarche is 12 years old.

As females develop, a universal means to classify where they are in puberty is known as Tanner stages. Stage one is prepubertal females. They will have no breast tissue or pubic hair. Stage two is when the breast bud begins to protrude with enlargement of the areola and the sparse presence of pubic hair.
