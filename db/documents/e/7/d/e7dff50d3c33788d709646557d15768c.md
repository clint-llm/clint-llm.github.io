MBP is a 13.8 kDa protein rich in arginine with an isoelectric point (pI) of 11.4.

The MBP proform (proMBP) is absent in mature eosinophils. The exact trigger for cleavage of proMBP to MBP is not known.Â Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is known to stimulate the maturation of eosinophils within the bone marrow and serve as a chemotaxis agent at sites of inflammation. IL-5 also stimulates the synthesis of proteins in eosinophil granules.

Studies of IL-5 stimulated umbilical cord precursor cells identified a homolog of MBP named MBP2.****Although MBP is present in eosinophils, basophils, and other cells, MBP2 has, so far, only been identified in eosinophils, making it a potentially useful biomarker for eosinophilic disorders.
