The most efficient way to obtain selenium systemically is through a well-balanced diet. Food items rich in selenium include Brazil nuts, halibut, sardines, yellowfin tuna, and shrimp, as well as turkey, chicken, and beef. If additional supplementation is needed, selenium administration can be through both oral and parenteral routes, and the preferred route depends on the indication for use. Most cases of selenium deficiency will reverse with oral supplements or selenium-containing foods. Intravenous infusions of selenium are available; however, they must be diluted before injection to prevent tissue irritation.

In 2000 the US Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated estimated average requirements (EARs), recommended dietary allowances (RDAs), and tolerable upper intake limits (ULs) for selenium in their dietary reference intakes (DRIs):

- The EAR for ages 14 and older: 45 mcg per day. The RDA is 55 mcg daily.

- For pregnancy: The RDA is 60 mcg daily. For lactation, the RDA increases to 70 mcg per day.

- For children ages 1 to 13, the RDA is 20 mcg to 40 mcg, increasing with age.

The Institute of Medicine has also set the tolerable upper intake level at 400 mcg daily. All these numbers come from the IOM dietary reference intakes (DRIs).

When administering selenious acid injection (600 mcg/10 mL), the recommended dosing is as follows:

- Adults: 60 mcg daily

- Pediatric patients 7 kg and over: 2 mcg/kg/day.

- Pediatric patients under 7 kg: 2 to 4 mcg/kg/day.

Clinicians should monitor selenium concentrations during the treatment period.

Dermatologic conditions require the use of topical administration of selenium sulfide.

- 1% shampoo: Apply twice weekly, with a maximum of 7 times per week. It should not be used on inflamed or broken skin. Treatment should be for the shortest effective duration.

- 2.25% shampoo or 2.5% lotion: Apply one to four times weekly.
