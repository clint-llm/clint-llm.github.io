The histopathology differs depending on the underlying cause:

- Ovarian cysts: Follicular cysts appear histologically as thin-walled cysts containing follicular fluid and are lined by granulosa and theca interna cells.

- Ovarian tumors:Â  the appearance of granulosa cell tumors varies depending on the type of cells (adult Vs. juvenile). Adult type granulosa cells appear as elongated pale cells with scant cytoplasm and grooved nuclei. These cells often appear as rosettes around collections of eosinophilic fluid referred to as "Call-Exner bodies" and resemble primordial follicles. Juvenile type granulosa cells appear as immature cells with frequent mitotic activity.

- Leydig cell tumors: Leydig cell tumors histologically appear as groups of large cells with regular round nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions referred to as "Reinke crystals" may also be seen, which is characteristic of Leydig cell tumors.

- Congenital adrenal hyperplasia: histological features include diffuse cortical hyperplasia.
