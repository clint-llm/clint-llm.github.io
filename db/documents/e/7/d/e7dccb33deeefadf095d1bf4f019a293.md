**History**

A detailed past medical and social history is essential in elucidating glycol ether (GE) toxicity. Occupational history is a crucial example. Workers in various industries such as electronics, printing, paint and coating, textiles, adhesives, cleaning, and personal care products may have been inadvertently exposed.

Additionally, workers in industries that use GE solvents or as product components, such as laboratory technicians, janitorial, and construction workers, may also be at risk.

Inquiring about using commonplace household items such as surface cleaner, all-purpose cleaner, window cleaner, paint, laundry detergents, and cosmetics is also essential. Remember that GE toxicity may resemble toxicity from toxic alcohols such as methanol and exacerbated medical conditions such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Obtaining a psychiatric history is also important because there have been reports of intentional ingestion with suicide attempts. Of note, patients with severe presentations may be unable to provide history, highlighting the importance of collateral information from emergency medical services.

**Physical**

The physical examination of a patient who has ingested a GE can vary based on several factors, including the amount consumed, the time since ingestion, and individual patient characteristics. As a result, examination findings can be classified into three categories: acute, subacute, or chronic, and there may also be some overlap in presenting signs and symptoms.

- **Acute Toxicity**
- Patients who might have ingested a large amount may present with neurologic signs and symptoms ranging from stupor, drowsiness, headaches, and even coma.
- Due to the resulting metabolic acidosis, patients may exhibit tachypnea or hyperventilation.
- One case report describes cardiac side effects such as heart block, refractory shock, and various metabolic derangements.
- Acute exposure can also cause hemolysis, which may present as weakness, pallor, and syncope if severe enough.
- Electronic cigarettes use diethylene glycol (DEG) as a solvent for the smoking fluid, which has been reported to cause lung injury.
- Patients may also present with severe dehydration and volume loss due to osmotic diuresis (early presentations will likely have a high osmol gap and low anion gap; see evaluation section).

- **Subacute**
- Neurological signs predominate after 5 to 10 days, including progressive lethargy, bilateral facial paralysis, dysphonia, and nonreactive pupils.
- Reports of peripheral neuropathies impacting specific nerve groups, including the 6th, 3rd, 5th, and 9th through 12th nerves, exist in the medical field.
- Focal central nervous system involvement has also been described bilaterally in the left partial lobe and occipital and cerebellar regions.
- Localized skin erythema, dryness, and in some cases, allergic reactions are possible, depending on the duration and frequency of exposure.

- **Chronic Toxicity**
- Chronic toxicity may present with central and peripheral nervous system impairment and can progress to coma. In addition, although the spectrum of long-term neurological injury is variable, impaired respiratory function is possible.
- Repetitive chronic exposure can also cause weakness, drowsiness, anisocoria (irregular pupils), and hypersomnolence.
- The resulting pancytopenia can present as a myriad of symptoms related to anemia and immunodeficiency; however, this is little research regarding the long-term sequelae in bone marrow suppression from GE toxicity.
- Patients may also report a longstanding history of infertility, decreased testicular size, spontaneous abortions, and congenital malformations in offspring.
