Lead encephalopathy is a critical illness that requires the coordination of an interprofessional healthcare team to optimize patient outcomes. Lead encephalopathy will often first be recognized by primary clinicians or emergency medicine providers. Because of the gravity of the disease, early aggressive therapy and the involvement of a medical toxicologist is beneficial. Clinicians, nurses, and other ICU staff play an important role in the stabilization and acute management of lead encephalopathy.

In those patients who survive this serious illness, long term outcomes are affected by behavioral, cognitive, physical, and occupational therapy. Therefore, coordination with the appropriate rehabilitative services is a key component to mitigating long-term morbidity of this condition. Finally, interprofessional communication between health care workers and the CDC, environmental, or occupational health organizations is a critical component to identify sources of lead exposure and prevent further exposure or outbreaks of lead intoxication.
