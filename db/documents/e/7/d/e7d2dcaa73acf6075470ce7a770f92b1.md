**Narrow-angle Glaucoma**

Clonazepam being a BZD drug is generally contraindicated in acute closed-angle glaucoma. Theoretically, these agents can induce relaxation of the iris and also have a mild anticholinergic activity, which can precipitate an acute attack of closed-angle glaucoma.

**Significant Liver Disease**

The liver extensively metabolizes clonazepam. In the case of liver disease, benzodiazepine oxidation decreases, which leads to the accumulation of the drug and results in excessive sedation and respiratory depression.

**Hypersensitivity to drug or components of the formulation**

Hypersensitivity to clonazepam is rare, but there are occasional reports.

**Boxed Warning**

- Concurrent use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Avoid combination.

- The use of benzodiazepines, including clonazepam, has the potential for misuse and addiction. Misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involves concomitant use of alcohol and illicit substances, including opioids.

- The continued use of clonazepam can lead to physical dependence. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of clonazepam after continued use may precipitate life-threatening acute withdrawal. A risk mitigation strategy involves a gradual dose reduction of clonazepam.
