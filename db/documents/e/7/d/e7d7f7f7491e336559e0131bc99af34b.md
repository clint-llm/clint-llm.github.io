Dakin solution, also called Dakin fluid or Carrel-Dakin fluid, is a dilute sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) solution commonly known as bleach.

English chemist Henry Dakin and French surgeon Alexis Carrel developed a Dakin solution to clean and irrigate wounds. It was originally formulated as a battlefield wound antiseptic during World War I.

The low cost and effectiveness of the Dakin solution make this bactericidal antiseptic very popular in the healthcare field. It is used to treat or prevent infections from cuts, abrasions, lacerations, skin ulcers, stage I to IV pressure ulcers, first- and second-degree burns, and even during surgery.
