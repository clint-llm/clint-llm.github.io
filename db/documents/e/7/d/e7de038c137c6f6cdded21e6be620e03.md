Modern healthcare is optimally delivered by multidisciplinary teams who should prioritize teamwork and communication to facilitate safe patient care. There is, however, an unacceptable incidence of preventable medical errors commonly attributed to communication failures between health professionals. Effective teams rely on a foundation of mutual respect and trust, shared mental models, and CLC for effective care delivery. Several challenges prevent the facilitation of such effective teams, including educational, organizational, and psychological challenges.

Medical professionals from multiple disciplines must effectively communicate and facilitate healthcare delivery via teams rather than individual providers. Failures of inter-professional teamwork and communication can lead directly to compromised patient care, medical errors, increased sentinel events, staff burnout, tension, and inefficiency.
