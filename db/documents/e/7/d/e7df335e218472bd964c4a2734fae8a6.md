No additional medical equipment is necessary for this test. The Romberg test does not require any equipment or instrumentation to diagnose a proprioceptive impairment or injury to the dorsal column medial lemniscus pathway. Although the test can be subject to error, accuracy is based solely on the patient's ability to follow the directions and sequences of the examination. Only a trained medical professional should perform this test and be conducted in a safe environment.
