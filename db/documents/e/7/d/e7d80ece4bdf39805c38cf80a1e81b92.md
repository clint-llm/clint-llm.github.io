**Sensory Nerve Conduction Studies**

Sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) are often the first values that are affected in CTS. SNAPs are measured and recorded at the mid palm and past the carpal tunnel to evaluate the possible differences between the two. Median nerve conduction velocities measuring less than 50 meters per second across the carpal tunnel or a difference of the conduction velocity of the wrist-to-digit segment compared to the palm-to-digit segment greater than 10 meters per second indicate signs of CTS.

An amplitude difference of greater than 50% across the carpal tunnel also rates as significant. The test's sensitivity can be increased by obtaining the combined sensory index, which measures the SNAPs difference between the median, ulnar, and radial nerve at fingers one and four because both digits have dual innervation.

**Motor Nerve Conduction Studies**

Compound muscle action potential distal latency is measured during the assessment of the motor nerve. Distal latency of greater than 4.2 milliseconds may indicate CTS. As with sensory nerve studies, it is often compared to the ulnar nerve to rule out a generalized motor neuropathy. A decrease in amplitudes during motor nerve stimulation may indicate a lesion along the median nerve or even a conduction block across the carpal tunnel.

**Late Responses**

F-waves and H-reflex (Hoffman's reflex) are late responses that are often not assessed. These are generally nonspecific, and motor and sensory studies provide a better evaluation of interest areas.

**Electromyography**

EMG is generally a diagnostic to determine and rule out evidence of axonal damage through the presence of fibrillation potentials or positive sharp waves.
