The appropriate and timely diagnosis of primary amebic encephalitis and its management requires an interprofessional healthcare team. Prompt consultation with an infectious disease specialist is essential. Nurses and physicians should together ensure that patients are monitored closely and assessed frequently as these patients can deteriorate rapidly. A higher level of care, in the intensive care unit, is required for patients with neurological deterioration requiring mechanical ventilation. Consultation with pharmacists should also be considered since the available medications for treatment for PAM may cause drug interactions and subsequently lead to lower therapeutic levels.
