If untreated, lesions of PCFCL will slowly increase over the years, but dissemination will only occur in 10% of cases. The generally indolent character of the disease has led to more low morbidity modalities like radiotherapy. Surgical excision can sometimes lead to problems with cosmesis depending on the size, especially since PCFCL tends to occur on the head. Following therapy, patients are followed at regular intervals to monitor for relapse or treatment-related complications. Cutaneous relapses occur in approximately 30% of cases.
