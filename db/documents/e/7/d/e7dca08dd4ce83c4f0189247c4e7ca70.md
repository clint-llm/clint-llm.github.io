The retropharyngeal space (RPS) is an anatomical region that spans from the base of the skull to the mediastinum. Its location is anterior to the prevertebral muscles and posterior to the pharynx and esophagus. It's bounded anteriorly by the buccopharyngeal fascia, laterally by the carotid sheath, and posteriorly by the prevertebral fascia. The RPS is divided by the alar fascia into two components–the “true” retropharyngeal space and the “danger space.” The true RPS is located anterior to the danger space and extends from the base of the skull to between the T1-T6 vertebrae.

The termination of the true RPS along the upper thoracic spine (T1-T6) is variable based on where the alar fascia joins and fuses with the visceral fascia. The danger space courses more inferiorly than the true RPS, running into the posterior mediastinum until the level of the diaphragm. This anatomical connection between the pharynx and the mediastinum is where the danger space acquires its name as it serves as a potential channel for infection to spread between these two sites.
