Most patients with tibial shaft fractures will present to the emergency room. A proper history, physical, and adequate imaging should take place promptly. From a triage standpoint, patients with open injuries or concern for compartment syndrome should undergo urgent evaluation.

Even prior to imaging, if there is visible bone or known open fracture, antibiotics should be started to help combat the risk of infection. Bedside debridement of gross contamination is also necessary along with provisional splinting. Antibiotic therapy can then continue into the postoperative period

Signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome are important for all members of the health care team to know. Â Compartment syndrome can develop in open and closed tibia fracture as well as before or after surgery. Due to the circumferential nature of casts, even minimally displaced fractures treated in a cast may represent or worsen overnight A patient that presented with mild swelling may degrade overnight, therefore, it is vital for floor nurses to be aware whether these patients have increasing pain overnight. All patients with tibial shaft fractures should have ice applied to the injury and elevation of the extremity.

It is an important look at the recommended weight bearing status for the injury. Patients treated non operatively, in an external fixator, or with comminuted fracture patterns will often have weight-bearing limitations while more simple fracture patterns fixed with intramedullary fixation can be weight bearing as tolerated. Physical and occupational therapy should work with patients to help with recovery.
