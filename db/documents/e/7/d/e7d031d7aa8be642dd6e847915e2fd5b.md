It is important to obtain a thorough personal and family history for patients who may have mesenteric ischemia. Patients with acute embolic mesenteric ischemia have a history of a prior embolic event about 30% of the time. Also, those with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis have a personal or family history of deep vein thromboses or pulmonary emboli roughly 50% of the time.

The most common presenting symptom is abdominal pain. The patient’s symptoms and presentation may help determine the etiology of the ischemia. An arterial embolism usually causes sudden, severe, periumbilical pain and is associated with nausea and vomiting. Thrombotic mesenteric arterial occlusion is usually associated with pain that is worse after eating. Patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis usually have slower-onset, “waxing and waning” abdominal pain.

The physical exam may be normal. In fact, patients present with pain that is out of proportion to the initial physical exam. There may be mild distension present, but peritoneal signs only begin to show when transmural bowel infarction and necrosis develops.
