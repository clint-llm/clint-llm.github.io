The tibia is one of two bones that comprise the leg.

The proximal portion of the tibia consists of a medial and lateral condyle, which combine to form the inferior portion of the knee joint. Between the two condyles lies the intercondylar area, which is where the anterior collateral ligament, posterior collateral ligament, and menisci all have attachments.

The shaft of the tibia is triangular in cross-section with three borders and three surfaces.

The distal portion of the tibia is shaped like a box with a distal medial protuberance that makes up the medial malleolus.

- The inferior surface provides a smooth articulation with the talus.

- The anterior surface is covered by extensor tendons and provides an area for ankle joint capsule attachment.

- The posterior surface has a groove for the tibialis posterior muscle.

- The lateral surface has a fibular notch which serves as an attachment for the interosseous membrane.

- The medial surface is a large bony prominence that makes up the medial malleolus.
