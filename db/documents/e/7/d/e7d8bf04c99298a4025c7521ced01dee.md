Waardenburg syndrome is mostly due to the genes changes in Type 1 and Type 3 due to the point mutations and can be detected by the use of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification in specific genes. Other tests include detecting the dystopia canthorum by three intraocular distances: 1)distance between angles of two inner canthi 2)the near papillary distance 3)distance between other canthi angles.

There are no other specific radiological tests for Waardenburg syndrome.
