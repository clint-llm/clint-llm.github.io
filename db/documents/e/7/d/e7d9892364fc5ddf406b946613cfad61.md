Cutaneous lesions of herpes zoster produce Varicella-zoster virus-specific T-cell proliferation, while the production of interferon alfa leads to the resolution of herpes zoster. In immunocompetent patients, specific antibodies (IgG, IgM, and IgA) appear more rapidly and reach higher titers during reactivation (herpes zoster) than during the primary infection causing long-lasting, enhanced, cell-mediated immunity to the varicella-zoster virus.

The dermatological involvement is centripetal and follows a dermatome. In most cases, it is the lumbar and cervical roots that are involved, whereas motor involvement is rare. The infection is contagious to individuals who have no prior immunity to varicella-zoster, however, the rates of transmission are low. The virus can be transmitted either via direct skin contact or by inhaling infected droplets.

It is important to be aware that herpes infections can also occur at the same time. Herpes simplex, CMV, EBV, and human herpesviruses have all been found in patients with shingles.
