GABA is found throughout the human body, though the role that it plays in many regions remains an area of active research. GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, and it is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord. The insulin-producing beta-cells of the pancreas produce GABA. It functions to inhibit pancreatic alpha cells, stimulate beta-cell growth, and convert alpha-cells to beta cells. GABA also has been found in varying low concentrations within other organ systems, though the significance and function of this are unclear.
