Other drugs of abuse require consideration in the differential of LSD intoxication, such as:

- 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)

- 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetmine (MDA)

- N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT)

- Psilocybin

- Phencyclidine (PCP)

- Cocaine and other amphetamines

- Ethanol

- Benzodiazepines

- Barbiturates

- Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)

Psychiatric conditions, such as psychosis and schizophrenia, should be considered in the differential. Infections and tumors within the central nervous system should also be in the differential, depending on the clinical presentation. The altered mental status that can manifest from LSD intoxication must be distinguished from other causes, such as various electrolyte abnormalities.
