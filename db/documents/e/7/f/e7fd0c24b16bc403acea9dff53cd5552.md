Human Behavior in a Social Environment (HBSE, also referred to as Human Behavior and the Social Environment) is a broad topic that often comprises entire courses or academic degrees. It is a foundational aspect of social work, and its topics apply to multiple fields of medicine. As the term itself implies, HBSE seeks an understanding of human behavior and all of the contributors to and characteristics of human behavior; the social environment and different levels and systems of this environment; and the interface between them.
