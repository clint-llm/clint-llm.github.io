Most true gallbladder polyps are not malignant. Often times they are not even true polyps and don't need surgical intervention. A thorough understanding of the genesis and course of gallbladder polyps needs to held by the primary care physician and surgeon. Even though they may not exhibit any sign of malignancy or premalignancy, they must be followed. Yearly ultrasounds are noninvasive and will alert the following physician to enlargement, which would suggest the need for cholecystectomy. Delay in identifying such activity could jeopardize the patient and possibly lead to a missed newly developed cancer. If caught early, these neoplasms are curable. If caught late, then the prognosis is much more dismal.
