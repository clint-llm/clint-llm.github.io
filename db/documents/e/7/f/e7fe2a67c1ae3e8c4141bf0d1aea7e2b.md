**Open Fractures**

Treat open fractures with the expeditious administration of appropriate antibiotics. Perform a bedside irrigation and debridement upon patient arrival and, ideally, an operative debridement within 2 hours if the patient is stable.

**End-of-Bed Skeletal Traction**

Consider traction on a case-by-case basis. Traction is generally not required in elderly patients with low-energy mechanisms. However, traction is helpful in younger patients as the strong muscular attachments cause shortening and the flexed proximal fragment may threaten skin anteriorly.

After assessment of the knee joint radiographically, a distal femoral or proximal tibial traction pin may be placed. End-of-bed traction of 12 pounds (5 kg) is generally used and may be adjusted based on the patient’s weight. Skeletal traction greater than 20 pounds (9 kg) is not recommended.

**Cephalomedullary Nailing**

Cephalomedullary nailing is the mainstay in treatment of subtrochanteric femur fractures due to decreased blood loss, reduced operative time, superior biomechanical strength, fewer complications, and expedited time to weight bearing.

Trochanteric and piriformis fossa start site nails are widely available. Studies have shown no difference in outcomes between these two nails.

Cephalomedullary nailing achieves relative stability and secondary bone healing. It is important to note that the fracture must be reduced prior to reaming and placement of the intramedullary device. In subtrochanteric fractures, this often requires percutaneous reduction techniques. Many adjunctive reduction aids can be used, such as reduction clamps, collinear clamps, Schanz pins used as joysticks, a ball spiked pusher, a femoral distractor, or a bone hook. A balance must be maintained between achieving secondary bone healing, preserving the proximal femur’s blood supply, and obtaining a satisfactory reduction with these techniques, which are placed at the fracture site and can potentially disturb some of the fracture biology.

Postoperative weight-bearing status should be determined on a case-by-case basis and is dependent on the quality of fixation. Multiple studies suggest that utilizing longer intramedullary devices reduces motion at the fracture site.

**Submuscular Fixed-angle Plating**

Though cephalomedullary nailing is preferred, submuscular plating is indicated in certain instances when the patient or fracture is not suitable for a cephalomedullary nail. Such an instance might include an extension of the fracture into the greater trochanter or piriformis fossa, preventing a safe, adequate start site for a nail. In this case, a direct lateral approach to the femur is utilized to apply a laterally based plate. The vastus lateralis may be split or elevated to expose the femur. A direct reduction is then obtained, and a plate is placed along the lateral femur. Various plate designs can be chosen including a blade plate, a dynamic condylar plate, or a proximal femoral locking plate. A blade plate converts tensile force along the lateral cortex into a compressive force on the medial cortex, thus essentially serving as a tension band construct. This construct requires an intact medial cortex without comminution to avoid plate failure. Patients are generally made non-weight-bearing following plating of subtrochanteric femur fractures.
