Fibromyalgia (FM) is a condition characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain. Fatigue, cognitive disturbance, psychiatric and multiple somatic symptoms often accompany the disorder. Fibromyalgia has an unknown etiology and uncertain pathophysiology.

Today fibromyalgia is considered to be a neurosensory disorder where the individual is not able to process pain in the brain.
