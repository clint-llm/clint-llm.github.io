Aminocaproic acid use is contraindicated in the following cases:

- Active intravascular clotting

- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

Aminocaproic acid may be used in these scenarios ifÂ with concurrent heparin administration.

Clinicians can apply the following tests to differentiate between DIC and primary fibrinolysis

- Platelet count is typically decreased in DIC but is usually normal in primary fibrinolysis.

- Euglobulin clot lysis is normal in DIC; however, it is abnormal in primary fibrinolysis.

- Protamine para-coagulation test is positive with DIC; however, it is negative with primary fibrinolysis.

Aminocaproic acid may cause intrarenal obstruction (glomerular capillary thrombosis/clots in the ureters or renal pelvis) in patients with upper urinary tract bleeding. Therefore until possible benefits outweigh the risk, it should not be used in patients with hematuria of upper urinary tract origin.
