The parathyroid glands are composed of two cell types - chief cells and oxyphil cells.

**Chief Cells**- Chief cells are the functional cells of the parathyroids, responsible for the synthesis and secretion of PTH.Â During low-calcium states, a calcium-sensitive receptor (CaSR) on the surface of the parathyroid gland activates a G-protein messenger pathway, leading to PTH synthesis/secretion. During hypercalcemic states, this pathway becomes inhibited, leading to decreased PTH synthesis/secretion.

**Oxyphil Cells**- Oxyphil cells are poorly understood, and their function is unclear. Research has suggested that they produce/secrete PTH in cases of secondary hyperparathyroidism.
