Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors inhibit the absorption of carbohydrates from the small intestine. They competitively inhibit enzymes that convert complex non-absorbable carbohydrates into simple absorbable carbohydrates. These enzymes include glucoamylase, sucrase, maltase, and isomaltase. By delaying carbohydrate absorption, they reduce the rise in postprandial blood glucose concentrations by about 3 mmol/l.

Acarbose is the most commonly used drug in this class and also the most widely studied one. Others include voglibose and miglitol. Acarbose inhibits alpha-amylase, maltase, sucrase, and dextranase and is most effective against glucoamylase. It does not affect lactase, which is a beta-glucosidase. Acarbose and voglibose (not FDA-approved in the USA) are poorly absorbed from the gut, have low bioavailability, and are excreted in the stool. Miglitol, on the other hand, is absorbed from the gut completely and is excreted through the renal route. Acarbose undergoes metabolism in the colon, while miglitol and voglibose have no metabolites.
