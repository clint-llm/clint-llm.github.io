When performing field intubation, a provider should use the equipment with which he or she is most comfortable. This choice is often both provider and company-specific. At a minimum, the provider will require:

- An appropriate size laryngoscope blade MAC, Miller, or combination blade, with a functioning light source

- An appropriate size ET based on patient anatomy and age

- An appropriate size stylet for ET tube used.

- Ten-mL syringe to inflate the balloon after insertion

- Medications to provide sedation in SAI or sedation and paralytic medications used in RSI as allowed by local protocols.

- Intravenous (IV) access if SAI or RSI is to be utilized or to provide resuscitation medications.

- Age-appropriateÂ BVM with a reservoir and needed attachments to ventilate the patient before and after the procedure

- Suction equipment to clear vomitus, secretions, among others

- Rescue equipment such as a gum elastic bougie, multiple sized tubes to account for stenosis or anatomical differences in patients, supraglottic airway devices, or video laryngoscopy equipment, if available.

- Equipment for surgical airway as allowed by local protocols in the event of a catastrophic airway failure

- Methods for tube placement confirmation such as end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) monitoring equipment, waveform capnography, or color change CO2 detectors

- Tape or commercially available "tube holders" to maintain an appropriate ET position.

- Gloves, mask, and goggles as personal protective equipment
