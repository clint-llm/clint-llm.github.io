The majority of newborns exhibiting signs of withdrawal will have a maternal history of drug use before and during pregnancy. The timing of withdrawal depends on the most recent history of the drug dose and the half-life of that drug. For example, in infants exposed to short-acting substances like heroin, withdrawal signs can be seen within the first 24 hours. However, for long-acting agents like methadone and buprenorphine, the withdrawal signs may be seen 1 to 3 days after birth. Occasionally, withdrawal signs may be delayed until five days of age or later. As a result, opioid-exposed infants should be observed in the hospital for at least 5 to 7 days with close follow-up care in place.

The classic signs of withdrawal include

- High-pitched excessive cry

- Tremors and irritability

- Poor sleep

- Increased tone

- Exaggerated Moro reflex

- Poorly coordinated feeding, vomiting, and failure to thrive

- Loose stools and perianal excoriation

- Sweating, sneezing, fever, mottling, temperature instability

- Tachypnea and tachycardia

- Seizures

The timing of the onset of withdrawal signs, along with the type and severity of signs, has a wide variability. The pathophysiology of this variability is not well understood but may be related to a variety of factors, such as:

- Type and dosages of the maternal drugs

- Concomitant use of other opioid and non-opioid drugs

- Maternal factors such as nutritional status, infections, and psychiatric conditions

- Genetic factors

- Prematurity and other comorbid infant morbidities

- Breastfeeding preferences

- Environmental factors like availability of infant handlers, excessive stimulation including noise and light levels
