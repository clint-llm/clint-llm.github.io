The differential diagnosis for an epithelioid mass in the head and neck region includes granular cell tumor, cellular neurothekeoma, nerve sheath myxoma, neurofibroma, schwannoma, benign fibrous histiocytoma, melanocytic lesions, for example, Spitz nevus or melanoma, and infection.

Distinguishing neural and fibrohistiocytic lesions from malignancies like melanoma can be difficult given the variable presence of epithelioid cells arranged in a theque-like architecture and given the potential presence of unusual features such as nuclear atypia, mitoses, and extension into fat or skeletal muscle.

The most problematic delineation is between cellular neurothekeoma and nerve sheath myxoma because of overlapping clinical presentation and histology. In the past, nerve sheath myxoma has been inadvertently included within the myxoid variant of neurothekeoma.
