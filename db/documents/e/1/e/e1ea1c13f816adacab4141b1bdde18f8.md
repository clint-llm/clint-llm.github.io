Screening for the presence of the HLA B 5701 allele should always be conducted to avoid possible morbidity due to allergic reactions. Due to the implications of positive results for the HLA B 5701 allele, using abacavir in treatment is contraindicated. Instead, physicians should substitute with a different NRTI in the patient's therapeutic regimen. It bears mentioning that in rare cases where HLA B 5701 testing is not available due to geographically low prevalence of the allele, physicians may prescribe abacavir under close observation for the first six weeks, although the median time of onset typically occurs at 1Â to 2 weeks.
