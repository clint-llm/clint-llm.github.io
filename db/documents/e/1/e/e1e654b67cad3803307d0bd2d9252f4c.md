An interprofessional team should educate patients that treatment for cystinuria starts with diet (low meat protein, low sodium) and hydration sufficient to generate 3,000 mL or more of urine daily. Urinary alkalinization with mineral water, fruit juices, sodium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate will significantly increase cystine solubility. The goal is to achieve a cystine concentration of 250 mg/L or less at a pH of at least 7 and optimally 7.5. An "optimal" cystine level is generally considered to be 150 mg/L or less, but some reports suggest that a cystine concentration goal of 90 mg/L may be "optimal." If this is not achievable or possible for any reason (tolerability, compliance issues, side effects), then the use of a thiol-based cystine lowering medication is warranted. Currently, tiopronin is the preferred thiol medication of choice based on its efficacy and reduced side effect profile.

It has been shown that a dedicated multi-disciplinary clinic for cystinuria patients reduces the surgical intervention rate by 50%, enhances patient education, increases the quality of life scores, and improves treatment compliance.

Excellent clinical practice guidelines and management updates for treating cystinuria have recently been published in the US and Europe.

All members of the interprofessional team treating cystinuria patients, including urologists, nurses, dietitians, and clinicians, should remind and educate patients that the optimal preservation of renal function with the best quality of life and the lowest stone recurrence rates are found in those with early and continuing prophylactic medical management of their cystinuria along with complete surgical stone removal whenever possible.
