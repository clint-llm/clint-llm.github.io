The pathophysiology of addiction revolves around the concepts of synaptic plasticity, specifically LTP (long-term potentiation) and LTD (long-term depression). Long-term potentiation is the phenomenon of strengthened neural connections over time and with increased stimuli. Long-term depression is the decrease in the responsiveness of a neural signal with stimulation. These are the same processes involved in learning and habit formation. The biochemical proof of these processes' involvement in drug addiction is founded in the same molecules undergoing upregulation in both cases - extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), cyclic AMP response element-binding (CREB), ELK-1, and Fos

Biochemical studies have shown the involvement of a dynorphin A (DYN) and K-opioid receptor (KOPr) system.

These are but two processes and systems known to be integral to addiction development. Further research will continue to illuminate pivotal features that can be ultimately manipulated to treat the addiction.

Furthermore, research has implicated dopamine as a pivotal player in terms of neurological changes in the brain of an addict. Large and fast increases have been associated with the onset and maintenance of addiction
