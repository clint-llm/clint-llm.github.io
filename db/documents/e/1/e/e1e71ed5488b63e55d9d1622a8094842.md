Over the past three decades, PSGN incidence has significantly dropped in developed countries; such as the United States, UK, Central Europe, and Japan. The reason for this progress is the use of antibiotic prophylaxis and the improvement of hygienic states. In these developed countries, PSGN has become more frequently seen in adult patients who suffer from chronic debilitating diseases.

Higher incidence of PSGN in developing countries- due to increased skin infections (pyoderma). Though the incidence in developed countries has gone down, it is still the most common cause of glomerulonephritis (GN) in children in the united states.

PSGN is also the most common cause of kidney injury in children in the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and worldwide. The annual incidence of new cases of PSGN in developing countries ranges from 8.5 to 28.5 per 100000 individuals.

Clinically manifestations of PSGN are more common in males than in females with a ratio of 2:1. However; the incidence of subclinical PSGN is almost equal in both sexes. Racial factors were not found to play a role. The disease most frequently affects children between the age of 3 and 12 (with the peak incidence between 5 to 6 years), and seniors greater than 60 years old.
