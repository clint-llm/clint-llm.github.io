When the body develops an infection, depending on the causative organisms, there is the possibility of abscess formation. As part of the body's immune response, the infection may become walled off by the body. These walls allow purulence to accumulate in the form of dead immune cells, infectious organisms, and debris. Fluid collections and abscesses can form almost anywhere in the human body in which there is access by microorganisms, specifically bacteria. Skin and soft tissue is a common site for the development of abscesses. Other common locations involve the sigmoid colon, such as in the case of a diverticular abscess. Additionally, in cases of complicated appendicitis, an abscess can form, or the appendix can rupture, forming an abscess in the right lower quadrant.
