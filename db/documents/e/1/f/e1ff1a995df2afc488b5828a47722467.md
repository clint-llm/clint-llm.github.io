Hemorrhoidal disease is a common disorder requiring surgical intervention in approximately 10% of cases

Hemorrhoids are columns of vascular connective tissue within the anal submucosa aiding in maintaining continence and bulk to the anal canal. The pathophysiology of hemorrhoids is mostly unknown, but one theory states that hemorrhoids develop due to varicose veins in the anal canal; however, most healthcare providers reject this idea. Instead, the current thought is that hemorrhoids develop due to decay or deterioration of the vascular cushions.

Hemorrhoids can have treatment with both medical and surgical interventions depending on their degree of prolapse and whether they are internal or external. The most effective treatment for recurrent, symptomatic grade III, or IV hemorrhoids, is surgical excision. Surgical procedures primarily include closed, also called Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy, which is the most common technique in the United States, or the open, also called Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy, used in the United Kingdom and Europe.
