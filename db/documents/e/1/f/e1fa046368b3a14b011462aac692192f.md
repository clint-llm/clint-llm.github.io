Papilloma etiology depends on the type ofÂ epithelial proliferation. Squamous papillomas and seborrheic keratosis are idiopathic benign cellular proliferation. There is no known definitive cause of these lesions. However, malignant skin lesions that can look like papillomas are often associated with chronic ultraviolet (UV) exposure and sun-damaged skin. Verruca vulgaris is caused by human papillomavirus type 6 or 11.
