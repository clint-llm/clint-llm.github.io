Ascites is the pathologic accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity. It is the most common complication of cirrhosis and occurs in about 50% of patient with decompensated cirrhosis in 10 years. The development of ascites denotes the transition from compensated to decompensated cirrhosis. Mortality increases from complications such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatorenal syndrome. Mortality ranges from 15% in a year to 44% in 5 years. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of ascites and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of ascites.
- Review the workup of a patient with ascites.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for ascites.
