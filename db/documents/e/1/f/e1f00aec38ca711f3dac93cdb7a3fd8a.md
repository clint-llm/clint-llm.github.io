The primary care provider, nurse practitioner,Â obstetrician, infectious disease specialty trained nurse, and the pharmacist should operate in an interprofessional health team working with each other to educate the patient on CMV prevention, particularly in places where women are most at risk. Such facilities include obstetrics offices and childcare centers. Confirmed prenatal diagnosis or high suspicion of disease without confirmation should be communicated to the newborn medical team; to ensure neonatal testing, treatment if indicated, and appropriate follow up. Early diagnosis ensures access to treatment and early intervention services.
