Although most cases of ectodermal dysplasia are diagnosed clinically after birth, there are other testing options available.  Sweat testing can be performed to identify female carriers of the X linked form of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia. These carriers can have mild symptoms such as defective dentition or patchy and abnormal distribution of sweat glands.

There is genetic testing available for various ectodermal dysplasia syndromes, although patients with a clinical diagnosis will not have their medical management changed due to further genetic testing. Therefore genetic testing is more useful for patients with mild or moderate symptoms for whom a genetic test will provide a definitive diagnosis.

Radioimmunoassay can also be done in some cases, such as to measure EDA levels with receptor-binding assays to help with diagnosing EDA deficiencies.
