The adverse effect profile of mexiletine is extensive and limits its use.Â  It affects nearly every organ system; most notably, it has significant cardiovascular and central nervous system (CNS) side effects and affecting the gastrointestinal (GI), musculoskeletal, dermatologic systems.

Cardiovascular adverse effects include bradycardia, palpitations, angina, ventricular premature contractions, heart block, hypotension, and exacerbation of cardiac arrhythmias.

Mexiletine carries a black box warning related to the findings of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) published in 1989, where suppression of asymptomatic, non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in post-myocardial infarction patients lead to excessive mortality than the placebo group. Though this study used class 1C antiarrhythmics for suppression, the results extrapolate across all class 1 antiarrhythmics.
