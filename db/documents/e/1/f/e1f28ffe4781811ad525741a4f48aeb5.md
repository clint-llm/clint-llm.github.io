Several other conditions may be confused with Toxicodendron toxicity, and a careful history and physical examination are necessary to differentiate between them. Herpes zoster often presents as a vesiculopapular rash but follows a dermatomal pattern that doesnâ€™t cross the midline of the body. It is also often preceded by pain in the affected area and would not have a history of environmental exposure. Phytophotodermatitis is another potential mimicker, as it follows a similar timeline. Differentiating factors include plant exposure to sun-exposed areas of the body and the absence of pruritus. Irritant dermatitis is usually sudden in onset and associated with exposure to metals or other irritating compounds with distinct dermal patterns. Other arthropod bites such as bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) or scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) may present similarly and be pruritic but lack the appropriate timing and are typically non-vesicular. Scabies has a characteristic burrowing pattern, while bed bug bites tend to have a rapid onset in skin findings.
