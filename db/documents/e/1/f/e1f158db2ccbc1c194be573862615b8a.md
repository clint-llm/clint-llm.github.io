Poland Syndrome is an unfortunate congenital muscle deficiency that affects young children with disfiguring outcomes. It is a mental and physical disturbance that can affect patients over their entire lifespan if not treated accordingly. The goal of these patients is to use integrated care with different evidence base approach and planning to address their aesthetic concerns with plastic reconstruction and their psychological disorder with psychotherapy support. An interprofessional approach that provides a synergistic and integrated team dedicated to patient care can help achieve the best possible outcomes for Poland syndrome patients.

The role of early cosmetic reconstruction and mental health support at a young age cannot be undermined. If the patient is to be discharged home after surgical reconstruction, consultation should be made with a social worker, physical therapist, and community mental health therapist who can monitor the patient's progress to evaluate for proper recovery and make referrals as needed. An integrated collaboration of different medical team sharing decision making, plan of action, and communication are important for a successful long-term outcome.
