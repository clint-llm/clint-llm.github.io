The pattern of clinical presentation in ISCA can be categorized as follows:

- Acute (less than one week)

- Subacute (1 to 6 weeks), and ****

- Chronic (more than six weeks).

ISCA is more frequently observed among males, with a peak incidence in the first and third decades of life.

The characteristic triad in ISCA constitutes fever, pain, and neurological deficits.

ISCA mimics acute transverse myelitis in the acute stage. Chronic ISCA mirrors spinal cord tumors and chronic myelopathy.

Children often have rapid symptomatology.

Among children, the median age of presentation is three years.

The typical symptomatology among children with ISCA includes:

- Motor deficits (90%)

- Infection signs (86%)

- Sensory deficits (40%)

- Urinary dysfunction (44%) and

- Bowel dysfunction (18%).

Among 38 cases of pediatric IASC studied between 1875 and 2001, 45% were female.

Among 26 cases of ISCA reviewed between 1998 and 2007, the most common clinical characteristics were:

- Motor deficits

- Fever

- Pain, and

- Bladder dysfunction

Of these, 68.5% were males, with a median age of presentation at 32 years. Fever was the initial presentation in 43.4%.

In the most recent systematic review comprising 137 ISCA cases from 1949 to 2022, 50.03% were adult cases, and 78.5% were males. The median age at the presentation was 52 years.

The most common patterns of clinical presentations include:

- Motor impairment (99%)

- Sensory loss (87%)

- Pain(56%)

- Urinary involvement (50%)
