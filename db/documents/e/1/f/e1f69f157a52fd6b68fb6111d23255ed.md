GSV cut down can be performed by a trained surgeon or trained medical professional such as a surgery resident, emergency medicine resident or midlevel provider. In an ideal situation, the operator will have an assistant to hand instruments, materials and IV tubing. In an acute trauma setting, collaborative effort is made by the trauma surgeon, emergency room (ER) physician and nurse to establish IV access and resuscitate the patient.
