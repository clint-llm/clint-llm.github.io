Once the diagnosis of syphilis has been made, the management is with a multidisciplinary team since the infection can affect almost every organ in the body. These patients need close follow-up by the cardiologist, neurologist, dermatologist, internist, ophthalmologist, obstetrician, and infectious disease expert. The patient must be followedÂ by the infectious disease nurse to ensure that the treatment is working and the patient is compliant with therapy. The patient's partner has to be investigated and treated if positive. If the patient with syphilis is pregnant, close follow-up with an obstetrician is highly recommended.
