Management of M. kansasii requires an interprofessional effort from primary care physicians, pulmonologists and infectious disease specialists. Physicians and nurses should educate the patient about being compliant with their medications. Ethambutol can cause visual disturbances. Rifampin is a strong CYP3A4 Inducer and may decrease the serum concentrations or decrease the therapeutic effect of most multiple medications. Pharmacists should be aware of the drugs the patients are on and also explain to the patients about the side effects of medications used in the management of M. kansasii.
