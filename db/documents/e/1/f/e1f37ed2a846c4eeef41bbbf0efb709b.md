High electrical field strength tends to result in either electrochemical or thermal damage to affected tissues with the risk of causing protein coagulation, coagulation necrosis, hemolysis, thrombosis, muscle or tendon avulsion, or dehydration. In addition to the electrical injury itself, high electrical field strength injury can result in massive tissue edema (e.g., secondary to thrombosis, vascular congestion, and muscle swelling secondary to damage), leading potentially to compartment syndrome. Dehydration (with associated hypovolemia and hypotension) may also occur as a result of this tissue edema. Severe muscle injury may lead to rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and additional electrolyte disturbances. Altogether, these sequelae place individuals at a very high risk of acute kidney injury.

Potential long-term sequelae of electrical injuries may include:

- Neurological

- Neuropathy
- Seizures
- Syncope
- Tinnitus
- Paresthesias
- Weakness
- Loss of balance, poor coordination, or gait ataxia

- Psychological

- Memory or attention difficulties
- Irritability
- Depression
- Post-traumatic stress

- Ocular

- Cataracts

- Physical

- Pain
- Fatigue
- Contractures
- Muscle spasms
- Pruritus
- Headaches
- Fever or night sweats
- Reduced range of motion or stiffness in the joints
