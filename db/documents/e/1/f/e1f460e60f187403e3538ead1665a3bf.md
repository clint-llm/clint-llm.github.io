Diffuse endocapillary proliferative changes are usually seen in the histopathological analysis of glomerulonephritis. The most common histological patterns observed in the descending order of prevalence are diffuse, focal, and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis.

- Under light microscopy, a normal glomerular morphology may be seen, while a loss of foot processes on electron microscopy (EM).

- Hypercellular glomeruli result from increased mesangial, endothelial, or parietal epithelial cells; acute and chronic white blood cells may also be seen in diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis (GN), while in crescentic GN, crescents made up of leukocytes and epithelial cells may be present.

- Basement membrane thickening, a feature highlighted by periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain and electron microscopy: EM will demonstrate electron-dense deposits of immune complexes in or adjacent to the basement membrane. The most common pattern of these deposits is sub-epithelial.

- Sclerosis of glomeruli is the end result of glomerular damage from various causes.
