Any process that can weaken the supports keeping vertebral bodies aligned can allow spondylolisthesis to occur. As one vertebra moves relative to the adjacent vertebrae, local pain can occur from mechanical motion or radicular or myelopathic pain can occur due to compression of the exiting nerve roots or spinal cord, respectively. Pediatric patients are more likely to increase spondylolisthesis grade when going through puberty. Older patients with lower grades I or II spondylolistheses are less likely to progress to higher grades over time.
