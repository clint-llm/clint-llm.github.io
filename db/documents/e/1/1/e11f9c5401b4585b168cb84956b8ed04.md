Due to the complex procedural nature and unmeasurable morbidity inflicted upon a patient, as outlined above, a multi-specialty approach is vital in ensuring the best outcomes.

The first port of call would be stabilizing a traumatic patient in the emergency room by a casualty provider. Due to the unpredictable nature of injuries, a variety of surgical specialties can be utilized to offer the best management â€“ be it free flaps from plastics, revascularization of arteries by vascular surgeons, or optimizing musculoskeletal tissue by orthopedic surgeons to ensure best prosthesis fit and function. Therefore, these injuries should be managed at tertiary units with multi-specialty input.

Post-operatively, to minimize patient morbidity, they must be managed holistically. These injuries take months, if not years, to recover. It can only be done through rehabilitation teams, nursing staff, and psychiatric or counseling teams. This interprofessional approach leads to better outcomes and has also been shown to decrease patient stay by 20 days while increasing discharges of patients with a prosthesis by five times and increasing the effectiveness of long-term rehabilitation.
