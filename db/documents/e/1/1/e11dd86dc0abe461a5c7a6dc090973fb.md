The heavy metal concentrations are evaluated using an inductively coupled plasma with mass spectrometry (ICP/MS) or atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). ICP/MS is more commonly used due to its low detection limit and ability to detect multiple elements at once.

**Arsenic:**Inorganic arsenic has a half-life of about 3 to 4 hours in the blood. It’s major metabolites, monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), will then be excreted into the urine and can be detected for 2 to 4 days.

**Lead:**A blood test is the most widely used method for lead detection. Following an exposure, lead has a half-life in the blood of about 1-2 months.

**Cadmium:**Cadmium has a half-life in the blood of 3 to 4 months, making this option useful for recent exposure.

**Mercury:**Metallic and elemental mercury initially has a quick half-life of 3 days in blood and then a longer half-life of 1 to 3 weeks. A urine sample can also be used for 1 to 3 months post-exposure. On the other hand, methylmercury has a half-life of about 40-90 days in blood and hair samples.

**Thallium:**Thallium has a half-life of 3 days in blood. Urine can be used for 2 months post-exposure.
