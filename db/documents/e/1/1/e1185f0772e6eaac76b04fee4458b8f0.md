Flight medicine centers on the awareness of how normal physiology is affected by the stresses of flight and mitigation strategies for those most at risk of succumbing to those stresses. When a physiologic event occurs in flight requiring the response of medical personnel for stabilization, comfort, or safety, the AMAA provides legal cover to those who volunteer to assist the flight crew in those efforts. Immediate stabilization often begins with the provision of oxygen, incorporation of the CPR trained flight crew, standard onboard medical supplies, and consideration of a differential with recommendations to the flight crew on whether divert is necessary.
