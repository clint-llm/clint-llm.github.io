The myenteric plexus develops from the neural crest cells of the fetus. These cells then go through a series of migrations to situate along the future gastrointestinal tract. At three weeks of gestation, these cells move to the anterior foregut, where they are then referred to as enteric neural crest-derived cells (ENCDCs). Interestingly, neural crest cells induce the differentiation of surrounding muscular structures and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). In turn, these differentiate into the elements of the enteric nervous system, glial cells, and neurons. By week 9 of embryologic development, the myenteric plexus, circular muscle, and longitudinal muscle layers have formed along the entire gut.
