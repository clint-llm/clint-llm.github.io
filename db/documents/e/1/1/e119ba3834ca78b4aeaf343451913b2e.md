**Candidates of Hospice**

The ideal candidates for hospice are patients nearing their final weeks to months of their life and want to focus on comfort measures rather than life-prolonging treatments. Physicians should give strong consideration in making a hospice referral when chronically ill patients present with a decreased functional status, spend more than half their time in bed or a chair and exhibit physical and psychological distress. A referral is paramount when there is a progressive decline in the patient's condition; their highest priority is to feel more in control and remain at home with support to keep comfortable.

**Qualifying for Hospice Benefits**

Patients over 65 years of age or individuals younger than 65 with a long-term disability will receive coverage through Medicare Part A benefits. If a patient is ineligible for Medicare hospice, benefit coverage will vary depending on the individual's health insurance coverage.

Currently, Medicare has four major qualification criteria to cover hospice services:

- Eligible for Medicare Part A

- 
              
- United States citizen/legal resident eligible for Social Security benefits
              
              
- Over 65 years of age or eligible for Medicare services due to long-term disability for greater than two years or having end-stage kidney disease

- Certification by Medicare as a recognized hospice facility

- Patient verification choosing hospice services instead of utilizing regular Medicare coverage

- Certification from both a physician and hospice medical director verifying the patient has received a diagnosis of a terminal illness, and in typical circumstances, without treatment to prolong the patient's disease, they are expected not to live more than six months

**Hospice Coverage**

When a patient has a terminal condition, Medicare will provide hospice care, including comprehensive services related to a terminal illness. The array of benefits may include:

- Medical equipment

- Medical supplies

- Skilled nursing care

- Medications to aid in the terminal illness to provide comfort

- Social workers and chaplains

- Home health care aids

- Bereavement support

- Short term inpatient and respite care
