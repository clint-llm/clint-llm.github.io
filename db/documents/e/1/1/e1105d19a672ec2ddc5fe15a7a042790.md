Breast cancer is the most common malignancy affecting women of every race and ethnic group worldwide. In the United States, 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime, although the incidence and mortality rate varies among different races.

Due to significant advances in early detection and available therapies, the overall mortality rate of breast cancer is declining in the United States, though not all races or ethnicities have benefited equally.

Studies have identified strategies to reduce racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes and improve all women's clinical care. Still, the broader implementation of these existing strategies needs to take place. Furthermore, interprofessional teams must work together to innovate new policies to reduce the racial gap seen in disease-free survival rates and institute the necessary changes to achieve those goals and provide the highest quality of care to all women.
