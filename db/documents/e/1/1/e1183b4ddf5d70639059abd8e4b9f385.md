Most variations in pituitary anatomy result in pathology, so a few physiologic variants exist. Empty sella syndrome describes the absence of an identifiable hypophysis within the sella turcica, a bony feature that typically surrounds the pituitary gland. While secondary causes usually correlate with pathologic pituitary insufficiency, one primary etiology of empty sella syndrome involves an anatomic defect affecting cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage that results in elevated CSF pressures within sella turcica. This increased pressure remodels the pituitary superiorly into the hypothalamus, thus, while imaging characteristically demonstrates an empty sella turcica, the tissue itself (as well as its function) are often preserved.
