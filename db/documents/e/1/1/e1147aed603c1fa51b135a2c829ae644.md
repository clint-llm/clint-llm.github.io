Most muscle tendon strains occur while the muscle is being forcibly stretched while being concentrically contracted. The greatest eccentric tension is placed on the adductor complex when the leg is in external rotation and abduction. Adductor injuries typically occur when the athlete pushes off in the opposite direction. As a result, the adductor muscles contract to generate both eccentric and concentric opposing forces. The dominant leg is more commonly injured and more likely to sustain significant injury.

For example, a soccer player trying to kick a ball with an externally rotated leg using the inside ofÂ their foot. If their leg swinging in adduction meets a significant resistive abductive force such as another player, this can place a significant load on the adductor complex leading to injury.

The musculotendinous junction is the most common site of injury in a muscle strain. The adductor tendons have a small insertion zone which is characterized by an area of poor blood supply and rich nerve supply which helps explain the increased degree of perceived pain.

The adductor longus is the most commonly injured muscle and accounts for 62% to 90% of cases. It is hypothesized that this occurs due to its low tendon to muscle ratio at the origin. Rugby players with an adductor-abductor strength ratio of less than 80% are 17 times more likely to sustain an adductor injury.
