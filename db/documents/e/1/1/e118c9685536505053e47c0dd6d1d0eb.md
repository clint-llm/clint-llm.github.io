Lemierre syndrome is best managed by an interprofessional team involving intensivist, surgeon and otolaryngologist. When patients present with oral cavity infections, one should always consider the fact these oral bacteria can migrate to adjacent tissues including the jugular veins. From here the septic embolic can go to any part of the body including the lungs. The treatment of Lemierre syndrome is antibiotics and the role of anticoagulation remains controversial.

The outlook for patients with this syndrome is guarded. Case reports reveal a high mortality despite optimal treatment.
