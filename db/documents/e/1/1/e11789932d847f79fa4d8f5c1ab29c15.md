The primary mechanism by which non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as nevirapine function isÂ by binding to the reverse transcriptases, which are unique to HIV. The binding of the nevirapine causes the formation of a hydrophobic pocket near the active site of the reverse transcriptase. This new pocket causes an alteration in the three-dimensional configuration of the substrate-binding site, which ultimately leads to hindering HIV DNA synthesis. An important point to note is that while nevirapine is effective against HIV-1, it is not effective against HIV-2 since it is non-competitive as an inhibitor.

Nevirapine undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism; it is a CYP2B6 and 3A substrate. It is excreted in the urine (approximately 80%) and the feces (approximately 10%) and has a half-life of 25 to 30 hours.
