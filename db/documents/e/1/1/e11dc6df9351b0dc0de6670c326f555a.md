Gaseous chlorine is poisonous and classified as a pulmonary irritant. It has intermediate water solubility with the capability of causing acute damage to the upper and lower respiratory tract. Most incidents of chlorine exposure are through accidental industrial or household exposures. Toxicity to chlorine gas depends on the dose and duration of exposure. Because of its strong odor, chlorine gas can be detected easily. Symptoms of chlorine gas exposure include burning of the conjunctiva, throat, and the bronchial tree. Higher concentrations can produce bronchospasm, lower pulmonary injury, and delayed pulmonary edema. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of chlorine gas toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing the patients affected by it.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of chlorine gas toxicity.
- Summarize the epidemiology of chlorine gas toxicity.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with chlorine gas toxicity.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by chlorine gas toxicity.
