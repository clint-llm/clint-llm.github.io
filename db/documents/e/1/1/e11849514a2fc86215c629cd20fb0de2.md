Kidney cysts develop from renal tubule segments and detach from the parent tubule after growing a few millimeters. Development of cyst increases proliferation of the tubular epithelium, abnormalities in tubular cilia, and excessive fluid secretion. ADPKD develops due to mutations in the genes PKD1 and PKD2. ARPKD develops due to variations in PKHD1, which plays a critical role in collecting-tubule and biliary development.
