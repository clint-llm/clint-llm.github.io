The first step in evaluating sinus node dysfunction is to exclude reversible causes such as electrolyte abnormalities, metabolic abnormalities, or uncontrolled sleep apnea, and removal of possible offending medications (e.g., beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers). There should be clear documentation of bradycardia that correlates with patient’s symptoms to make a diagnosis of sinus node dysfunction. Given the episodic nature of the disease, diagnosis on 12 lead ECG is unusual and prolonged monitoring to detect and document bradycardic episodes is often indicated. This is achieved by 24-48 Holter monitor or telemonitoring, depending on the severity of the symptoms. If telemetry or Holter monitoring fails to demonstrate bradycardia, then an external or implantable long-term event monitor or a loop recorder is warranted. If the diagnosis of sinus node dysfunction is strongly suspected, but no arrhythmias were detected, then the electrophysiologic study is suggested. Autonomic modulation testing such as prolonged sinus pause more than 3 seconds after carotid sinus massage is suggestive of sinus node dysfunction but not by itself diagnostic. Testing for chronotropic incompetence is usually done by treadmill exercise test especially in those who experience fatigue and exertional symptoms. Chronotropic incompetence is diagnosed when the patient achieves less than 80% of maximal predicted heart rate; however, this has not been clinically validated
