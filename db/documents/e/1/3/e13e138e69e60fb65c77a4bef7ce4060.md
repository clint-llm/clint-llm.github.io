The word "atelectasis" is Greek in origin; It is a combination of the Greek words atelez (Ateles) and ektasiz (ektasis) meaning "imperfect" and "expansion" respectively. It is caused by the partial or complete, reversible collapse of the small airways resulting in an impaired exchange of CO2 and O2 - i.e., intrapulmonary shunt. The incidence of atelectasis in patient's undergoing general anesthesia is 90% This activity discusses the etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, and treatment of atelectasis. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of teamwork among all involved caregivers to ensure adequate patient education, prevention, early recognition, treatment, and, ultimately improve patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review the various mechanisms by which atelectasis occurs.
- Identify the risk factors for developing atelectasis.
- Discuss the typical presentation of atelectasis, including history and physical. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure patient education on atelectasis, early application of preventative strategies, and prompt diagnosis/ treatment of atelectasis.
