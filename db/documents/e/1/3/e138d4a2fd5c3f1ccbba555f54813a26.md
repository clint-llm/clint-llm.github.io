Early diagnosis is critical in managing bagassosis as progression is generally preventable, and adverse effects are usually reversible. Minimizing exposure is the cornerstone of management. There is no role for drugs in the management of bagassosis; however, where elimination of antigen exposure fails at regressing the disease, corticosteroids may be warranted. Being an occupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis resulting from exposure to bagasse dust, avoiding the dust is usually all that is required to treat the condition. Reexposure to the dust is associated with the reoccurrence of the disease.

The use of low-dose macrolides has been suggested to improve inflammation; however, its benefits have not been studied in human studies.
