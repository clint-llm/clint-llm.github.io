**Primary Congenital Glaucoma**

The histopathological and electron microscopy studies revealed outflow obstruction and high iris insertion. Deposition of fibrillar collagen, elastin, and other ground substances has been demonstrated.

**Axenfeld-Rieger Anomaly**

The anteriorly displaced Schwalbe's line is made of dense collagen and ground substance and is covered by a monolayer of spindle cells. Iris stromal fibers are seen bridging the peripheral iris and the Schwalbe line.

**Peters Anomaly**

On light microscopy, a complete absence of Descemet's-endothelium complex and partial absence of the posterior cornea has been demonstrated.

**Congenital Aniridia**

On histopathological examination, iris muscles are absent with iris hypoplasia. Incomplete cleavage of angle has also been demonstrated.

**CHED**

On histopathological examination, the peripheral cornea had relatively normal endothelial cells, whereas, in the mid-periphery, the endothelial cells were attenuated. In the central cornea, the endothelial cells were completely absent.

**Sclerocornea**

In sclerocornea, there is abnormal and disorganized collagenous tissue with vascularized stroma and an absent Bowman's layer.

**Congenital Iris Ectropion Syndrome**

The iris surface is lined with endothelial cells with hyperplasia of pigmented epithelium of the iris.
