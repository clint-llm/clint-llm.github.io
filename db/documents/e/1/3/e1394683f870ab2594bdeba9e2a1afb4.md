The etiology of asymptomatic bacteriuria has not been conclusively determined. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is more common among women than among men probably because of the shorter female urethra, which gives bacteria from the urethral meatus and the perineum a shorter distance to the bladder. In fact, most women have transient bacteriuria after sexual intercourse, but few of these women will develop symptomatic infections because the body's normal defense mechanisms prevent symptomatic infection in most cases.  In the elderly, it is thought that incomplete bladder emptying contributes to the increased incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria.
