The size of the foramen ovale can vary between individuals. Generally, the foramen ovale is ovular and has been shown to occupy 33% of the whole developing atrial septum. Investigation shows that fetuses between 17.5 and 37 weeks in gestation with variances in the size of the foramen ovale have a risk of congenital defects. Those with lower ratios of foramen ovale size to atrial septum have associated left heart obstructive diseases, like coarctation of the aorta. On the other side, those with larger ratios have associated right heart obstructive issues, like Ebstein anomaly, pulmonic valve, or tricuspid valve abnormalities.
