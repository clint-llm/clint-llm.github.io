The exact etiology of visceral aneurysms is not established. Recent literature has suggested that true aneurysms develop secondary to arterial wall weakness due to several causes. These include atherosclerosis (32%), medial degeneration or dysplasia (24%), abdominal trauma (10%), hypertension, connective tissue diseases, and necrotizing vasculitides such as polyarteritis nodosa or Wegner granulomatosis. Pseudoaneurysms are periarterial hematomas that develop as a consequence of iatrogenic trauma or inflammatory processes such as chronic pancreatitis. Pseudoaneurysms lack a true wall hence they are more prone to rupture.
