Above-the-knee amputations may be necessary for many reasons. These can include trauma to the lower leg, which results in a non-viable leg at or near the level of the knee. Below-the-knee amputation may adequately address a more distal injury. Many studies have attempted to create algorithms to help physicians decide when to reconstruct versus amputate. One of these is the Mangled Extremity Severity Score (MESS), which takes into account skeletal/soft tissue injury, limb ischemia, shock, and patient age.

Other indications include infection, which has compromised the entire lower leg and is unresectable. Etiologies may include non-healing diabetic wounds, necrotizing fasciitis, or cases of immunocompromised patients. Tumors that are unresectable or whose resection would render the distal aspect of the limb non-usable are yet another indication for this procedure. Vascular compromise, whether from injury or disease, which cannot be corrected, can also necessitate an AKA. Additionally, congenital disabilities that render a limb non-usable can indicate the need for this amputation.
