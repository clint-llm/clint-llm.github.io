The oculomotor or the third nerve nuclei are in the dorsal midbrain, ventral to the cerebral aqueduct. Multiple subnuclei of the third nerve complex are found ventral to the periaqueductal gray matter in the midbrain. Branches from the multiple nuclei converge to form a fascicle that travels ventrally through the midbrain, exiting from the medial portion of the cerebral peduncle to travel through the subarachnoid space in the interpeduncular cistern, traveling medially to the posterior communicating artery.

The trochlear nerve nuclei lie ventral to the cerebral aqueduct. Fibers of trochlear nerve exit the trochlear nucleus, course dorsally, wrap around the cerebral aqueduct and then decussate in the superior medullary velum. Distal to their decussation, trochlear nerves then exit the dorsal aspect of midbrain inferior to the contralateral inferior colliculus, then travel around brainstem between the superior cerebellar and posterior cerebral arteries (smaller than oculomotor nerve but similarly passing between these arteries).
