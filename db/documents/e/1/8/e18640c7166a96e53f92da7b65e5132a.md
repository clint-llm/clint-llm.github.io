Cervical spine fractures are high-risk injuries with the potential for devastating neurological sequelae. Hence, a trained spine specialist should carry out subsequent evaluation and treatment. All patients with cervical fractures should be closely monitored with a follow-up to ensure continued cervical stability and healing. Any fracture extending into the foramina transversarium from C2 to C6 should beÂ evaluated for the possibility of co-occurring vertebral artery injury. This is most often done with computed tomogram (CT) angiogram.
