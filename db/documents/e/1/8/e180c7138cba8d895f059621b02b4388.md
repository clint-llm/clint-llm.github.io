EED is a skin disorder that is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes nurses and pharmacists. The diagnosis usually required a biopsy. However, treatment of EED is not adequate once it is established. The triggers or the primary cause must be treated; with all treatment recurrences are common. It often takes years for the skin disorder to resolve.
