**Bipolar Depression**

To diagnose a bipolar affective disorder, clinicians need to document one manic or hypomanic episode. The challenge with the pediatric population is that bipolar disorders often start with an episode of depression in childhood or adolescence.

**Adjustment Disorder**

The onset of symptoms in adjustment disorder occurs following a significant life event.

**Substance Use Disorders**

Either withdrawal from substances, for example, amphetamines or cocaine, or intoxication (alcohol) could present a clinical picture similar to depression. Depression could be diagnosed as a concurrent disorder if depressive symptoms persist or precede the onset of substance use.

**Medical Conditions**

Different medical conditions could present with depression, for example, multiple sclerosis, stroke, or hypothyroidism.

**Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder**

Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) could present with irritable mood, poor concentration, and these symptoms are similar to pediatric depression symptoms.
