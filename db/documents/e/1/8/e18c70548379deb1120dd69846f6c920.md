Radiation is the cornerstone of treatment for vaginal cancer, particularly in advanced stages. It combines EBRT and intracavitary radiotherapy (ICRT) or brachytherapy. The principal advantage of radiation is organ preservation. The standard of care EBRT to the pelvis includes the external iliac and obturator nodes. Additionally, the inguinal nodes may be included if the tumor is in the distal vagina.

CCRT for patients with vaginal cancer has increased and has demonstrated significant improvement in survival in several studies. In a National Cancer Database study of 13,689 patients, the median overall survival was 56.2 months with CCRT and 41.2 months with radiation alone (p<0.0005).

Radiation treatment is contraindicated in patients with verrucous carcinoma because it can provoke anaplastic transformation and worsen the prognosis.
