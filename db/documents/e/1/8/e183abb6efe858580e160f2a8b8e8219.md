Treatment:

- Pre-hospital GI decontamination is not recommended.

- Activated charcoal administration if an overdose is recent and patient, not vomiting, and able to maintain the airway.

- Airway management. Intubation in patients with severe respiratory symptoms.

Treatment is symptomatic and supportive.

In patients with nausea and vomiting, treat with antiemetics, and administer intravenous fluids as needed.

In patients with myelosuppression, treat with colony-stimulating factors in patients with neutropenia, platelets transfusion in patients with severe thrombocytopenia, and packed red blood cell transfusion in patients with anemia.

In patients with seizures, treat with antiepileptics.

Mild mucositis treatment is with bland oral rinses like 0.9 % normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and water. In moderate cases with pain, a local anesthetic is added. Treatment for moderate to severe mucositis is with local anesthetic and systemic analgesics. Oral antimicrobial mouthwashes can help to decrease the risk of infection.
