- HFI is an autosomal recessive disorder. Genetic counseling is important as both the parents of the affected individual are obligate heterozygotes (carriers) and there is a 25% chance of having a child with HFI, 50% chance of being a carrier, and 25% chance of not being affected.

- Educating the child and adults regarding the importance of dietary restriction and adherence is needed. The primary objective of dietary restriction is to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with this disorder.
