Many variables are present in gram-negative infections; therefore, the prognosis of the diseases caused by these pathogens is difficult to measure and is not unanimous in the literature. However, such infections are usually associated with poor outcomes, mainly in elderly patients, with a history of comorbidities, those with solid organ transplantation, and malignant diseases. Treatment success also depends on the causative microorganism and the site of infection. Serious infections with high mortality rates are related to delayed antibiotic therapy or inadequate therapy, while appropriate antibiotic administration correlates with patient survival. Besides, the lack of a well-defined protocol for these infections may lead to treatment failure since suboptimal or inadequate administration contributes to poor results. Finally, monotherapy is also ineffective, especially when compared to combination therapy, which is related to a good prognosis.
