For transabdominal US full bladder is recommended and required for adequate visualization of the pelvic organs. The fluid within the bladder displaces the gas-filled colon and acts as an acoustic window facilitating better visualization of pelvic structures. The patient is therefore asked to drink water and hold urine before the ultrasound examination. The bladder can be retrogradely filled by placing a bladder catheter in children who do not have bladder control. The patients lie supine on the bed. The area to be scanned (pelvis) is exposed, covering the rest of the abdomen with a drape.

The patients are asked to void before the transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) examination. The patient is placed in a lithotomy position for TVS.
