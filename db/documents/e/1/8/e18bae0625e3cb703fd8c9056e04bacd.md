The technical success rate for PCN with dilated calyces without stones is usually at least 95%

Benefits of PCN include the following:

- Can save nephrons immediately and give a greater chance than other interventions to save kidney function.

- Can relieve pain from an obstruction.

- Can create a better chance to treat infected urine than medicine alone.

- Is less likely to result in injury to abdominal organs, causes less muscle injury and pain, and leaves a much smaller scar than surgery.

- Less manipulation of ureteral stones.Â  Can use a larger tube for improved drainage compared to transurethrally placed retrograde double J stents.

- When used for pyonephrosis and urosepsis, fever resolution and pain relief typically follow rapidly within just one to two days.
