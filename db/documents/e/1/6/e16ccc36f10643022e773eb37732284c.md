Treatment and management of alexia are focused on rehabilitation strategies to improve reading. The treatment modality for alexia depends on the neuroanatomical area affected, as described above. For individuals with intact letter recognition, a letter-by-letter approach to reading is used in which each letter is sounded out individually.Â For patients with intact writing skills, a kinesthetic approach is used. In this approach, the patient will trace or outline the letters and sound them out by the tactile input provided from writing the letter. These tactics can be used regularly to increase reading speed over time. Although this may improve symptoms, a definite cure for the disorder has not been found.
