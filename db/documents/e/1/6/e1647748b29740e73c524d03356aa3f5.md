Differential diagnosis is especially important for acquired cases of nipple inversion. Clinical findings like erosion, inflammation, erythema, eczema, bloody nipple discharge, or a palpable subareolar mass may accompany nipple inversion. Malignancy of the breast, Paget's disease of the nipple, erosive adenomatosis of the nipple, florid papillomatosis, subareolar ductal papillomatosis, and breast eczema are the main differential diagnoses for acquired causes.Â Post-surgery changes, fat necrosis, fibrocystic disease, and Mondor's disease are other benign etiologies. Rare causes include syringomatous adenoma of the nipple, nipple leiomyoma, and Borrelia-associated lymphocytoma cutis.
