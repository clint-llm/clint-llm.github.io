Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is an essential topic in pediatrics that is frequently overlooked, especially in the context of children with neurodevelopmental delay. The American Thoracic Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics define obstructive sleep apnea in children as a sleep-related breathing disorder with intermittent upper airway obstruction that disrupts normal sleep patterns. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea.
- Outline the evaluation of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea.
- Review the management options available for pediatric obstructive sleep apnea.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication among primary care providers and specialists to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of pediatric obstructive sleep apnea and improve outcomes.
