Contraindications to chin augmentation using alloplastic implants include:

- Suboptimal vertical chin height (i.e., shortened mandibular height)

- Retrognathia associated with dental malocclusion

- History of previous rejection to the implanted material

A relative contraindication may include:

- Transverse chin asymmetry (may be addressed with a carefully shaped and customized implant)

- Deep mentolabial crease, as chin augmentation may accentuate this sulcus
