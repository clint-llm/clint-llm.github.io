Hyperphosphatemia, in general, is an asymptomatic condition. Mortality is mostly due to underlying conditions.

Short-term complications of hyperphosphatemia include tetany due to hypocalcemia. There can also be deposition of calcium/phosphate in soft tissues, subcutaneous tissues, and joints.

Increased serum phosphate is associated with increased mortality among dialysis patients. Research has shown thatÂ phosphate is a potential biomarker to predict mortality and reflect disease severity in critically ill patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy.

Acute phosphate nephropathy, due to mineral and bone disorder of the recipient, has been reported to cause graft failure in the renal transplant recipients.

In a study in ICU patients, researchers found that altered phosphate levels were associated with worse morbidity and mortality.
