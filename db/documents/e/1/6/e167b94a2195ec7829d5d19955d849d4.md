COP is associated with excellent, long-term outcomes when treated. Spontaneous remissions are seen in about 50% of mild cases. Patients demonstrate a rapid symptomatic response to treatment and up to 80% achieve complete cure. Relapses are common but do not seem to affect long-term outcomes in terms of morbidity and mortality.
