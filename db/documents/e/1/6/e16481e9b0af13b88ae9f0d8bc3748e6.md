The most common anesthetic agent used for dental procedures is 2% lidocaine with 1:100 000 epinephrine. In patients where bleeding can be a problem, 1:50 000 epinephrine is recommended for hemostasis. Articaine is frequently utilized in 4% concentration and with vasoconstrictors because of its vasodilatory effect. This agent has been reported to have a more prolonged effect than 2% lidocaine when used for the inferior alveolar nerve block.
