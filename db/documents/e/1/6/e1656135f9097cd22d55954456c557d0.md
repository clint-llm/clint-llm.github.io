Atrioventricular dissociation related complications arise from the associated hemodynamic compromise. Often from its causative insult, namely severe sinus bradycardia and ventricular tachycardia. Syncope is by far the most common complication. Further untreated effects of hypoperfusion can lead to severe complications such as acute renal failure (due to renal artery hypoperfusion) or myocardial ischemia.
