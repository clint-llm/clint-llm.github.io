Cardiac syndrome X (CSX) is characterized by typical or atypical anginal chest pain with no evidence of significant coronary vascular abnormalities visualized on angiogram. It is viewed as a type of ischemic heart disease with occurrence most prevalent in perimenopausal and postmenopausal females. To avoid the high morbidity and complications associated with this condition requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of CSX and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathogenesis of cardiac syndrome X.
- Describe the treatment modalities of cardiac syndrome X.
- Identify the complications of cardiac syndrome X.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and patient education in treating patients with cardiac syndrome X and improve outcomes.
