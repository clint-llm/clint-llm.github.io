When prescribing metronidazole or tinidazole, it is important to discuss alcohol abstinence with patients. These medications cause a disulfiram-like reaction when patients use alcohol while on these antibiotics. The recommendation is twenty-four hours of alcohol abstinence following metronidazole and seventy-two hours of alcohol abstinence following tinidazole.

IfÂ a clinician diagnoses a patient with trichomoniasis, they should educate the patient regarding safe sexual practices. The patient should be encouraged to inform their sexual partner(s) about the diagnosis so the partner(s) may pursue treatment. The patient should also refrain from sexual intercourse until both the patient and the partner(s) are treated, and symptoms have resolved.
