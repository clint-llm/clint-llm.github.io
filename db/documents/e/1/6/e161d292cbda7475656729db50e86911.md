Diphenhydramine is now available over the counter, but that does not mean that interprofessional healthcare team members should not pay close attention to when patients are using it, particularly if they are self-medicating; the clinician (MD, DO, NP, PA), nurse, and pharmacist needs to educate the patient on the safe use of this agent. While the drug is relatively safe, it should not be combined with alcohol, other sedatives, and hypnotics. The patient must be taught how to read labels and not take more than the recommended dose. Parents should be educated on the safe storage of this agent to prevent accidental ingestion by children. Interprofessional collaboration and information sharing will result in improved patient outcomes and help to preclude adverse events. [Level 5]
