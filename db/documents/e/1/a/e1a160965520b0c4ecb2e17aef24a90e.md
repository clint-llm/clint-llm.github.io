There are no specific contraindications for scalp reconstruction. Previous radiotherapy to the area may prevent the graft from taking, due to poor vascularity. The patient's health may prevent a general anestheticÂ which can limit what reconstruction is possible. Graft failure may require debridements of non-vital tissues.
