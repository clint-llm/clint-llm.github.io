Pyocystis is a severe form of lower urinary tract infection that results from the collection of purulent debris within the bladder. Pyocystis is sometimes referred to in the literature as ‘empyema cystis’ and ‘vesical empyema.’ Pyocystis is an uncommon condition that occurs exclusively in the defunctionalized bladder. It can cause a severe systemic infection and result in prolonged hospital stays, surgery, and death. To optimize outcomes and reduce morbidity, early identification and treatment must occur. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients with pyocystis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the pathophysiology of pyocystis.
- Identify the risk factors that make a patient susceptible to developing pyocystis.
- Summarize the treatment options for patients with pyocystis. 
- Describe the Spence-Allen procedure and its role in the management of pyocystis.
