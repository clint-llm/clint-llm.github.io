The posterior branch of the obturator nerve innervates the obturator externus muscle. The obturator nerve is a branch of the lumbar plexus and originates from the L2-L4 spinal nerves. Near the obturator foramen, the obturator nerve branches into posterior and anterior divisions.

The obturator internus muscle is innervated by the nerve to the obturator internus. This is a branch of the sacral plexus and originates from the L5-S2 spinal nerves. This nerve also innervates the superior gemellus muscle. However, some variation in the innervation of the superior gemellus muscle has been identified. It was shown that 60.4% of the time, the superior gemellus muscle received dual innervation from the nerve to the obturator internus and the nerve to the quadratus femoris.
