Patients with hydroa vacciniforme have significant psychosocial and emotional morbidity. According to studies, the most perceived impairment is the restriction on daily activities and life adjustments needed to minimize their disease. Furthermore, disfigurement from permanent scarring significantly impacts patients' lives.

The clinical course of hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma is aggressive with high mortality, especially when extracutaneous involvement occurs. In one study, 8 out of 12 patients died from complications of their disease an average of 5.3 months after initial diagnosis.
