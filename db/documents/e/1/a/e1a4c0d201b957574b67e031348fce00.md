The most common cause of chronic ischemia is coronary artery obstruction secondary to atherosclerotic disease. A newly recognized entity, more frequently described in female patients, is endothelial dysfunction or microcirculatory dysregulation, resulting in similar symptoms but without the presence of significant stenosis on angiography. Less common etiologies include coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal angina) and coronary anomalies which may rarely present with a similar picture.
