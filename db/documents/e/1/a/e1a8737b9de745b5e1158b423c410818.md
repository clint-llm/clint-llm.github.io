The slit lamp biomicroscope is a vital tool in any ophthalmologist's armamentarium. It helps in a detailed examination of the anterior and posterior segments and picks up subtle findings to reach a particular diagnosis. It also aids in examination with various accessory devices. A routine slit lamp examination requires combined efforts of ophthalmologists, nursing staff, optometrists, and ophthalmic technicians to diagnose and manage ocular pathologies.
