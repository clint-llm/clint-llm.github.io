Presenting manifestations depend on the histological subtype, the size of the tumor, and the rapidity of growth. Mature teratomas, which are slow growing, can often be diagnosed incidentally. The common clinical symptoms of mediastinal non-seminomatous germ cell tumors are cough, dyspnea, chest pain, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Rarely the tumor can compress critical structures such as the superior vena cava in the mediastinum resulting in manifestations of superior vena cava syndrome such as facial plethora and prominent neck veins. Compression of the bronchus can result in post-obstructive pneumonia, and hemoptysis can be seen when erosion into the bronchus occurs.
