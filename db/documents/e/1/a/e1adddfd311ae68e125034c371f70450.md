After a four-corner fusion, patients should be immobilized in a short-arm volar splint for 2 weeks, at which point a custom splint is worn for an additional 6 weeks or until radiographic evidence of healing is confirmed.

Gentle finger range of motion and strengthening are started at 2 weeks, but wrist motion and strengthening are not initiated until there is radiographic confirmation of union.

Patients should expect a 50% loss in wrist range of motion compared with the contralateral side. Grip strength should return to about 80% of the unaffected side.
