Patients with meniscal tears usually present to the emergency department with pain or difficulty moving the knee joint. These tearsÂ are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes the emergency department physician, nurse practitioner, orthopedic surgeon, physical therapist, and radiologist.

The initial treatment of the acutely painful, edematous knee in which meniscal tear is suspected should consist of the RICE principles and pain control. In addition, bracing or knee sleeves may be used for protection and compression, and early pain-free knee and ankle ROM exercise may help to limit the loss of motion and aid in edema control.

Simple injuries are managed conservatively, but complex injuries are usually managed with surgery. Physical therapy will be part of the management plan in both conservatively managed, and surgical cases; the PT should follow the plan laid out and inform the orthopedic team through the nurse regarding patient progress. Rehabilitation following meniscal repair typically includes restrictions in knee flexion ROM and the weight-bearing status during the first 6 weeks postoperatively. An orthopedic nurse can coordinate medical care and therapy, answer patient questions, and note patient progress or lack thereof, keeping the treating clinician abreast of all developments. The recovery is often prolonged, but overall most patients achieve a satisfactory outcome with full use of the knee.
