Identification of low fluid in the antepartum setting may allow adequate patient counseling regarding expectations during labor, as well as identify patients early who may be candidates for interventions such as amnioinfusion. Patients require education regarding the purpose of electronic fetal monitoring, their options for continuous or intermittent monitoring, and the potential consequences of monitoring such as cesarean section. Additionally, the potential benefits of fetal monitoring require a review as well.
