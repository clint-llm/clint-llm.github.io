Pulmonary papillomas are rare lesions that are best managed by an interprofessional team including pulmonologist, surgeon, otolaryngologist and nurses. These lesions should be excised surgically to prevent a recurrence. There is a very small risk of malignancy and hence follow up with serial imaging studies is recommended.

Most patients have an excellent outcome.
