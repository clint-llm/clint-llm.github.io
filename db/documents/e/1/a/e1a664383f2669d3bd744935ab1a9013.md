Gastroschisis is the main differential diagnosis of omphalocele. In gastroschisis, the intestinal protrusion is usually to the right of the midline, and there is no involvement of the umbilical cord. The membranous sac is a major distinguishing feature of the two conditions as gastroschisis is characterized by free-floating bowel loops, but in the case of a giant omphalocele, the membrane can occasionally rupture in-utero.

Other differential diagnoses include hernias of the umbilical cord with covered abdominal wall defects less than 2 cm, body stalk anomaly characterized by an umbilical cord absent or severely shortened associated with scoliosis.
