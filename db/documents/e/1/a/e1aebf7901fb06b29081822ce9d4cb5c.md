Based on evidence currently available, routine clinical scanning of every woman during pregnancy using real-time B-mode imaging is not contraindicated. American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) and National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) regulated that the ultrasound device has to display the emitted energy through the thermal index (TI) and the mechanical index (MI). Both indexes are not perfect indicators of the risks of thermal and non-thermal bioeffects, but currently, they should be accepted as the most practical and understandable methods of estimating the potential for such risks.

Acoustic outputs in B-mode and M-mode are generally not high enough to produce deleterious effects. The significant temperature increase may be generated by spectral Doppler mode, particularly in the vicinity of a bone. This should not prevent the use of this mode when clinically indicated, provided the user has adequate knowledge of the instrumentâ€™s acoustic output or has access to the relevant TI. Exposure time and acoustic output should be kept to the lowest levels consistent with obtaining diagnostic information and limited to medically indicated procedures, rather than purely entertainment purposes. This unequivocal demand of carefulness is best expressed by the ALARA principle (i.e., as low as reasonably achievable).
