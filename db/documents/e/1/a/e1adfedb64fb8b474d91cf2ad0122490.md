Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) represents inadequate blood flow through the posterior circulation of the brain, which is supplied by the two vertebral arteries that merge to form the basilar artery. The vertebrobasilar vasculature is also known as the posterior circulation and supplies areas including the brainstem, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, occipital and medial temporal lobes. Stroke may occur either due to occlusion of the vertebral or basilar artery or an embolus that lodges more proximally to the brain. In the emergency setting, VBI is an important differential diagnosis to consider. Its presentation may share features with other etiologies including labyrinthitis, vestibular neuritis, and benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). This activity reviews the evaluation and management of vertebrobasilar insufficiency and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the typical imaging findings associated with vertebrobasilar insufficiency. 
- Summarize the options available for the secondary prevention of vertebrobasilar insufficiency.
- Review the pathophysiology of vertebrobasilar insufficiency.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team members to ensure compliance with the medical treatment to prevent further episodes and improve outcomes for patients affected by vertebrobasilar insufficiency.
