Carpal tunnel syndrome is considered a compressive neuropathy of the median nerve that causes pain, paresthesia, and muscle wasting in the thenar eminence. It is diagnosed clinically based on a patient’s signs and symptoms. Females are three times more likely than males to be affected by CTS. Conditions such as pregnancy and arthritis are considered risk factors as well. People who perform repetitive motions or vibrations of the wrist, such as excessive typing, are more likely to be affected by CTS.

The median nerve has multiple branches. Therefore, the palmar cutaneous branch travels superficially to the carpal tunnel and is not affected by CTS. This branch is responsible for skin sensation over the thenar eminence. The recurrent branch travels through the carpal tunnel before returning proximally to innervate the muscles of the thenar eminence. Compression of the recurrent branch can lead to muscle atrophy of the thenar eminence.

Multiple physical exam maneuvers can be performed to identify CTS, and these include Tinel’s test, Durkan’s test, and Phalen’s Test. Additional modalities are not required for diagnosis but can provide useful adjunctive information, especially in complex presentations. Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and electromyography (EMG) are often used. NCV shows slowing conduction velocity, and EMG shows fibrillations and fasciculations of the muscles.

First-line treatment for CTS is non-operative and typically involves the use of NSAIDs, activity modification, and nighttime neutral splinting. If first-line therapy fails, steroid injections may be utilized and have shown transient improvement in 80% of patients. Surgical intervention may be considered if non-operative management fails to treat CTS and often results in partial or complete relief of symptoms in 75% of patients.

Atrophy of the hand muscles is a characteristic feature of ALS. It most often occurs in the thenar eminence while the hypothenar eminence is spared. This is known as the split hand sign, and it can be the initial presentation of ALS as it may appear before upper motor nerve signs. Kuwabara et al. used EMG on 77 patients with ALS and 171 patients without ALS, which confirmed thenar involvement and hypothenar sparing muscle wasting in early ALS.

Ape hand deformity is caused by damage to the recurrent motor branch of the median nerve. This causes the muscles of the thenar eminence to be denervated and lose function, specifically the opponens pollicis. People with this deformity are not able to perform opposition with the thumb. Damage to this nerve typically occurs at either the elbow or the wrist. Median nerve palsy may also present with ape hand deformity and typically occurs following a deep penetrating injury or blunt force trauma to the arm, forearm, or wrist.

Supracondylar humerus fractures may also cause this deformity. The anterior interosseus nerve (AIN), a significant motor branch of the median nerve, lies anterior to the supracondylar humerus and is at risk of being stretched, impinged, or pierced during fracture. This type of fracture is most common in children due to falling on an outstretched arm.
