- Congenital myotonic dystrophy (CMD) is a multisystem disease affecting many organs in the body. It is caused by a mutation in the DMPK gene.

- Infants appear weak, and sometimes require help with breathing and feeding.

- It is usually diagnosed by genetic testing for the targeted gene.

- There is no cure, but multiple teams will follow the patient for symptoms management, surveillance, and family support.

- Unfortunately, the mortality rate is up to 40% in the neonatal period secondary to respiratory failure.
