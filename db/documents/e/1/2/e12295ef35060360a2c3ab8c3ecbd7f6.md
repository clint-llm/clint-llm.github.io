Porje initiated the research on isosorbide in Stockholm, and the drug was marketed in Sweden in 1946. Isosorbide dinitrate was synthesized in the United States in the 1950s by Harris and colleagues. After introducing isosorbide, its popularity temporarily decreased as Needleman and his colleagues questioned its efficacy as it underwent extensive biotransformation in the liver.

**FDA Approved Indications for Isosorbide Dinitrate**

- Prevention or treatment of angina pectoris resulting from coronary artery disease - however, it is not recommended for use once the anginal episode has started because the onset of action is not sufficiently rapid enough to abort an acute anginal event. In the latter case, glyceryl trinitrate is preferable.

- Treatment of congestive heart failure. A fixed-dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine is approved to treat congestive heart failure in African Americans.

**Non-FDA Approved Indications for Isosorbide Dinitrate**

- Achalasia

- Diffuse esophageal spasms

**FDA Approved Indications for Isosorbide Mononitrate**

- Treatment of chronic angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease

- Along with non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB), it can be used as secondary prophylaxis in preventing recurrent variceal hemorrhage.
