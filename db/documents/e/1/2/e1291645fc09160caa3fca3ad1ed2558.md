Medication overuse headache (MOH) is thought to occur when medications intended to relieve headaches are consumed too frequently. Causal agents are varied and can include agents such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, triptans, ergot derivatives, and opioids, although any analgesic can potentially trigger medication overuse headaches. This activity describes problems associated with the overuse of medications intended to relieve headaches and the evaluation and management of medication overuse headaches. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of headaches.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of medication overuse headaches.
- Describe the pathophysiology of medication overuse headaches.
- Explain the various options for managing medication overuse headaches.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the prevention and management of medication overuse headaches and improve patient outcomes.
