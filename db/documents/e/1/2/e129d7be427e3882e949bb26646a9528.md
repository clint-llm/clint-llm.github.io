Cataracts can be evaluated by a number of steps as follows:

**History**

- The chief complaint of the patient, i.e., a decrease of vision

- Past ophthalmic history

- Any systemic disease causing or aggravating the symptoms

**Comprehensive ophthalmic examination**

- **Visual acuity:**can be assessed by Snellen chart to identify the severity of the disease and limitations in routine activities of life

- **Refraction:**Important factor to plan management

- **Cover test:**poor vision caused by cataract can be a reason for a divergent squint

- 
**Slit-lamp examination**

- **Pupillary responses:**to check the shape of the pupil, afferent and efferent pathways and relative afferent pupillary defect

- **Adnexal examination:**a thorough examination is needed to exclude any adnexal pathology, i.e., dacryocystitis, blepharitis, chronic conjunctivitis, lagophthalmos, ectropion, entropion, and tear film abnormalities - these conditions may predispose to endophthalmitis, so their diagnosis and optimization are necessary to treat cataract

- **Cornea:**important to asses whether cornea will able to handle operative trauma - arcus senilis is an important finding because it can obstruct the operative field clarity

- **Anterior chamber:**a shallow anterior chamber can make cataract surgery extremely difficult

- **Lens:**part of the lens involved can be an important factor to plan our surgical technique - nuclear cataract is harder while cortical cataract is softer in consistency

- **Fundus examination:**any pathology in the fundus, i.e., age-related macular degeneration can be an important factor to determine visual outcome after surgery that is why a thorough fundal examination is critical

**Investigations**

The following investigations can help diagnose and plan the management of the disease:

- **Intraocular pressure:**to rule out glaucoma

- **Dark Room Tests:**direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy

- **Fundoscopy:**to rule out any vitreous or retinal pathology

- **Biometry:**for intraocular lens (IOL) placement during surgery

- **Peripheral retinal assessment:**testing the projection of light in all quadrants

- **Macular function test:**like cardboard test (two-point discrimination), Maddox rod test, the laser interferometry, foveal electroretinogram, photo stress test

- **Ultrasound scan:**B-scan is advised to see retinal detachment or any vitreous pathology

- **Systemic diseases:**Blood glucose levels, electrocardiography, echocardiography, ultrasonography

- **Baseline tests:**Complete blood count, liver function test, renal function test, bleeding profile, Hepatitis B and C screening, chest x-ray
