Headaches are a common presentation in clinical practice and for the most part, are encountered by the nurse practitioner, pharmacist, and primary care provider. However, not only are there many different types of headaches, but in some cases, the cause may be something serious like a bleed in the brain or a tumor. Thus, headache management is best with an interprofessional team.

While the general practitioners may not be aware of all types of headaches, the key is to obtain a specialist referral when the diagnosis is unknown or is atypical. The nurse practitioner or primary care physician should not initiate complex treatments for a headache until there is confirmation that there is no serious underlying pathology.

Turtle headaches can be complicated to diagnose. They are highly underdiagnosed. For individuals who suffer from hypnic headaches, the broader, "alarm clock" style headaches that encompass turtle headaches are also challenging to diagnose. It is crucial for clinicians evaluating headache patients to take a detailed and complete history as that will be where the answer lies. It is also essential to rule out any significant secondary causes of the headaches, especially in the setting of an abnormal neurological exam. The pharmacist should provide patient education regarding the different types of headaches. Simply offering an NSAID is not always the right approach; many of these patients can benefit from a headache specialist consultation. Nursing staff can assist in evaluating treatment compliance and success, as well as reporting adverse medication events to the pharmacist or physician.

Long-term relief is attainable but requires an accurate diagnosis to attempt appropriate treatments.

Patients with headaches need long-term monitoring to ensure that the treatment is working. Headaches may be benign but can seriously affect the quality of life. Hence, a mental health professional should be consulted if there is evidence of anxiety or depression. Only with an interprofessional team approach can there be a reduction in the morbidity of headaches. [Level V]
