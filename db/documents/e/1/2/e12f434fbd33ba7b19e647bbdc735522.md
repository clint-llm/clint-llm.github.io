Actinic prurigo, also known as prurigo or hydroa aestivale or Hutchinson summer, is a photodermatosis that is characterized by intensely pruritic papulonodular lesions, primarily but not exclusively affecting sun-exposed areas. The condition is usually seen in prepubescent females and typically in the spring and can persist through winter. In severe cases, excoriations, cheilitis, conjunctival disease, and scarring may develop. The disease has a strong genetic component and is commonly seen in American Indians of North, Central, and South America. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of actinic prurigo and highlights the interprofessional team's role in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of actinic prurigo.
- Explain how to evaluate a patient with suspected actinic prurigo.
- Identify treatment considerations for actinic prurigo.
- Outline how an interprofessional team approach to evaluating, managing, and counseling patients with actinic prurigo will improve outcomes.
