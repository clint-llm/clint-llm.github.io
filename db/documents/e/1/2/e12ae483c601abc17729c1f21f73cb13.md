The two caudate nuclei lie near the thalamus in the center of the brain. The head of the caudate nucleus forms the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle, its body lies lateral to the body of the lateral ventricle, and the tail of the caudate nucleus lies above the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle.

The anterior portion of the caudate nucleus is connected with the lateral and medial prefrontal cortices and is involved in working memory and executive functioning. One can think of the head of the caudate nucleus as the cognitive and emotional portion.

The caudate nucleus and putamen connect to the substantia nigra and one another.

Association learning is another important function of the caudate nucleus. It plays a role in connecting visual stimuli with motor responses as well as learning with feedback. Lesions of the anterior caudate nucleus result in abnormal behavior, which does not correspond to rewards.

Lesions to the caudate nucleus and resulting deficits can further elucidate caudate nucleus function. Lesions to the caudate nucleus can result in abulia, or absence of will, an interesting outcome when considered in conjunction with evidence of its role in goal-directed behavior and motivation.
