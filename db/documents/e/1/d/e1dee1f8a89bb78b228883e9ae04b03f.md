Fibular grafting may be contraindicatedÂ in the following scenarios, as potential complications may arise after the fibular transfer:

- History of peripheral vascular disease involving the extremity

- History of trauma or surgery in the distal lower extremity

- Hypoplastic anterior tibial artery

- Venous insufficiency (potential for donor site complications)

- Recurrent infection (for non vascularized fibular grafting)
