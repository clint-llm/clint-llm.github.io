Anatomical considerations include:

- Surgeons can access the knee medially or laterally to the patella, superior or inferior to the patella.

- The patient should extend their knee with the quadriceps muscle relaxed at 20 degrees flexion.

- The physician shouldÂ place their thumb on the patella and push it aside as they insert the needle.

- During the suprapatellar approach, they should place it 1 cm lateral and 1 cm superior.

- Upon identifying the midpoint of the patella, they should insert a needle either 1 cm lateral or medial.

- They should aim the needle posterior to the patella and up toward the joint space, then squeeze or "milk" both sides of the joint space to facilitate aspiration.
