Acute hepatitis A is diagnosed by serologic testing to detect HAV-specific immunoglobulin (IgM) antibodies in the blood. Additional testing can include reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to detect the viral RNA. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-HAV emerges soon after infection and remains present for the person’s lifetime.

Blood work will reveal a mild lymphocytosis and normal prothrombin time. If the prothrombin time is elevated, it should raise suspicion of severe liver damage including risk for encephalopathy.

Hepatitis A is associated with an elevation in aspartate aminotransferase, which returns to normal in 4-6 months. Bilirubin levels are also elevated and if they persist one should suspect cholestatic liver disease.

Ultrasound is not done in routine cases of HAV.
