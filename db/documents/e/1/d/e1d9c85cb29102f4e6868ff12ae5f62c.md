Bacteroides fragilis is a bacteria that is a common component of the human colon bacteria. It has involvement in causing disease in humans under certain conditions. The human colon is lined by a mucosal barrier that protects body tissues from being invaded by the bacteria that inhabits the intestinal cavity. When the mucosal barrier is disrupted by trauma, surgery, or tumor, the bacteria invade the surrounding tissues through the disrupted barrier and start an infectious process. The human body's immune systems begin to combat the infection by an inflammatory process aiming to eradicate the infection. The inflammatory reactions of the body would manifest locally as abscess formation and systemically as fever, chills, and if the infection is severe, it may result in sepsis. The management of Bacteroides fragilis infection is usually by source control either by incision and drainage of the pus or aspiration along with antibiotics targeted toward the causative organism.
