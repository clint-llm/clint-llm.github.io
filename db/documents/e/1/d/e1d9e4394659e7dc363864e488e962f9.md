The surgical approach to UKA should allow adequate exposure of the medial compartment while minimizing the release of the soft tissues. The tibial resection should match the native tibial slope. The sagittal resection should be as close to the tibial spine as possible to maximize the area for positioning of the component without causing damage to the ACL. In the coronal plane, the part should be placed perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia.

The ideal position of the femoral component is central or slightly lateral on the femoral condyle to optimize tracking with the tibial component.

Other considerations in UKA include the use of mobile- (MB) versus fixed-bearing (FB) implants. MB implants were introduced in the 1980s and were designed to distribute loads over a large surface area to decrease polyethylene wear.

Another consideration is whether to use cement during component implantation. Cementing in UKA can prove challenging given the limited exposure and surface area. Furthermore, cementing prolongs the operative duration and may result in cementation errors.
