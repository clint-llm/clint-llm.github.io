LDL-C and HDL-C levels are essential for calculating the 10-year risk of ASCVD derived from the Lloyd-Jones et al. study, which is applicable for men and women, age 40 to 79, and African American/Non-Hispanic White.

Another risk-estimation tool identified as heart score, which is adopted by the European Society of Cardiology, also incorporates total cholesterol and HDL levels.
