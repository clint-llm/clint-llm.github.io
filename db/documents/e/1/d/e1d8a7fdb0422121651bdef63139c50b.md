Radiographs of the knee should be obtained to assess the knee for bony injury. Fractures through the tibial eminence should be visible on x-ray. MRI and CT can be obtained for further characterization of the injury.

Based on imaging review, in 1959 the Meyers and McKeever classification was published:

1. Non-displaced fracture (bony apposition)

2. Partially displaced fracture (posterior hinge)

3. Completely displaced - broken down into (A) not rotated, (B) rotated

4. Comminuted (later added by Zaricznyj in 1977)

Classification of these fractures is important as treatment algorithms are based on the amount of displacement and comminution.
