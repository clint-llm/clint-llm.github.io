While a pediatric surgeon is involved in the surgical management of patients with epispadias, it is important to include an interprofessional team of specialists. The involvement of a nephrologist in the management of children who are prone to the upper tract damage (having anomalies of the upper urinary tract) is crucial. The nurses play an indispensable role in the interprofessional group. Educating the parents and patients about urinary habits, teaching exercises of the pelvic floor, ensuring proper hygiene, and ensuring compliance to medications are few roles of nurses apart from being involved in the crucial immediate post-operative care.

The pharmacist also ensures that the child is on the right formulation and dosage of the antibiotics and anticholinergic medications. During the transitional care of these patients, the involvement of an andrologist/urologist and psychiatrist is often required to deal with the psychosexual issues. Thus, thorough planning and discussion with the members of the interprofessional group are needed to ensure optimal care and to improve the outcomes.
