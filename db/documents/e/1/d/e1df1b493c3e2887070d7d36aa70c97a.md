Tamoxifen has a black box warning for uterine malignancies, pulmonary embolism, and stroke in patients whoÂ are at high risk for cancer or who have ductal carcinoma in situ.

Like many cancer drugs, tamoxifen has many adverse effects associated with it, though serious and fatal ones are rare. The most common adverse effects seen in treatment are hot flashes, irregular periods, and vaginal discharge. Other common adverse effects include peripheral edema, hypertension, mood changes, pain, depression, skin changes and skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, weakness, arthritis, arthralgia, lymphedema, and pharyngitis.

Less common adverse effects may include insomnia, dizziness, headache, weight gain, abdominal pain, diarrhea, indigestion, urinary tract infections, thrombocytopenia, back pain, alopecia, ostealgia, and cataracts among many more. Due to the extensive adverse effects of tamoxifen, it is important for patients to discuss all adverse effects they are experiencing with their doctor.

Tamoxifen can also cause a local disease flare which may lead to increased bone and tumor pain. This can be associated with good tumor response and usually resolves quickly. In patients with bone metastasis, hypercalcemia may occur. If hypercalcemia becomes severe and not manageable, discontinue tamoxifen.
