Galeazzi injuries are associated with very high morbidity and are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an orthopedic surgeon, emergency department physician, therapist, orthopedic nurse and the radiologist. Galeazzi fractures are easily missed, particularly the DRUJ dislocation, as they can be difficult to identify on radiographs. When patients present with forearm and elbow fractures, an orthopedic consult should be made.

The complexity of Galeazzi fractures leads to a variety of outcomes. It is estimated that the overall complication rates of Galeazzi fractures are close to 40%. Children usually fare better than their adult counterparts. As time passes without the correct identified diagnosis, the more difficult it becomes to manage the injury, and the patient is more likely to have significant morbidity.

Even after treatment, recovery is often prolonged and rehabilitation is required to regain muscle strength and function.
