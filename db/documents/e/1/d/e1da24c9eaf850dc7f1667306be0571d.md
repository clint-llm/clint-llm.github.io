Previous literature has well established the relationship between heavy alcohol use and atrial fibrillation, although the underlying pathophysiology had relied mainly on loosely connected theories. In 2018, Yan et al. presented experimental evidence of the crucial involvement of JNK2/CaMKII pathway activation and its impact on diastolic calcium handling by cardiac myocytes in the development of paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation induced by binge alcohol consumption.

**Electrophysiological Effect of Alcohol**

Yan et al. used animal models (mouse and rabbit atria) and human atrial tissue (from donor's hearts with and without histories of alcohol exposure) for their study. Animal models were exposed to well-controlled alcohol concentration and artificially paced to trigger atrial fibrillation. The ease of induction and duration of atrial fibrillation in alcohol-exposed animals and human atrial tissue exceeded that of sham and non–alcohol-exposed human tissue. Using optical mapping techniques and immunoblotting experiments, the authors proceeded to establish a connection between alcohol-induced increased cardiac myocyte JNK2 signaling and cardiac myocyte calcium dysregulation.

Abnormal sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release during the repolarization phase of the action potential (diastolic phase of myocyte contraction cycle) increases the likelihood of a delayed afterdepolarization (DAD). Diastolic increase in calcium levels stimulates the sarcolemmal Na+/Ca+ exchanger. This generates a net inward positive depolarizing current (3 Na+ inward/1 Ca2+ outward). This current can prompt an action potential, which triggers atrial fibrillation in atrial myocytes.

**Autonomic Effect of Alcohol**

"Hangover," which is often observed after binge alcohol, is believed to be a mild alcohol withdrawal state, which is characterized by sympathetic hyperactivity and a decrease in the atrial refractory period. One study demonstrated a 17% increase in resting heart rate in healthy nonalcoholics 12 hours post-binge.

**Electrolyte Disturbances and Direct Toxic Effect of Alcohol**

Alcohol is well known to have a diuretic effect. Heavy alcohol use may cause loss of intracellular and extracellular electrolytes, which are essential to maintain the membrane resting potential and therefore increase cardiac myocyte automaticity.
