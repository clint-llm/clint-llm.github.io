Modern healthcare requires culturally competent interventions that acknowledge individual needs while connecting the individual to the whole, considering race, culture, and gender. These interventions are crucially significant for minorities such as the American Indians/Alaska natives (AI/AN). About half of AI/AN patients reported having a personal physician or healthcare provider.

This trend indicates an immediate need to set surveillance standards across national and local levels to narrow social inequity, establishing culturally competent prevention skills, and accelerating healthcare access for AI/AN patients. We retrospectively review significant health and clinical details of AI/AN to highlight patient needs that may help improve healthcare practices and specific native-health-based programs for AI/AN patients; this study may also generalize inclusive practices for treating several other minorities.
