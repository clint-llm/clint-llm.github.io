Osteoblastoma is an uncommon benign bone-forming neoplasm that accounts for about 1% of all primary bone tumors and 1 to 5 % of all benign bone tumors, and 10% of all osseous spinal neoplasms.

In most cases, the basis for diagnosis is from clinical, radiological, and mainly histopathological examination. Osteoblastoma has a variable radiologic appearance ranging from indolent to very aggressive.
