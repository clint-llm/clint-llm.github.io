In developed countries, the incidence of preeclampsia has been described to be between 1.5 to 10 cases in 100,000 deliveries. The condition is more prevalent in developing countries. The risk factors of preeclampsia are similar to those of preeclampsia and include nulliparity, non-White race, low socioeconomic backgrounds, plural pregnancies, and extremes of maternal age. Additionally, it is associated with an array of maternal medical conditions such as chronic hypertension, chronic renal disease, and autoimmune disorders. Obesity and maternal diabetes are also recognized as increasingly important etiologies. Fetal conditions, such as fetal hydrops, have been associated with preeclampsia.
