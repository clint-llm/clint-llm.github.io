The overall incidence of immune hemolytic reactions is not known. The prevalence of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions has been estimated at approximately 1 in 70,000 per blood product transfused. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction incidence is unknown because most patients are asymptomatic, so it is under reported. There is a large range from studies with estimates ranging from approximately 1:800 transfusions to 1:11,000 transfusions. The incidence of non-immune hemolytic reactions is also not known; however, it is thought to be very rare. Many systems have been put in place to try to reduce the incidence of hemolytic transfusion reactions due to human and machine error.
