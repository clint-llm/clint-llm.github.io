Dental infections most commonly occur when bacteria invade the pulp and spread to surrounding tissues; this can be due to dental caries, trauma, or dental procedures.

Periodontal infections first involve the gingival tissues causing gingivitis and, over time, periodontitis. The periodontal disease mostly results from poor or ineffective dental hygiene leading to plaque and calculus accumulation and subsequent inflammation of tissues that support the teeth, alveolar bone, periodontal ligament, and cementum. The etiology of periodontitis is multifactorial; while bacteria initiate them, the clinical presentation and outcome of the different forms of the disease are in the end determined by the inflammatory response and modifying and predisposing factors. The disease progression seems to be regulated by environmental and genetic factors specific in each patient

Streptococcus mutans is considered as the primary etiologic agent of dental caries, an infectious disease. This pathogen can access the bloodstream during dental procedures, causing opportunistic systemic infections. Thus, bacteremia, through the adhesion to the endocardium, is involved in infective endocarditis and peripheral arterial disease
