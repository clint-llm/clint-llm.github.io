The use of spironolactone for various FDA and non-FDA approved conditions has been reported, but clinicians must be careful when prescribing the drug. Communication between doctor and pharmacists is essential; the pharmacist should perform a thorough medical reconciliation of a patient's entire medication list. In doing so, healthcare professionals can identify multidrug related potentiation of adverse effects specific to spironolactone and thereby avoid starting the drug or discontinuing it versus switching to eplerenone if clinically appropriate. For example, cohort studies have identified beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers being co-administered with spironolactone as risks for the development of severe hyperkalemia, which would help decide the appropriateness of spironolactone.
