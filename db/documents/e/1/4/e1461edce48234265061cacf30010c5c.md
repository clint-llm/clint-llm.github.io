Conservative measures for vesicovaginal fistula often fail, and surgery is pursued. The literature reports varying rates of successful surgical fistula repair, ranging between 70 and 100%, with a similar rate for transvaginal or transabdominal approaches, in non-radiated patients, at 91 and 97%, respectively.

In one study, surgical repair of vesicovaginal fistula proved to be 100% successful (24 of 24 patients) when performed via the transabdominal route.
