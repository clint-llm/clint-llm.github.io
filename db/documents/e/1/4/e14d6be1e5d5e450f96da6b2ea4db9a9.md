Gastroparesis is a clinical condition associated with obstructive gastric symptoms in the absence of mechanical obstruction that is observed in a variety of clinical conditions. There is no definitive treatment for this condition currently. Unfortunately, management options are limited and mostly focused on symptom relief. Several new treatment alternatives are emerging to manage this condition but need further studies to evaluate clinical benefit.
