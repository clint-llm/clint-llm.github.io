Patients should be managed appropriately to receive the best care to improve outcomes and reduce morbidity. Given that calcium is implicated in various biochemical pathways, it is important to understand how it can be affected by various diseases and medical therapies. An interprofessional approach is recommended to tailor each patient’s needs and treatment accordingly. For example, patients taking bisphosphonates should receive continuous follow-ups for the adverse effects of long-term use, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, particularly in patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic bone disease.

Interprofessional patient care involving clinicians (MD, DO, NP, and PA), nursing staff, pharmacists, and possibly dieticians can address calcium levels and coordinate activity to provide corrective actions when necessary, leading to optimal patient outcomes. [Level 5]
