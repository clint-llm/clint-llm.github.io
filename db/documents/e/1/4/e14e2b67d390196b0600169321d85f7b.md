The clinical course of iron toxicity is divided into five stages. The progression from stage to stage may be very rapid, and not every patient goes through every stage.

- During the first stage (0.5 to 6 hours), the patient mainly exhibits gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms including abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, and hematochezia.

- The second stage (6 to 24 hours) represents an apparent recovery phase, as the patient’s GI symptoms may resolve despite toxic amounts of iron absorption.

- The third stage (6 to 72 hours) is characterized by the recurrence of GI symptoms, shock, and metabolic acidosis. Iron-induced coagulopathy, hepatic dysfunction, cardiomyopathy, and renal failure are also observed in this stage.

- The fourth stage (12 to 96 hours) is characterized by an elevation of aminotransferase levels and possible progression to hepatic failure.

- The fifth stage (2 to 8 weeks) represents the consequences of the healing of the injured GI mucosa including pyloric or proximal bowel scarring and obstruction.

A patient may present in or skip any of the five stages. Determination of the iron toxicity stage should be based on symptoms and clinical manifestations and not on time of ingestion.
