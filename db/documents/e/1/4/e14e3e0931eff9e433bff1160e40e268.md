Research has shown minimal added risk when performing this technique. Patients undergoing aortic root enlargement techniques do have higher perioperative morbidity and mortality when compared to those without enlargement. However, when strictly comparing only aortic valve replacements with aortic enlargement procedures with no added operative procedures, there was no difference noted. The aortic enlargement patient group was found to have lower risks of patient prosthesis mismatch. Despite longer on pump aortic cross-clamp time, patients who underwent aortic valve replacement with aortic enlargement procedure did not experience higher rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, complete heart block/permanent pacemaker implantation, or reoperation for bleeding.

- Infection

- Bleeding

- Damage to aortic outflow tract structures

- Damage to the conduction system

- Damage to mitral valve causing significant mitral regurgitation

- Detachment of aortic patch

- Dysfunction of the aortic valve if enlargement too great

- Patient prosthesis mismatch

- Reduced exercise tolerance

- Delayed left ventricular regression
