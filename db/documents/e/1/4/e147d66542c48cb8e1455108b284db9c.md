Patients undergoing resection for an MCN constituting a distal pancreatectomy or pancreaticoduodenectomy may develop diabetes mellitus by up to 20%. The patients need to be made aware and educated. Though having a resection for a confirmed benign lesion is unlikely to recur and does not mandate a follow-up. Whereas patients undergoing surgery for lesions with suspicious characteristics need regular follow-up with imaging.
