The sternohyoid muscle contributes to depression of the hyoid bone in speaking, chewing, and swallowing. If the sternohyoid muscle were to become injured, these mechanisms would become impaired. Also, if the nerve or blood perfusion to the sternohyoid muscle was to be compromised, the sternohyoid and the infrahyoid muscles could atrophy or even undergo necrosis.

The close relationship between the sternohyoid muscle and the thyroid gland makes the sternohyoid muscle a site of possible metastasis in thyroid cancers. If thyroid cancer spreads, it could affect the sternothyroid gland and manifest as a nodule in the muscle.
