After proper ankle reduction and immobilization in the emergency department setting, patients should be educated on several factors.  The patients should be provided with crutches or a walker and instructed to be non-weight bearing on the injured extremity.  The patient should be able to demonstrate that they understand and can follow these restrictions.  The patient should understand that if they were to weight bear, they risk re-displacement of their fractures or dislocation.  Patients should also be educated on splint management, most importantly, not to get the splint wet as this affects the integrity of the immobilization and can cause skin problems.  If their splint does get wet, they should return to have it changed.  The patient should be educated on proper pain management including Tylenol and NSAIDs as the first line, and if they are given a narcotic prescription to only use it as needed.

Patients should also be educated on the signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome.  While compartment syndrome is rare after ankle fracture-dislocations or pure dislocations

If the patient does undergo surgical fixation, patients are again educated on all of the above factors, as well as general post-anesthesia guidance.   Special attention is given to keeping the splint dry for wound-healing purposes in addition to the above-mentioned reasons.
