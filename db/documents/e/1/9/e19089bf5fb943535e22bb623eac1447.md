The preferred treatment method is dependent on the underlying cause, age, the severity of the deformity, and the absence or presence of neurologic deficits. Treatment is typically initiated in a conservative manner and may progress to the point that surgical intervention is required. In younger patients, kyphoscoliosis may be an incidental finding with little to no effect on function. However, if pathology is significant enough to cause pain, neurologic changes, concerns of cosmesis, or concerns of progression, then further testing and referral to a specialist are recommended.

In patients recommended non-operative management, treatment can include:

- Observation: In asymptomatic or minimally affected patients, physicians may choose to simply closely monitor over time. Management may include serial imaging studies and functional assessments to track curvature and symptom severity over time.

- Pain management: Conservative pain management includes the use of NSAIDs. Due to risks of respiratory compromise, the use of stronger pain agents (ex: narcotics) should be used judiciously by physicians and their patients. Muscle relaxers such as cyclobenzaprine are also frequently prescribed, however resulting lethargy should be discussed and monitored.

- Respiratory management: Structural abnormalities such as reduced lung volume secondary to a restrictive thoracic chest wall, decreased compliance, and limited diaphragm movements may result in restrictive lung disease and lead to chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure and alveolar hypoventilation.

- Cardiac management: Clinics should perform transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) to rule out a cardiac etiology and evaluate for right ventricular overload in which right ventricular systolic pressure would be elevated.

- Bracing: Bracing is used in skeletally immature patients in an effort to reverse or prevent progressive abnormalities. Orthotic bracing can be either soft or rigid, and depending on the curvature of the spine, it can range from the cervical spine to the sacral spine. The duration of use, the rigidity of the structure are dependent on the needs of the spine.

- Physical therapy and exercise: A recent Meta-analysis indicates that exercise programs utilizing stretching and/or strengthening programs have a large statistically significant impact on the improvement of thoracic kyphosis.

- Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) can be considered for patients with chronic back pain that is refractory to conservative interventions. It may be appropriate for patients that are deemed poor surgical candidates or for those that are averse to corrective surgery. In addition, it may be an option in those with failed back surgery syndrome.

- Yoga may alleviate pain in some, however, care should be taken to avoid extreme hyperflexion and hyperextension, especially in patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis.

- Lifestyle changes: Modification of habits and cessation of smoking and optimization of body weight may assist in symptom severity and improve quality of life.

- Emotional: Clinicians should also frequently monitor a patient's emotional well being and screen for anxiety and depression.

In patients experiencing neurological changes, operative management may be warranted.

Scoliosis surgery:

Usually curves greater than 45 and 50 degrees are surgically managed.

The two methods of surgical intervention are:

- Fusion surgeries - Posterior or anterior fusion

- Non-fusion surgeries - These involve instrumented or non-instrumented epiphysiodesis on the convexity side of the scoliosis curve. Wedge thoracostomy can result in thoracic insufficiency syndrome due to a combination of ribs and curves, which can be corrected by vertical expandable prosthetic titanium ribs (VEPTR).

Kyphosis surgery:

The various correction osteotomies for kyphosis include:

- Smith-Peterson Osteotomy (posterior column wedge osteotomy with the opening of anterior column) - used for Scheuermann kyphosis and flat-back syndrome

- Ponte osteotomy (posterior closing wedge osteotomy) - for the treatment of Scheuermann kyphosis

- Pedicle Subtraction osteotomy (three-column closing-wedge posterior osteotomy) - for kyphosis due to congenital, traumatic, metabolic, and infectious causes

- Vertebral column resection

Post-operatively, a patient's course should be closely monitored to optimize pain control and assess for any neurological changes. Surgery is not typically recommended in elderly patients given their high-risk profile and poor bone health, however, it can be carefully considered as an option for those patients affected by significant malformation.
