The mechanism of taste signals converting from the form of a chemical stimulus to electrical impulses for transmission to the brain requires specific ion channels and second messenger systems. The type of system utilized for transduction depends upon the taste itself.

As molecules of food enter the oral cavity, they reach “taste pores” on the apical surface of taste buds surrounded by microvilli known as “taste hairs,” binding to specific receptors on the cell surface and result in depolarization or activation of intracellular signaling by second messengers, depending on the type of taste sensation.

Following the creation of electrical impulses, they potentiate along their nerve pathways.
