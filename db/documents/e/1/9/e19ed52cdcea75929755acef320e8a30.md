Fetal ultrasonography is a standard and vital component of a comprehensive fetal evaluation in pregnancy. There are specific indications for using ultrasound in each trimester and assessing both the fetus and the mother by ultrasonography. Based on maternal and fetal risk factors, ultrasound timing and frequency are individualized to evaluate the fetal components at the highest risk for fetal anomalies. Understanding the types of fetal assessments and their indications in each trimester permits earlier detection and diagnosis of fetal anomalies allowing for a multidisciplinary management approach. This activity reviews the classifications and indications of fetal ultrasounds in each trimester and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in identifying the opportunities to screen and diagnose fetal anomalies to maximize patient autonomy and clinical outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review the terminology of fetal ultrasonography in pregnancy.
- Outline the clinical indications for standard and specialized ultrasounds by trimester.
- Describe the scanning protocol and techniques for a detailed first-trimester ultrasound and compare the components of a standard versus detailed second-trimester anatomy scan.
- Summarize the clinical implications of common fetal ultrasound abnormalities and their utility by an interprofessional team.
