The indications of adhesiolysis depend on several factors. Most of the time, it accompanies other primary procedures. Pur adhesiolysis procedure is not frequently don. Care is necessary to avoid adhesiolysis when there is not a clear indication. Adhesion will redevelop shortly after the adhesiolysis. It may not be to the same extent or configuration, but the re-development of adhesions is reality. Therefore, it is prudent to consider adhesiolysis only when indicated.

The following are known clinical scenarios to perform adhesiolysis:

- Bowel obstruction; this is by far the most common reason to perform adhesiolysis.

- Entrapment of structures, e.g., nerves, ureter, blood vessel, etc

- Unexplained abdominal or pelvic pain. This condition is a weak indication. Adhesiolysis should not be offered to patients until all the exhaustion of other causes of abdominal or pelvic pain. The patients realize that the chance of improving the pain with adhesiolysis is not high.

- Improving fertility; on a few occasions, adhesions might cause infertility. Adhesiolysis might be considered in these situations when it is potentially helpful.

- Other less specific indications including adhesiolysis around structures in preparation for another procedure, e.g., hernia repair.

Preventing adhesions might be an effective intervention to avoid and eliminate the need for adhesiolysis. Preventing adhesions after surgery has been the topic of many experiments and researches.
