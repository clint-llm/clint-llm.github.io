The Schirmer test is used in ophthalmic examination to measure tear production for the diagnosis of conditions such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca and dry eye, which can manifest in a number of symptoms such as foreign body or gritty sensations, burning/stinging, tearing, photophobia, and/or intermittent sharp pains in the eyes. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca refers to dry eye in general, as well as inflammation of the conjunctiva and cornea. Dry eye is divided into decreased tear production and increased tear evaporation subtypes, both of which result in an insufficient fluid layer (precorneal tear film) that normally covers the eye. It is the most prevalent ocular condition in elderly patients and one of the most common conditions seen in ophthalmology, with a worldwide prevalence between 5% to 34%. Risk factors for dry eye include refractive surgery, age greater than or equal to 50 years, and female sex. In 2007, the definition of dry eye was updated to designate it as a multifactorial disease involving the tears and ocular surface and causes discomfort or visual disturbance, with potential damage of the ocular surface. It is also accompanied by increased osmolarity of the tear film and an inflammation of the ocular surface.
