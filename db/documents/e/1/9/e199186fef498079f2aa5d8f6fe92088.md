Patients typically present with hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and pain in the anterior region of the neck after a recent traumatic tracheal intubation or upper airway instrumentation. There are reports of rare instances of severe cough, external blunt trauma**,**or spontaneous events that lead to this presentation. The development of respiratory problems, dyspnea, and pseudo asthma are also possible.

The clinician must first rule out life-threatening conditions such as stridor, dyspnea, and internal and external hematomas of the neck.Â The physical examination must include flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy and videostroboscopy to allow direct and dynamic evaluation of the laryngeal structures**.**
