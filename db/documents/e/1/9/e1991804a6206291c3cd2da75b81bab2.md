Any patient diagnosed with STS benefits from a multidisciplinary approach. The same applies to AS. The treatment for AS can be divided based on the stage of presentation (metastatic versus non-metastatic).

- Non-metastatic disease:

- Local surgery with R0 resection is the treatment of choice.
- AS is a high-grade malignancy. Hence peri-operative RT is always recommended. Small retrospective studies have demonstrated a survival benefit with local control.
- No study has shown a clear benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy. However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be considered in patients where the tumor size is large, and achieving negative margins may be challenging.
- In patients with locally advanced cutaneous-AS, small retrospective studies have shown benefit of adding weekly paclitaxel to RT to improve local control rates and prolong survival.
- Localized visceral angiosarcoma is a disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. A multimodality approach combining surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy must be used. Recent reports have demonstrated the benefit and safety of using proton beam therapy combined with chemotherapy for cardiac angiosarcoma.

- Metastatic disease: Metastatic disease is treated with chemotherapy. Cytotoxic agents, targeted therapy, and Immune checkpoint inhibitors are being explored in treating metastatic disease. 

- Cytotoxic chemotherapy- anthracycline-based regimens are usually the first line of treatment in a patient with any STS. However, in patients with AS, paclitaxel is an effective drug with comparable response rates to anthracyclines.

- Anthracyclines- In patients with STS, the response rate is between 16-36%. In most cases, a combination with another drug, ifosfamide, certainly increases toxicity but may not benefit the outcome.
- Taxanes: The antiangiogenic properties of taxanes make them useful in patients with AS. After numerous retrospective studies reporting benefits in AS, a small phase II prospective study (ANGIOTAX study) showed an ORR of 17%. However, two of the five patients with responses underwent surgery and achieved a complete pathological response.
- Other cytotoxic drugs like Ifosfamdie, Gemcitabine, Cisplatin are also active in patients with AS; however, they are usually not used as the first line of treatment.


- Targeted therapy

- Anti-VEGF molecule- Since AS is a malignancy arising from vascular endothelium, anti-VEGF therapy, particularly bevacizumab, gained a lot of attention for metastatic AS. However, a prospective phase II study failed to show any benefit.
- Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (TKI)- Several TKI (Sorafenib, Pazopanib, Axitinib, and regorafenib) have been tested in patients with AS. The drugs mainly target either VEGF or PDGFRA, which are critical to the growth of AS. Unfortunately, none of these drugs showed a beneficial response, despite clinical activity in patients with AS.


- Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). 

- Recent data suggest that ICI may be active in patients with AS.
