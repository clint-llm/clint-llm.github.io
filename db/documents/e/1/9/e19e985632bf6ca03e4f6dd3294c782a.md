Malignant mesothelioma is a rare growth of mesothelial cells strongly associated with asbestos exposure. Mesothelial cells form the lining layers of the viscera. Mesothelioma can occur at any mesothelial layer such as the peritoneum or pericardium. The pleural layer is by far the most commonly affected, giving rise to malignant pleural mesothelioma.
