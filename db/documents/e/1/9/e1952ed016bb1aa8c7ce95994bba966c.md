Iron is a critical component of the body. Its primary role is to store and transport iron (as myoglobin and hemoglobin) throughout the body. In an iron-deficient state, hemoglobin cannot be synthesized, with resultant microcytic anemia due to the formation of small erythrocytes.

The role of iron supplementation is to replace those iron stores and to encourage erythropoiesis and oxygen transportation throughout the body. Iron transport occurs via the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) across the cell membrane, where it is incorporated and stored as ferritin in the macrophage. This form then is converted to an absorbable Fe2+ ion, then sequestered by transferrin to various sites in the body, including the bone marrow for RBC synthesis. The iron combines with other components such as porphyrin and globin chains to form hemoglobin, which transports oxygen from the lung to other organs in the body.
