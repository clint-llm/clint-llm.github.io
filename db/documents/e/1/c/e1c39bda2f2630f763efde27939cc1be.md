The Apley grind or compression test is a physical examination maneuver first described by the British orthopedic surgeon Alan Graham Apley. It is commonly performed to evaluate potential meniscal injury of the knee, often in conjunction with the Apley distraction test.

Meniscal injuries are prevalent and correlate with significant pain, morbidity, and missed time from school, sports, and work. Meniscal injuries are very uncommon in patients younger than ten years old. Males are afflicted more commonly than females, and the assumption is that this relates to males engaging in more activities involving rotational injuries, such as contact sports.

Prompt diagnosis of these injuries with the proper physical examination, provocative tests such as the Apley grind test and Apley distraction test, and advanced imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential to provide appropriate treatment and a positive outcome for patients.
