Breast reconstruction with synthetic implants was first described in the 1960s. It was initially a single staged placement of a permanent implant, performed at the time of mastectomy. It has now evolved into a multi-stage process consisting of expander placement with tissue expansion over several weeks to months, culminating in the exchange of the tissue expander for the permanent implant. This is a commonly-utilized option for selected patients undergoing mastectomy due to the relatively uncomplicated nature of the procedure, which adds little extra time to the initial mastectomy. The expanders can also be placed after initial resection as a delayed repair, with the subsequent exchange for the permanent implant.
