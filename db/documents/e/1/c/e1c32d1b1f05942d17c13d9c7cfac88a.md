EIMs of IBD should be differentiated from extraintestinal complications that result secondarily due to chronic disease and malnutrition or treatment side effects. Musculoskeletal manifestations of IBD are the most common EIMs. However, side effects from intestinal IBD treatment may mimic these EIMs, including corticosteroid treatment leading to osteonecrosis and anti-tumor necrosis factor treatment leading to lupus arthropathy. It is also important to exclude differentials for IBD like celiac disease, lactose intolerance, peptic ulcer disease, irritable bowel syndrome, travelerâ€™s diarrhea, gastroenteritis, and colon carcinoma as they may present with similar features.
