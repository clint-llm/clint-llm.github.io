The pituitary gland is responsible for producing and secreting various hormones that play a vital role in regulating endocrine function within the body. The pituitary gland consists of an anterior and a posterior lobe. Hormones produced by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland include growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizingÂ hormone (LH), follicular-stimulating hormone (FSH), adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH), and prolactin (PRL). Hormones stored and released from the posterior pituitary are antidiuretic hormone (ADH)/vasopressin and oxytocin. ADH and oxytocin are produced by neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus. Trophic hormones produced by the hypothalamus stimulate or inhibit the production of different anterior pituitary hormones, affecting target organs.

Hypopituitarism is defined as a deficiency of one or more of the hormones produced by the pituitary gland. Hypopituitarism is associated with increased mortality due to increased cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and early diagnosis is important to prevent further morbidity due to the subtle presentation.
