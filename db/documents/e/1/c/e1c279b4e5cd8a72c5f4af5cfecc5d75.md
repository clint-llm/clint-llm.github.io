Puppies are the definitive host.

The eggs mature into an embryo in 2-6 weeks in the external environment. Humans get infected through the ingestion of contaminated soil or contaminated food. The embryo reaches the intestine and matures into a larva. The larva penetrates the intestinal wall and enters the systemic circulation. It is then carried to various organs like the heart, liver, lungs, and eyes.
