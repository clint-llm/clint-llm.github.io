In the clinical setting, the majority of grafts fail in the immediate post-infusion period; this is due to an extreme inflammatory response that occurs called the instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction. In this process, tissue factor on islet cells attracts and activates platelets resulting in a cascade of additional immune cell recruitment and clot formation. Anticoagulants and intense anti-inflammatory agents aim to minimize this process and subsequently prevent immediate rejection.

One of the main goals of islet cell transplantation is that patients will be able to achieve some form of insulin independence. The rate of insulin independence varies widely among centers, 20 to 90%. Long-standing experience with the infusion process appears to be the most influential factor in regards to the center's success rate. Insulin independence from islet cell infusion has an expiration date. Results are not lifelong and require another round of infusions after approximately three years to maintain independence. Beta cells can retain some function up to 5 years after infusion.

Islet cell transplantation is now in use in the clinical setting; however, the harvesting, curating, and infusion process continues to evolve as ongoing discoveries occur in the experimental setting. This process will continue, which will produce more consistent and sustainable results in the clinical setting.
