In the early 1900s, the four different blood types within the ABO blood group system were identified. Knowledge of these blood types and the implications associated with ABO incompatibility has improved patient care and decreased associated morbidity. This activity reviews the ABO blood group system, highlights complications of ABO incompatibility, and emphasizes the appropriate selection of blood products by the interprofessional team-based on ABO blood typing.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the ABO blood group system antigens and antibodies.
- Review the blood typing methods and reasons why discrepancies in blood typing can occur.
- Summarize typical scenarios of hemolysis due to ABO incompatibility.
- Identify appropriate blood products that should be ordered for patients in the context of their ABO blood type.
