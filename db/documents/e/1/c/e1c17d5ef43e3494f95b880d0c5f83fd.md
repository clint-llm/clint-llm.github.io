Microscopic examination reveals the degenerated epithelial cells along with mucinous secretions. Sometimes there can be an epithelial lined cyst on the top surface of the concretion. The concretions strongly stain for dyes to stain phospholipid and elastin, weakly for polysaccharides and lipids. They do not stain for amyloid, collagen, DNA, RNA, calcium, iron, and mucopolysaccharides.
