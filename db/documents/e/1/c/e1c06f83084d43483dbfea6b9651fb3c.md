Although thyroid adenomas are usually benign lesions, they should be monitored continuously for malignant potential; this requires the involvement of an interprofessional healthcare team consisting of clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists (particularly an endocrinologist), nursing staff, and depending on the therapeutic path chosen, possibly pharmacists. Clinicians may note the lesions on routine testing, and any ambiguity about how to proceed or the differential should involve an endocrinology consult. Nurses can assist in evaluation, counsel the patient, help monitor the condition, and coordinate activities between the various clinical personnel involved. In cases where thyroid tissue is surgically or otherwise removed or ablated, thyroid hormone therapy may be necessary, necessitating pharmacists performing medication reconciliation, verifying dosing, and patient medication counseling. The interprofessional team approach will help drive optimal patient outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]

The probability of malignancy for palpable thyroid lesions is higher than for non-palpable nodules.
