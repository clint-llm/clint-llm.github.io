Pemphigus is a serious skin disorder with very high morbidity. The role of the pharmacist is critical. When dispensing any thiol-related medication, the risk of drug-induced pemphigus must be considered. The sooner the drug is discontinued, the better the prognosis. Once the drug-induced pemphigus has developed, besides discontinuing the drug, the nurse or physician should educate the patient on a recommended diet. Certain foods contain phenols and thiols that can exacerbate the condition. Thus a dietary consult is necessary. Foods that contain phenol and thiol-like compounds include chives, garlic, onion, black pepper, cashew, and mangoes. For patients who develop burning pain, the pharmacist should encourage compliance with medical treatments and review how the medication is taken and possible side effects. Follow up of these patients is critical as many of them will require potent immunosuppressive drugs for symptom relief.
