In general, diagnostic workup with labs and imaging are not significantly helpful in establishing the diagnosis but may help rule out other differential diagnoses. A chest x-ray may show changes of barotrauma or near-drowning. It is very important to rule out pneumothorax when considering recompression therapy. CT and MRI are usually normal but may be helpful in finding other causes of the patient’s symptoms. Rarely CT or MRI of the brain may show air densities in arterial branches. Laboratory studies may reveal hemoconcentration or elevated CPK (in the presence of AGE).
