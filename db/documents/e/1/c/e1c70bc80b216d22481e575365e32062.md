Pacemakers are adjustable artificial electrical pulse generators that can be temporary or permanent. They frequently emit a pulse lasting between 0.5 and 25 milliseconds with a voltage between 0.1 to 15 volts and at a frequency up to 300 per minute. Pacemaker rate, pulse width, and voltage can be controlled. This activity reviews the pacemaker and its usages and illustrates the role of interprofessional teams in caring for patients with pacemakers.

**Objectives:**
- Contrast the physics of an artificial pacemaker with the heart's intrinsic pacemaker. 
- Identify patients that might benefit from a pacemakers. 
- Review the potential for pacemaker malfunction. 
- Explore strategies to optimize care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with pacemakers.
