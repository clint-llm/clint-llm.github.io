Variation in the incidence of radiation cystitis exists in the current literature. In general, the incidence of delayed radiation effects is estimated at 5% to 10%, and severe hematuria occurs 5% to 8% of the time. Differences in tumor type, the extent of cancer, type of radiation used, and total amount of radiation used create a wide range within the literature.

The average duration from completion of radiation therapy to the onset of symptoms is approximately 31.8 months. It develops more commonly in males than females (2.8:1).
