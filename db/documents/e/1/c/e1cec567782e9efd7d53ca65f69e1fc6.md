Healthcare providers can now monitor the common multi-drug combinations for association with adverse health outcomes analysis. A study identified the combination of acetaminophen, oxycodone, and prochlorperazine as overrepresented in the 30-days before emergency room visits. It is necessary to note that this association doesn't mean causation. Still, as indicators of patients' health, multi-drug combinations could be used to recognize patients at risk of an ER visit shortly.
