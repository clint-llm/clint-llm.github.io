Amoxapine is a second-generation tricyclic dibenzoxazepine antidepressant; therefore, it works primarily by inhibiting the reuptake of norephedrine in the neuronal synapses.HTR-6, 5-HT-6).

Amoxapine is primarily metabolized into two active metabolites by the liver through aromatic hydroxylation. The active metabolites are 7-hydroxyamoxapine and 8-hydroxyamoxapine, which reduce the incidence of diarrhea in patients after administering irinotecan chemotherapy.
