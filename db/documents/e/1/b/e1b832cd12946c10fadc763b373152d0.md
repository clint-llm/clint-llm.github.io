Multiple studies have recently and/or are presently investigating ipilimumab combined with other drugs and follow-up survival rates in previously treated patients. It originally received FDA approval in March of 2011 for malignant melanoma, including unresectable or metastatic melanoma.

Using CTLA-4 antibodies to fight cancer (which is the mechanism for ipilimumab) was pioneered by Dr. James Allison during his time as a director at the University of California, Berkley Cancer Research Laboratory. This work eventually led to his being a co-recipient, along with Tasuku Honjo, of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine.
