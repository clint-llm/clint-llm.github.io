As the underlying cause of YNS is unknown, the pathophysiology is also unclear. The most widely accepted cause of YNS is thought to be related to abnormalities in lymphatic flow. Based on their investigations involving quantitative lymphoscintigraphy, Bull et al. argue that unlike primary lymphedema, which is due to permanent structural lymphatic abnormalities, the abnormalities observed in YNS appears to be functional and potentially reversible.
