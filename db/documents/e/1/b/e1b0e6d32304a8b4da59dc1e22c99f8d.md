Lung nodules and masses can be challenging at times to diagnose and often require invasive procedures.

- **Percutaneous Transthoracic Lung Biopsy (PTLB):**This type of biopsy may also be referred to as a percutaneous or transthoracic needle biopsy in which a needle is inserted through the chest wall via CT or fluoroscopic guidance into the suspected area to obtain a tissue sample.

- **Open Lung Biopsy (OLB)**: Surgical removal of lung tissue for histopathological and microbiological analysis under general anesthesia.

- **Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS):**Endoscopic removal of lung tissue via the chest wall, which may also be referred to as VATS.

- **Transbronchial Biopsy (TBLB):**Biopsy using flexible bronchoscopy via the transnasal or transoral route usually preferred for central (accessible) lesions.

- **Cryobiopsy (Cryo-TBB):**Transbronchial cryobiopsy involves freezing and removal of tissue with the use of nitrous oxide and a specialized flexible probe.

- **Recent advances:**EBUS (Endobronchial Ultrasound) biopsy, Electromagnectic Navigation Bronchoscopy, Conr Beam CT, Robotic Bronchoscopy.

This article aims to review the various techniques of lung biopsy. An integrated interdisciplinary team approach has been discussed for carrying out various tasks related to the procedure, including nursing assistance and pre-procedure patient education.
