Melatonin is relatively non-toxic, although some mild side-effects have been reported with higher doses and extended-release formulations, including:

- Drowsiness

- Daytime sleepiness

- Headaches

- Nausea

No evidence suggests that people develop tolerance to melatonin. Avoid melatonin with benzodiazepines or zolpidem as it canÂ lead to excessive sedation.
