75% of cases are detected on a chest X-ray.  Often incidental findings of pulmonary nodules were found on x-ray.  As BCTs are commonly central lesions of the tracheobronchial tree, findings related to bronchial obstruction are commonly found. Overinflation of the lung as a result of air trapping due to the lesion can be seen as well as peripheral atelectasis distal to the lesion if the occlusion is large enough. 40% of cases will have atelectasis, while 25% will show a central lesion on Chest X-ray.  Homogenous increased opacities with volume loss may also be found on radiographs. In roughly 20 % of cases, BCTs develop in the periphery of the lung identified as a peripheral solitary nodule.

Further investigation with computed tomography of the thorax can help identify smaller lesions of the tracheobronchial tree.  Common findings include contrast enhancement of the highly vascularized lesion and/or calcification. A new CT sign called "bronchial tree sign," as explained by Dr. Coruh et al. can be used to differentiate Ct findings of carcinoid tumors from hamartomas.

Given the high likelihood of central lesions, bronchoscopy is often the most effective tool in diagnosing bronchial carcinoid tumors.  In conjunction, the measurement of biochemical markers in the body, such as urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and serum chromogranin A can result in a more confident diagnosis.

To effectively differentiate typical and atypical BCTs, surgical specimens are preferred when compared to biopsy and cytology via the use of bronchoscopy. Differentiation is confirmed via immunostaining for neuron-specific enolase, serotonin, calcitonin, and bombesin. Mediastinoscopy is suggested only when there is moderate to high suspicion for atypical carcinoid tumors. Further imaging for metastases is also indicated should there arise high suspicion for atypical carcinoid given its more aggressive nature.
