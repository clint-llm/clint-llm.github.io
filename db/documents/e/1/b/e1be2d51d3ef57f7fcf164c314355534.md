Contraindications include the following:

- ICD therapy is not indicated in those who do not have a reasonable expectation of survival with an acceptable functional status for at least 1 year, even if they meet implantation criteria for ICD specified in class I, IIa, and IIb recommendations above. (Level of Evidence: C)

- ICD therapy is not recommended for patients with incessant VT or VF. (Level of Evidence: C)

- ICD therapy is not recommended in significant psychiatric illnesses that may be aggravated by device implantation, or that may preclude systematic follow-up. (Level of Evidence: C)

- ICD therapy is not recommended in NYHA Class IV with drug-refractory congestive heart failure who are not candidates for cardiac transplantation or CRT-D. (Level of Evidence: C)

- ICD therapy is not recommended for syncope of undetermined cause in a patient without inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias and structural heart disease. (Level of Evidence: C)

- ICD therapy is not recommended when VF or VT is amenable to surgical or catheter ablation (e.g., atrial arrhythmias associated with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, LV, or RV RV outflow tract VT, idiopathic VT, or fascicular VT in the absence of structural heart disease). (Level of Evidence: C)

- ICD therapy is not recommended for patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias as a result of an entirely reversible disorder in the absence of structural heart disease (e.g., drugs, electrolyte imbalance, or trauma). (Level of Evidence: B)
