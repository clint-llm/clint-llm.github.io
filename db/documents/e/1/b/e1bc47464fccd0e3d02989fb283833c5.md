Continued instability is a risk for both operative and non-operative management. With advances in surgical techniques, stabilization procedures in high-risk patients have become more successful in decreasing recurrence.

Surgical complications must be considered. With capsular and labral repair, overtightening or prolonged immobilization can lead to stiffness. Bone block procedures may have complications with graft incorporation and hardware complications. In their 2019 systematic review, Williams et al. cited complications rates of 1.6%, 0.5%, 6.2%, 2.3%, 7.2%, and 13.6% for arthroscopic soft tissue repair, arthroscopic soft tissue repair with arthroscopic remplissage, open soft tissue repair, open labral repair with remplissage, open bone block procedures, and arthroscopic bone block procedures respectively. They cited a 10-fold increase in complications with bone block procedures.
