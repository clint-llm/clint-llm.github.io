**Clinically Significant Warnings and Precautions**

There are several clinically relevant precautions with imatinib use.

- Dermatologic: including cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and erythema multiforme (although the etiology of imatinib causing SJS is unclear)

- Embryo-fetal toxicity

- Fluid retention and edema

- Gastrointestinal disorders and perforations

- Growth retardation in children

- Hematologic toxicity (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)

- Hemorrhage (gastrointestinal and intra-tumoral grade 3/4 hemorrhages)

- Hepatotoxicity

- Hypereosinophilic cardiac toxicity (cardiogenic shock and left ventricular dysfunction have been reported in HES patients initiating imatinib therapy)

- Hypothyroidism

- Long-term use toxicity (cardiac, kidney, and liver toxicities suggested by animal studies)

- Pregnancy (category D â€“ avoid pregnancy while taking imatinib)

- Renal toxicity

- Severe congestive heart failure with left ventricular dysfunction

- Tumor lysis syndrome
