Penetrating trauma generally causes injury by three mechanisms: direct injury, cavitation, and the resulting shock wave.

Energy from the projectile causes a radial stretching that forms a temporary cavity with increased damage. The higher the energy mechanism, the larger the temporary cavity, and the greater the damage. Finally, a shock wave is created by rapid changes in pressure and temperature from the projectile.

Blunt trauma can cause bowel injury by either a crushing force, shearing force, or bursting force.

The most common site of duodenal injury is the second portion (36%). This is followed by the third portion (18%), the fourth portion (15%), and the first portion (13%).

Due to the proximity of other critical structures, duodenal injury rarely occurs in isolation. The most common associated injury is to the liver (17%), followed by the colon (13%), pancreas (12%), other small bowel (11%), and stomach (9%).
