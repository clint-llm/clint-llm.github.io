World Health Organization classification:

Recently, the classification of central nervous system tumors is moving toward a more molecularly oriented classification scheme.

In the 2021 WHO classification of central nervous system tumors, ependymal tumors are classified as follows:

- Myxopapillary ependymoma (grade 2)

- Subependymoma (grade 1)

- Classic ependymoma (grade 2)

- RELA fusion-protein positive ependymoma (grade 2 or 3, this is the only molecularly classified ependymoma)

- Anaplastic ependymoma (grade 3)
