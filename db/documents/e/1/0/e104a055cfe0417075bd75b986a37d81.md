Leydig Cells can be studied or observed using a variety of stains or methods. Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining is one of the most commonly used methods in the field. When staining a testicular specimen using HE stain, Leydig cells can be easily differentiated or isolated because they stain deeper than cells in seminiferous tubules. They appear as oval cells with big and round nuclei.

HSD3B staining is another possibility. 3Î²-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B) is an enzyme that catalyzes the biosynthesis of the steroid progesterone in Leydig cells, making it a specific stain because this enzyme is not present in other testicular cells. Leydig cells show different populations when stained with HSD3B depending on the uptake intensity, which is affected by the lipid content of cells.

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can also be beneficial by detecting the transcription of important enzymes in Leydig cells, including HSD3B6, CYP17A1, and StAR.
