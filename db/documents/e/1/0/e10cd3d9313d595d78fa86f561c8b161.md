There is a significant overlap in the clinical presentation of childhood absence epilepsy and juvenile absence epilepsy. The absences of childhood absence epilepsy are very frequent, up to hundreds each day and shorter in duration whereas the absences in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy are less frequent, with less severe impairment of consciousness and longer in duration than those in childhood absence epilepsy. Some studies refer to absences of CAE as pyknoleptic and those if JAE as non-pyknoleptic.
