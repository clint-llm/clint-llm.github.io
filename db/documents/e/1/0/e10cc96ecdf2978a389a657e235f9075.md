The incidence of arthropod bites and stings in the United States is difficult to quantify because most produce only minor symptoms that go unreported. The American Association of Poison Control Centers reported 28087 cases of arthropod exposures in 2015 which, because of under-reporting, represents only a small fraction of arthropod encounters.
