In 2010, the Peripheral Nerve Society published guidelines on performing and evaluating the nerve biopsy. Their Class IV recommendations are as follows

- The biopsy should only be performed after exhaustion of lab testing, electrophysiological findings, and thorough clinical investigation

- All providers involved should have a good working relationship as well as the open sharing of information in regards to the patient.

- The specimens should be evaluated by those with training and expertise in the matter

- The laboratory performing the analysis should have the ability to interpret frozen and fixed sections

- Although not necessary, additional tests that may be useful are immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, fiber analysis, and others.
