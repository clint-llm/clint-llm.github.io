Breast mastectomy for prophylactic or curative reasons can potentially affect a patient's well-being, gender identity, and gait balance, as well as fit and appearance of clothing. It is important for clinicians to recognize which patients are candidates for breast reconstruction and what options for breast reconstruction are available. This activity reviews postoperatively adjustable breast implants as one of the options for breast reconstruction. It further illustrates the important role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients that undergo breast mastectomy followed by breast reconstruction.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications of postoperatively adjustable breast implants.
- Describe the technique of postoperatively adjustable breast implants.
- Outline the potential complications of postoperatively adjustable breast implants.
