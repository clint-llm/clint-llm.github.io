Cutaneous horns can be treated surgically, medically, or via laser ablation. Diagnosis of the cutaneous horn, however, must be made after histological assessment due to its ability to appear like other conditions such as an ectopic nail.

Historically, cutaneous horns have been treated using simple detachment and cauterization of the base.

Ablative lasers like carbon dioxide or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet may be preferred for aesthetic considerations, as well as electrocautery.

Patients with cutaneous horns caused by underlying squamous cell carcinoma should also be evaluated for metastasis. For patients with basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, follow-up evaluations are necessary for the first three years after diagnosis. Given the other causes for the cutaneous horn, standard follow up for that entity is sufficient.
