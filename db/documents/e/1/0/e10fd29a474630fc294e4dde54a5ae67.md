LVADs are life-saving in patients with end-stage cardiac disease. They offer an intermediate to long-term solution for those with HFrEF. They are most commonly used as a BTT or as DT. The structure and function of these devices have evolved with time, and further developments and advances in this field should help to further reduce the mortality rates from advanced heart failure.
