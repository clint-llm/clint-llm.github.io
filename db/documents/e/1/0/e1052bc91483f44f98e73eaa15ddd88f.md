In the United States and other developed countries, prevention of sexually transmitted genital infections and complications mainly focuses on screening and treating nonpregnant sexually active women aged 25 years or younger on an annual basis. Screening for pregnant women is recommended and screening and treatment of women over 25 years of age are recommendations if there are identifiable risk factors, such as new or multiple sexual partners. Screening of young men in high-risk settings (sexually transmitted disease and adolescent clinics, correctional facilities) should be a consideration if resources allow. Urine or endocervical NAAT are the recommended screening tests. The prognosis is excellent with prompt initiation of treatment early and with the completion of the entire course of antibiotics; antibiotic treatment is 95% effective for first-time therapy.

No vaccine is currently available for either trachoma or chlamydial genital infections.

The healthcare team including clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists must work together to educate the patient on methods to avoid exposure and the importance of completing treatment.
