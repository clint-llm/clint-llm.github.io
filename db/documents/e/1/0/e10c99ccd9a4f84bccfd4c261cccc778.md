Foreign bodies are common but extremely varied. They range from being very difficult and very easy to remove - this means that they do not all require a trip to the operating theatre for their removal. For the easier foreign bodies, they are removable in the emergency department; however, there needs to be adequate support from surgical specialties to get involved for more complicated retrievals.

The key to enhancing outcomes is good communication with the patient. Not only when explaining all the complications and risks, but also that not all foreign bodies require removal.
