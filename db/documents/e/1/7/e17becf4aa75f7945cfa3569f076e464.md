The rhythm on ECG is usually clinically significant because of how it affects the rate. When the heart beats too slowly, it can cause hypotension and hypoperfusion. Symptoms include fatigue, dizziness syncope/near syncope, and exercise intolerance.

Accurate rhythm identification is important because treatment directly depends on what type of rhythm the patient has. RecognizingÂ the underlying cause of an arrhythmia is always indicated, and sometimes it is the only treatment necessary for the patient.
