Beryllium is a naturally occurring element typically distributed in soil and volcanic dust.

Beryllium exposure has since been linked to workers in nuclear, defense, electronics, biomedical, and semiconductor industries, with the number of exposed US workers ranging from 21,200 to 800,000 between the 1970s and 1980s.

Beryllium is typically used in industry as either a pure metal, beryllium oxide, or alloy. Beryllium oxide, in particular, is known for having a high heat capacity and is used primarily in select electronic equipment.****Beryllium alloys are involved in theÂ manufacture of cars, computers, sports equipment, and dental bridges.

Acute beryllium pneumonitis occurs after high-intensity exposure and results from respiratory tract inflammation. Depending on the solubility of the beryllium compound, both upper and lower respiratory inflammation can be seen, and this is not specific to beryllium. Due to increased workplace safety initiatives, acute beryllium toxicity has become rare after the 1980s.

A patient must become sensitized to beryllium to develop chronic beryllium disease via a cell-mediated type IV hypersensitivity mechanism. Patients with a specific HLA-DPB1-Glu polymorphism are more susceptible to beryllium sensitization. Beryllium-specific CD4+ T cells, in turn, recognize beryllium and induce proliferation. The release of various inflammatory cytokines results in granuloma formation and is histologically indistinguishable from sarcoidosis.
