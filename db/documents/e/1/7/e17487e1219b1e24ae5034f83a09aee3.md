**Advantages of UBT:**

- Noninvasive, safer, and cost-effective when compared to endoscopic evaluation.H. pylori, EGD evaluation could be negative. UBT has less tendency for sampling errors and more sensitive than EGD in these circumstances.

- UBT is convenient and preferred by many patients when compared to stool collection for SAT.

- UBT is more accurate than the SAT and serological tests.

- UBT is helpful for initial diagnosis (test-and-treat strategy) and also to confirm the eradication of infection.

- 13C-UBT can be easily repeated and also could be administered safely in children (above three years of age), and in pregnant women.

- 13C-UBTs are useful in the epidemiological evaluation of H. pylori in both children and adults.H. pylori and but unlike UBT, serological tests cannot differentiate past and present infections.

**Limitations of UBT:**

- Helicobacter heilmannii, another urease containing bacteria can also cause false positive testing.

- False positive test results in achlorhydria and also in oral contamination of bacteria with urease activity.

- Recent history of upper GI bleeding could affect the accuracy of UBT.

- 13C-UBT is less accurate in the pediatric population with sensitivity and specificity in the range of 75 to 100%.

- Low sensitivity in patients with a history of gastric surgery.
