Unconsciousness is generally caused by a temporary or permanent impairment of either the reticular activating system in the brainstem, both cerebral hemispheres, or bilateral thalami. The causes for an unconscious patient can be differentiated into structural pathology local to the brain or systemic pathology. This activity describes the risk factors, evaluation, and management of unconscious patients and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care delivery for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the types and frequency of tests that should be done routinely in unconscious patients.
- Outline how to evaluate the unconscious patient.
- Review management considerations for unconscious patients. 
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination, with particular emphasis on communication between interprofessional medical teams, to enhance prompt and thorough delivery of care to unconscious patients.
