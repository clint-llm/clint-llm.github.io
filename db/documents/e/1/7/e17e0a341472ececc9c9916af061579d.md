A lesion first described by German pathologist Eugen Albrecht in 1904, hamartomas are generally benign tumors that may occur in the lungs, skin, heart, breast and other regions of the body. The word hamartoma derives from “hamartia,” the Greek word for ‘erroneous,” or “faulty."

Pulmonary hamartomas can, therefore, be viewed as benign malformations of common lung tissue, to include cartilage, epithelium, fat, or muscle. They are the most common benign pulmonary neoplasm in adults. However, they are much more rare in children.
