Although the pathophysiology of brachial neuritis is not exactly known, there are 2 theories to explain the mechanism behind the development of this disease. The first one is that viral illnesses, one of the most commonly reported cases, will directly affect the brachial plexus thereby causing the symptoms.

For diseases with a vasculitic component such as polyarteritis nodosa, lupus, and temporal arteritis a vascular cause is thought to be responsible for the onset of brachial neuritis.

For pain that is associated with brachial neuritis, ischemia caused by either a mechanical or an inflammatory cause is thought to be related to the onset of sudden extreme pain
