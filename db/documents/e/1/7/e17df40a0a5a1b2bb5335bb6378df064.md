Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive measure of oxygen saturation. Capnography is a method of monitoring the concentration or partial pressure of carbon dioxide. This activity describes the use of capnography and pulse oximetry. as well as its clinical significance and limitations for patient care.

**Objectives:**
- Review the possible uses of capnography in monitoring patients with lung disease.
- Summarize the applications of capnography in monitoring patients with acute asthma exacerbations.
- Identify the limitations of capnography and pulse oximetry.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care when using capnography and pulse oximetry.
