Red blood cell (RBC) metabolism hinges on glycolysis. Pyruvate kinase (PK) enzyme is key to this process. PK converts phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate.****These metabolites enable RBCs to function effectively. In PKD, cellular energy efficiency and longevity decrease. Young RBCs are most affected in PKD.****Frameshift, deletion, and insertion type mutations can occur.
