Xeroderma is generally benign and may persist for years. The prognosis is favorable with avoidance of triggers and incorporating a skincare regimen focused on gentle cleansing and adequate moisturizing. In some instances, dry skin may occur as part of a genetic disorder (i.e., xeroderma pigmentosum, ARCI-lamellar ichthyosis, etc.) with further sequelae, such as an increased risk of skin cancer.
