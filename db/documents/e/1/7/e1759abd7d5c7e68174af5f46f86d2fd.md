Juvenile open-angle glaucoma often occurs as a result of abnormal development of trabecular meshwork.

Juvenile-onset open-angle glaucoma has many risk factors such as:

- Male sex: in a study of 125 eyes with JOAG, 64% were male.

- Myopia: Researchers found 87% of JOAG individuals to be myopic in a study of 23 affected patients.

- Severe elevation of intraocular pressure IOP: it is a typical feature of juvenile-onset primary open-angle glaucoma. Generally, intraocular pressures range over 40 mmHg.

- African ancestry
