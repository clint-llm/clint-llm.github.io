The prognosis of pyocystis depends on the severity of the infection and systemic involvement. Milder cases may be managed in the community with antibiotics and intermittent bladder irrigation. Severe non-resolving infections require surgical management with either the Spence-Allen procedure or total cystectomy.

The need for a cystectomy in patients diagnosed with pyocytis is reported to be between 18.7% and 25%, however, due to the relative rarity of the condition, the number of cases in the studies was low, and a meta-analysis of a larger patient cohort is required to establish more accurate figures.
