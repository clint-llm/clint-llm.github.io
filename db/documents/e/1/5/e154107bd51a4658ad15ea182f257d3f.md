Management of acute beryllium exposure and sensitivity primarily involves removal from the source of exposure and symptomatic treatment alongside stabilization of any abnormal vital signs. Inhaled corticosteroids and short-acting bronchodilators can be used for symptomatic relief. Corticosteroids are the primary treatment of chronic beryllium disease, and many patients will see symptomatic improvement with steroid administration. Primary treatment is typically prednisone 40mg daily or every other day, with the response to therapy assessed every 3 to 6 months both clinically and radiographically. The prednisone dose can be reduced based on improvement in symptoms, CT findings of inflammation/fibrosis, and PFT results.

Despite early identification and treatment, progressive decline in pulmonary function and fibrosis is possible even in individuals who receive continued immunosuppressive therapy.

Due to the significant potential for side effects associated with long-term steroid use, the use of steroid-sparing therapies (e.g., methotrexate, azathioprine, or infliximab) may be considered in patients experiencing notable side effects.
