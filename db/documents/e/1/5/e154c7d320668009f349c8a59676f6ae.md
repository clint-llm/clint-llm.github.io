Many patients undergoing superior oblique tendon weakening procedures will develop double vision (more than a third of the patients). These patients will need further extraocular muscle surgery to control the double vision or will need to wear prisms. Too few patients have undergone neurosurgical, neurovascular decompression to allow assessment of complications of this procedure, although half of the patients developed fourth nerve palsy following surgery which resolved over weeks to months. All neurosurgical procedures carry morbidity and mortality.
