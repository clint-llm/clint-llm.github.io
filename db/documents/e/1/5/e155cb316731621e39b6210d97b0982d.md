The majority of adverse reactions associated with atracurium administration are related to histamine release. The most common side effects associated with histamine release related to atracurium administration are flushing and erythema. Less commonly, more severe adverse effects can occur and include bradycardia, bronchospasm, dyspnea, hypotension, laryngospasm, tachycardia, urticaria, and wheezing. Studies have previously demonstrated that a mean arterial pressure fall of 30 mm Hg can be seen within 2 minutes of administration. Histamine receptor type-1 and histamine-receptor, type-2 blocking agents have been used effectively to attenuate this hypotensive response. Slower injection speed, from 30 to 60 seconds, has also been shown to reduce histamine release and the associated adverse effects.
