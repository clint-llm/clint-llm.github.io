Bismuth subsalicylate (BSS) has been around for over 100 years and was first FDA approved in 1939. It was created prior to the practice of hygiene and sanitation for the cure of cholera infections. BSS has provided healthcare professionals with an alternative option to antimicrobials for the treatment of nausea and diarrhea. The primary indications of BSS involve gastrointestinal conditions and traveler's diarrhea.

**Diarrhea/Dyspepsia**

The FDA-approved indications of BSS are for treating diarrhea, heartburn, indigestions, nausea, and stomach upset. BSS is effective in situations where patients are experiencing mild gastrointestinal discomfort, as it reduces the severity and incidence of flatulence and diarrhea.

**Helicobacter Pylori**

One off-label indication for BSS use is to eradicateÂ Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) gastrointestinal tract infection.H. pylori infections.

**Traveler's Diarrhea**

Another off-label indication for BSS is for the prophylaxis and treatment of traveler's diarrhea. In developing countries, traveler's diarrhea affects at least 20% to more than 50% of tourists.

BSS may also be used to prevent traveler's diarrhea. However, its prophylactic efficacy was less than antimicrobials (62% versus 80%, respectively).
