Chancroid is an exceedingly rare sexually transmitted infection, both in the United States and globally. Knowledge regarding its true prevalence is made difficult by the lack of readily available diagnostic testing and by its similar presentation to other more common causes of genital ulcer diseases. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and complications of chancroid and underscores the importance of an interprofessional team approach to its management.

**Objectives:**
- Discuss the pathophysiology and histopathology of chancroid infection.
- Describe the evaluation process that should be employed to lead to a diagnosis of chancroid infection.
- Review the treatment options recommended in patients with chancroid.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes in patients who present with chancroid.
