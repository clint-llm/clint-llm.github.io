IBD is a complex disease with widespread systemic manifestations that can present as a challenge to healthcare professionals. As such, it requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team comprised of clinicians (including PAs and NPs), specialists, nursing staff, and pharmacists. When these various disciplines coordinate their activities, exercise open communication, and function as a cohesive interprofessional team, patient outcomes will benefit. [Level 5]

Several EIMs do not respond to intestinal-IBD treatment and hence require close monitoring and management to avoid complications. Musculoskeletal manifestations of IBD, including axial arthropathies, require frequent monitoring and coordinated management by gastroenterologists and rheumatologists. Regardless of being an ulcer, pyoderma gangrenosum has been known to worsen following surgical debridement due to pathergy. It is imperative to rule out pyoderma gangrenosum as the cause of an ulcer in IBD patients before proceeding. Additionally, pyoderma gangrenosum may require topical treatment by a dermatologist.

Patients diagnosed with PSC should be referred for colonoscopy and monitored under colonoscopic surveillance programs to exclude the presence of underlying IBD as both conditions increase the likelihood of the development of colonic dysplasia/carcinoma. Colonoscopy should be performed whenever PSC is diagnosed and repeated at 1 to 2 years interval in patients with IBD.
