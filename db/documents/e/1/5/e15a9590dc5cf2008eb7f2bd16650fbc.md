Each human cell holds 22 pairs of autosomes and a pair of sex chromosomes (female: XX, male: XY). In karyotyping, autosomes are sorted by size. Critical findings in conventional karyotyping reveal aneuploidies that involve having one or more extra chromosomes or having missing chromosomes and structural abnormalities such as translocation, deletion, duplication, inversion, insertion. These findings helpÂ to diagnose congenital diseases, specific syndromes, and solid organ and hematologic malignancies.
