Reported risk factors for hypoglycemic complications following bariatric surgery include female sex, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery history, longer time since surgery, and absence of preexisting diabetes.

A randomized controlled trial found no significant difference in the occurrence of hypoglycemia after SG compared with RYGB, but RYGB may be associated with more severe episodes.

There is wide variation in the reported prevalence of hypoglycemia post-bariatric surgery. This variation is likely due to different study methodologies, variability in testing, and definitions of hypoglycemia used. However, with increasing recognition of conditions such as asymptomatic hypoglycemia, meal-independent hypoglycemia, and the use of more sensitive methods such as CGM, it has become apparent that the condition is underreported.

Studies that have relied on patient recall of symptoms have noted a prevalence of post-prandial symptomatic hypoglycemia ranging from 0.1 to 34%.

The actual burden of this condition and risk factors are yet to be determined and would require extensive studies.
