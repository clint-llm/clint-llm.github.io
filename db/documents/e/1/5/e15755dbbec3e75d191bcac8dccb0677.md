A cross-sectional epidemiological retrospective study of SFN conducted in the Netherlands found an incidence of 12 cases per 100,000/year, with a prevalence of 53 cases per 100,000. This study found SFN to be more commonly seen in men and more frequently diagnosed in patients over the age of 65.

These disease rates are likely underestimated due to a lack of awareness and lack of standardized diagnostic criteria, with rates expected to increase in the coming years with increased awareness of SFN.
