CLE is more common in infants and is extremely rare among adults. Thirty-three percent of the cases are symptomatic at birth. Due to the severity of symptoms, most are diagnosed within the first six months of birth. The left upper lobe is most commonly involved (43%), followed by the right middle lobe (32%) and right upper lobe (21%) involvement. The involvement of the lower lobe is as rare as only 2% of the cases.
