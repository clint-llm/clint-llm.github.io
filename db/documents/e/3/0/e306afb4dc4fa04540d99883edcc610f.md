Patients need to understand the testing needed following CML diagnosis to check for metastatic disease and determine what phase the disease has achieved. Chronic myelogenous leukemia has 3 phases chronic, acute and blastic. The phase will dictate the treatment. They must also understand that CML relapse is possible following treatment.

Lastly, they need to be counseled on what to expect and their prognosis. Prognosis is affected by several factors, including:

- Patient age

- The disease phase

- The number of blasts in the blood or bone marrow.

- Spleen size

- Overall patientÂ health

They must also understand the ramifications and side effects of their therapy.
