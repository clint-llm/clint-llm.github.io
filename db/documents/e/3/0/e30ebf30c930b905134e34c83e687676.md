The main indication for the epilepsy surgery is the drug resistance as perÂ the consensus from the Task Force of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE).

The most common histological findings in specimens from epilepsy surgery have been hippocampal sclerosis in adults and focal cortical dysplasia in children.

The absolute indications for performing hemispherectomy include

- Sturge-Weber syndrome

- Cortical dysplasia

- Hemimegalencephaly

- Rasmussen syndrome

- porencephalic cyst and

- Hemiconvulsion-hemiplegia-epilepsy syndrome

The resective procedure is indicated in patients with lesions amenable to surgical removal.

The epilepsy surgery is also indicated in patients with seizure semiology showing characteristic clinical localisations.

The patterns of epilepsy surgery to be performed in the patients depend upon the multispectral governing factors such as the pathology, seizure semiology, and the clinical characteristics of the patients.
