OGs are found predominantly in the cerebral hemisphere white matter (80Â to 90% supratentorial), most commonly in the frontal lobes, but temporal and parietal lobe involvement is not uncommon. The tumor predominates in the cortical-subcortical location with diffuse infiltration throughout the adjacent white matter. OG has also been found to be intraventricular or subependymal, but this is rare.
