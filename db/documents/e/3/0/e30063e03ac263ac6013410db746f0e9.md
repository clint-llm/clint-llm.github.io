The initial evaluation of patients with suspected rhabdomyosarcoma should aim to identify the anatomic boundaries of the tumor because this decision determines the tumor stage, risk stratification, and treatment. The initial workup for patients with suspected rhabdomyosarcoma should include CT or MRI scan of the tumor, CT scan of abdomen and retroperitoneum, CT scan of the chest, bone scan, and bilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Additional studies can be performed based on possible sites of spread. A biopsy of the lesion is necessary for diagnosis. It is highly recommended that an experienced pediatric pathologist assesses the biopsy. The two major histologic subtypes, embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, show different clinical and molecular characteristics, reflecting differences in biologic mechanisms. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma presents throughout childhood in the trunk and extremities and harbors two distinguishing chromosomal translocations; the first and more common is t(2;13), and the second, less common, one is t(1;13)(p36;q14). Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma usually presents in children, mainly in the head, neck, and genitourinary sites. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma does not show specific translocations. However, most embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma shows loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the 11p15 locus, the site of the IGF-II gene
