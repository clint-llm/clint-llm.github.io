Mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a rare, reversible myocardial injury that presents with distinctive regional wall abnormalities of the left ventricle. This condition, predominantly found in postmenopausal females, usually presents after significant emotional or physical stressors. To avoid delayed diagnosis and proper treatment of this condition, health care providers need guidelines for timely and appropriate diagnosis and management of this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of patients who presented with suspected mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
- Review the risk factors for developing mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with suspected mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
- Summarize the typical imaging findings associated with mid-ventricular Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
