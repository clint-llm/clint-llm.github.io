UARS is the intermediate between that of normal subjects and that of patients with mild-to-moderate sleep apnea syndrome. The best outcome for the patient is strongly dependent on the early discovery and help of the patient's physician. However, some studies suggest that untreated UARS has an increased risk of arterial hypertension. It can also evolve into obstructive sleep apnea, particularly with increased weight or additional comorbidities and age.
