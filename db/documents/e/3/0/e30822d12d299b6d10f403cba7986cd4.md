Historical clues such as poor body hygiene, lack of access to clean clothing, homelessness, and residing in crowded, unsanitary conditions should prompt consideration for body louse infestation and louse-borne infections

The primary symptom of body lice infestations is severe pruritus.

The dermatologic findings in body lice infestation vary but include areas of pyoderma, erythematous macules, wheals, and hemorrhagic puncta. The severe pruritus associated with bites can cause intense scratching leading to excoriations and the development of secondary infections. In the setting of chronic body lice infestation, frequently bitten areas of the skin can develop notable thickening and discoloration, a condition known as “vagabond’s disease.” [CDC - https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/lice/body/disease.html] Dermatologic findings tend to be most prominent in areas where clothing seams are in contact with the skin, such as the waist, groin, thighs, and axillary folds.

Unlike head and pubic lice, infestation with body lice is typically diagnosed by finding eggs and lice in seams of clothing rather than on the skin.
