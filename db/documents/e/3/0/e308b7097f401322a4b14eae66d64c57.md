Patients with embryonal tumors usually present with signs of increased intracranial pressure, which may include headache, nausea, vomiting, irritability, and lethargy in decreasing order of frequency.

The location of the tumor, supratentorial or infratentorial, is important for the manifestation of symptoms. Those with an infratentorial location usually develop hydrocephalus with headache, vomiting, irritability, and lethargy. Ataxia or other cerebellar signs and cranial nerve palsies are common. They rarely have seizures.Â In supratentorial locations, vomiting, seizures, and headaches are common. Hemiparesis is present if the tumor affects the cortical motor areas or the descending tracts. The presentation is also affected by age. Younger patients present irritability, vomiting, and visual problems. Those older than three years usually show headaches, vomiting, and ataxia.

These aggressive tumors have a short prediagnosis interval between the first symptoms and the radiological diagnosis, with a median of 20 days.

A complete physical examination with emphasis on the neurological evaluation is essential. The neuro-ophthalmologist must evaluate visual problems as they are challenging to identify in younger patients.
