Internuclear ophthalmoplegia is an ocular movement disorder caused by a lesion of the medial longitudinal fasciculus. It is characterized by impaired adduction of the ipsilateral eye with nystagmus of the abducting eye. This activity describes the pathophysiology and presentation of internuclear ophthalmoplegia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its diagnosis and management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of internuclear ophthalmoplegia.
- Review the eye exam of a patient with internuclear ophthalmoplegia.
- Outline brainstem signs that may assist in localizing the site of the medial longitudinal fasciculus lesion in a patient with internuclear ophthalmoplegia.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by internuclear ophthalmoplegia.
