There is no guidelines-based treatment available for stunned myocardium. At present, no known medical therapy is available that can hasten the recovery of stunned myocardium. Since myocardial stunning is a transient phenomenon and myocardium regains full functionality after some time following reperfusion, the focus of care and medical therapy in patients with stunned myocardium lies in the treatment of underlying ischemic tissue. Ionotropic agents can temporarily assist in cases of severe myocardial dysfunction.
