Malignant or necrotizing otitis externa (NOE) is a life-threatening condition that occurs most commonly in immunocompromised patients and older patients with diabetes mellitus. NOE is an extension of the infection that can spread to the temporal bone, and it is typically caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (90% of cases). Early diagnosis is crucial as it has a high mortality rate; therefore, it should be suspected in patients with diabetes or immunocompromised patients with OE and fever that do not respond to treatment. Antibiotics with antipseudomonal coverage are the mainstay of treatment.
