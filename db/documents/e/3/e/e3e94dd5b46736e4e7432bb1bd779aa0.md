**Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**is the**gold standard**study to evaluate the brain and cerebellum. Many of the etiologies will be identified by this study.

Specific etiologies should be evaluated as follows:

**Physiological/psychiatric**: a good history and physical, complete metabolic panel (CMP), psychiatric history, nonpharmacological management, stressful situations (anxiety, fear, anger, and fatigue).

**Iatrogenic:**a thorough review of home medications and establish a timeline to determine whether starting or discontinuing any particular medication could have triggered the tremor.

**Vascular:**a comprehensive stroke workup including a good history and physical, screening of vascular risk factors, A1C, lipid panel, blood pressure measurements, brain and vessel imaging (head computed tomographic (CT) scan, head CT angiography, CT perfusion, brain MRI), 2D Echocardiogram with bubble study, Holter monitoring.

**Trauma:**a CMP, complete blood count (CBC), coagulation studies, head CT scan, CT angiography, brain MRI, MR venous, electromyography, or nerve conduction.

**Neuroinflammatory, autoimmune or paraneoplastic:**CMP, CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), antinuclear antibodies, extractable nuclear antigen panel, Sjogren and lupus anticoagulant studies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme test, head CT, brain and spine MRI, chest/abdomen/pelvis CT scan, and lumbar puncture with laboratory studies including cells with differential, glucose, protein, IgG index, myelin basic protein, oligoclonal bands, aquaporin four antibodies, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies, paraneoplastic panel, flow cytometry/cytology.

**Metabolic:**CBC, CMP, vitamin deficiency workup, ammonia level, liver ultrasound, abdomen/pelvis CT scan with contrast, advanced metabolic testing.

**Toxic:**urine toxicology, ethanol level, heavy metal testing.

**Hereditary:**CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP, copper/ceruloplasmin, slit eye lamp examination, head CT scan, brain MRI, genetic testing.
