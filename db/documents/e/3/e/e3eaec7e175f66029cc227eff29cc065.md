Spinal cord injuries are associated with numerous complications such as urinary tract infections, pressure sores, deep vein thromboses, autonomic dysreflexia, and chronic pain.

Autonomic dysreflexia occurs in individuals with SCI at or above thoracic spinal level 6 (T6). This condition often manifests as orthostatic hypotension. The symptoms of orthostatic hypotension are often challenging to treat. Symptomatic management with abdominal binders, elastic stockings, peripheral vasoconstrictor medications like midodrine, and mineralocorticoids like fludrocortisone can help. Increased salt intake can also help with volume expansion and help with symptom control.

There are also significant indirect costs through lost mobility, inability to work, and heavy caregiver burden.

The most common causes of mortality are pneumonia and sepsis.
