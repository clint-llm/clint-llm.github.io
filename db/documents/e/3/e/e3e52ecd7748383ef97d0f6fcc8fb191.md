Atelectasis is a partial collapse of the lung which causes shortness of breath. It may be the result of several different processes, most often associated with poor inspiratory effort, airway obstruction blocking air movement into the lung, additional pressure placed on the outside of the lung, or alterations in the production or function of a protein called surfactant in the lung. Treatment addresses underlying causes of the condition but consists most often of supportive measures, such as deep breathing, incentive spirometry, and providing supplemental O2.
