**Oral Administration**

Aminophylline comes in the form of an oral solution, oral tablets, and extended-release- tablets. The absorption of the solution and oral tablets give wide fluctuations of serum concentrations and therefore are usually not recommended. The extended-release tablets are absorbed slowly over 12 to 24 hours and provide a steady plasma concentration. The recommended dose ranges from 400 to 600 mg/day.

**Intravenous Administration**

Intravenous administration of aminophylline occurs via two methods. First, a loading dose is given to achieve a serum concentration of 10 mcg/ml. Then, the constant maintenance infusion follows once the serum concentration has reached 10 to 15 mcg/ml. The dosage depends on theophylline clearance and whether the person has taken theophylline in the last 24 hours. These dosages vary by age, body weight, and the health status of the patient.

**Loading Dose**

The loading dose is 5.7 mg/kg based on the ideal body weight for all age groups. Loading doses should be administered over 30 minutes at a rate not to exceed 21 mg/hr and should be calculated using ideal body weight. This dose is for patients who have not taken aminophylline in the past 24 hours.

The loading dose calculation must use the formula given below for patients who have taken aminophylline in the last 24 hours.

Loading dose = (Desired concentration - measured concentration) (volume of distribution)

Mean volume of distribution:Â  0.3 to 0.7 ml/kg

**Maintenance Dose**

Up to 1 mg/kg/hour as a constant infusion can be given depending on the ideal body weight and clearance rates.

**Intramuscular Administration**

IM administration is not recommended due to severe pain at the injection site.

**Rectal Suppositories**

These dosage forms are not widely used due to inconsistent absorption and the occurrence of proctitis.

**Dosing Considerations**

- Hepatic Impairment: Patients with hepatic dysfunction due to cirrhosis or any other cause require a dose adjustment. The maximum dose for such patients can't exceed 400 mg/day.

- Renal Impairment: No dose adjustments are needed for renal impairment in adults or children older than three months. However, in infants younger than three months, a large amount of theophylline is excreted in the urine, requiring a dose adjustment.

- Concurrent Illness: A good rule of thumb is that the maximum dose should not exceed 400 mg daily due to varying clearance rates for different concurrent illnesses.

- Smokers: Smokers require a higher dose as their clearance rates of theophylline are faster than non-smokers.
