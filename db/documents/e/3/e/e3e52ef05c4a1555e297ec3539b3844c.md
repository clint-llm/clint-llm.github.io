The first prenatal screening test was introduced in the 1970s: a single second-trimester serum test for maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, a marker of neural tube defects. Aneuploidy screening using maternal serum markers was introduced in the 1980s, and the number and complexity of offered screening tests have been on an upward trajectory ever since.
