Factor V Leiden (FVL) is a point mutation of factor V resulting in an elimination of the cleavage site in factor V and factor Va. This genetic defect increases the risk of thrombosis, especially in homozygous or pseudo-homozygous FVL-mutated individuals. Many individuals with the mutation will never develop a venous thrombotic event (VTE). The decision about VTE risk reduction (both primary and secondary) requires a great deal of clinical acumen, given that most people who carry the mutation will never have VTE. FVL is an autosomal dominant genetic condition that exhibits incomplete penetrance, meaning that not every person with the mutation will develop the disease. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and implications of factor V Leiden and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of FVL.
- Review the clinical manifestations of FVL, including the importance of combined thrombophilia conditions.
- Review the prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism during pregnancy and during the postpartum period for women with FVL with or without a family history of thromboembolism. 
- Summarize the treatment options for FVL.
