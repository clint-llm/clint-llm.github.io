Vasculitides are a group of highly variable disorders characterized by inflammation of the vessel walls in various organ systems. Vasculitis can target large, medium, and small-sized arteries, capillaries, and veins. Mesenteric vasculitis is a disorder of the vessels of the gastrointestinal tract,Â that usually occurs in association with vasculitis of other organ systems, though it can occur in isolation. This activity will broadly discuss the various disorders that can cause mesenteric vasculitis, their presentation, diagnosis, and management.
