Jessner lymphocytic infiltration of the skin (JLIS) is the term used to describe a rare, benign cutaneous condition characterized by papular or plaque-like eruptions that commonly involve sun-exposed areas such as face, neck, and trunk.

This disease is diagnosed by biopsy revealing perivascular and periadnexal clusters of plasmacytoid monocytes within the dermis, sometimes extending into the subcutaneous tissue. These cells, also known as plasmacytoid dendritic cells, play a vital role in the induction of autoimmune diseases and other skin diseases.

In 1969, the disease was included under the umbrella term cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia along with lymphocytoma cutis and malignant lymphomas used to encompass skin diseases with lymphocytic infiltrates. There is still debate about whether this disease is a unique entity or part of a spectrum of cutaneous diseases, including discoid lupus erythematosus, polymorphous light eruption, and possibly malignant lymphoma.
