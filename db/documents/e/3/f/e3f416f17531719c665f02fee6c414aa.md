Bowel adhesions are irregular bands of scar tissue that form between bowel loops, which are normally not bound together. The bands of tissue can develop when the body is healing from any disturbance of the tissue that occurs secondary to surgery, infection, trauma, or radiation. This activity explains the risk factors, evaluation, and management of bowel adhesions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of bowel adhesions.
- Outline the evaluation of patients with bowel adhesions.
- Explain the treatment strategies for patients with bowel adhesions.
- Identify the most common complications associated with bowel adhesions.
