In the United States to date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved several formulations of procaine in the form of procaine hydrochloride at 1%, 2%, and 10% concentrations. Dilution and addition of epinephrine may be undertaken depending on the procedure performed. A full discussion of such is beyond the scope of this review. Briefly, for infiltrative administration, 0.25% and 0.5% solutions are generally appropriate with a target single-dose total of up to 350 to 600 mg. Pediatric patients may receive a 0.5% solution for local infiltration with a maximum dose of up to 15 mg/kg. For peripheral nerve blocks, procaine solutions of 0.5%, 1%, and 2%Â  are generally appropriate up to 200 mL, 100 mL, and 50 mL, respectively. For neuraxial anesthesia, the 10% solution is usually the choice with total single doses ranging from 50 to 200 mg, depending on the extent of desired anesthesia with an injection rate of 1mL/5 seconds. For local and regional blockade, epinephrine may be supplemented to induce local vasoconstriction and prolong the duration of action at the local site of injection. Single administration dose should never exceed 100 0mg procaine hydrochloride. Patients with cardiac, renal, and hepatic disease and patients who are elderly or acutely ill should receive reduced doses.
