The exact mechanism is not entirely known. Anxiety can be a normal phenomenon in children. Stranger anxiety begins at seven to nine months of life.  Noradrenergic, serotonergic, and other neurotransmitter systems appear to play a role in the body's response to stress. The serotonin system and the noradrenergic systems are common pathways involved in anxiety. Many believe that low serotonin system activity and elevated noradrenergic system activity are responsible for its development. Therefore, it is selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) that are the first-line agent for its treatment.
