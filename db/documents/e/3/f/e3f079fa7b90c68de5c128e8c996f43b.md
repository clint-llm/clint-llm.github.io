Dehiscence of the geniculate ganglion is characterized by the absence of the osseous covering above the ganglion. This results in the ganglion being exposed at the floor of the middle cranial fossa.

Data suggests that this variant occurs in 14.5% to 30% of adult patients.

When dehiscent, the ganglion stands in direct contact with the dura mater. Therefore, the variant increases the risk of accidental injury during surgeries that require elevating the dura. Surgeries of this type include those that require accessing the cranial base, especially the middle fossa or structures inside the temporal bone.
