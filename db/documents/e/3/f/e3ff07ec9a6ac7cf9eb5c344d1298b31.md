Patients with Lown-Ganong-Levine pattern on EKG are at an increased risk of developing tachyarrhythmias. Certain medications that enhance conduction through the AV node make AVRT, and some atrial tachycardias occur; this is thought to occur due to alteration in the conduction and refractoriness of the AV node or atrial myocardium. As a result, some medications, such as sympathomimetics, should be utilized with caution in these patients.
