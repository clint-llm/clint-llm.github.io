It is extremely important to differentiate between hydranencephaly and severe-extreme hydrocephalus. Both disorders can present similarly, but prognosis and management are very different. A patient with severe-extreme hydrocephalus improves significantly clinically and radiographically after treatment, while those with hydranencephaly do not. If treatment is delayed, it can lead to catastrophic outcomes.
