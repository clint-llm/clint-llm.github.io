Like CVAs, stroke mimics may present with negative neurological symptoms, including speech difficulties, weakness or numbness of the extremities, and facial asymmetry. Stroke mimics may also present with positive neurological symptoms, such as aura, hallucinations, or delusions. The presence of positive neurological symptoms may help distinguish stroke mimics from CVAs.
