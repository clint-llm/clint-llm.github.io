The management of chigger bites is focused on symptom control with oral antihistamines or topical corticosteroid creams. Cold compresses may also help decrease discomfort and localized swelling. There is no role for covering the bite in nail polish, vaseline, or cream intended to suffocate the parasite.

Itching can be treated with topical menthol or calamine lotion. In severe cases, potent topical corticosteroids with occlusion may be used.

Scrub typhus is treated with doxycycline.
