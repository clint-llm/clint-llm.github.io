Patients with nightstick fractures are best managed by an interprofessional team. Patients with isolated fractures of the ulnar shafts are frequently seen initially by primary clinicians and emergency department clinicians. Such practitioners should have a low threshold for obtaining radiographs of the forearm with a reported history of trauma to the extremity and then referring to an orthopedic surgeon for further management. Nightstick fractures are almost always managed on an outpatient basis if the patient is not a polytrauma. Optimal patient outcomes are dependent on appropriate initial imaging at the time of initial evaluation, as well as appropriate follow-up with an orthopedic surgeon. If it is determined that the patient is a surgical candidate, it is important that the surgeon and all operating room personnel are comfortable with the relevant anatomy and surgical plan. Data from multiple sources and meta-analysis of retrospective studies were used for the purpose of this article.
