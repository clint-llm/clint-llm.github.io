The submandibular triangle is bounded anteriorly by the anterior belly of the digastric muscle and posteriorly by the posterior belly of the digastric muscle.

Superficial to deep dissection of the submandibular triangle involves passing through the skin, subcutaneous fat, superficial cervical fascia, platysma muscle, and deep cervical fascia before reaching the submandibular gland. The majority of the space within the triangle is taken up by the submandibular gland that helps produce salivary fluid secreted into the oral cavity. Additionally, the gland helps to facilitate lymph drainage from the lower gums, tongue, the floor of the mouth, and tonsils into the 3-6 lymph nodes contained within the triangle which lie adjacent to the submandibular gland. Unlike the parotid gland, the submandibular gland contains no intraglandular lymph nodes.
