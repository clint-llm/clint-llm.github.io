The treatment of uveitic macular edema is initially with steroids, and then it is modified with the help of other drugs depending upon the response of the patient. Following are the treatment options available:

- **Corticosteroids**: These are the mainstay of treatment. Systemic steroids are given for binocular uveitis or uniocular involvement not improving with peri-ocular injections: oral prednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg is started, which is slowly tapered. Peri-ocular steroids (posterior subtenon or transseptal) may be administered with triamcinolone acetonide (2 to 4 mg/0.1ml). Methylprednisolone acetate (40 to 80 mg) injection is indicated in unilateral cases of UME or where systemic steroids are contraindicated. Intravitreal triamcinolone (2 to 4 mg/0.1ml) or steroid implants are also used in recalcitrant cases. Fluocinolone (590 micrograms) implants slowly release the drug for up to 30 months. Dexamethasone (700 micrograms: duration of effect is around three months) is used quite often when the patient is not responding to periocular injections or for recurrent CME.

- **Topical steroids:**Topical steroids do not have much role in macular edema control but can be added to control anterior segment inflammation. Of all the drugs, difluprednate has superior posterior segment penetration.

- **Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs:**Though their role has not been effectively proven to control uveitic macular edema, they may have a synergistic action with steroids, e.g., bromfenac and nepafenac eye drops.

- **Immunomodulator agents:**Antimetabolites like azathioprine and methotrexate may be used. Azathioprine, a nucleoside analog, interferes with DNA replication and RNA transcription (dose up to 2 mg/kg/day). Methotrexate is a folic acid analog that inhibits dihydrofolate (starting 10 to 15 mg/week gradually increasing to 15 to 25 mg/week). Mycophenolate mofetil is an inosine monophosphate inhibitor (1 to 1.5 grams). Another group is T-cell inhibitors such as cyclosporine, an IL-2 inhibitor (1 to 5 mg/kg/day).

- **Biological agents:**These have been used in refractory cases of uveitis associated with UME in consultation with a rheumatologist. These are etanercept (TNF alpha receptor blocker) and infliximab (TNF alpha inhibitor).

- **Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)**: Bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05ml) and ranibizumab (0.5 mg/0.05ml) have been used as off-label in the treatment of UME. They have the disadvantage that they do not control inflammation and may sometimes worsen it and have a shorter duration of action. The advantage is that they do not cause glaucoma or cataract. AntiVEGF agents have a definite well-proven role in treating inflammatory choroidal neovascular membranes that can lead to retinal edema.

- **Surgical:**Uveitic CME in the presence of hyaloid traction on the macula and the presence of dense epiretinal membranes may require surgical intervention.
