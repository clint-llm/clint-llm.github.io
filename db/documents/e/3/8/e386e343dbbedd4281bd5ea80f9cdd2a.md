The most prevalent presenting signs and symptoms include cyanosis and desaturations. Neonates with PS-IVS become symptomatic following the closure of the patent ductus arteriosus as their pulmonary circulation is dependent on it. They rarely present or have the symptoms of decreased cardiac output due to obligatory right to left shunting at the level of atrial septum through foramen ovale. The presence of low cardiac output syndrome should raise suspicion for myocardial ischemia, especially in patients with coronary fistulae. As noted with many other forms of cyanotic CHD, these patients will not have an improvement in their cyanosis/desaturations with 100% oxygen delivery, failed hyperoxia test.

On cardiac auscultation, the examiner will note single first and second heart sounds. If there is a regurgitation of the tricuspid valve, a pansystolic murmur is audible at the left lower sternal border. An additional murmur related to the flow across patent ductus arteriosus might be audible in patients with patent ductus, especially following the initiation of prostaglandin infusion to maintain the ductal patency. The peripheral pulses and capillary refill time are usually normal except in patients with a severely restrictive right to left shunting at the level of atria.
