The severity of symptoms at the time of patient presentation correlates with the outcomes. Patients may have an altered level of mental status for several days after the acute overdose, but the majority will improve. Patient education is very important forÂ recurrence prevention. A detailed explanation is needed on coadministration of other medications and the patient also should be advised to keep all medications in a locked, secure place to prevent pediatric overdose. Of the 1880 documented cases in 2014, only 62 patients had a major outcome that included admission to the intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation, and no deaths were reported.
