Aducanumab is a newly approved agent identified as an amyloid beta-directed monoclonal antibody. It is indicated in the management of Alzheimer disease (AD).

Aducanumab therapy was tested in clinical trials in the subset of subjects with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of AD. The safety or effectiveness of inducting the amyloid-beta (Aβ)-directed antibody earlier in the disease course has not been analyzed or reported. Aducanumab received FDA's accelerated approval in 2021 based on subjects with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia associated with AD demonstrating a reduction in Aβ plaques.

Alzheimer disease is a progressive, chronic, neurodegenerative disease and the most common etiology of dementia.

Disease onset is quite insidious, causing a gradual decline of behavioral and cognitive abilities manifesting as an initial short-term memory impairment accompanied by impaired language, attention, comprehension, and executive functioning.

Knopman S. et al. analyzed the data from two clinical trials with aducanumab. The investigators conclude that the efficacy of aducanumab cannot be proven when the two clinical trials yield different results.

**FDA Approved Use**

The drug is approved for use in Alzheimer disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia stage of the disease.
