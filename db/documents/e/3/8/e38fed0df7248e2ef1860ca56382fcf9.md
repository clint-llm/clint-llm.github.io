Neutropenic enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe inflammatory disorder of the intestines that occurs in neutropenic patients. It is a critical condition that is associated with high mortality. Its pathogenesis is not fully understood. The thinking is that NEC occurs due to the translocation of bacteria through weak and friable intestinal mucosa that is damaged by chemotherapy. The diagnosis usually results from findings on abdominal CT in a patient with concerning signs or symptoms of neutropenic enterocolitis. Limited evidence exists regarding the treatment of NEC. Treatment primarily consists of IV antibiotics with bowel rest. Surgery is considered, if needed, for complications.
