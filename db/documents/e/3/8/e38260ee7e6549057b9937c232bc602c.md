Under normal physiological conditions, fatty acids are the main source of energy during fasting.

In carnitine deficient states, LCFAs cannot be effectively transported to the mitochondria matrix for oxidation and subsequent utilization in Krebâ€™s cycle and ketone body production. During periods of fasting, improper utilization of fatty acids impairs gluconeogenesis and characteristically leads to nonketotic or hypoketotic (no or minimal ketone body production respectively) hypoglycemia.
