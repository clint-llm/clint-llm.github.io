Light microscopy is the primary means for the magnified examination of tissue blocks. Most microscopes used in dermatopathology are compound microscopes. Compound microscopes offer two locations of magnification, the eyepiece, which traditionally has 10x magnification, and the objective lens, which is situated directly above the slide. Different microscopes can have varying magnification settings, but a standard microscope generally offers 10x, 40x, and 100x with objective lens magnification. The 100x magnification usually requires a medium between the lens and the slide, such as oil immersion. Light microscopy also generally shows cells as colorless, necessitating the need for various stains. Most tissue is initially stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).
