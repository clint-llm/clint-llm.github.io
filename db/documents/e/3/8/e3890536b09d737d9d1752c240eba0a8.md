Although the prevalence of microphthalmia varies between 1.4 to 3.5 per 10,000 births, there is a paucity of literature regarding the demographic profile of microphthalmia with cyst. Few studies have reported a prevalence as low as 0.3Â to 0.6 per 10,000 births.

Microphthalmia with cyst is a non-hereditary disorder without any gender predilection. It generally appears within the first few months after birth and may be detected as early as the neonatal period. Although the majority of the cases are unilateral, microphthalmia with a cyst can manifest bilaterally.
