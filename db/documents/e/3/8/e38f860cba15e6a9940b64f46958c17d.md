Familial Dysbetalipoproteinemia is caused by a genetic mutation in the gene for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) leading to Apo E2/E2 homozygotes.Â The most common isoform of ApoE is ApoE3. The primary cause of dysbetalipoproteinemia is the presence of another isoform of ApoE called ApoE2, which is different from the ApoE3 by a single amino acid substitution of cysteine for arginine at position 158.

Dysbetalipoproteinemia primarily results in the accumulation of remnant lipoprotein. ApoE is found on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles like chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), and intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL) and mediates their catabolism by binding to receptors in the liver. The presence of ApoE2 isoform on these triglyceride-rich particles leads to impaired binding of lipoprotein particles to lipoprotein receptors [LDL receptors(LDLR), LDLR-related proteins (LRP), and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG)]. HSPG contains a single transmembrane, polypeptide strand (core protein) to which sugar polymers are attached called heparan sulfates.
