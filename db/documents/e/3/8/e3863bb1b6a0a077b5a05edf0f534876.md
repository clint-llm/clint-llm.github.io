Testicles are the male reproductive glands located within the scrotum. Testicular cancer is cancer that develops from the cells in the testicles. Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in young men and is one of the most curable of all cancers. More than 95 percent of all men diagnosed with testicular cancer survive their disease. It most commonly presents a painless hard mass within the scrotum, in the testicles, mostly on only one side, and uncommonly on both sides. When cancer spreads to other sites such as the lungs, brain, abdomen, neck, etc., symptoms including nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, cough, shortness of breath, weakness, sensory disturbances, abdominal pain, lumps in the neck/groin areas, and back pain, can occur. Prompt evaluation is important to ensure early diagnosis and treatment and decrease the burden of treatment in advanced disease—medical evaluation, physical examination, and ultrasound of the testis.  Serum tumor markers and cross-sectional imaging follow. When suspicion for metastatic disease is present, additional imaging with computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen may be done for staging.

Both definitive diagnosis and initial management can be achieved by removing the mass along with the testicle. Further surgery or radiotherapy or chemotherapy will be based on the disease's stage and response to the initial management. In summary, it is one of the most curable cancers with excellent survival rates; having awareness about the disease and seeking prompt healthcare evaluation is of utmost importance.
