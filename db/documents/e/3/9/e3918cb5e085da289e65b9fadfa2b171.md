The sternoclavicular joint is a saddle-shaped diarthrodial joint that joins the upper extremity appendicular skeleton to the axial skeleton. The large medial clavicle articulates with the superomedial manubrium and costal cartilage of the first rib, forming a joint with very little bony stability.

Blood supply to the joint comes from the articular branches of the suprascapular and internal thoracic arteries.

Septic arthritis of theÂ sternoclavicular joint is rare and represents less than 1% of all bone and joint infections.
