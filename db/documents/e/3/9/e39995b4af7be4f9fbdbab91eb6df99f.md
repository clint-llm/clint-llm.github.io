**Heart Rate:**The clinical team should maintain the patient's heart rate above 55 bpm in patients taking nadolol. The heart rate specifically requires monitoring while escalating the dose, which can cause further bradycardia, and while withdrawing the medications, it can cause rebound tachycardia.

**Blood Pressure:**The blood pressure should be maintained above 90 mmHg systolic, especially while escalating and withdrawing the medication.

**Signs and symptoms of Exacerbation:**Abrupt withdrawal of nadolol can cause rebound tachycardia and reduced blood flow to the myocardial tissue, generating anginal symptoms or worseningÂ angina.
