Every joint has a different blood supply; however, there are patterns based on the histological classification of joints.

Fibrous joints are usually supplied by perforating branches of the proximal vessels. For example, the blood supply of the tibiofibular joint is derived from branches of the anterior tibial artery and the peroneal (fibular) artery.

Cartilaginous joints only receive their vascular supply at the periphery because cartilage is an avascular tissue. Intervertebral discs, for example, are supplied at the margins by capillaries from the vertebral bodies.

Synovial joints receive vascular supply through a rich anastomosis of arteries extending from either side of the joint, termed the periarticular plexus. Some vessels penetrate the fibrous capsule to form a rich plexus deeper in the synovial membrane. This deeper plexus, the circulus vasculosus, forms a loop around the articular margins that supplies the articular capsule, synovial membrane, and terminal bone. The articular cartilage, which is avascular hyaline cartilage, is nourished by the synovial fluid.

Lymphatic vessels for every joint follow the lymph drainage of the surrounding tissue; some joints house lymph nodes, like the popliteal lymph nodes in the popliteal fossa of the knee.
