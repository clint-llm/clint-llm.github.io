Ossiculum terminale or the apical odontoid epiphysis: Odontoid apex is derived from the fourth occipital sclerotome

The odontoid and axis bodies: Develop from the first and second cervical sclerotomes

Neurocentral synchondrosis: The epiphyseal growth plate that separates the first and second cervical sclerotomes

Subdental synchondrosis: This is a cartilaginous band that exists between the odontoid process from the body of the axis in most children less than 4 years of age and disappears by the age of 8 years.

Terminal apical arcade of blood vessels - The odontoid process depends on this arcade mostly for its blood supply and this anastomoses caudally with the deep penetrating branches arising from the posterior ascending arteries. The latter arises from the vertebral artery. Since the blood supply to the odontoid is precarious in this way, any vascular insufficiency of the terminal arcade can lead to ischemia and necrosis during embryologic development.
