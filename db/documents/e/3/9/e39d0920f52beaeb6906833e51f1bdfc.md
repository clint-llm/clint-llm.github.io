Tyrosine kinase inhibitorÂ keratitis is rarely severe, with most patients experiencing mild keratitis. However, the possibility of severe consequences, such as complete visual loss, exists in a minority of patients. Patients who are currently taking a TKI should be advised to seek immediate medical assistance if they experience periocular pain, photophobia, decreased visual acuity, foreign body sensation, and/or discrete redness, as these are signs of possible ocular toxicity. Patients tend to have a good prognosis when the disease is diagnosed and treated promptly.
