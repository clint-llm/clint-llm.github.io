Generalized pustular psoriasis is a rare and extreme form of psoriasis characterized by the presence of sterile pustules. The incidence peaks between 40 and 59 years of age, but infantile and juvenile cases are also reported. The age at onset tends to be earlier in those with pure generalized pustular psoriasis without plaque psoriasis. Generalized pustular psoriasis is often associated with metabolic syndrome and polyarthritis. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of generalized pustular psoriasis and the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with generalized pustular psoriasis.
- Describe how the evaluation for generalized pustular psoriasis is performed.
- Describe the treatment options for generalized pustular psoriasis.
- Describe the need for a well-integrated, interprofessional team approach to improve care for patients with generalized pustular psoriasis.
