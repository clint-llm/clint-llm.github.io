Even though predominantly a smoker’s disease, with a reported association of close to 90%, DIP has also been associated with other exposures and disease conditions including:

- Inhalation of marijuana

- Exposure to copper, beryllium (thus tool grinders, arc polisher, aluminum arc welder, machinist, tire manufacturing workers, among others)

- Occupational exposure to fire extinguisher powder and diesel fumes

- Nylon filaments in textile workers

- Use of medications like sirolimus, nitrofurantoin, tocainide, and sulfasalazine

- Autoimmune diseases like scleroderma and rheumatoid arthritis

- Recurrent episodes of DIP after lung transplant

It has been associated with certain infectious etiologies like Aspergillus, Hepatitis C, and Cytomegalovirus as well as with metabolic diseases like Gaucher disease.

Although adult-onset DIP is not identified with any genetic defects, DIP in children is a distinct clinical entity with a demonstrated genetic mutation in surfactant protein B and C causing dysfunction. It usually portends a poorer prognosis.
