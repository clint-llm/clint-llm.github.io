When patients present to the primary care provider or nurse practitioner with joint pain, the differential diagnosis is vast. Synovial chondromatosis is one condition that can present with joint pain and is best managed by an orthopedic surgeon. The management of primary synovial chondromatosis is through surgery. Current arthroscopic surgical techniques allow for arthroscopic surgical management; however, occasionally, open procedures may be necessary.

Post-operative management includes a progressive range of motion and strengthening of peri-articular muscle groups. Secondary synovial chondromatosis is initially managed by anti-inflammatory medication unless mechanical symptoms prohibit adequate function. At this point, surgical management is indicated. Surgical management should address improving long-term function and prognoses. As such, joint reconstruction or arthroplasty, in addition to removing loose bodies, is indicated.

An interprofessional healthcare team consisting of clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), orthopedic specialists, nurses, and physical therapists, engaging in open communication to ensure all team members have the information they need to advance the patient's outcome, will generate the best outcomes.
