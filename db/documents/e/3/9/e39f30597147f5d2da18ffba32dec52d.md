LP is one of the most common bedside procedures performed in the office, emergency department, or inpatient location. LP is required to diagnose infection, demyelinating process, malignancy, and also for myelography and cisternography. Additionally, LP is performed for therapeutic purposes to reduce intracranial pressure in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

There is an increase in the need for FGLP due to the increasing number of patients having spine surgery, high BMIs, or due to multiple failed blind attempts, or fear of failed attempts. FGLP is associated with a reduced rate of failure of LP in patients who have high BMI, prior surgery, or significant degenerative disease.
