Acute retinal necrosis is characterized by peripheral necrotizing retinitis usually due to infection with Varicella-zoster virus or Herpes simplex virus. Typically, acute retinal necrosis occurs in immunocompetent individuals, however, it can occur in immunocompromised patients. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment for patients with acute retinal necrosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the classic triad of acute retinal necrosis. 
- Review the workup that should be considered in a patient with probable acute retinal necrosis. 
- Explain how to treat a patient for acute retinal necrosis. 
- Outline well-integrated, interprofessional teamwork to coordinate care and provide prompt treatment to patients with acute retinal necrosis.
