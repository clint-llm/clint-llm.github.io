The diagnosis is based on the clinical presentation and ocular exam with a detailed history and review of systems, targeted laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

**Common Lab Tests**

- Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) – specific for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis)

- Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA) – suggestive of systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune conditions

- Complete blood count(CBC) with differential – identify infectious or inflammatory processes

- C-reactive protein – elevated in inflammatory conditions

- ESR – suggestive of giant cell arteritis, inflammatory or infectious processes

- HLA-B27 -  more useful in cases of uveitis; rare association with scleritis

- Lyme serology – rule out Lyme Disease, presents with recurrent diffuse anterior scleritis

- Rheumatoid factor – suspect for rheumatoid arthritis

- Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) -  suggestive of sarcoidosis

- Serum lysozyme – suggestive of sarcoidosis

- Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) – suggestive for syphilis

- Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) – suggestive for syphilis

**Imaging**

- Chest X-Ray – rule out sarcoidosis

- B-scan – assess for posterior scleritis

- MRI – can be used if B-scan is non-conclusive

- CT – can be used if MRI is non-indicated (posterior scleritis)

- Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) – can be used to differentiate episcleritis from scleritis

- Optical coherence tomography (OCT) – can display thickened sclera on anterior segment OCT and thickened choroidal tissue

- Anterior segment fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) – useful in visualizing necrosis
