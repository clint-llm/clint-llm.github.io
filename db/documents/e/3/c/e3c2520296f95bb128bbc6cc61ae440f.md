Epidermal inclusion cysts are the most common cutaneous cysts and can occur anywhere on the body. These cysts typically present as fluctuant nodules under the surface of the skin, often with visible central puncta. These cysts often become painful to the patient and may present as a fluctuant filled nodule below the patient's skin. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of epidermal inclusion cysts and highlights the importance of an interprofessional approach to caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of epidermal inclusion cysts.
- Describe the evaluation of epidermal inclusion cysts.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for epidermal inclusion cysts.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of epidermal inclusion cysts and improve outcomes.
