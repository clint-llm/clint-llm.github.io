ParaphimosisÂ commonly occurs iatrogenically, when the foreskin is retracted for cleaning, placement of a urinary catheter, a procedure such as a cystoscopy, or for penile examination.

**It is essential that all caregivers who regularly change Foley catheters routinely replace the foreskin at the end of the procedure to prevent the development of a paraphimosis.**
