Bruxism can be defined as the involuntary, unconscious, and excessive grinding of teeth. During bruxism, there is forceful contact between the biting surfaces of maxillary and mandibular teeth. Bruxism may occur while awake, which is then called awake or diurnal bruxism, and during sleep, known as sleep or nocturnal bruxism. The main cause of bruxism has not yet been determined, but it is believed to be multifactorial.

Bruxism can be subclassified into primary and secondary, whereas primary bruxism is not related to any other medical condition; secondary bruxism is associated with neurological disorders or is considered an adverse effect of drugs.

The recommended approach to managing bruxism includes three angles. The use of an occlusal splint - preferably the hard acrylic-resin devices - works more as a protector of the teeth, preventing further damage. A behavioral approach to increase the patient’s awareness of the disorder, relaxation, lifestyle, and sleep hygiene instruction, and the use of drugs, which should be limited to short periods and severe cases where occlusal devices and psychological methods were ineffective.
