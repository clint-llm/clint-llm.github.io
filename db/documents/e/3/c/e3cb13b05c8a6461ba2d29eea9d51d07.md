Triplane ankle fractures are often under-appreciated with plain radiographs as each view typically only reveals a single fracture line. AP, mortise, and lateral views are essential. The AP view reveals the sagittal fracture line in the epiphysis (Salter-Harris III), and the lateral view demonstrating the coronal fracture line in the posterior metaphysis (Salter-Harris II). The mortise radiograph is the best way to appreciate articular displacement on plain films. Computed tomography (CT) is a vital tool for assessing the exact fracture pattern, degree of displacement, and articular step-off. Jones et al. demonstrated that all surgeons surveyed changed the starting point and trajectory of planned screw fixation after reviewing the CT scan versus relying on plain radiographs in a series of triplane ankle fractures.
