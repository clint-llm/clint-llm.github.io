A more detailed description of the foramen lacerum and pterygoid canal: The anatomy of the foramen lacerum, carotid canal, and pterygoid canal can be difficult to visualize. As the internal carotid enters the skull, it does not travel straight superiorly. As the internal carotid enters through the carotid canal, there is a slight bend to the vessel. It is this "bent" part that runs over the cartilage filled foramen lacerum. The internal carotid once again travels superiorly. The deep petrosal nerve runs with the internal carotid as it courses over the cartilaginous section of the foramen lacerum. The deep petrosal then combines with the greater petrosal, which comes from the seventh cranial nerve from the brainstem. From there, the deep and greater petrosal nerves combine and travel through the pterygoid canal which opens from the same area as the foramen lacerum and carotid canal.
