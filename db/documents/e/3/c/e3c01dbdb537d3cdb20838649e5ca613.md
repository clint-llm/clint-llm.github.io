Mixed connective tissue disease resembles several other connective tissue diseases and is easy to misdiagnose. Diagnosis can be challenging to nurse practitioners and primary care physicians due to variable and mixed presentation and changes in symptoms over time. Early diagnosis and targeted treatment are associated with a better outcome. It is crucial to recognize early signs and symptoms and make an early referral to a rheumatologist. Definitive diagnosis often requires close follow-up and identification of the characteristic evolution of clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings.

An interprofessional team approach is key to improving the quality of life. Pulmonologists, cardiologists, and other specialist referrals should be made based on organ involvement. Nurses and physicians should provide coordinated patient education to ensure patient understanding of signs and symptoms and when to seek medical attention. Pharmacists should help educate patients about the medications used and their potential adverse effects. Pain should be addressed with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches, e.g., physical therapy, psychological, social, and emotional support.
