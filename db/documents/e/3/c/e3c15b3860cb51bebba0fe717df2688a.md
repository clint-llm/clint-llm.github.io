The incidence of echogenic bowel varies from 0.2 to 1.8 % in the prenatal sonogram performed in the second trimester.

This variability could also be attributed to the fact that the detection of echogenic bowel is prone to significant inter-observer variability since the diagnostic criteria are based on a subjective assessment which is prone to over or underestimation of the finding based on the level of expertise of the sonographer as well as the frequency and the gain settings of the ultrasound machine.
