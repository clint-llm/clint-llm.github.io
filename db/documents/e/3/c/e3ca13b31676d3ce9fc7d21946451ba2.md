Patients not requiring tracheal repair at the time of pulmonary artery sling (PAS) repair have an excellent prognosis and long-term results.

Complications after PAS can include:

- Mortality

- Arrhythmias

- Low cardiac output syndrome

- Renal failure

- Abdominal sepsis

- Mediastinitis

- Re-exploration for bleeding

- Diaphragm paralysis from phrenic nerve injury

- Technical errors - left pulmonary artery kinking from too much length

- Tracheitis

- Tracheostomy

- Residual tracheal/bronchial stenosis

- Recurrent tracheal stenosis from granulation tissue

- Pneumonia

- Wound infection

- Pulmonary hypertension

Surgical technical complications in left pulmonary artery reimplantation include tension, kinking, narrowing of the left pulmonary artery, and compression of the trachea anteriorly.

Postoperative complications from slide tracheoplasty include injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, anastomotic dehiscence, or recurrent stenosis.

Patients can die from mediastinitis due to anastomotic leak.

Patients undergoing simultaneous PAS repair and tracheal repair are prone to early mortality (within 30 days of surgery or before hospital discharge) compared to PAS repair only patients.

In one case series of 14 patients with PAS and tracheal stenosis, there was a mortality rate of 14% (2 out of 14). All patients on long-term follow-up for about three years show patent left pulmonary artery anastomosis.
