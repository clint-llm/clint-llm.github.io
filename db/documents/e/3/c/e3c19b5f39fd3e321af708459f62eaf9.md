There is minimal patient preparation for this procedure. Many of these can be done safely as outpatient procedures. The patient should withhold food and fluids after midnight prior to the operation and present to the pre-operative holding area before surgery. In the operating room, the patient would undergo general anesthesia. The whole neck, chest, and upper abdomen should be prepped into the field in case catastrophic bleeding occurs, and emergent median sternotomy or thoracotomy is needed for control of massive hemorrhage.
