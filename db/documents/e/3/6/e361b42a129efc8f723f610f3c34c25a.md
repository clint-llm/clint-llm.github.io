RP progresses at a varied rate, depending on the inheritance pattern and age of onset, from peripheral constriction of fields to tunnel vision and gradually losing vision loss. Early-onset of visually significant cataract is common. Risk factors associated with cataract surgery are more in cases with retinal dystrophy compared to the general population, which include zonular weakness, capsular phimosis, early onset of posterior capsule opacification, and cystoid macular edema.
