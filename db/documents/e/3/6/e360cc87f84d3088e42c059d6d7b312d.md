Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a monoamine neurotransmitter that is biochemically derived from tryptophan. Serotonin is found primarily in the gastrointestinal tract, the central nervous system, and platelets. It is metabolized by monoamine oxidase in the liver. Serotonin modulates attention, mood, appetite, and sleep as well as some cognitive functions, making serotonin modulation a common mechanism of action for many antidepressants. Serotonin also modulates thermoregulation and promotes platelet aggregation, uterine contraction, bronchoconstriction, vasoconstriction, and gastrointestinal motility. Stimulation of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors from a single or combination of drugs produces serotonin syndrome.
