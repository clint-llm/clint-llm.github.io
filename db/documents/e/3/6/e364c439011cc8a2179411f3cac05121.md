Perinatal substance use is a significant public health issue in the United States (US) and worldwide. In the US, 40% of persons with a lifetime drug use disorder and 26% with a combined alcohol and drug use disorder during the prior year are women. They are at the highest risk for substance use disorder during their reproductive years, and substance use during pregnancy is prevalent. The most frequently used substances in pregnancy are tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana, followed by cocaine and opioids. Use in pregnancy is associated with multiple adverse outcomes for the mother and their child.

Universal screening is recommended, with access to effective interventions if indicated. However, pregnant women who use substances often feel stigmatized, and barriers to evidence-based treatments exist. This activity will include a discussion of legal and psychosocial issues and the importance of the interprofessional team in ensuring healthy outcomes for women who use substances during pregnancy and their children.
