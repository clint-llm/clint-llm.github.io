The Vidian nerve supplies parasympathetic fibers to the nasal mucosa, palate, and lacrimal gland via the pterygopalatine ganglion. The sacrifice of this nerve by reducing the autonomic supply to the nasal cavity is proven to improve nasal hypersecretion.

Vasomotor rhinitis, believed to arise from an imbalance between parasympathetic and sympathetic supply to the nasal mucosa, was hence a reasonable indication. In the pre-endoscopic era, with challenges in localizing the vidian nerve, this procedure was accompanied by poor long-term outcomes and, therefore, was sporadically deployed. Open approaches to the pterygopalatine fossa, such as transantral or transpalatal, were fraught with patient morbidities, such as ophthalmoplegia, orbital complications, and palatal fistulae.

Clinical studies have reported improved nasal outcomes using this technique compared to medical management or other surgical options such as turbinoplasty or septoplasty
