Acute barbiturate toxicity may result from an intentional or unintentional overdose. Barbiturates have a history of abuse; New York City Health Department data showed 8469 cases of barbiturate poisoning in the period between 1957 through 1963.

A systematic review demonstrates the efficacy of multiple-dose activated charcoal for phenobarbital and primidone overdose. Haemodialysis and haemoperfusion may be considered in patients having life-threatening barbiturate toxicity.
