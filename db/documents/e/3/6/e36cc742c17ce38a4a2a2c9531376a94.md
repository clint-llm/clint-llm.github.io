The presence of a dural arteriovenous fistula can cause significant physical and mental health effects in the patient. These lesions can severely affect the quality of life and the lifespan of an affected patient. Many patients present with intracerebral hemorrhages, affecting their mobility and verbal communication depending on the location and size. Patients need to be well-oriented about the DSA results and the natural history of their particular fistula in terms of hemorrhage risk, so they can make informed decisions. Patients should be oriented that ischemic injuries are permanent, but treatment will prevent future damage. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy are needed for those with permanent deficits. In those patients where the dAVF is not treated initially, close follow-up is necessary to assess the development of new symptoms or progression of existing ones.
