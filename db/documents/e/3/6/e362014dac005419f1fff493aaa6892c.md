**History**

A thorough history is crucial to diagnosing YNS. Open-ended questioning and a detailed review of the pulmonary, vascular, and integumentary systems can reveal clues that may lead to the diagnosis of this rare syndrome. The pulmonary findings in YNS vary widely. It is important to ask about persistent cough, congestion, and recurrent respiratory infections. Review of past medical history, social history (i.e., smoking status, exposures to respiratory irritants), and previous chest imaging are essential. Remember that symptoms can be mild, intermittent, and may not present concurrently.

**Physical Exam**

Special attention should be paid to analyzing fingernails and toenails and removing polish if necessary. Nail findings can be subtle, the discoloration can range in intensity from pale yellow to green.

The physical appearance of lymphedema in YNS is no different than what is seen in primary lymphedema. Based on case reports, lymphedema is the initial symptom of YNS in approximately one-third of patients, and it is present in approximately 30% to 80% of those diagnosed with the syndrome.

Respiratory tract manifestations in YNS occur in 60% to 70% of patients, the most common of which is a chronic cough.
