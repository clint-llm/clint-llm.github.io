**Caffeine**

When treating acute primary headaches, doses greater than 130 mg enhance the analgesia in a tension-type headache and doses greater than 100 mg enhance the analgesia in a migraine headache.

Mild, transient, and reversible cardiovascular symptoms may result from doses exceeding 600 mg per day.

It is not considered harmful to consume caffeine at doses of 200 mg in one sitting or 400 mg daily.

**Acetaminophen**

When used regularly and in large doses (more than 4 grams per day), a risk of serious side effects may arise. Patients with cirrhosis or on warfarin require reduced doses: 2 to 3 grams per day for a few days in cirrhosis and less than 1.3 grams per day for no more than two weeks in patients who take warfarin.

**Acetylsalicylic Acid**

Aspirin will have an increased risk of hypoglycemia when given with glyburide or other sulfonylureas. The explanation for hypoglycemia may be synergetic inhibition of K(ATP) activity.
