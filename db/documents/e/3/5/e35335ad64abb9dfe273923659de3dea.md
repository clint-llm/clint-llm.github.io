The TFL is supplied by the deep branch of the superior gluteal artery.  The superior gluteal artery is the largest branch of the posterior division of the internal iliac artery.  It runs posteriorly between the lumbosacral trunk and the first sacral nerve root. It exits the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen, where it divides into superficial and deep branches. The deep branch travels between the gluteus minimus and gluteus medius to supply those muscles and the TFL.
