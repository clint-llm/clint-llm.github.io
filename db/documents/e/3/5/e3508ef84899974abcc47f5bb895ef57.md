Bladder dysfunction: Most patients with myelomeningocele have some degree of bladder incontinence. Preventive goals are directed toward preventing infection with the implementation of bladder drainage utilizing intermittent catheterization or indwelling catheters. Bladder stimulation has shown to improve bladder emptying and reduce infection.

Bowel dysfunction: Myelomeningocele is associated with anal sphincter dysfunction that results in bowel incontinence. Assisted bowel emptying reduces barriers associated with social activities, including attending school and personal relationships.

Immobility: Most myelomeningocele patients have significant weakness, which results in severe ambulation deficits or paraplegia. Bracing using external orthosis can help to maximize their mobility and ensure a near-normal developmental progression. In children over 1-year-old, utilizing a standing frame can reduce the risk of osteoporosis and the formation of contractures in lower extremities. A wheelchair can provide mobility for older children and adults.

Infections: Due to a neurogenic bladder, many have urine colonization and infections. Shunts are also prone to infections. When shunts are placed, infections can occur superficially at the skin or intraabdominal, as many of these patients have multiple abdominal procedures.
