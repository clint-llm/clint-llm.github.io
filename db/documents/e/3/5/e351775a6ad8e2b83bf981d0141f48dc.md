Trichosporon species are pathogenic yeast that colonizes and proliferates in different parts of the human body, including the gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, and skin. These organisms can cause superficial and invasive infections. Invasive Trichosporon infections are common in immunosuppressed patients, such as those with hematological malignancies. Unfortunately, invasive trichosporonosis can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and the global incidence is increasing. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with trichosporonosis and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical features of trichosporonosis.
- Identify the risk factors for invasive trichosporonosis.
- Summarize the current treatment options for trichosporonosis.
- Outline the significance of care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve the outcome for patients with trichosporonosis.
