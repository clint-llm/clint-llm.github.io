Schwannomas grow slowly and may exist for years without any symptom manifestation. Schwannomas can present in various locations, which explains the variations in clinical presentations. Tenderness is felt when palpating the mass. Neurologic symptoms may show if the tumor is large. Approximately there is a 5-year delay between symptoms and diagnosis.

Schwannomas in the extremities may present as an asymptomatic mass, mild pain in the area, or paresthesia due to pressure on the parent nerve. Sciatic nerve schwannomas can mimic disk herniation with low back pain with radiation down the leg. Schwannoma, which involves the C7 nerve root, can produce thoracic outlet syndrome. A schwannoma in the ankle or wrist can present as tarsal tunnel syndrome or carpal tunnel syndrome. The presentation of distal symptoms can be due to a lesion in a proximal nerve. Schwannoma may trigger a physiological deficit due to local pressure on the originating nerve.

Vestibular schwannomas usually present with decreased hearing, tinnitus, and imbalance. Rarely will a patient show facial nerve palsy. Trigeminal schwannoma causes numbness or pain in the trigeminal nerve distribution. If the tumor is located at a specific root (V1, V2, or V3), pain and numbness are at the corresponding anatomical area of the face.
