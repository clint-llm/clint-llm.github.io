**Aspiration Abortion**

- Vasovagal episode

- 
              
- Cool compresses
              
              
- Elevate legs above the chest

- Atropine IM 0.4mg or 0.2mg IV, max dose 2mg

- Heavy bleeding - remember 6 Ts

- 
              
- Tone - Uterine massage and consider uterotonics like methergine, misoprostol
              
              
- Tissue - Ensure there is no retained tissue in the uterus 
              
              
- Trauma - Identify the source of bleeding and address it, especially cervical and vaginal tears
              
              
- Thrombin - review the history of bleeding and consider additional tests like CBC, coagulation tests, clotting test
              
              
- Treatment - Consider IV fluid bolus and uterine tamponade with a foley’s catheter bulb
              
              
- Transfer - to the hospital if need be, monitor vitals closely

- Perforation

- 
              
- Stop the suction, examine the contents of the aspirate for omentum, bowel, products of conception
              
              
- If stable, continue and complete the procedure under ultrasound guidance. Consider uterotonics and antibiotics. Observe for 1.5 to 2 hours post-procedure. 
              
              
- If the patient is unstable, transfer

- Incomplete abortion

- 
              
- Offer misoprostol or 
              
              
- Reaspiration if bleeding, in pain or have signs of infection

- Accumulation of blood in the uterus post-procedure - patient usually complains of pain and rectal pressure, and this is usually accompanied by hypotension and or vasovagal  syncope

- 
              
- Uterine aspiration or uterotonics

- Endometritis (fever, pain, vaginal discharge, leukocytosis)

- 
              
- Antibiotics per the CDC PID regimen
              
              
- Ultrasound +/- aspiration procedure
              
              
- Test for gonorrhea and chlamydia

- Ectopic Pregnancy  - suspect if POC inadequate at the time

- 
              
- Transfer to hospital for treatment with methotrexate vs. surgical management
