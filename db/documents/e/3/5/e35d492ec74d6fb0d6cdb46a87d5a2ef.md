Myocytes in TPs are non-uniformly distributed, rounded in the middle, and thinner at the peripheryÂ with a reduced number of mitochondria and accumulation of inflammatory cells.

Erythrocytes in patients with myofascial pain show a lack of antioxidants, such as selenium and zinc. This causes greater oxidative stress that would stimulate a systemic inflammatory response, but further studies are necessary to draw definitive conclusions.
