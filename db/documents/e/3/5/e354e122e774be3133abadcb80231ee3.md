Congenital deformities of the fifth toe typically resolve on their own. When intervention is necessary, it is essential to have a dedicatedÂ interprofessional team consisting of clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs, and podiatrists), physical therapists, surgical assistants, and nurses to educate patients and their parents about the deformity and treatment strategy. Nurses will often liaise between the various disciplines working on the case.

All interprofessional team members must document their findings and interventions with the patient. If they note any concerns, open communication is necessary to alert the appropriate team members regarding the need for a change in strategy or other changes to the patient's management. This interprofessional paradigm will yield the best patient results. [Level 5]
