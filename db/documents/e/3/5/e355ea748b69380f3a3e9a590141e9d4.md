The definition of a selective IgA deficiency mediated anaphylactic transfusion reaction is anaphylaxis that occurs within one hour of transfusion of plasma-containing blood products in an individual who is IgA deficient and has plasma anti-IgA antibodies.

However, the role anti-IgA antibodies play still remains controversial. For example, blood products containing anti-IgA antibodies given to IgA deficient individuals have occurred with no adverse reactions. Additionally, it has been shown that IgA containing blood products does not always induce a reaction when exposed to anti-IgA antibodies.
