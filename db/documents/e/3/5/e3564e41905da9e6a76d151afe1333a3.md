Abaloparatide, a human parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), is a selective parathyroid hormone type 1 receptor (PTH1R) agonist.

Abaloparatide shifts the balance of bone remodeling to favor bone formation by osteoblasts with a minimal increase in osteoclast bone resorption.

Binding to the R0 conformation of PTHR1 induces a longer-lasting signaling response that gradually increases cAMP.

Abaloparatide binding capacity to the two high-affinity PTHR1 conformations was assessed using radioligand competition methods. Abaloparatide exhibited greater selectivity for the RG conformation, with weak binding to R0.

This explains why patients taking abaloparatide are less likely to develop hypercalcemia than those taking teriparatide. In a study determining the efficacy and safety of abaloparatide in increasing bone mineral density (BMD) in Japanese patients with osteoporosis at high fracture risk, significant increases in serum markers of bone formation [procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP)] and bone resorption [C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX)] were observed following treatment with subcutaneous abaloparatide (80 µg once daily) compared to placebo.

Abaloparatide has off-label effects by activating Gq and β-arrestin-1 mechanisms in target cells such as the testis and epididymis to alleviate symptoms of epididymitis and orchitis.
