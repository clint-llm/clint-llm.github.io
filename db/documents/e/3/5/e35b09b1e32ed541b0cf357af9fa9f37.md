The falciform ligament is a double-layered extension of parietal peritoneum that sweeps off the anterior abdominal wall to divide the liver into the asymmetric left and right lobes. When looking at the ligament from a coronal view, the most distal aspect of the falciform ligament ends in a free edge containing the round ligament of the liver and the paraumbilical veins. The proximal portion will diverge to merge with the right and left coronary ligaments which surround the bare liver area which superimposes against the inferior diaphragmatic surface.Â  The round ligament of the liver is the fetal remnant of the umbilical vein, which once traveled from the placenta to the fetal liver to deliver oxygenated blood.
