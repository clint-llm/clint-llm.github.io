Before the advent of ultrasound, little was known about the phenomenon of vanishing twin syndrome (VTS). It was disclosed in 1945 by Stoeckel that the rate of multiple gestations is greater than the rate of their birth, i.e., a twin or even multiple can be lost during multi-fetus pregnancy before the mother is even aware of the loss or the fact that she was carrying multiple fetuses. Since ultrasonography and transvaginal sonography in early pregnancy, vanishing twin syndrome is more frequently diagnosed. Vanishing twin syndrome is evaluated to happen in 36% of twin pregnancies and in half of the pregnancies that begins with at least three or more gestational sacs.

With respect to assisted reproductive techniques (ART), it is assessed to occur in 20-30% pregnancies. This phenomenon is progressively predominant with the utilization of the assisted conceptive methods, as more than one embryo is transferred to the uterus; the rate of multiple gestations also increases.
