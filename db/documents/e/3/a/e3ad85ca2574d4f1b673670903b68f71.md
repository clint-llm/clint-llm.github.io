Primary congenitalÂ glaucoma and CHED are often confused with each other. Both present with ground glass cornea and hence the confusion. The corneal diameter is usually large in congenital glaucoma along with Haab's striae. It is important to distinguish between birth trauma and Haab's striae. Birth trauma-induced breaks in the Descemet membrane are usually vertically oriented, whereas true Haab striae are either horizontally oriented or curvilinear.

AXRA (bilateral involvement) should be distinguished from ICE (iridocorneal endothelial) syndrome (unilateral involvement).

Sclerocornea and Peter anomaly should be distinguished from other causes of congenital corneal opacities. Sclerocornea is usually bilateral, and Peters anomaly can be unilateral or bilateral. Sclerocornea is often associated with cornea plana.

Congenital aniridia should be distinguished from traumatic aniridia.

The closest differential of congenital iris ectropion is Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly and iridocorneal endothelial syndrome (ICE syndrome).
