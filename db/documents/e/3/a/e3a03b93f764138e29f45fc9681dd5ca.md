The most frequently encountered adverse effects are injection site reaction, headache, fatigue, nausea, and fever. Severe reactions can include hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylaxis, hyperviscosity, and thromboembolism. Recombinant human hyaluronidase comes with a black box warning of thrombosis. Risk factors for precipitating thrombosis are hypercoagulable conditions, prolonged immobilization, advanced age, and cardiovascular disease. It is essential to hydrate adequately before administering the dose to prevent these adverse reactions.

Animal-derived hyaluronidase is immunogenic and may cause allergic reactions. Human recombinant hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) is better tolerated and is less likely to cause an allergic reaction. Approximately 6% of the population have anti-rHuPH20 antibodies that are non-neutralizing and have no clinically significant consequences.

There is insufficient data available to assess fetal risk in pregnancy, nor is thereÂ human data available to evaluate the effects on milk production in lactating mothers. It is essential to weigh the risks versus benefits when prescribing to pregnant or breastfeeding women.
