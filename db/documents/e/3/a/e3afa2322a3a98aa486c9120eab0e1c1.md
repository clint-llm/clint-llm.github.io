Abrasions are superficial injuries of the skin and visceral linings in the body, resulting in a break in the continuity of tissue. These are the simplest of injuries in terms of healing, with most injuries being confined to the epidermis and resulting in minimal bleeding at most. The majority of abrasions heal without leaving any scar. However, the abrasions that extend into the dermis may result in scarring of the tissue upon healing. The most common mechanism of formation of abrasion is due to friction against the epidermis, resulting in its denudation. Abrasions appear in all forms of blunt trauma, with friction and impact being the most common mechanisms. Pressure abrasions, while less frequent in occurrence, can have a greater medicolegal significance, especially for the identification of the causative material.
