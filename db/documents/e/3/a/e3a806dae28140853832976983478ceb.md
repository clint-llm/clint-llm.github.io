When performed properly, PPS allows pediatric patients to tolerate brief stressful or painful procedures without experiencing significant pain or having unpleasant memories of the event. It allows for diagnostics and interventions to be performed for the pediatric patient with more effectiveness while limiting the amount of stress on the child. PPS can be elective or unscheduled but must be performed in a controlled environment with the proper staff and equipment to facilitate the procedure and sedation.Â  Providers must know and anticipate possible complications, including vomiting and respiratory depression, to be able to intervene when necessary. When performed by skilled providers, PPS can be used to perform procedures with few adverse outcomes.
