Impairment or damage to any of the hypothalamic nuclei causes a deficit in its function. The following abnormalities can be seen in the impairment of each hypothalamic nuclei:

- Anterior nucleus: Poor heat dissipation

- Posterior nucleus: Excessive heat dissipation

- Ventromedial nucleus: Increase in appetite

- Lateral nucleus: Decrease in appetite

- Arcuate nucleus: Dysfunction of the tuberoinfundibular pathway

- Supraoptic nucleus: Central diabetes insipidus due to loss of ADH production

- Paraventricular nucleus: Decrease in the secretion of oxytocin

- Suprachiasmatic nucleus: Circadian rhythm dysfunction

These impairments can be caused by intracranial masses, vascular abnormalities, ischemia, and also by certain medications such as antipsychotics.
