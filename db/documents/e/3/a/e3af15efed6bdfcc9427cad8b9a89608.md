The brain areas responsible for controlling our feelings and emotions are the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex. Patients with mood disorders have shown to have an enlarged amygdala on brain imaging, which substantiates the certainty that abnormalities in these areas lead to mood disorders. Ventricular expansion results from repeated episodes of mood disorders.

**Biological Factors**

Neurotransmitters that play an important function in mood disorders are serotonin and norepinephrine, which are decreased in episodes of depression. Serotonin is the neurotransmitter most commonly associated with depression. Dopamine has also been implicated in mood disorders with research showing that it may be decreased in depression and increased in mania.

Medical conditions which lead to mood disorders include:

- Brain tumors

- CNS syphilis

- Delirium

- Encephalitis

- Influenza

- Metabolic changes associated with hemodialysis

- Multiple sclerosis

- Q fever

- Cancer

- AIDS

- Hypothyroidism

There are certain drugs and medications, consumption of which lead to symptoms simulating a mood disorder. These are amphetamines, cocaine, procarbazine, and steroids.

**Genetic Factors**

According to research based on twin studies, there are certain genes causing mood disorder.

**Hormonal Factors**

Increased HPA activity is associated with stress and depression. Increased TSH has been shown to be associated with depression.

**Psychosocial Factors**

Stressful life changes (death of significant other, parents, siblings, etc.) traumatic events and childhood abuse have been found to be major risk factors for the development of mood disorder later on in life, especially depressive disorder.

**Neuroimmunological Factors**

Research shows that mood disorder leads to the altered release of neuroactive cytokines like IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha.

Recent research has found a crucial role of nitric oxide (NO) involved in causing the inflammatory process that leads to signs and symptoms of mood disorder. Altered levels of NO have also been found in patients suffering from mood disorders.

Increased frequency of abnormal hyperintensities is seen in subcortical regions in depressive disorders and bipolar disorder.
