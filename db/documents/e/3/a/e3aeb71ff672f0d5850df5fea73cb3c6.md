Management of rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis requires close interaction and coordination between various medical and surgical clinicians. There could a certain overlap between various specialties in the management of suspected or proved rhino-orbital cerebral mucormycosis patients. Suggested specialties to be involved include the following:

A hospitalist may be in charge of the overall general management of the patient. Infectious disease or endocrinology opinions can be obtained if further inputs regarding the diagnosis and antimicrobial management, or diabetic ketoacidosis treatment are required. An urgent otorhinolaryngology opinion is needed for extensive debridement and tissue biopsy of the affected nose and sinuses where the former procedure is expected to reduce the fungal load, while the latter helps to achieve a definite tissue diagnosis. Opthalmology review for assessment of ophthalmoplegia and optic neuropathy is advisable. Oculoplasty surgeons can help in orbital debridement, decompression, or exenteration and reconstruction. A neurosurgery consult would be ideal if orbital or intracranial disease is present. Many times the different surgical teams have to intervene together in single or multiple settings. Pharmacotherapists often help in the proper dosing of IV amphotericin.

Psychiatry or psychology counseling or treatment may be required for patients and relatives who often get crippled with the significant post-surgery disfigurement. Rehabilitation help might be required to combat residual neurologic sequelae.
