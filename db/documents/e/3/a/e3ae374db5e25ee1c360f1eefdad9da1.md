A careful review of the clinical presentation, serologies, histology, and immunofluorescence is required in the process of diagnosis.

In 1983 Camisa and Sharma proposed the following diagnostic criteria for bullous systemic lupus erythematosus, which was later revised in 1986:

- A diagnosis of SLE based on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria

- Vesicles and bullae arising upon but not limited to sun-exposed skin

- Histopathology compatible with dermatitis herpetiformis (DH)

- Negative or positive indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) for circulating BMZ autoantibodies

- Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) revealing IgG and/or IgM and often IgA at the BMZ

In 1995, Yell et al. l described BSLE as "an acquired subepidermal blistering disease in a patient with SLE with immune reactants at the BMZ on either DIF or IIF."

Detection of an autoantibody directed against collagen VII was shown to play a role in BSLE. The criteria by Camisa and Sharma were made before the availability of ELISA or immunoblot technology. The use of ELISA for detecting antibodies against NC1 and NC2 of type VII collagen is utilized.

However, it is important to note that a diagnosis of SLE is usually present; however, this may be the first presentation of SLE in a few cases. A thorough exclusion of other blistering diseases should also be completed.
