The rectus femoris is a long, fleshy muscle located in the anterior compartment of the thigh. The rectus femoris is fusiform in shape with superficial fibers that are bipenniform and deep fibers that run straight (rectus) to the deep aponeurosis.

The rectus femoris has two heads of origin: the direct (straight) head and the indirect (reflected) head. The direct head arises from the anterior aspect of the inferior iliac spineÂ (AIIS; a common site of avulsion), while the indirect head originates from the acetabular ridge. The two heads merge to become the conjoined tendon below their origin.
