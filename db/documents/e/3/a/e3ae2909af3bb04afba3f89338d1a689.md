Chronic pulmonary embolism (also known as chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension) is a potentially life-threatening condition and is associated with high mortality and morbidity. It is an uncommon disease with low physician awareness and a long silent period. It frequently gets misdiagnosed, and its prevalence underestimated. To avoid the adverse effects associated with this condition, it requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of chronic pulmonary embolism and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of chronic pulmonary embolic hypertension.
- Summarize the history, physical exam findings, and evaluation of chronic pulmonary embolic hypertension.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for chronic pulmonary embolic hypertension.
- Describe the importance of collaboration and coordination among the healthcare team to enhance patient care for patients with chronic pulmonary embolic hypertension.
