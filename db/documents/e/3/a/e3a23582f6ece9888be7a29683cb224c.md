A close collaboration between an endocrinologist, a radiologist, and an experienced endocrine neck surgeon is warranted for the best approach to thyroid adenomas. The benign tumors do not need any aggressive management and can be followed conservatively, but the thyroid nodules showing suspicious radiographic features should be looked at more closely. A thyroid biopsy by fine needle aspiration is considered routine testing, and depending on its cytology results, the final treatment decision can be made. Different scoring systems have been developed to help differentiate benign versus malignant nodules, and further molecular genetic testing can assist medical providers in avoiding unnecessary interventions or more testing. The medical team should spend time explaining the process and the different steps to the patients in detail to increase the comfort level and patient collaboration.
