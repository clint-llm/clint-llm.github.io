floFolate is mainly concentrated in the liver.

For DNA synthesis, deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) accepts one methyl group from 5-10-MTHF—via thymidylate synthase, which accepts the other—to become deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP) and allows the cell cycle to continue while simultaneously regenerating DHF. Drugs used in cancer chemotherapy disrupt this process by inhibiting vital enzymes necessary for cell cycle progression. Methotrexate, for example, inhibits dihydrofolate reductase. By reducing available THF and its downstream components, methotrexate indirectly deprives the thymidylate synthase of its substrates.

Methionine is a byproduct synthesized as folate reduces homocysteine levels in the blood; 5-10-MTHF donates a methyl group to an enzyme, methyl-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), and then becomes 5-methyl THF.
