Atorvastatin is available as atorvastatin calcium tablets in strengths of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg.

This medication can be administered with or without food and should be taken at the same time every day. It is generally recommended to administer statins at bedtime since endogenous cholesterol synthesis is cyclical, with the highest production levels during fasting as at night. However, the longer half-life of atorvastatin compared to other shorter half-life statins (e.g., lovastatin, fluvastatin, and simvastatin) offers greater flexibility regarding dosing times.

**Adult Dosing**

The dosing of atorvastatin can have its basis in LDL-C lowering ability (intensity), or doses are titratable to specific lipid goals.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines recommends either moderate intensity (atorvastatin 10 to 20 mg) or high intensity (atorvastatin 40 to 80 mg) therapy depending on the statin benefit group to which a patient belongs. Moderate-intensity statins should lower LDL-C by about 30 to 50%, while high-intensity statins should lower LDL-C by over 50 %.

Both the National Lipid Association and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists recommend utilizing statin therapy to reach specific lipid goals based on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.

**Pediatrics**

Doses above 20 mg do not have study data for pediatric patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Doses up to 80 mg have been used in a limited number of pediatric patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Studies have not evaluated atorvastatin use in pre-pubescent patients or those under ten years old.

**Geriatrics**

Patients over 65 years old may have higher plasma concentrations of atorvastatin than young adults. Older patients may be at increased risk of statin-induced myopathies.

**Renal Impairment**

Atorvastatin and its metabolites do not undergo renal elimination, so no dose adjustments are required with reduced renal function. Hemodialysis will not likely remove atorvastatin due to plasma protein binding.

**Hepatic Impairment**

Increased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin have occurred in patients with chronic alcoholic liver disease. Drug exposure is four times higher in patients with Child-Pugh Class A and 11x higher in patients with Child-Pugh Class B. Atorvastatin is contraindicated in patients with active liver disease.

**Drug Interactions******

Using atorvastatin with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors can lead to increased plasma concentrations, which may enhance adverse events, including myopathy. OATP1B1 inhibitors can increase the bioavailability of atorvastatin.

CYP3A4 inducers may cause decreased plasma concentrations of atorvastatin.

Patients taking digoxin should undergo monitoring when starting atorvastatin as plasma concentrations of digoxin may increase.

Atorvastatin may also increase drug concentrations of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol.
