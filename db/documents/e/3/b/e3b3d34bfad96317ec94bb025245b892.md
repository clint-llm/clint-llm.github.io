Collaboration among healthcare team members can prove beneficial for patients with osteoporosis. Besides the healthcare providers and nurses, other interdisciplinary team members who might be involved in the care plan for patients with osteoporosis include pharmacists, endocrinologists, registered dieticians, and physical or occupational therapists. If fractures develop, orthopedic surgeons might also serve on the team. Social workers and case managers can address psychosocial or financial issues along with needs for special equipment.
