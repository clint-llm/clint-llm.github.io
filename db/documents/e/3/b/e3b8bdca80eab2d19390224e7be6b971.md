The large arteries and veins directly connected with the heart are termed the great vessels, consisting of the inferior vena cava, superior vena cava, pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins, and root of the aorta. These vessels are critical parts of the circulatory system, ensuring the delivery of deoxygenated blood from the periphery to the heart so it can be pumped into the lungs for oxygenation, returned to the left side of the heart, and then distributed back to the periphery. There are several congenital anatomical variations in the morphology of the great vessels, which can have significant deleterious effects on circulatory physiology requiring surgical management.Â Furthermore, thrombosis, stenosis, and aneurysm can affect the great vessels, which can be life-threatening conditions requiring prompt recognition and treatment.
