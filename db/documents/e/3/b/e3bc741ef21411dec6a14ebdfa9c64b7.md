- PCA is the most common pediatric brain tumor

- Classified by the WHO as low-grade, grade I

- MRI: Typically cystic with avidly enhancing mural nodule; although can be completely solid

- Microscopy: long, bipolar cellular processes that look "hair-like"

- Excellent prognosis with complete surgical resection; radiotherapy and chemotherapy not routinely used

- 95% 10-year survival with surgery alone if complete resection

- Strong association with NF1, 5% to 20% of patients with NF1 develop PCA mostly in the visual pathway

- Presentation typically with cerebellar signs and features of hydrocephalus
