Laboratory investigations play a pivotal role in diagnosing and management of diseases. The number of tests ordered daily rises with the number and complexity of diagnoses at discharge. Patients with a single diagnosis were found to undergo 7.5 tests per day. A study observed that the daily average for tests in the internal medicine department was 9.5. Similar results were found by another study performed at an American hospital stating an average of 9.67 tests per inpatient day. The average for CBC (complete blood count), an important initial test frequently ordered, was 1.07. The most frequently ordered analytes were serum electrolytes levels, particularly sodium.
