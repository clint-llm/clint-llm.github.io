Aesthetically, the face is divided up into several subunits: forehead, brows, orbits, nose, cheeks, mouth, chin, and ears, each of which has its own constituent parts with additional boundaries among them. In many cases, keeping scars within a single subunit or, preferable, between subunits can substantially improve cosmetic results. In these situations, using an M-plasty to limit or redirect the scar into subunit boundaries can be very helpful. Additionally, many anatomical structures on the face possess free margins, such as the nasal alae, the auricular helices, the eyebrows, the hairline, and the eyelids, violation of which is best avoided to prevent cicatricial notching; M-plasties can be very useful in these cases as well.
