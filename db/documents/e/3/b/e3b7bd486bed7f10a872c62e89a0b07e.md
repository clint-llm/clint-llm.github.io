As with any illness, a detailed history and physical exam is the most important initial step in evaluation. Hyperchloremic acidosis due to gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss or medication usage is apparent easily. A complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate for an infectious cause with elevated white blood count and fluid body status with hemoglobin and hematocrit values is useful. A complete metabolic panel is important with attention to sodium, potassium, and chloride levels as these can be used to calculate the anion gap value. Arterial blood gas measurement is needed to determine pH status and to identify that the acidosis is metabolic in origin. The urinary anion gap is an essential measurement in hyperchloremic acidosis to establish the urine ammonium excretion status, as discussed above. Distal renal tubular acidosis will have urinary pH greater than 5.3 and a positive urinary anion gap. In proximal renal tubular acidosis, urinary pH is usually less than 5.3, and the urinary anion gap is variable.
