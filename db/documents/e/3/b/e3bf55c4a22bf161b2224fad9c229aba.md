Phenotypic presentation of ulnar nerve compression, at Guyon canal, is not the same in all patients. This is due to the anatomic variations in the ulnar nerve as it passes through the tunnel.

- Aberrant branching of the ulnar nerve in the distal forearm

- Low trifurcation proximal to Guyon canal with all 3 branches passing through Guyon canal

- High trifurcation proximal to Guyon canal: All 3 branches can pass through Guyonâ€™s canal, or the volar sensory branch can pass volar to the canal.

- Accessory branches arising from the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve: These branches can also be referred to as accessory branches of Kaplan.

- Branches of the median nerve and the ulnar nerve that communicates in the forearm

A review of cadaveric specimens found several aberrant muscular structures that passed through Guyon canal. The majority of the muscles identified were classified as aberrant abductor digiti minimi muscles.
