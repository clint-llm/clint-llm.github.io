An ultrasound machine with a transducer is required. Ultrasound gel is required to perform the examination. The gel acts as a medium between skin and transducer and facilitates the passage of ultrasound rays easily. A curved/convex array transducer of 3 to 5 MHz is used for the transabdominal ultrasound in adolescents. Linear, 5 to 9 MHz abdominal transducer is used for transabdominal sonography in small children/infants. A linear transducer is more useful for transperineal ultrasound in infants/neonates. A 12 MHz linear transducer helps differentiate and evaluate bowel, fat, muscles, and lymph nodes adjacent to the pelvic organs.

Transvaginal sonography is not performed in children. It can be performed in sexually active adolescents to complement transabdominal sonography. A long, high-frequency "wand" shaped transducer is introduced into the vagina for better delineation of the pelvic anatomy, especially endometrial evaluation.

Color Doppler mode provides additional information about the ovaries' vascularity, uterus, and lesion if visualized.  Spectral Doppler helps obtain waveforms from a vascular lesion, and it is very important in certain pathologies like ovarian torsion.
