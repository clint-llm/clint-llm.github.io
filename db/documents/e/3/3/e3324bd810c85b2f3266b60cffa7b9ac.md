Patients operating high-pressure spraying equipment professionally or privately should receive education on the risk of this injury. One must be attentive when cleaning the device because this is the most common time injection injury occurs. The affected hand can look deceivingly benign after the initial injury, yet patients must remain concerned. It is recommended to immediately go to the nearest hospital with a surgeon on staff that can properly evaluate high-pressure injection injury.
