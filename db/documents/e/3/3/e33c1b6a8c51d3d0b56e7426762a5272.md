The sensation of the upper eyelid is provided by the ophthalmic branch of cranial nerve V. The sensation of the lower eyelid is provided by the maxillary branch of cranial nerve V.

Cranial nerve III, as well as sympathetic innervation, innervates the eyelid retractors. Cranial nerve VII innervates the orbicularis muscle responsible for protracting (closing) the eyelids.
