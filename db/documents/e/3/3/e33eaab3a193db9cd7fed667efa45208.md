Treatment of myocarditis can be symptomatic or etiologic. Symptomatic treatment involves the management of heart failure and arrhythmias based on current guidelines.

Hemodynamically unstable patients need intensive care and may require inotropic support, ventricular assist devices, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in cases of severe ventricular dysfunction as a bridge to cardiac transplant or recovery.

Myocarditis patients may present with conduction abnormalities like complete A-V blocks, which can rapidly evolve into life-threatening arrhythmias. As a result, temporary or permanent pacing may be necessary. Ventricular tachycardias can be treated with amiodarone or may require an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) as a bridge to transplant or recovery.

Etiologic management includes appropriate antimicrobial therapy for infective causes (like ceftriaxone or doxycycline in Lyme carditis, benznidazole, or nifurtimox for Chagas disease).

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) do not seem to have any benefit in myocarditis; in fact, their use in myocarditis correlates with greater mortality.
