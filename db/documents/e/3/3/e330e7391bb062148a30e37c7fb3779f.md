- Immune deficiency may be primary or secondary.

- Primary occurs when certain cells or a part of the immune system does not work properly due to a genetic defect of the immune system.

- Secondary occurs when the immune system works properly, but the function is compromised due to external factors (e.g., viral infections, treatment with immunosuppressors, and malnutrition).
