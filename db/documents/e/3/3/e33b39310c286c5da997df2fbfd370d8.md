Retropharyngeal abscess typically occurs in children between the ages of two and four years but can occur at any age.

Half of the retropharyngeal abscesses are believed to be attributed to antecedent upper respiratory tract infections leading to retropharyngeal suppurative lymphadenitis and eventual abscess formation.

One-fourth of retropharyngeal abscesses is attributed to retropharyngeal trauma, which results in inoculation of the retropharyngeal space resulting in abscess formation.

Although an uncommon diagnosis, the incidence of retropharyngeal abscess has been increasing in recent years, according to data collected from 2000 through 2009.
