Patients who present with a first time renal calculi must be educated on the high rate of recurrence. The patient should be educated that additional outpatient testing, such as calculi composition analysis may be needed to identify the cause of the stone, especially in recurrent cases. A patient can also be educated on the use of a sifter to retrieve a renal stone for analysis. Patients who present to the emergency department and are diagnosed with uncomplicated nephrolithiasis should be advised to look out for warning symptoms such a fever/chills, lethargy, difficulty urinating that would warrant additional evaluation. Otherwise, in uncomplicated nephrolithiasis, patients should be educated that this condition generally includes mainly symptomatic treatment only with NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or ketorolac. Appropriate outpatient follow up with a patient's primary care provider (PCP) and/or urologist should be given.
