There are several dialysis fistula creation sites that can be made depending on the patientâ€™s vascular anatomy. The patient should be positioned in a supine position with the corresponding arm outstretched to 90 degrees, prepped, and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Principles of arteriovenous fistula creation include obtaining vessel control proximally and distally, and the anastomosis should be made without tension or kinking.

**Radiocephalic Fistula (Brescia-Cimino)**

The radiocephalic fistula is a distal forearm fistula created by anastomosing the cephalic vein to the radial artery. A transverse incision is made in the wrist. The radial artery and cephalic vein are dissected, mobilized, and secured using vessel loops. Any small tributaries can be ligated and divided. An anterolateral arteriotomy is made, and the artery is flushed with heparinized saline. An end-to-side anastomosis can be made by ligating and dividing the distal cephalic vein and spatulating the end to match the size of the arteriotomy. A side-to-side anastomosis can be made by creating a venotomy in the corresponding portion of the cephalic vein. The arteriovenous anastomosis is then performed using a running nonabsorbable monofilament suture. Vascular Doppler should be used to confirm the thrill through the fistula, as well as the distal radial artery signal. Hemostasis is achieved, subcutaneous tissues are approximated, and skin is closed using nonabsorbable sutures.

**Brachiocephalic Fistula (Kaufmann)**

The brachiocephalic fistula is an upper arm fistula created by anastomosing the cephalic vein to the brachial artery. A transverse incision is made over the antecubital fossa. The brachial artery and cephalic vein are dissected, mobilized, and secured using vessel loops. Any small tributaries can be ligated and divided. An arteriotomy is made, and the artery is flushed with heparinized saline. An end-to-side anastomosis is performed by ligating and dividing the distal cephalic vein and spatulating the end to match the size of the arteriotomy. The arteriovenous anastomosis is then performed using a running nonabsorbable monofilament suture. Vascular Doppler should be used to confirm the thrill through the fistula, as well as the distal radial artery signal. Hemostasis is achieved, subcutaneous tissues are approximated, and skin is closed using nonabsorbable sutures.

**Transposition Brachiobasilic Fistula (One-Stage vs Two-Stage)**

The brachiobasilic fistula is used when the techniques above are not feasible or have failed. The basilic vein is medial and deep; therefore, in order to be easily accessed, the vein must be transposed into a more superficial and lateral location. This can be done in one or two stages. The two-stage approach has a better maturation and patency rate but requires reintervention and additional time before use.

**One-Stage:**A longitudinal incision is made in the upper arm over the previously mapped basilic vein from the axilla to the antecubital fossa. The incision is deepened, and the brachial fascia is incised to expose the basilic vein. The brachial artery and basilic vein are dissected, mobilized, and secured using vessel loops. Care is taken to avoid injury to the median antebrachial cutaneous nerve. An arteriotomy is made in the proximal brachial artery and then flushed with heparinized saline. A curved tunneler is used to create a subcutaneous tunnel along the anterior aspect of the upper arm. The distal basilic vein is ligated and divided and then tunneled laterally and superficially in a curved fashion. The end of the basilic vein is spatulated to match the size of the arteriotomy, and an end-to-side anastomosis is performed using a running nonabsorbable monofilament suture. Vascular Doppler should be used to confirm the thrill through the fistula, as well as the distal radial artery signal. Hemostasis is achieved, subcutaneous tissues are approximated, and skin is closed using nonabsorbable sutures.

**Two-Stage:**The first stage starts with making a transverse incision just distal to the antecubital fossa. The brachial artery and basilic vein are dissected, mobilized, and secured using vessel loops. An arteriotomy is made in the distal brachial artery and then flushed with heparinized saline. The distal basilic vein is ligated and divided, and the end spatulated to match the arteriotomy. An end-to-side anastomosis is made using a running nonabsorbable monofilament suture. The fistula is then allowed to mature over the next 6-8 weeks. The patient is then brought back to the operating room for the second stage. A longitudinal incision is made in the upper arm from the axilla to the antecubital fossa. The arterialized basilic vein is dissected proximally in a similar fashion and transected proximal to the anastomosis. The vein is mobilized and tunneled laterally and superficially using a curved tunneler. A new proximal brachiobasilic end-to-end anastomosis is made using a nonabsorbable monofilament suture.
