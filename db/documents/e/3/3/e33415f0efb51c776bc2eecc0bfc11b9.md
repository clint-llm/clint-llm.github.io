Keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria is a rare inflammatory genetic condition characterized by recurrent episodes of debilitating unilateral corneal and conjunctival hyperemia, corneal edema, visual impairment, corneal opacification, and photophobia that last for two to five days.

Though both the hyperemia and opacification generally resolve completely within two to four days, localized opacity in the cornea may persist for weeks to months after the acute phase.Â Initial reports indicated that regardless of the duration of the corneal haze, or the number of episodic incidents a person experiences, the opacification always completely remits and vision returns to normal.

The frequency of these symptomatic inflammatory attacks varies by age demographic. Patients who are 15 to 20 years old experience the most frequent symptoms, occurring one to eight times a year.
