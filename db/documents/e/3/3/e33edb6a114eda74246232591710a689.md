Current guidelines regarding diabetic foot osteomyelitis

- Control the soft tissue infection before resecting bone. Drain all infected areas

- Use negative pressure wound therapy dressings in between surgeries to help with healing

- Resect diseased bone until healthy bone is visible

- Any infected area of bone seen on x-ray should be removed

- All bone fragments removed at surgery should be examined for infection and organisms

- Sample proximal bone to ensure it is infection-free

- Use a power saw to resect bone

- Delayed primary closure should take place once all infection is cured

- Consider adjunctive tendo-Achilles lengthening in patients with ankle equinus deformity

- If the patient has significant forefoot functional issues which may trigger ulcers, consult a podiatrist
