Coronaviruses (CoVs) are large, enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses that belong to the Nidovirales order within the subfamily Coronaviridae. The genome encodes four or five proteins, including the spike (S) protein which projects through the viral envelope and forms the characteristic "crown" appearance of the virus, deriving its name from the Latin word corona, meaning crown. Based on their genomic structure, these viruses are classified into four different genera:

- Alphacoronavirus (αCoV)

- Betacoronavirus (βCoV)

- Gammacoronavirus (γCoV)

- Deltacoronavirus (δCoV)

Coronaviruses are widespread among birds and mammals, but only alpha and beta coronaviruses have been associated with human disease. The alpha coronaviruses include two human virus species, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, and the beta coronaviruses include five human virus species, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and now SARS-CoV-2. Most of these viruses involve the respiratory system, typically causing common cold symptoms.

SARS-CoV-2 is a novel beta coronavirus belonging to the same subgenus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which have been previously implicated in epidemics with mortality rates up to 10% and 35%, respectively.
