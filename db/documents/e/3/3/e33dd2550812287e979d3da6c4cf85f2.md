A cerebellar infarct (or cerebellar stroke) is a type ofÂ cerebrovascular event involving the posterior cranial fossa, specifically the cerebellum. Impaired perfusion reduces oxygen delivery and causes deficits in motor and balance control. In the case of hemorrhagic events, bleeding can directly damage tissue and worsen these deficits. While comprising a small fraction of strokes, cerebellar strokes are responsible for a disproportionate share of morbidity and mortality due to their sometimes subtle initial presentation and the adverse effects of reactive swelling in the posterior fossa. Of all brain strokes, Cerebellar strokes account for 1% - 4%.
