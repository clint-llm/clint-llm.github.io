Shrinking lung syndrome is a rare complication of SLE and requires a high index of suspicion to diagnose and prevent complications. While a rheumatologist will typically be supervising care, other specialists such as internists and pulmonologists plan an essential role in diagnosing and managing this condition, particularly in the exclusion of competing diagnoses. Nursing staff members are crucial in disease education and administering medications (including infusions of biologics where necessary). Pharmacists make a key contribution to the safe prescription of disease-modifying therapies. Physiotherapists and occupational therapists play a key role in rehabilitation from respiratory illness.

This condition has potentially deleterious consequences in the form of severe dyspnoea and potentially respiratory failure. Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed, along with a meticulous evaluation in order to make an early diagnosis and prevent complications and improve prognosis.
