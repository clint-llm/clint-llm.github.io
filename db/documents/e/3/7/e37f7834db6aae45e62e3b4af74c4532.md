Naloxone is a pure, competitive opioid antagonist with a high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor, allowing for the reversal of the effects of opioids. The onset of action varies depending on the route of administration but can be as fast as one minute when delivered intravenous (IV) or intraosseous (IO). It has a half-life of 30 to 120 minutes, depending on the route of administration, with IV being the fastest. In most cases of overdose, the reversal is observable in a matter of minutes. If no signs of reversal are apparent after administration of 10 mg of naloxone, one must consider co-ingestants like tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methamphetamine, and club drugs.
