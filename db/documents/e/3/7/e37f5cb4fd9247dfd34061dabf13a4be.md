Inflammation of the periosteum, periostitis, involves a dynamic pathophysiological pathway. Acute periostitis is caused by infection, which is marked by severe pain, the formation of pus, pain, constitutional symptoms, resulting in necrosis. An immoderate level of physical activity as well, as in the case of tibial periostalgia, instigates the formation of periostitis. Acute periostitis usually initiates in the deeper osteogenic layer of the periosteum by exudation and inflammation around the vessels; the periosteum unfastens and lifts from the bone by the exudation, leading to eventual destruction. This condition may lead simply to exfoliation or maybe the indication of extensive necrosis.

Periostitis involves the IL1RN (interleukin-1 receptor antagonist) gene and utilizes the innate immune system, and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) Induced Signaling to establish its mechanisms. PEDF is a member of the serine proteinase inhibitor (serpin) family. This polypeptide is traced back to as the agent of inflammation in cases of periostitis. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and type II interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R2) are the associated regulators of IL-1 biologic activity. During the inflammatory response, IL-1ra levels increase more than IL-1 levels, indicating that IL-1ra works to block further IL-1 activity and acts in the eventual termination of the inflammation; however, a mutation may inhibit IL-1ra activity. Individuals with this mutation either do not make or make defective, IL-1 receptor antagonists (IL-1Ra). This condition is known as DIRA (deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist), which is caused by homozygous recessive deletions of 2q13, E77X, N52KfsX25, and Q54X genes. The absence of IL-1ra results in unchallenged signaling through the IL-1R, leading to hyperactivity of cells related to IL-1-alpha and IL-1-beta with overproduction of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The malfunctioning of the IL-1 pathway yields systemic inflammation. Osteomyelitis may show a correlation with periostitis; however, misassociation has persisted in the past due to similar symptoms. Acute periostitis seldom affects the joints and may lead to the destruction of the medulla without acute inflammation. Congenital infection with syphilis may also lead to periostitis in newborn infants.

Endosteal hyperostosis is an autosomal dominant sclerosing bone disorder marked by skeletal densification. This condition is common in the tubular long bones and the cranial vault without a prominent risk of fracture. The syndrome results from a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-5 (LRP5) gene that yields increased bone formation. G171V mutation in the LPR5 was identified as the sub-mechanism. It can be distinguished from VBD and sclerostosis via a more harmless clinical presentation, although the radiological analysis may overlap.
