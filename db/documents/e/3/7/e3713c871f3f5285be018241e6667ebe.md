The exact epidemiology of PIOL is not known. Most of the available data relates to a larger group of primary central nervous system lymphoma. PCNSL accounts for 1 to 2% of all extranodal lymphomas and 3 to 5% of primary CNSÂ (central nervous system) tumors.

Primary intraocular lymphoma usually occurs in adults from the third to eighth decade of life, with a mean age of presentation in the fifth and sixth decades of life.
