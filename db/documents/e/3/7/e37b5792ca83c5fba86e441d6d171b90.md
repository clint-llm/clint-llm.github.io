Radial club hand is a term describing a group of complex congenital malformations of the radial side of the forearm. It comprises a spectrum of conditions that varies widely from thumb hypoplasia to an absent radius and first ray and includes hypoplasia of the associated muscles, ligaments, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels.

Jean-Louis Petit described the first case of radial club hand in 1733, who documented a case of a newborn male with bilateral absent radii. Kato, in 1923 reviewed 250 cases of radial clubhand and can be considered the first attempt at a comprehensive study of the condition.
