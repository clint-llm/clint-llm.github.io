As in any chronic illness, it is very common for people with chronic fatigue syndrome to experience depression, stress, and anxiety. While chronic fatigue syndrome is not a psychological condition, it is debilitating. Good days or bad days can be unpredictable. Patients experience ongoing challenges in their education, career, and personal life, as they work to balance how they feel about their obligations and desires. Many people with CFS describe feeling demoralized or even, at times, hopeless.
