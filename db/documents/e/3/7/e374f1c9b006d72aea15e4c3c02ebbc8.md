The basic biological assessment is performed in the early follicular phase (third to the sixth day of the cycle, early morning, fasting) and after stopping possible oral contraception for two or three cycles unless a tumor cause is suspected. It comprises total testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), delta4-androstenedione (delta4A), luteinizing hormone (LH) / follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), steroid hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). In the case of menstrual cycle disorder (amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea), the stimulating thyroid hormone (TSH) and prolactinemia (PRL) are included.

According to the clinical findings, one can add to the work up a short dexamethasone suppression test (Cushing syndrome), an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test and a prolonged dexamethasone suppression test (late adrenogenital syndrome), a carbohydrate tolerance test or HOMA index (insulin resistance syndrome).

The diagnosis of idiopathic hirsutism is a diagnosis of exclusion. Approximately 15% to 50% of women suffering from hirsutism belong to this category. Its pathogenesis is then parallel to that of primary androgenetic alopecia.
