The radial forearm free flap (RFFF) has gained tremendous popularity since its introduction in 1978 as a reconstructive option. This flap'sÂ relative ease of harvest, pliable tissue, and reliable anatomy make it a reconstructive workhorse most commonly for defects of the hypopharynx, oral cavity, total pharyngoesophagus, and scalp.
