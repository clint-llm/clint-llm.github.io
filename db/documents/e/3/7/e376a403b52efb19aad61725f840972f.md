Aspiration is common, even in healthy patients. Aspiration can have significant morbidity and mortality in certain circumstances. It is categorized based on the predominant material in the aspirate. If oropharyngeal secretions, orally ingested material, or partially digested gastric contents are aspirated, one would expect infectious pneumonia to develop. However, if pure gastric secretions are aspirated, then a chemical pneumonitis is the result. If partially digested gastric contents are aspirated along with some gastric acid, a mixture of chemical pneumonitis and inoculation of the lungs with potentially pathogenic organisms can occur. In practice, it is prudent to treat a chemical pneumonitis with prophylactic antibiotics because a superimposed infection occurs in over 25 percent of cases. It is difficult to determine the quality of the aspirate in most cases, and a combination of bacterial and chemical injury is common. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of aspiration pneumonia and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the risk factors for aspiration.
- Review the pathophysiology of aspiration pneumonia.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for pneumonitis.
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with pneumonitis.
