Diabetic ketoacidosis is a life-threatening complication of diabetes, and any delay in treatment can lead to death. The disorder can present with varied signs and symptoms and affects many organs; thus, it is best managed by an interprofessional team dedicated to the management of patients with diabetes mellitus. The majority of patients first present to the emergency department, and it is here that the treatment usually starts.

The triage nurse has to be familiar with the signs and symptoms of DKA and immediately admit the patient and notify the emergency department physician. While the patient is being resuscitated, placed on a monitor, and having blood drawn, the intensivist and an endocrinologist should be consulted.

Immediate blood work is necessary to determine the state of ketoacidosis, and imaging may be necessary to rule out pneumonia. If the mental status is altered, a CT scan may be required, and thus the radiologist must be notified about the patient's hemodynamic status. No patient with DKA should go unmonitored to a radiology suite.

The infectious disease expert and cardiologist should be consulted if there is suspicion of infection or MI as the trigger.

The pharmacist and nurses should determine if the patient was compliant with insulin treatment. Following discharge, the social workers should be involved in the care since recurrent DKA admissions are common, especially in inner-city hospitals. Socioeconomic status, education status, access to insulin, the presence of health care coverage, and the presence of mental illness, etc. play a big role in these patients.

An interprofessional team, including social workers, are often needed to address these particular situations. Meticulous discharge planning, involving social workers for patients with socioeconomic needs, and hospital initiated follow up clinics for discharged patients are some of the factors important to reduce the recurrences of DKA in the same individual. Finally, patient education is highly recommended, as in many cases, the cause of DKA is failing to comply with treatment.

**Outcomes**

In developed countries, the morbidity and mortality rates are low chiefly because of a streamlined interprofessional approach to the management of these patients. However, in developing countries, mortality rates of 0.3Â to 2.5% are still reported. The major cause of death in most young patients is cerebral edema.
