Symptoms of extracranial carotid disease are usually caused by embolization. Arterial emboli account for approximately 25 percent of strokes in Europe and North America, and 80 percent of these originate from atherosclerotic lesions in a surgically accessible artery in the neck. Most commonly, the lesion is at the bifurcation of the carotid artery. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and technique involved in performing carotid artery surgery and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the pre-operative and post-operative care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures involved in carotid artery surgery.
- Describe the indications for carotid artery surgery.
- Review the complications of carotid artery surgery.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to ensure safe performance of carotid artery surgery and improve patient outcomes.
