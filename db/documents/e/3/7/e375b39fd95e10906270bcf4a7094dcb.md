Unfractionated heparin is an anticoagulant indicated for both the prevention and treatment of thrombotic events such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) as well as atrial fibrillation (AF). Heparin is also used to prevent excess coagulation during procedures such as cardiac surgery, extracorporeal circulation, or dialysis, including continuous renal replacement therapy. Heparin is also widely used in the hospital for many different off-label indications. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, dosing, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of heparin and increases practitioners' knowledge regarding how to approach this medication and use and monitor it effectively to drive better patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications, both approved and off-label, of heparin.
- Identify the potential adverse effects and contraindications of heparin.
- Review the monitoring for toxicity, as well as any potential reversal measures that may be available.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients when using heparin as anticoagulation therapy.
