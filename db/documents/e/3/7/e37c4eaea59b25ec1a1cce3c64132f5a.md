Diffuse intramural esophageal diverticulosis is a rare disease characterized by multiple tiny flask-shaped outpouching lesions of the esophageal wall. These outpouchings represent the ducts of submucosal glands of the esophagus, and for this reason, the disorder is also called esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis (EIP). It was first described by Mendl et al. in1960.
