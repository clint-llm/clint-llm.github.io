Although human tissue can withstand significant pressure, tissue injury can occur when a gas-filled space is unable to equilibrate to environmental pressure. This can be an increase or decrease in pressure. This phenomenon is called barotrauma. Two conditions must be present for barotrauma to occur: a change in ambient pressure and transfer of pressure to a gas-filled space. Failure of the Eustachian tube to equalize pressure between the middle ear and external ear canal due to mucosal edema from irritation, infection, or allergy can lead to elevated middle ear pressure (as compared to ambient pressure) on ascent whether in the water or air.  A pressure increase in the middle ear of as little as a few feet of seawater (66 cm H2O) can impede capillary blood flow to the facial nerve traversing the area producing ischemic neuropathy.
