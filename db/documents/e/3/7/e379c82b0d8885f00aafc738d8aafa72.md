Different diseases or pathologies that are known to causes vegetations with the heart valves should be ruled out before diagnosing LSE; these include:

- Infective endocarditis: either positive or negative culture

- Rheumatic valvular disease

- Atrial myxoma

- Degenerative valvular disease

- Infective endocarditis

- Vasculitis

- Cholesterol emboli syndrome occurs when atherosclerotic plaque becomes disrupted, and cholesterol crystals embolize distally. Clinical manifestations depend on the location of the embolic source, the extent of embolization, and the degree of preexisting disease in the affected vascular bed; they may include systemic or cerebral embolism

- Fibroelastoma

- Lamb's excrescences: originate at valve closure sites (most commonly on the aortic valve). They appear to be normal variants, but some reports propose embolic potential. Laboratory studies should include a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, and blood cultures to exclude infective endocarditis. A workup for SLE and APS is necessary if the patient does not already have these as established diagnoses.
