Untreated or undiagnosed thyrotoxicosis can lead to thyroid storm. Patients present with tachycardia, fever, altered mental status, agitation, features of cardiac failure, and impaired liver function. A careful history is needed to identify a precipitating event such as major stress, illness, or a recent injury. Treatment include administration of thionamide therapy with methimazole or PTU to stop the synthesis of new thyroid hormone and Iodine to stop the release of pre-formed hormone.  Supportive care with beta-blockers and fluid resuscitation is commonly used in a critical care setting.
