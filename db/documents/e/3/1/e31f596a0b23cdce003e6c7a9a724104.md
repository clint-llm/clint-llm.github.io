Throughout history, multiple investigators reported a high occurrence of benign palatal mucosal cysts in newborns. In 1880, a Prague pediatrician, Alois Epstein, first described Epstein disease as the presence of small nodules in the oral cavity of newborns.

Epstein pearls, Bohn nodules, and gingival cyst of the newborn (dental lamina cyst) are peculiarly similar lesions that have been confused and interchanged throughout the years. They share more similarities than they show differences: similar clinical appearance, same histology, and natural history of evolution, but differ in etiology.

Currently, palatal cysts is the term used to refer to Epstein’s pearls and Bohn’s nodules, and gingival cysts of the newborn is used to refer to dental lamina cysts.

It is not always possible nor required to differentiate between these three entities clinically; they are diagnosed based on their clinical appearance alone, and the course of treatment is the same for all of them. However, health care professionals who work with newborns must be well informed about the clinical aspect of these benign self-resolving lesions to distinguish them from other conditions requiring an invasive approach – congenital epulis of the newborn natal and neonatal teeth.
