In the past, conotoxins and affected ion channels have been studied to understand the toxic effects that envenomation can have on the body. In recent years, research has focused on how conotoxins can be used as medicinal therapies. The primarily explored pharmaceutical potential has been in cases of intractable pain. At this time, a conotoxin from C.
magus has been FDA-approved for pain management under the trade name Prialt. Other toxins have been considered for the management of Parkinson’s disease and to provide cardioprotective effects. Given the large variety of neuromodulatory targets, conotoxins could potentially serve as therapy for a wide range of diseases.

An additional, but concerning, potential use of conotoxins is the capability of creating bioterrorism agents. Most toxins are relatively simple combinations of peptides, so as they are studied, these combinations are relatively easy to recreate within a laboratory setting. Potential bioterrorism concerns include the utilization of conotoxins in food source contamination and aerosolization of conotoxins for wide dispersal.
