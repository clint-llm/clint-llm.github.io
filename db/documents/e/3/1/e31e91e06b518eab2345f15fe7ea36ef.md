The medial lemniscus (second-order neuron of the DCML pathway) is mostly contained within the brainstem. Due to the high density of neurological tracts and nuclei in the brainstem, it is complex to perform surgery targeting specific pathways within it. Surgery in the brainstem may result in additional neurologic tracts suffering damage; therefore, surgery has historically been reserved for clear-cut cases in which benefits outweigh risks. Researchers conducted a prospective randomized clinical trial, in which motor deficit and neurological status outcomes underwent evaluation using preoperative diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) in patients undergoing surgery for cavernous brainstem malformations. Although it is too early to make any conclusions, results seem promising as specific tracts and pathologies may be visualized, allowing for a better surgical approach, decision making, and potentially decreasing morbidities.
