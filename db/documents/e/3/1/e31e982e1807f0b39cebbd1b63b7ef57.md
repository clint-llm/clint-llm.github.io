A thorough history is necessary, with detailed questions regarding recent falls, trauma or injuries, use of anticoagulation, presented spinal instrumentation, intravenous drug use, history of malignancy, chiropractic manipulation, and constitutional symptoms like fevers/chills.

Patients can present with:

- Back pain and sciatica (seen in as many as 97% of patients)

- Weakness and changes in sensation in the lower extremities

- Bladder dysfunction (disruption of autonomic fibers results in either retention or incontinence in up to 92% of patients)

- Bowel dysfunction (retention or incontinence in up to 72% of patients)

- Saddle anesthesia or decreased sensation in the perineum (in up to 93% of patients)

- Sexual dysfunction (impotence in men)

The symptoms above when presenting in isolation, are neither specific nor sensitive for CMS/CES. However, several of the signs and symptoms mentioned above taken as a constellation should raise clinical suspicion.

Once clinical suspicion is established based on history, a thorough neurological examination is paramount. Findings to watch for include:

- Motor or sensory deficits in the legs – usually bilateral but can also be unilateral and asymmetrical (particularly in cases with an incomplete injury)

- Lower motor neuron signs in the legs – areflexia, hypotonia, atrophy (in cases of chronic cord compression resulting in CES)

- Saddle anesthesia

- Absent or decreased rectal tone

- Absent or decreased bulbocavernosus reflex

- Palpable bladder indicating urinary retention

It is important to note that in the case of isolated conus medullaris syndrome, deficits of the lower extremities are more often bilateral and symmetric. Also, upper motor neuron signs can be present, such as spasticity and hyperreflexia.
