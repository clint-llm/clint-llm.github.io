Although not directly articulating with musculature, the medial meniscus is vital in stabilizing and cushioning the medial knee during movement. The knee has two primary movements: flexion and extension. Two separate groups of muscles control these two movements. Extension of the knee is controlled by the quadriceps muscles, which include the vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, rectus femoris, and vastus medialis. Flexion of the knee is controlled by the hamstring muscles: the semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and biceps femoris.
