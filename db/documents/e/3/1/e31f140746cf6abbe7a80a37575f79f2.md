Idiopathic acute eosinophilicÂ pneumonia can occur at any age but is more common in males of age 20-40 years. Associations for the condition also exist with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), HIV infection, and smoking.

The most common cohort for chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is white women with a peak incidence between 30-40 years. Asthma is present in 50 percent of these patients.
