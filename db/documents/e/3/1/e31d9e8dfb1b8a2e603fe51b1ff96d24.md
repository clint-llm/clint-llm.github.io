Because of their long course through the arm, each of the nerves is vulnerable to damage, particularly in the setting of trauma or surgery.

The axillary nerve can suffer damage with anterior, inferior dislocations of the shoulder joint, through prolonged compression of the axilla, and with fracture of the surgical neck of the humerus. Injury leads to loss of arm abduction, deltoid atrophy, and loss of sensation over the lateral arm.

Damage to the musculocutaneous nerve can occur during surgery with overzealous retraction of the coracobrachialis. Injury leads to weakened flexion at the elbow and shoulder, weakened supination, and a corresponding loss of sensation.

The radial nerve can get compressed at the axilla, known as Saturday night palsy.  Injury at this level leads to loss of extension of the forearm, wrist, and fingers combined with sensory loss in the radial nerve distribution. In the arm, the radial nerve can incur damage with a mid-shaft humeral fracture leading to weakness of wrist and finger extension and corresponding sensory loss distally. Damage can also occur in the forearm.

Ulnar nerve injury can occur with a fracture of the medial epicondyle resulting in abduction of the wrist, loss of abduction and adduction of the fingers, loss of flexion at the MCP joints, and hypothenar atrophy.  Loss of thumb adduction results in a positive Froment sign. The ulnar nerve can suffer an injury at the wrist.

The median nerve can become impaired with a supracondylar humerus fracture.  Injury at this level can cause adduction of the wrist, loss of pronation of the forearm, weakness of wrist flexion, loss of thumb flexion, thenar muscle atrophy, and loss of sensation over the corresponding area.  When attempting to form a fist, the radial digits will not flex, resulting in the hand of benediction sign.  At rest, loss of thumb abduction leads to the ape hand deformity.  Distally, the anterior interosseous nerve can be injured, and the median nerve can be damaged at the wrist or compressed within the carpal tunnel.
