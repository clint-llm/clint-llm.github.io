In all 50 states in the U.S. and a few other countries where the incidence of this disease is high, NBS for inherited types of hypertyrosinemia is available. Unfortunately, most other nations do not have a robust NBS program that often allows this disease to go undiagnosed until later. NBS programs rely on tandem mass spectroscopy to detect SA in HT1 or elevated tyrosine levels in HT2 and HT3. Patients suspected of hypertyrosinemia based on clinical features or an abnormal NBS should undergo confirmatory tests for a specific type of tyrosinemia. For example, HT1 patients have elevated SA in their urine or blood and moderate tyrosine elevations. Elevated SA is considered pathognomonic of HT1. These patients also have elevated alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), abnormal liver function, and coagulation profiles.

Patients with HT2 have substantially higher levels of tyrosine (>1000 micromoles/L). In addition, urine from these patients contains large quantities of p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, p-hydroxyphenyllactate, and p-hydroxyphenylacetate. Patients with HT3 have elevated serum tyrosine levels, but the levels are typically less than 500 micromol/L.

Molecular testing for specific gene mutations is also available for all three types of hereditary hypertyrosinemia. Acquired types of tyrosinemia usually have mild elevations in serum tyrosine levels and typically show up as abnormal NBS in the case of transient tyrosinemia of the newborn. Since the tyrosine levels are only mildly elevated, these patients are clinically asymptomatic.

Once a diagnosis has been made, most patients with HT1 and HT2 require interdisciplinary team management involving a pediatrician/neonatologist and a gastroenterologist, cardiologist, neurologist, ophthalmologist, dermatologist, a medical geneticist from the pediatric specialty along with a nutritionist experienced in managing hypertyrosinemia patients. Timely consultations and regular follow-ups with these sub-specialties cannot be overemphasized. Affected HT1 patients would also need abdominal imaging to rule out hepatocellular carcinoma. HT2 patients would benefit from echocardiography to rule out cardiomyopathy and nerve conduction studies to evaluate peripheral neuropathy.

In terms of imaging, all patients with features to suggest hypertyrosinemia should get an ultrasound of the liver and kidneys. If there are nodules in the liver, further imaging, preferably an MRI, should be carried out. A bone radiograph of the wrist or chest should be done in cases of confirmed tubulopathy.
