This viral infection is not indigenous to one area in particular but occurs worldwide. As children (particularly those younger than seven years of age) tend to be infected at a higher rate than adults, you can see outbreaks in daycares, summer camps, or within the family. Large-scale surveillance from China demonstrated that more than 90% of HFMD cases occurred in children less than five years of age, mortality was around 0.03%, and that cases tended to occur more frequently during late spring and early summer.

In 2021, French surveillance found a rapid increase in HFMD cases, with more than 3400 cases. Although more than 90% of sequenced cases were found to be linked to Enterovirus, atypical cases were found to be associated with Coxsackievirus A6 and A16.
