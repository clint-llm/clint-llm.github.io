**When to Refer for Bariatric Surgery**

- There have been significant advances in pharmacotherapies for weight loss. However, bariatric surgery remains the most effective weight loss treatment. Pharmaceutical options may not be available to all patients due to side effects, cost, or contraindications to the medication. Surgical interventions are an option for patients with clinically severe obesity (BMI ≥40 kg/m^2 or BMI ≥35 kg/m^2 with comorbid conditions) who are unable to lose weight.

**Recommendations on How to Maintain Lost Weight**

- Patients may often find it difficult to maintain their weight loss long-term. Research shows that physical activity strongly predicts keeping weight off long-term. In addition to being physically active, treatment adherence to diet is also key to long-term success.

- Practitioners must educate patients that a lack of weight loss does not imply a lack of benefits. Less than 3% of Americans meet the basic qualifications for a "healthy lifestyle," as defined by four characteristics: 150 minutes of moderate-vigorous activity a week, a healthy diet, not smoking, and having a healthy body fat percentage.
