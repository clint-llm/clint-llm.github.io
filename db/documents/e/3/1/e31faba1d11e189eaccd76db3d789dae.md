- After a rapid initial evaluation of the patient, it is essential to determine the concentration of the solution and the route of exposure, as this is critical in management decisions and prognosis.

- Early intubation for airway protection should be considered if there is any concern for airway compromise, as the burns/injury can continue progressing and may progress rapidly.

- Consider NG or OG tube for possible drainage of remaining hydrogen peroxide and/or decompression of the stomach/GI tract as the reaction produces significant amounts of oxygen gas.

- In some situations, central line placement with removing oxygen gas from the bloodstream may be considered.

- Hyperbaric treatment may be life-saving or life-altering to patients with air emboli.
