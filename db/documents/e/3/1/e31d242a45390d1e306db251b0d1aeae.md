**Dry Eyes**

One of the most common transient side-effects from LASIK is dry eyes due to a lack of tear production. This is due to the interruption of the lacrimal reflex as a result of nervous tissue being severed during the procedure.

**Visual Aberrations**

20% of patients will report some form of visual change.

**Diffuse Lamellar Keratitis**

Patients may also report blurriness and foreign body sensation that may be caused by diffuse lamellar keratitis (DLK), or “sands of Sahara” syndrome, a sterile inflammatory response.

**Corneal Flap Complications**

The incidence of microstriae, macrostriae, buttonholing, incomplete cap, free cap, cap dislodgement, and epithelial ingrowth after surgery, is a low-risk event, with 0.1-4% of patients reporting some form of complication.

**Post-LASIK Ectasia**

A thin cornea before surgery may increase the risk of developing ectasia or further thinning of the cornea. The incidence has been reported from 0.04% to 0.6%.

**Infectious Keratitis**

Less than 0.1% of patients will develop an infection after LASIK.Staphylococcus species, or atypical mycobacteria, especially if the onset of infection is one-two weeks after surgery.

**Rare Complications**

Ischemic optic neuropathy, retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and posterior vitreous detachment, are potential but very rare complications of LASIK, occurring in less than 0.1% of patients.
