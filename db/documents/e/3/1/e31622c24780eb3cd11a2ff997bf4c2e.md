While there is not a single blood supply to the EW nucleus, it receives its blood supply via vessels that feed the midbrain and brainstem. These blood vessels are part of the vertebrobasilar circulation and include the basilar artery, superior cerebellar artery, and posterior cerebral artery

The second segment (P2) is characterized by an anterior and posterior part (P2A and P2P). The P2A begins at the end of the P1 and extends to the most lateral aspect of the cerebral peduncle. The P2P then continues onwards to the posterior edge of the lateral midbrain. The P3 part of the artery extends until the origin of the parieto-occipital sulcus, and the P4 parts are the branches that occupy this sulcus and the calcarine sulcus.

The lymphatic drainage of the brain consists of the perivascular pathway (basement-membrane drainage system), glymphatic pathway, cerebrospinal fluid drainage via meningeal lymphatic vessels, and cervical lymph drainage routes.
