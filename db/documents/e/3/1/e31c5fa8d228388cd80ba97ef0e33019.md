Superficial hand infections are commonly encountered by hand surgeons, primary care physicians, and emergency medicine practitioners. As many superficial infections are managed conservatively in an outpatient setting, determination of the exact incidence of various infections is challenging. One study estimated 70% to 85% of hand infections are located within the skin, nail fold, fingertip pulp, or subcutaneous tissues.

Certain populations of patients have been determined to be at greater risk for hand infections. Manual laborers are more predisposed to superficial trauma, which can lead to the development of infection.
