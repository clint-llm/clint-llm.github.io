TEN is characterized by extensive full-thickness epidermal necrosis with subsequent epidermal detachment. There is little evidence of dermal or epidermal inflammation, as few mononuclear cells can be seen in skin biopsies. In the early stage, satellite cell necrosis occurs, which then progresses to extensive eosinophilic necrosis. Histological evaluation includes immunofluorescence analysis of the skin specimen to differentiate it from other exfoliative skin conditions.
