Laryngeal cancer should be on the differential for any patients who present with prolonged hoarseness or with risk factors to include worsening dyspnea, aspiration, and/or weight loss. Clinicians should seek consultation with an Otolaryngologist for further referral to exclude malignancy.

Patients presenting with persistent dysphonia that does not resolve after four weeks or worsens should seek attention from their medical provider. Voice rest and speech therapy is often the first-line treatment option for benign laryngeal lesions and muscle tension dysphonia.
