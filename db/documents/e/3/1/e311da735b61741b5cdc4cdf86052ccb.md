Prevention and management of Marjolin ulcers require an interprofessional team approach, including providers from surgery, primary care, oncology, and dermatology. Burn scars should be excised, and the surrounding skin should be reconstructed by a surgeon trained in the reconstruction (i.e., plastic surgeon) to prevent malignant conversion. For burn scars that have been allowed to heal by secondary intention, primary care providers (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) must be aware that burn scars are at risk for malignant conversion. All burn scars should be monitored on routine physical examination, and patients should be educated on symptoms to prompt earlier presentation.

Wound changes that are suspicious for Marjolin ulcers should be immediately biopsied. Once malignancy has been identified, a team approach to management should be initiated. Staging should involve an examination of the regional lymph nodes, either by physical or ultrasound examination. If the malignancy is thought to be confined to the scar, treatment should be discussed with a surgical oncologist, plastic surgeon, and Mohs surgeon. Resection with wide margins or Mohs technique should be performed depending on the location and desired cosmesis.

After treatment, follow-up surveillance should occur regularly with a primary care provider or dermatologist to note any evidence of recurrence.
