Many chronic diseases can cause end-stage renal disease. In many developed and developing countries, diabetes mellitus is the leading cause.

- Hypertension

- Vascular disease

- Glomerular disease (primary or secondary)

- Cystic kidney diseases

- Tubulointerstitial disease

- Urinary tract obstruction or dysfunction

- Recurrent kidney stone disease

- Congenital (birth) defects of the kidney or bladder

- Unrecovered acute kidney injury

- Certain medications, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), calcineurin inhibitors, and antiretrovirals

- **Vascular Diseases**
- Renal artery stenosis
- Cytoplasmic pattern antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (C-ANCA)–positive and perinuclear pattern antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (P-ANCA)–positive vasculitides
- ANCA-negative vasculitides
- Atheroemboli
- Hypertensive nephrosclerosis
- Renal vein thrombosis

- **Primary Glomerular Diseases**
- Membranous nephropathy
- Alport syndrome
- Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy
- Focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
- Minimal change disease
- Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN)
- Complement-related diseases (atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome [HUS], dense deposit disease)
- Rapidly progressive (crescentic) glomerulonephritis

- **Secondary Causes of Glomerular Disease**
- Diabetes mellitus
- Systemic lupus erythematosus
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Mixed connective tissue disease
- Scleroderma
- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis)
- Mixed cryoglobulinemia
- Endocarditis
- Hepatitis B and C
- Syphilis
- Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
- Parasitic infection
- Heroin use
- Gold
- Penicillamine
- Amyloidosis
- Light-chain deposition disease
- Neoplasia
- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
- Shiga-toxin or Streptococcus pneumoniae – related HUS
- Henoch-Schönlein purpura
- Reflux nephropathy

- **Causes of Tubulointerstitial Disease**
- Drugs (eg, sulfonamides, allopurinol)
- Infection (viral, bacterial, parasitic)
- Sjögren syndrome
- Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome
- Chronic hypokalemia
- Chronic hypercalcemia
- Sarcoidosis
- Multiple myeloma cast nephropathy
- Heavy metals
- Radiation nephritis
- Polycystic kidneys
- Cystinosis and other inherited diseases

- **Urinary Tract Obstruction**
- Benign prostatic hypertrophy
- Urolithiasis (kidney stones)
- Urethral stricture
- Tumors
- Neurogenic bladder
- Congenital (birth) defects of the kidney or bladder
- Retroperitoneal fibrosis
