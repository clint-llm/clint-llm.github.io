FMD can lead to many complications; however, they only occur in approximately 10% of cases. One such complication is carotid artery dissection leading to ruptures. Others include involvement of the arterial lumen causing a decrease in perfusion and the formation of thrombi which could lead to distal embolization. There are also concurrent issues that can ariseÂ and complicate management. These include atherosclerotic occlusion of the carotid bifurcation which makes it difficult to ascertain the cause of cerebral symptoms, extracranial carotid aneurysms, FMD of the vertebral and renal arteries.
