High-dose radiations on a focused location, such as the hypothalamus hamartomatous lesion, can be effective. Gamma knife radiosurgery uses highly focused gamma rays, and therefore it is a distinctly precise procedure.

Although it uses highly focused radiation beams and is relatively safer than traditional radiation therapy, it can also cause various adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, fatigue, skin blistering, dysphagia, brain edema, and headache. Long-term treatment with radiation also increases the risk.
