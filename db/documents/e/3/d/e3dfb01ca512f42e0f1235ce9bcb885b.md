Pseudomembranous candidiasis presents histologically with an inflammatory cell infiltrate, with irregular acanthotic changes in the epidermis. As this lesion is the result of a fungal infection, hyphae ofÂ Candida may be present in a Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stain.

Erythema migrans has very characteristic findings, with a thickened spinous layer, swollen papillae, and a strong inflammatory infiltrate of T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils - mimicking that of psoriasis

Morsicatio buccarum presents histologically as normal tissue with a shredded appearance towards the outermost epithelium. Hyperkeratosis may be noted as a response to trauma. No evidence of dysplasia is noted.

Linea alba presents histologically as hyperkeratotic tissue and a potentially reduced granular layer

Leukoedema presents histologically with hyperkeratotic epithelium with irregular rete pegs

Oral lichen planus presents histologically with parakeratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Direct immunofluorescence reveals the distinctive linear fluorescence along the basement membrane and clefting of the epithelium-connective tissue junction
