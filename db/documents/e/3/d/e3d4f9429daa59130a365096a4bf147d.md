Cholesterol embolization syndrome occurs when atheromatous plaques in large arteries release cholesterol emboli and atheromatous debris into the circulation, which become lodged downstream in smaller arterioles, and cause varying degrees of ischemia of the target organ. The partially occluded arterioles also display an intense giant cell foreign body inflammatory response with fibrosis and eventually complete occlusion. Subsequent waves of arterial embolization are associated with increasing symptoms and signs of the syndrome and may explain why about 20% of cases go unrecognized. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of cholesterol emboli and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cholesterol embolization syndrome.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of cholesterol embolization syndrome.
- Outline the management options available for cholesterol embolization syndrome.
- Describe some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients with cholesterol embolization syndrome to prevent further development of atheroembolism and improve outcomes.
