**Imaging**

Imaging starts with plain radiographs. Orthogonal radiographs of the femur should be obtained. In addition, orthogonal images should be obtained of the hip and knee joints.

It is important to assess for ipsilateral femoral neck injuries. Â A 1-9% incidence has been noted in the literature. Many level one trauma centers have adopted protocols to include computed tomography (CT) scans which include both femurs to the level of the lesser trochanter. Before the widespread adoption of these protocols, associated ipsilateral femoral neck injuries were missed approximately 20-50% of the time.

Imaging may also play a part in management decision-making. The start site for IM nailing may be compromised in diaphyseal fractures with an associated proximal femur fracture. In these cases, a CT of the proximal femur is helpful to assess the integrity of the greater trochanter or piriformis fossa.

**Classification**

Open femur fractures can be categorized by the Gustillo-Anderson classification system. Epidemiologic studies documented 43% grade I, 31% grade II and 26% grade III open fractures. Aggressive management is necessary due to the mechanism of injury and the amount of soft tissue that must be violated for a femur fracture to become open.

Two common classification systems are used to describe diaphyseal femur fractures.

**The Orthopaedic Trauma Association Classification**

**32A - Simple**

- A1 - Spiral

- A2 - Oblique, an angle less than 30 degrees

- A3 - Oblique, an angle less than 30 degrees

**32B - Wedge**

- B1 - Spiral wedge

- B2 - Bending Wedge

- B3 - Fragmented Wedge

**32C - Complex**

- C1 - Spiral

- C2 - Segmental

- C3 - Irregular

**Winquist and Hansen Classification**

- Type 0 No comminution

- Type I Insignificant comminution

- Type II greater than 50% cortical contact

- Type III less than 50% cortical contact

- Type IV Segmental, with no contact between proximal and distal fragment

Blood work is always done to assess levels of hemoglobin. A significant amount of blood loss can occur with a femur fracture, which can lead to hypotension. If the wound is open, cultures should be obtained.
