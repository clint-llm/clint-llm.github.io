Given the inherent procedural risks associated with percutaneous biopsy and surgical resection and the indolent nature of focal nodular hyperplasia, close observation is recommended with serial imaging every three to six months. However, biopsy or resection is often pursued if a patient is symptomatic, if there is a concern for underlying malignancy after an inconclusive biopsy, or if a lesion displays continued growth. The definitive therapy remains surgical resection.

Focal nodular hyperplasia was first described in the 1960s prior to the widespread use of oral contraceptive pills. Since then, there has been no proven increase in the incidence of focal nodular hyperplasia with the use of estrogens. However, almost all documented cases of hemorrhage or rupture have occurred in patients taking oral contraceptives. While discontinuation of oral contraceptives is not necessarily indicated, follow up imaging is advised for any patient on estrogen therapy to monitor for growth. In the pediatric population, a thorough examination of the patient’s risk factors for underlying malignancy or liver disease is warranted.
