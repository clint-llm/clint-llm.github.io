Treatment of Wallenberg syndrome requires a rapid response and coordinated interprofessional team approach involving clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists to provide the patient with the best possible outcome. Preferably, a specialty-trained neurologist and neurology specialty nurse should assist with coordinating patient care, monitoring, and patient education, keeping other team members apprised of findings and issues. Nursing will assist with patient assessment and counseling and coordinate activities among all involved healthcare professionals. The pharmacist should evaluate for potential drug-drug interactions and assist with appropriate dosing and patient education, coordinating with the clinical staff if any medication changes are necessary. Therapists (OT, PT, speech) are crucial to the rehabilitation of lost neural function. An interprofessional approach utilizing open communication between all team members and accurate record-keeping will improve outcomes.
