A genetic link has been demonstrated that cites that about two-thirds of lipomas exhibit genetic abnormalities. In a subgroup of lipomas, the HMGA2 gene (located on 12q14.3) was involved in tumor pathogenesis.

The following structural rearrangements of chromosomes have been associated with lipoma occurrence:

- 12q13-15 region

- 13q portion loss

- 6p21-23 region

- Other loci anomalies or normal karyotype
