Keratin from shed skin cells accounts for roughly 60% of cerumen's mass, with the remainder composed of lipids and peptides secreted by the sebaceous and ceruminous glands of the lateral third of the external auditory canal.

In one study, every sample of cerumen from patients with recurrent impactions showed evidence of fungal growth, most commonly Aspergillus terreus; when bacteria are present, Staphylococcus aureus is most common.
