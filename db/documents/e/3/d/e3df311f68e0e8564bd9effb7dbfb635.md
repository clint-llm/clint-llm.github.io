Skin lesions of patients with CHILD syndrome usually reveal a psoriasiform epidermis with hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis. The papillary dermis usually also has foam cells that express surface markers such as CD68 and CD163 which are specific for macrophages. They do not express pan-cytokeratin markers AE1/AE3 and S100 proteins. Under electron microscopy, numerous lipid droplets and vacuoles are usually seen in the foam cells found in the upper dermis. These cells are made by ingestion of lipids by macrophages. When affected cells and unaffected cells from a CHILD syndrome patient are compared, there are significant differences in the markers of the keratinocytes. This strongly suggests that the difference in the affected skin originates in the keratinocytes and not from external factors or mutant cells. Mi et al. also confirmed these previous findings in their work published in 2015 where their patient with CHILD syndrome had macrophage-derived foam cells.
