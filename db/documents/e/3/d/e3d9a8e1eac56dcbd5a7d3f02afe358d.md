New-onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT) is the development of diabetes mellitus after solid organ transplantation. NODAT frequently occurs, increasing the risk of infection as well as mortality rates. The appropriate evaluation and management of NODAT by the health care providers result in prompt diagnosis with a subsequent decrease in morbidity and mortality associated with this condition and increases the organ survival after a transplant. This activity describes the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of NODAT and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of new-onset diabetes mellitus after organ transplantation. 
- Outline typical laboratory findings for a patient with new-onset diabetes mellitus after organ transplantation. 
- Explain the treatment considerations for patients with new-onset diabetes mellitus after organ transplantation. 
- Review the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance patient care, facilitate treatment planning, and increase patient survival following organ transplantation.
