Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur syndrome (GLPLS) is a type of lichen planopilaris. Lichen planopilaris is the follicular type of lichen planus. There are three variants of lichen planopilaris, including GLPLS, frontal fibrosing alopecia, and classic lichen planopilaris. The onset of symptoms in GLPLS can occur in any order, though the condition often begins with the development of the hyperkeratotic papules on the trunk and extremities prior to the development of alopecia. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Graham-Little-Piccardi-Lasseur Syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.
