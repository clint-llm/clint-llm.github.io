Wounds of all shapes and sizes have plagued patients and created a significant burden on their caretakers. It has long been noticed that some patient factors are more likely to be associated with better wound healing. Likewise, certain wound types have been noted to be associated with a better prognosis than others. Until recently, there has been little scientific evidence regarding the risk factors and characteristics, both positive and negative, responsible for wound healing behaviors. This activity will review factors that lead to poor wound healing and the latest advances in their care. It will also address how an interprofessional team can provide coordinated care to provide better outcomes in the care of patients with wounds.

**Objectives:**
- Describe factors that are associated with better wound healing.
- Identify the wounds that are likely to experience impaired healing.
- Summarize the recent advances in wound care and treatments available.
- Explain how use of an interprofessional team leads to better outcomes in the care of wounds.
