In some asymptomatic patients with small thyroid adenomas and no malignancy found by fine needle aspiration, regular monitoring with repeat ultrasonography is usually recommended. The FNA might need to be repeated if the nodule grows in size in future examinations or if other suspicious features are seen in a radiologic evaluation with an ultrasound.

For patients with benign thyroid adenomas, thyroid lobectomy and isthmusectomy is a sufficient surgical treatment. This procedure is also adequate for patients with minimally invasive thyroid cancer. When histological examination shows no signs of malignancy, then no further intervention is required. These patients should only continue to have their thyroid hormone status regularly checked.

Non-euthyroid patients with a solitary toxic nodule, which is a functioning thyroid adenoma, may be treated with anti-thyroid drugs to achieve a euthyroid state. Treatments with iodine-131 therapy or thyroidectomy are also recommended options. The advantages of surgical therapy are relief from compressive symptoms, immediate resolution of hyperthyroidism, and avoidance of radiation exposure to the normal part of the thyroid gland.
