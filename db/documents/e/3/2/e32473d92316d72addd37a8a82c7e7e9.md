Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is an extremely rare inherited blood clotting disorder that isÂ characterized by giant platelet cells, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged bleeding time. In 1948, Jean-Bernard and Jean-Pierre Soulier described the first male patient who presented with repeated episodes of bleeding throughout his life and eventually died at the age of 28 years from an intracranial hemorrhage sustained after a bar fight.
