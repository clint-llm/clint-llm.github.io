The inferior alveolar nerve block involves the injection of a local anesthetic solution near the area of the mandibular foramen and the entry of the nerve into the inferior alveolar canal. This anesthetic technique is widely used in routine dental practice as it facilitates multiple surgical procedures. This activity reviews the anatomy relevant to and indications for the inferior alveolar nerve block, describes various techniques that facilitate the administration of the anesthetic agent, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving outcomes for patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify potential indications of the inferior alveolar nerve block.
- Apply knowledge of the relevant anatomy to facilitate the proper administration of the inferior alveolar nerve block.
- Differentiate between the conventional and alternative techniques for the inferior alveolar nerve block concerning procedural execution, indications, and predicted outcomes.
- Report the potential complications of the inferior alveolar nerve block.
