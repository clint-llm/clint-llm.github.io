Below is a summary of the major muscles that border the adductor canal. For further detail, please see the references for each respective muscle.

- Adductor Longus

- Origin: Anterior aspect of the pubic bone
- Insertion: Linea aspera of the femur
- Innervation: Obturator nerve
- Function: Adduction of the thigh

- Adductor Magnus

- Origin: The muscle has two distinct portions with multiple origins, including the pubic ramus, the ischial ramus, and the ischial tuberosity.
- Insertion: Multiple including the gluteal tuberosity, linea aspera, supracondylar line of the femur, adductor tubercle of the femur, and other sites.
- Innervation: Obturator nerve and the tibial portion of the sciatic nerve
- Function: The adductor portion adducts and flexes the thigh; the hamstring portion adducts and extends the thigh.

- Â Sartorius

- Origin: Anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS)
- Insertion: Superior medial aspect of the tibial shaft. Joins with the tendons of the gracilis and semitendinosus muscles to form the pes anserinus.
- Innervation: Femoral nerve
- Function: Hip flexion, external hip rotation, knee flexion

- Vastus Medialis

- Origin: Inferior aspect of the intertrochanteric line as well as the medial aspect of the linea aspera of the femur
- Insertion: Medial border and base of the patella
- Innervation: Femoral nerve
- Function: Knee extension, stabilization of the patella
