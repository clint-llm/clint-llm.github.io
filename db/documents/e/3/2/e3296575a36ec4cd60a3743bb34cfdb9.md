Patient education on disease progression and available treatment options should be made available at the initial diagnosis. Having a more widespread circulation and up to date knowledge of osteonecrosis would aidÂ primary clinicians in making prompt and pertinent referrals to their orthopedic surgeon colleagues. It should be orthopedic surgeons who are proactive in circulating current information as it will ultimately enable better care of their patients. Orthopedic surgeons should closely follow up on patients with SON to monitor disease development.
