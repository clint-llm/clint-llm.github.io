The prognosis of biliary obstruction is highly dependent on the etiology. If left untreated, it can lead to life-threatening infection and sepsis. If the obstruction is persistent and chronic, it is usually due to a chronic liver pathology, which commonly has a poor prognosis. Most acute cases can be successfully managed with medical, surgical, and/or endoscopic treatment with full recovery. Obstruction caused by chronic liver disease and malignant etiology usually has a less favorable prognosis.
