It is generally accepted that dental implant treatment is done for restorativeÂ purposes. The importance of presurgical communication and cooperation between the restorative dentist, periodontist, dental technician, and the implant surgeon is well recognized in modern implantology. The predictable outcome of function and aesthetics of intraoral rehabilitation can and must be determined and controlled before the surgical procedure, with the entire restorative team (the periodontist, surgeon, restorative dentist, laboratory, and patient). Competent interprofessional team-work is essential for the successful completion of implant-retained restorations.
