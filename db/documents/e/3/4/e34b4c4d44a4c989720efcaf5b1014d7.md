As mentioned above, pulmonary surfactant is a lipoprotein. Its production begins around 26 weeks gestation and reaches mature levels at approximately 35 weeks. It is produced in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of type two pneumocytes and secreted from the lamellar bodies of type two pneumocytes.

A large portion of the composition of surfactant is phospholipid dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), which makes up about 50% of its structure.

SP-A also appears to be a part of a negative feedback mechanism that controls surfactant release from type II alveolar cells. SP-B and SP-C are hydrophobic proteins that control the rate at which surfactant covers the surface of alveoli.
