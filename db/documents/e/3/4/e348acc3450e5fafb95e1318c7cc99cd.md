**Initial Care**

Much like many exposures, care starts with stabilization, airway, breathing, and circulation, as well as removing contaminated clothing. Activated charcoal can be used for patients presenting within one hour of ingestion.

**Emergency Department**

If the patient had dermal exposure, their skin is to be washed with soap and water. For eye exposure, irrigate the eyes with room temperature water. Activated charcoal and Prussian blue may be used for gastrointestinal ingestion. Prussian blue has been shown to be more successful and is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration.

**Medications**
