MN is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes dialysis nurses. Traditionally, initial supportive care which includes controlling the blood pressure, salt restriction, ACE-I/ARB, statins, and diuretics should be provided for all patients with MN. Treatment of secondary MN should be achieved by treating the underlying cause. For patients with primary MN, clinicians should be aware that the addition of immunosuppressive (IS) therapy to the supportive care is indicated for patients with progressive loss of GFR (greater than 50% in serum creatinine or a level greater than 1.5 mg/dl) or refractory proteinuria. The Toronto risk score can be used to categorize patients in low (less than 4% g per day), moderate (4 to 8 g per day), and high risk (greater than 8 g per day) after 6 months of supportive care. Moderate and high-risk patients should be provided with IS therapy.

Unfortunately, about 10-20% of patients may not respond to treatment and may go on to develop ESRD requiring dialysis or renal transplant. Even those who respond to treatment may develop recurrence.
