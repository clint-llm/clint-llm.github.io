There are a few limitations of Freezing point depression osmometers. Particulate matter can cause premature crystallization of samples; this can be avoided by centrifuging blood and urine samples or the filtration of urine samples. The presence of air bubbles in a sample may also result in the inadequate freezing of samples. Test samples that are allowed to evaporate, are non-aqueous in nature, or are highly viscous may not freeze well and yield an inaccurate result. High concentrations of substances, including ethanol, methanol, acetone, paraldehyde, trichloroethane, or propylene glycol, may not freeze reliably, leading to inaccurate results.

Finally, failure to clean the sample container after sample analysis can lead to the next osmometer measurement being skewed by the previous sample. Vapor pressure osmometers are limited by a lack of precision compared to freezing point depression osmometers. They cannot be used to measure the osmolality of solutions that contain volatile solutes.
