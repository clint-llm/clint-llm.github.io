If hyperchloremic acidosis is not corrected, acidemia can cause arrhythmias which can prove fatal and increase mortality. pH less than 7.2 can impair myocardial contraction and increase the risk of ventricular fibrillation and heart failure. Tachypnea results in compensation of acidosis can cause respiratory muscle fatigue and if not corrected promptly can lead to respiratory arrest.
