Entropion is an inversion of the eyelid margin and is an extremely common lid malposition. Often the eyelashes are directed posteriorly at the globe. When the eyelashes are directed toward the globe, corneal and conjunctival damage can ensue, potentially leading to corneal disease. Surgical repair of entropion is performed to restore the eyelid to its proper anatomical alignment. This, in turn, protects the eye from injury and reduces associated symptoms. This activity describes the four types of entropion: congenital, involutional, acute spastic, and cicatricial. This activity also reviews the evaluation and treatment of entropion and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Differentiate the 4 types of entropion by etiology and underlying risk factors.
- Identify appropriate indications for entropion repair and manage postoperative complications.

- Compare the various approaches for surgical correction of entropion and the risks and benefits of each.
- Implement efficient and effective interprofessional practices for the management of entropion in the prehospital, hospital, and postoperative settings.
