The most important mechanisms of the immune system by which it generates immune response include:

Macrophages produce lysosomal enzymes and reactive oxygen species to eliminate the ingested pathogens. These cells produce cytokines that attract other leukocytes to the site of infection to protect the body. The innate response to viruses includes the synthesis and release of interferons and activation of natural killer cells that recognize and destroys the virus-infected cells. The innate immunity against bacterial consist of the activation of neutrophils that ingest pathogens and the movement of monocytes to the inflamed tissue where it becomes in macrophages. They can engulf, and process the antigen and then present it to a group of specialized cells of the acquired immune response. Eosinophils protect against parasitic infections by releasing the content of their granules.

**Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC)**: A cytotoxic reaction in which Fc-receptor expressing killer cells recognize target cells via specific antibodies.

**Affinity maturation**: The increase in average antibody affinity mostly seen during a secondary immune response.

**Complement system**: It is a molecular cascade of serum proteins involved in the control of inflammation, lytic attack on cell membranes, and activation of phagocytes. The system can undergo activation by interaction with IgG or IgM (classical pathway) or by involving factors B, D, H, P, I, and C3, which interact closely with an activator surface to generate an alternative pathway C3 convertase.

**Anergy**: It is the failure to induce an immune response following stimulation with a potential immunogen.

**Antigen processing**: Conversion of an antigen into a form that can be recognized by lymphocytes. It is the initial stimulus for the generation of an immune response.

**Antigen presentation**: It is a process in which specific cells of the immune system express antigenic peptides in their cell membrane along with alleles of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) which is recognizable by lymphocytes.

**Apoptosis**: Programmed cell death involving nuclear fragmentation and the formation of apoptotic bodies.

**Chemotaxis**: Migration of cells in response to concentration gradients of chemotactic factors.

**Hypersensitivity reaction**: A robust immune response that causes tissue damage more considerable than the one caused by an antigen or pathogen that induced the response. For instance, allergic bronchial asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus are an example of type I and type III hypersensitivity reactions respectively.

**Inflammation**: Certain reactions that attract cells and molecules of the immune system to the site of infection or damage. It featured increased blood supply, vascular permeability and increased transendothelial migration of blood cells (leukocytes).

**Opsonization**: A process of facilitated phagocytosis by deposition of opsonins (IgG and C3b) on the antigen.

**Phagocytosis**: The process by which cells (e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells) take up or engulf an antigenic material or microbe and enclose it within a phagosome in the cytoplasm.

**Immunological tolerance**: A state of specific immunological unresponsiveness.

**Hypersensitivity Reactions**

They are overreactive immune responses to antigens that would not normally cause an immune reaction.

Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions: Initial exposure to the antigen causes stimulates Th2 cells. They release IL-4 leading the B cells to switch their production of IgM to IgE antibodies which are antigen-specific. The IgE antibodies bind to mast cells and basophils, sensitizing them to the antigen.

When the body is exposed to the allergen again, it cross-links the IgE bound to the sensitized mast cells and basophils, causing the degranulation and release of preformed mediators including histamine, leukotrienes, and prostaglandins. This causes systemic vasodilation, bronchoconstriction, and increased permeability of vascular endothelium.

The reaction can be divided into two stages – 1) **Immediate**, in which release of preformed mediators cause the immune response, and 2)**Late-phase response**8-12 hours later, in which the cytokines released in the immediate stage stimulate basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils even though the allergen is removed.

Type 2 hypersensitivity reactions (Antibody dependant cytotoxic hypersensitivity): Immune response against the antigens present on the cell surface. Antibodies binding to the cell surface, activate the complement system and cause the degranulation of neutrophils and destruction of the cell. Such reactions can be targeted at self or non-self antigens. ABO blood group incompatibility leading to acute hemolytic transfusion reactions is an example of Type 2 hypersensitivity.

Type 3 hypersensitivity reactions are also mediated by circulating antigen-antibody complex that may be deposited in and damage tissues. Antigens in type 3 relations are soluble as opposed to cell-bound antigens in type 2.

Type 4 hypersensitivity reactions (delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions): They are mediated by antigen-specific activated T-cells**.**When the antigen enters the body, it is processed by antigen-presenting cells and presented together with the MHC II to a Th1 cell. If the T-helper cell has already been sensitized to that particular antigen, it will be stimulated to release chemokines to recruit macrophages and cytokines such as interferon-γ to activate them. This causes local tissue damage. The reaction takes longer than all other types, around 24 to 72 hours.****

**Transplant Rejection**

- Xenografts are grafts between members of different species, triggers the maximal immune response. Rapid rejection.

- Allografts are grafts between members of the same species.

- Autografts are grafts from one part of the body to another. No rejection.

- Isografts are grafts between genetically identical individuals. No rejection.

**Hyperacute Rejection:**In hyperacute rejection, the transplanted tissue is rejected within minutes to hours because vascularization is rapidly destroyed. Hyperacute rejection is antibody mediated and occurs because the recipient has preexisting antibodies against the graft, which can be due to prior blood transfusions, multiple pregnancies, prior transplantation, or xenografts. Activation of the complement system leads to thrombosis in the vessels peventing the vascularization of the graft.

**Acute Rejection:**Develops within weeks to months. Involves the activation of T lymphocytes against donor MHCs. May also involve humoral immune response, which antibodies developing after transplant. It manifests as vasculitis of graft vessels with dense interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate.

**Chronic Rejection:**Chronic rejection develops months to years after acute rejection episodes have subsided. Chronic rejections are both antibody- and cell-mediated. The use of immunosuppressive drugs and tissue-typing methods has increased the survival of allografts in the first year, but chronic rejection is not prevented in most cases. It generally presents as fibrosis and scarring. In heart transplants, chronic rejection manifests as accelerated atherosclerosis. In transplanted lungs, it manifests as bronchiolitis obliterans. In liver transplants, it manifests as vanishing bile duct syndrome. In kidney recipients, it manifests as fibrosis and glomerulopathy.

**Graft-versus-host Disease:**The onset of the disorder varies. Grafted immunocompetent T cells proliferate in the immunocompromised host and reject host cells which they consider 'nonself' leading to severe organ dysfunction. It is a type 4 hypersensitivity reaction and manifests as maculopapular rash, jaundice, diarrhea, hepatosplenomegaly. Usually occurs in the bone marrow and liver transplants, which are rich in lymphocytes.
