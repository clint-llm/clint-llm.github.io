The venous drainage of the lower limb starts mainly on the dorsum of the foot, with proximal venous blood return occurring in both a superficial and deep venous pattern. The majority of the foot is drained by the small saphenous vein. The small saphenous vein begins at the lateral end of the dorsal venous arch. It then courses posterior to the lateral malleolus, ascending on the posterior side of the leg, running with the sural nerve before emptying into the popliteal vein. The great saphenous vein begins at the medial end of the dorsal venous arch of the foot. It then passes anterior to the medial malleolus and runs on the medial side of the lower limb before emptying into the femoral vein. The femoral vein then drains into the external iliac vein, which combines with the internal iliac vein to form the common iliac vein; this then drains into the inferior vena cava and right atrium of the heart.
