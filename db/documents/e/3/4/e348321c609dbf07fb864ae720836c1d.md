Laboratory abnormalities seen with MARV infection include increases in alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST) and increased serum creatinine levels. Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) encompass the hematological findings within the first week of symptoms.

According to the CDC, diagnosis can be made using antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) testing, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and IgM-capture ELISA within a few days of symptom onset. GP-based ELISA assays have been developed to detect species-specific antibodies, but PCR remains the preferred method for distinguishing between different virus variants andÂ aiding in the early identification of the disease. IgG-capture ELISA can be used later in the course of the disease or after recovery. Virus isolation must be completed in a high containment laboratory such as a biosafety level 4 laboratory.

Typical diagnostic samples include bodily fluids such as blood as well as tissue specimens at autopsy. In the United States, clinicians should immediately contact their state health department for further advice on specimen testing and managing patients under investigation.
