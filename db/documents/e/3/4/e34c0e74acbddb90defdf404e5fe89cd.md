There are many formulations for testosterone. Transdermal gels and intramuscular (IM) injections are the top two options. It is essential to note the difference and side effects when choosing patient candidates for testosterone therapy. There are many ways to administer testosterone, including oral, buccal, transdermal (gel, patch, solution, pellet), and IM injection.

Oral capsules and tablets of testosterone such as methyltestosterone should generally not be used to treat testosterone deficiency due to hepatic side effects and decreased efficacy compared with other formulations. The buccal form should not be chewed or swallowed.

Transdermal formulations include testosterone gels, patches, solutions, and pellets. Testosterone gels are generally the recommended formulation due to patient preference, cost, convenience, and insurance coverage. The chief advantage of gels is maintaining stable serum testosterone concentrations resulting in stable libido, energy, and mood. There are various formulations of testosterone gel. These gels should be applied to the shoulder, upper arms, or abdomen and not to the scrotum. A study showed the bioavailability of testosterone gel is 30% lower when applied to the abdomen than when compared with arms and shoulders.

Intramuscular injections of testosterone include testosterone enanthate and testosterone cypionate. These injections are generally recommended to be given at doses of 50 to 100 mg every week or 100 to 200 mg every two weeks.
