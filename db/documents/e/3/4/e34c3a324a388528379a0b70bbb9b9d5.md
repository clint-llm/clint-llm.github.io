NursesÂ caring for patients must include a mental status exam in the overall physical assessment of the patient. The evaluation may take place during admission or soon after. The mental status exam should include the general awareness and responsiveness of the patient. Additionally, one may also include the orientation, intelligence, memory, judgment, and thought process of the patient. At the same time, the patient's behavior and mood should undergo assessment. The patient care plans often have to be altered when there are observable abnormalities on the mental status exam.
