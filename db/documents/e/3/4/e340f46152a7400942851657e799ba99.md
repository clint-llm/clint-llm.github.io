Waardenburg syndrome is a group of genetic conditions inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. During embryogenesis, there is an abnormal distribution of melanocytes, which results in patchy areas of depigmentation. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Waardenburg syndrome and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of Waardenburg syndrome.
- Describe the clinical features of patients presenting with Waardenburg syndrome.
- Outline the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with Waardenburg syndrome.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Waardenburg syndrome.
