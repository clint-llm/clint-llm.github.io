There is no standardized dose for black cohosh. A randomized study published in Menopause in 2006 used black cohosh 160 mg/day orally in an ethanolic extract to contain 2.5% triterpene glycosides. This study was continued for 12 months, with no significant side effects reported. Another study published in 2009 used black cohosh at 128 mg/day orally in an ethanolic extract containing 5.7% triterpene glycosides. Again, there were no adverse effects reported. A Cochrane review of studies totaling over 2000 women used formulations from 8 to 160 mg orally daily with a median dose of 40 mg. The studies were 8 to 54 weeks in length. Not all the authors state that they used the rhizome/root for the extract. In many of the studies, extraction of the preparation was not detailed, nor was a standardization of the extract for specific active compounds accomplished. In light of all studies, doses of 160mg daily by mouth do not appear to have any ill effect on the user. Doses of various commercially available supplements vary greatly.
