Rheumatoid spondylitis in elective surgery:

- Any patient with RA should have flexion/extension films prior to having elective surgery

- RA spondylitis most commonly affects the occipitoatlantoaxialÂ joint

- Ranawat grade IIIB patients (nonambulatory) have high associated morbidity when it comes to performing surgical intervention -- thus the literature is very controversial with respect to the use of surgery in this unique subset of RA spondylitis patients
