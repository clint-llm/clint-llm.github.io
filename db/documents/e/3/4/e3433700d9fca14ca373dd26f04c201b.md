Acneiform eruptions can be distinguished from acne vulgaris by a history of sudden onset, monomorphic morphology, development of the eruption at any age,  affecting trunk more common than the face, not necessarily affecting sebaceous areas of the body with a rarity of cyst formation. In most cases, the diagnosis is clinical, but when there is doubt about the diagnosis, one may obtain a biopsy or culture any discharge. Withdrawal of the suspected medication is another way to make the diagnosis.
