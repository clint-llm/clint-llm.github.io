PLP is very complex and difficult to treat. It is best managed by an interprofessional team The first treatment is usually conservative and should include nonpharmacological and nonsurgical methods. The prosthetic professional should assess the stump and train the patient in the use of the prosthetic device. A mental health nurse and psychotherapist should help ease anxiety and depression. If this fails, The pharmacist should work with the clinician to select an appropriate agent, as well as educate the patient on the different pharmacological agents available, their effectiveness, and their adverse effects. A pain specialist should be involved as well

There is no one treatment that works reliably or consistently in all patients. Most patients are prescribed multiple agents to control pain, but tragically, this polypharmacy also has serious adverse effects that tend to lower compliance. Patients with PLP often doctor shop and try many types of conventional and non-conventional therapies to relieve the pain.

A pain referral should be ordered and the patient'sÂ HR-QOL should be improved.

Patient education is key and members of the team should communicate with each other so that the patient is provided with optimal treatment. The outcomes for most patients are guarded and the quality of life is poor.
