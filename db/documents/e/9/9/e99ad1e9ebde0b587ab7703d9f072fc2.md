With treatment, the prognosis of acute and chronic infections is generally favorable. However, in patients with hyperinfection syndrome and disseminated infection, the mortality rate is reported to be as high as 70 to 100%.

A 2006 study from Hong Kong evaluated the clinical course and outcome ofÂ disseminated strongyloidiasis over a 10-year period. Seven patients were identified, of which 5 had pulmonary involvement at the time of presentation and subsequently died despite anthelmintic therapy and aggressive supportive therapy. Pulmonary and bowel symptoms were prominent in this series, and peripheral eosinophilia was universally absent.
