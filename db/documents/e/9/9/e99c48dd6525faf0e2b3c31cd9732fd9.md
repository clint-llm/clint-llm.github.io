Polycystin-1 (PKD1 protein) and polycystin-2 (PKD2 protein) belong to a subfamily of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels

A common finding in animal models of PKD has increased levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), not only in the kidney but also in the liver and vascular smooth muscle.Â cAMP exerts effects on cell proliferation in different cell types. cAMP and PKA signaling enhances several pro-proliferative pathways in cells derived from polycystic kidneys while inhibiting proliferation in cells derived from normal human kidney cortex.

Liver cysts arise by excessive proliferation and dilation of biliary ductules and peribiliary glands.

Endothelial vasodilation and constitutive nitric oxide synthase activity are reduced in subcutaneous resistance vessels from patients with ADPKD and normal glomerular filtration rate (GFR), thus causing hypertension.
