The location of a rash and thorough history are the keys to makings a diagnosis of nickel allergy. Information such as a recently purchased piece of jewelry may lead to the discovery of an identifiable and treatable cause. Often, the patient will have multiple healthcare visits across specialties until a trigger for the contact dermatitis is identified. While it is unlikely there will be much direct communication between specialties for suspected allergic contact dermatitis, good documentation of patient visits, and lists of exposures may help improve timely identification. A team approach involving providers, nurses, and laboratory technicians to identify nickel allergy and make appropriate referrals will result in the best outcomes.
