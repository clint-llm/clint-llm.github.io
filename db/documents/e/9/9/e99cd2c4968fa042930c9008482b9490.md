Patients should be educated following an abortion that they should seek care immediately if they develop worsening bleeding, pain, or signs of infection. They should be advised to not use tampons or have sexual intercourse for two weeks after the abortion. Patients should also be made aware that symptoms of guilt and sadness may occur following an abortion, and that counseling can be helpful for some patients. The patient should also be educated regarding the use of proper contraceptive measures as a means of birth control, to avoid unwanted pregnancies. The patient should be urged to remain compliant with antibiotic therapy if the abortion was septic.
