Cardiac sarcoidosis has been reported in less than 10% of patients diagnosed with sarcoidosis. However, in patients with extracardiac sarcoidosis, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and autopsy studies have detected evidence of cardiac involvement in up to 26% of patients that remained asymptomatic.

The prevalence of CS is higher in African Americans (35.5 per 100,000) than whites (10.9 per 100,000). Cardiac sarcoidosis is more common in Japan, with autopsy studies showing a higher prevalence of myocardial sarcoidosis and a higher incidence of death from myocardial sarcoidosis in Japanese patients than whites and African Americans.
