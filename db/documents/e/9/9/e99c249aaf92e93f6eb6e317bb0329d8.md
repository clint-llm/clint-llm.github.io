There have been reports that HBO therapy may induce cataract formation. This may be true after chronic therapy but there is no evidence that a single session of HBO can affect vision. Patients who undergo multiple HBO treatments and complain of visual changes persisting for more than two to three months after completion of the HBO course should be seen by an ophthalmologist to assess vision and diagnose the cause of any impairment.
