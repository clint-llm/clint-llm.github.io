There are some areas where the indications for a pacemaker are clear, but there are few areas where clinical judgment and expertise plays a greater role. Although the guidelines attempt to define practices that meet the needs of most patients, the ultimate decision for the patient should be based on particular patient presenting scenario, clinician judgment, and discussion with the patient about risks and benefits of the procedure. There are specific pacemaker generators that are used for patients with AV block and sinus node dysfunction depending upon presentation. The different types of generators include a single chamber, dual chamber, and biventricular. A cardiology consult is highly recommended prior to the insertion of a pacemaker.
