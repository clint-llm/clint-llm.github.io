Myocarditis can present with a broad spectrum of symptoms of varying severity. From being asymptomatic to mild nonspecific symptoms like fever, myalgias, decreased exercise tolerance, or pleuritic chest pain, it can also mimic angina/MI and heart failure, or present with life-threatening arrhythmia or cardiogenic shock. In their position statement on myocardial and pericardial diseases, the European Society of Cardiology broadly grouped myocarditis symptoms into four classes

- Acute coronary syndrome-like presentation, associated with ST-T wave changes, the elevation of troponins, and even regional or global wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography, but with no evidence of CAD on coronary angiography. A respiratory or gastrointestinal illness often precedes symptoms by approximately 1-4 weeks.

- New onset or worsening heart failure lasting for fewer than 3 months, in the absence of CAD or known causes of heart failure, with symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, palpitations, pedal edema, fatigue, and chest discomfort. Physical examination may reveal a distressed, tachypneic individual with sinus tachycardia, an audible S3, bilateral crackles, or jugular venous distension. An echocardiogram can show impaired left or right ventricular systolic function with or without increased wall thickness or ventricular dimensions, and patients might have associated atrioventricular or bundle branch blocks.;

- Chronic heart failure with symptoms lasting for over 3 months, in the absence of CAD or known causes of heart failure

- Life-threatening conditions like ventricular arrhythmias or cardiogenic shock with severely reduced ejection fraction.

Patients might also display signs and symptoms of the causative disease. For example, a patient with Chagas’ disease might present with swelling at the infection site (chagoma), fever, myalgia, rash, lymphadenopathy or eyelid swelling (Romaña's sign) in the acute phase; or with dysphagia (megaesophagus), constipation (megacolon) or orthostatic hypotension (dysautonomia) in the chronic phase. Similarly, Lyme carditis may present with rash, flu-like symptoms, joint pain, facial palsy, or neuropathy.

Liebermann et al. introduced a clinicopathologic classification in 1991 that utilized clinical presentations to differentiate fulminant myocarditis from active lymphocytic myocarditis (acute, chronic active, or chronic persistent).
