The spherical equivalent (SE) can be determined via the following formulae:Â Optimal subjective spherical component (S) plus half of [the subjective cylindrical component (C)]

Algebraically, the formula is:

- 
**SE = S + C/2**

Example: A complete refraction shows right eye (RE): +2.50 DS - 0.50 DC x 90, and left eye (LE): +1.50 DS +1.00 DC x 90.

The spherical equivalent is calculated as SE(RE)=+2.50 + (-0.50/2)=+2.25 DS; and SE(LE)=+1.50 + (+1.00/2)=+2.00 DS
