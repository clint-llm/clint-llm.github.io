# Definition/Introduction

Obesity is defined as an increase in body weight when compared to height. To classify obesity, the standard practice is to use a Body Mass Index scale which puts weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. An individual is considered obese at BMI level of 30 except in Asian where a BMI of 27 or higher is considered obese.

Obesity is more prevalent now more than ever, and many factors come into play such as foods with high sugar and fat content, increased fast-food restaurants, modes of transportation, increased sedentary work lifestyles, and urbanization. Due to the changing environment, it is important now more than ever to implement weight prevention strategies. These strategies can vary from policy changes, increased health services, and efforts from the local community. Ultimately, these changes should target the causes of obesity which are unhealthy eating habits and lack of physical activity.

# Issues of Concern

Obesity is an issue of concern because it is a significant cause of co-morbidities, which include diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.

# Clinical Significance

As obesity levels rise in both children and adults, the healthcare team must educate the population on weight gain prevention. Possible clinical interventions are in areas of diet, physical activity, surgery, and pharmacotherapy. Even just a modest reduction in weight can improve many obesity-related conditions leading to better healthcare outcomes, improved quality of life, and reduced socioeconomic costs.

First-line management in obesity is through diet and exercise. In terms of diet, various options can be recommended, such as a low carbohydrate diet, low-fat diet, Mediterranean diet, and the Paleo diet. No one single diet is considered superior to the other in terms of weight loss, as long term adherence to a healthy eating plan is the most crucial factor for successful weight management.

For diet and physical exercise to be maintained, an individual must make permanent lifestyle changes. The healthcare professional needs to assist the patient in areas such as self-monitoring, physical activity, problem-solving, stress management, relapse prevention, and social support.

When physical exercise and diet are not successful, pharmacotherapy can be involved with multiple drugs on the market proven to be effective. These drugs are potentially useful when patients attempt lifestyle interventions for six months with no results, BMI is greater than 30, or if BMI is greater than 27 with an obesity-related condition. The FDA approved medications for weight management include orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, bupropion/naltrexone, liraglutide, and phentermine.

Lastly, surgery can be a consideration if an individual is extremely obese with no success in diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Surgery can restrict energy intake by reduction of the gastric pouch and also reducing the absorption of the stomach. Various procedures can be done, such as a roux-en-y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and implantation of certain devices. The type of procedure performed is all dependent on a various amount of factors such as surgical risk and patient desires. Less invasive procedures tend to have fewer surgical complications, but less weight loss and more invasive procedures tend to have more surgical complications but increased weight loss.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

On a large scale, strategies to counter obesity are abundant with multiple programs and policies in place, tackling the first intervention in obesity management, diet, and exercise. These programs aim to improve access to healthier food and provide a more friendly environment that encourages physical activity. Some examples of these programs include Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing Incentives, Kids in Parks, and Baltimore Healthy Stores.

On the primary care level, the treatment of obesity tends to be poor. In a prospective cohort study, researchers found that many obese patients are not receiving appropriate counsel during primary care visits. Possible reasons for the lack of counseling include time constraints, compensation, and low self-efficacy. When patients did receive counseling, it correlated with a moderate reduction in weight.

The US Preventative Serves Tasks Force recommends for Primary care providers to use the 5 As approach which includes: Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, and Arrange. This method helps the physician identify any medical issues, delivers thorough counseling, and provides the patient with resources to make healthy lifestyle changes. This approach also helps build a multidisciplinary team for the patient, which is more likely to produce clinically significant weight loss than if the physician treated the patient alone.
