During the concomitant formation of the first anlage of the pelvic organs, two muscle groups arise the pubis-caudal group and the cloacal group, or Gegenbauer's muscle.

From the pubic-caudal group will derive the coccygeal muscle and the levator anis muscle with their fibrous differentiations, the pubic-sacral or pubic-urethra-bladder-recto-sacral ligaments in man (the pubic-urethra-bladder-uterus-recto-sacral in the woman), the sacrospinous and sacrotuberous ligaments.

From the cloacal group, after the descent of the genitourinary septum that will separate the rectum, posteriorly, from the bladder and the urethra (urethra and vagina in the woman) anteriorly, will derive the sphincteric muscles (of the anus and of the urethra) and the bulbocavernosus, ischiocavernosus and the superficial and profound transverse muscles. There are close relationships and sometimes a fusion of various anatomical components. These include the levator anis muscle of the rectum and the urethra, the puborectalis muscle with the sphincter of the urethra that surrounds the prostate, the external anal sphincter, and with the deep transverse muscle of the perineum. These relationships have become functionally fundamental given the new upright posture and the bipedal gait acquired in humans.

During the very early fetal period, the mesenchymal tissue separating the orifices of the anus and vagina and the muscular cells surrounding them are clearly recognizable in specimens.
