A diagnosis of AD with MCI or mild dementia should be confirmed before considering Aducanumab.Â A thorough history and physical and neurological examination of the patient should be conducted with a timeline of the onset of cognitive decline.

Routine monitoring for ARIA by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended before initiating and during aducanumab therapy. Brain MRI should be taken within a 12-month period before starting aducanumab. Another MRI should be considered before the seventh infusion and the twelfth infusion of 10 mg/kg of aducanumab. Dosing adjustments in renal and hepatic dysfunction are not advised as aducanumab is not expected to be metabolized in the liver or renally cleared. Immunogenicity of aducanumab was observed during clinical studies. Anti-aducanumab antibodies developed in 0.6% of subjects receiving aducanumab.

To date, no sufficient data on aducanumab use during pregnancy and lactation in humans has been reported in the scientific literature or manufacturer's label. Aducanumab was tested during animal reproductive studies, and no adverse effects were detected.
