With the advent of US-guidance, there has been a surge in popularity for the TAP block, now beingly highly used for postoperative analgesia management following abdominal surgery. The TAP block is used as part of the multimodal analgesia management for abdominal surgeries that include the use of at least two non-opioid analgesic agents (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, gabapentinoids, IV lidocaine, ketamine or local anesthetic wound infiltration) in addition to oral or parental opioids.

The benefits of the TAP block includes a reduction in opioid requirements in the postoperative period and a decrease in postoperative nausea and vomiting, but no difference in visual analog pain scale scores.
