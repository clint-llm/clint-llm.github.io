Most periodic limb disorders are associated with a multitude of conditions affecting sleep. The etiology of primary cases of periodic limb movement disorder is unclear. Conditions associated with PLMS include restless leg syndrome in 80 to 90% of cases (seen during sleep study), obstructive sleep apnea, narcolepsy, REM behavioral disorder, uremia, spinal cord tumor, and ADHD.

The diagnosis of primary PLMD can only be made in patients with subjective sleep complaints with evidence of PLMS in the absence of other sleep disorders. Demonstration of transient arousals and short awakening by sleep EEG usually accompanies diagnosing periodic limb movement disorders. These awakenings result in sleep disruption.

Risk factors for PLM can be related to the conditions mentioned above.

A family history of RLS may be a risk factor for PLMS and, as a result, PLMD.

Certain genes like MEIS1 and BTBD9 that have links with RLS may be causing an increased incidence of PLMS.

Similarly, iron deficiency and decreased ferritin may aggravate PLMS.

Medications like dopamine blockers, SSRIs, and TCAs could also increase the risk of PLMS.
