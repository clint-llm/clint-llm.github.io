Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are among the most commonly used cardiovascular drugs in the adult population. Like most other medications, when calcium channel blockers are taken beyond the appropriate recommended dosage, they can have untoward toxicities with a wide range of complications that can even be fatal. This activity discusses their use to treat a wide array of clinical conditions including hypertension, supraventricular tachycardia, vasospasm, and migraine headaches.

**Objectives:**
- Review the epidemiology of calcium channel blocker toxicity.
- Outline the anticipated presentation of a patient with calcium channel blocker toxicity.
- Summarize the common complications of treatment of calcium channel blocker toxicity.
- Identify some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication amongst interprofessional team members to improve the outcome of patients with calcium channel blocker toxicity.
