The number one predisposing factor for a cardiac abscess is current or prior infective endocarditis. The most common sites involved are the aortic valve, followed by the ventricular septa, mitral valves, and papillary muscles. S. aureus, the most commonly involved causative agent, is present in up to one-third of all cases and has an even higher incidence in patients with prosthetic valves.

Secondly, bacteremia becomes of significant importance although abscesses due to bacteremia alone tend not to be large enough to cause death and have been reported as an incidental postmortem finding in most papers.

The site of prior MI has also been documented as a predisposing risk factor for the development of a cardiac abscess in patients in whom bacteremia is of concern. Such a scenario is plausible in a patient with a known prior infection undergoing an acute coronary syndrome or acquiring the infection soon following an MI. It is also suspected that the presence of necrosis of muscle fibers post-MI, in addition to inflammatory state and decreased perfusion with lack of blood flow, increases myocardium susceptibility to this complication.
