Cocaine toxicity is associated with high mortality. Also, injection of cocaine can be associated with pneumothorax, thrombosis, endocarditis, pseudoaneurysm of the central vessels, and arteriovenous fistulas. Other sequelae include cellulitis, HIV infection, thrombophlebitis, abscess, tetanus, and necrosis. For those who develop neuropsychiatric symptoms, the recovery is often prolonged and may not be complete.
