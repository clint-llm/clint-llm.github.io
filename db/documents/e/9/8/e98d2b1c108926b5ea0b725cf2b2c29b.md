The development of the eye is a complex multifactorial symphony of signaling molecules, receptors, and molecular gradients organized in a melody of the time and space during embryogenesis. Understanding this process within the eye allows us to have a better understanding of the basis of congenital eye diseases. The optic cup is particularly important to the proper formation of the eye, as it forms all major structures of the globe, except for the lens. Congenital glaucoma, retinal detachment, and coloboma are phenomena related to defects in the optic cup or its associated structures, and all of these can have serious consequences for the sight of the patient.
