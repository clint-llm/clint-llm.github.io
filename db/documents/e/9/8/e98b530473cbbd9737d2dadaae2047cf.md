Neointimal hyperplasia may be associated with recurrence of symptoms such as.

- Anginal symptoms or acute coronary syndrome for coronary artery venous graft or stenting with critical flow-limiting graft stenosis.

- AV graft or fistula failure leading to vascular access complication and delayed hemodialysis in ESRD patients on hemodialysis.

- Post carotid endarterectomy (CEA) restenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia can present with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke symptoms.
