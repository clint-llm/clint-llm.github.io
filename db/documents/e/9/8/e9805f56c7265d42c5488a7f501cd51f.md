As conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a manifestation of a disease, rather than a disease itself, complications of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia vary based on underlying etiology. Nonetheless, complications arising solely from the elevated bilirubin level also exist. As conjugated bilirubin does not significantly bind to nervous tissues, it never causes kernicterus or other associated toxicities. On the other hand, cholestasis can lead to fat malabsorption; thus, levels of fat-soluble vitamins should be monitored and corrected. Greenish pigmentation of teeth due to prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinemia may occur in low birth weight infants as a delayed complication.

Infections in hepatobiliary systems can lead to sepsis or septic shock, peritonitis, and gall bladder perforation, among other complications. Infections, pain, cachexia, thrombosis, intractable vomiting, and death may occur secondary to malignancy.
