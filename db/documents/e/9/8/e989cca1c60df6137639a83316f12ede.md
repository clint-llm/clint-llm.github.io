As with DM, most patients with NODAT are asymptomatic. The detection of many patients will be due to inpatient glucose monitoring and hyperglycemia on laboratory tests after transplant surgery. Hence, glucose testing is in the recommendations for post-transplant screening in all transplant patients; this can result in early detection of NODAT. Symptoms are the same as in non-transplant DM patients and include polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, weight loss, blurry vision, neuropathy, numbness of extremities, and symptoms of infection.  The physical exam includes vital signs, the extent of hydration, funduscopic eye exam, vascular and neurologic examinations, and a foot assessment. The physical examination findings might be unrevealing, although observable end-organ damage may occur.
