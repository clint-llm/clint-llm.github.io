Wallenberg syndrome is commonly caused by atherothrombotic occlusion of the vertebral artery, followed by occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and, least often, the medullary arteries.Â The PICA is of great clinical importance with its unique anatomical complexity and is involved in many diseases, including ischemic stroke, aneurysm, neurovascular compression syndrome (NVCS), arteriovenous malformation (AVM), brain tumor, etc. Besides, the PICA is exposed in many surgical approaches and is vulnerable to damage.

Hypertension is the most prevalent risk factor, followed by smoking and diabetes.
