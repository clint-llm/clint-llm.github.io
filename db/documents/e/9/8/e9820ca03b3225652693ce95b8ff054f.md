Duodenal atresia is a relatively common intestinal disorder that often presents soon after delivery; hence it is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a pediatric surgeon, obstetrician, neonatal nurse, dietitian, pediatrician, intensivist, and geneticist. The definitive management of this condition is surgery, but the procedure is often associated with complications that prolong hospital stay. Over the past three decades, the mortality rates of duodenal atresia have significantly dropped, averaging 2% to 5%. Mortality rates are not directly related to the surgery but to the other associated organ anomalies like complex congenital cardiac defects. However, survival continues to improve with better NICU care, nutritional support, and improved pediatric anesthesia. Today long-term survival of most infants (more than 80%) with duodenal atresia is the norm. The biggest controversy for the future is the use of endoscopy to excise the duodenal web. This technique remains experimental. The other controversy surrounds the time to feed the patient after surgery. Experts recommend a fluoroscopic evaluation to check for a leak before initiating feeding.
