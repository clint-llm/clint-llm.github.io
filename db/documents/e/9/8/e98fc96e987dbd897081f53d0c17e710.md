Complications of spasticity can vary. In a severe state, spasticity can interfere with daily function. It can cause extreme discomfort or pain for the patient and interfere with hygiene and the caregiver’s ability to provide care. This, in turn, can increase the risk of developing pressure ulcers, which can lead to infection and sepsis. It also can lead to bone fractures, subluxation, dislocation, and increased the risk of heterotopic ossification.
