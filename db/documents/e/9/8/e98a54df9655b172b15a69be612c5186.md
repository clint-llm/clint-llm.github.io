The toxin is an alkaloid found in the seeds of the Strychnos nux-vomica plant (See Figure 1), which is native to India, Northern Australia, and the East Indies. In Cambodia and Thailand, it is called “slang nut” or “slang Thai nut.” It is used in several Southeast Asian herbal remedies. In the United States, strychnine has been used in poisons, rodenticides, and performance-enhancing drugs. Low doses of strychnine are thought to have performance-enhancing qualities. The 1904 Olympic marathon winner ingested strychnine mid-race, and the 2016 Olympic weightlifting bronze medalist tested positive for strychnine.

Its use in the United States has been curtailed dramatically in the last century because of cases of poisoning and fatalities from ingestion of products containing strychnine. In the 1930s, it was one of the most common lethal poisonous ingestions of children. As late as the 1980s, strychnine could still be found in over the counter consumer products such as digestive aids, sedatives, stimulants, and cold remedies, although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered its removal from food and medicines in 1962. In 1989, it was outlawed as an indoor pesticide in the United States, but it is still found in outdoor poisons today.
