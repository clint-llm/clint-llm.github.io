Prior to the advent of chemotherapy, the 5-year overall survival rate was between 10% to 20% only

The presence of metastatic disease at presentation has the worst impact on prognosis, with overall survival ranging between 20 to 30%.

Male sex, non-caucasian race, elevatedÂ ALP, and LDH levels have also been associated with a poor prognosis.

The histological subtype of the tumor, which may also prove to be crucial in determining the response to treatment may also be a determinant of prognosis.

Craniofacial osteosarcomas are usually low-grade tumors and have been considered to have a favorable prognosis when compared to extremity osteosarcomas.

Naples prognostic score that includes four parameters namely serum albumin level, serum cholesterol, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and monocyte to lymphocyte ratio, has also been proposed for preoperative prognostication and has been shown to correlate with Enneking stage, presence of pathological fracture, local recurrence, and presence of metastasis.
