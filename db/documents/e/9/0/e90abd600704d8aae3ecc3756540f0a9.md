The derived alveolar gas equation is based on the assumption of a steady state condition. The equation will only be valid if the assumptions upon which it was constructed remain true. Low FiO2 conditions could violate the steady state. Thus, some physicians and scientists suggest using the detailed form of the equation. In clinical practice, the full alveolar gas equation does not convey relevant increased accuracy and the abbreviated equation discussed above is sufficient in calculating the PO2 in alveoli.
