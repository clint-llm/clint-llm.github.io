Patients with thalassemia minor/trait are usually asymptomatic or present with mild anemia. The presentation of thalassemia intermedia varies clinically and is manifested by pallor, failure to thrive (FTT), lethargy, and fatigue, but they are not transfusion dependent.

Usually, patients with beta TM (Cooley anemia) start having symptoms after 6 months of age due to the transition of HbF to HbA. Unlike thalassemia minor, clinical features of beta TM are of a severe type and include pallor, shortness of breath, irritability, FTT, and hepatosplenomegaly (HSM) due to extramedullary hematopoiesis. Other features include recurrent fever, feeding problems, and abdominal distention. Patients who are either untreated or received poor transfusion (especially in developing countries where there is no availability of well-developed transfusion programs) develop a wide range of symptoms such as retarded growth, brown discoloration of the skin, jaundice, leg ulcers, knock knee (genu valgum), and skeletal deformities such as long bone abnormalities, craniofacial deformities like frontal bossing, prominent cheekbones, depressed nasal bridge, and maxillary hypertrophy resulting from bone marrow expansion giving the chipmunk appearance. In addition to that, gallstone formation usually occurs due to chronic hemolysis.
