Primary hepatic lymphoma (PHL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that primarily involves the liver. This is in contrast to predominant lymph nodal or splenic involvement associated with other subtypes of NHL. The majority of the patients with PHL report vague symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, or discomfort. Approximately one-third report constitutional symptoms, including fever, myalgia, and weight loss. However, due to the low incidence and characteristically vague symptoms of PHL, patients often undergo extensive investigations before the diagnosis is made. This activity describes the evaluation and management of primary hepatic lymphoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the definition of primary hepatic lymphoma.
- Outline the diagnostic evaluation of primary hepatic lymphoma.
- Summarize the role of combination chemotherapy in improving survival for patients with primary hepatic lymphoma.
- Review the role of interprofessional team collaboration and effective communication in arriving at a prompt diagnosis and institution of the early treatment result for better survival outcomes.
