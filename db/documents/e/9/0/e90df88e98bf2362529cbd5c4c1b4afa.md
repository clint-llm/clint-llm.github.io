Endometrial cancer is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes dietitians, oncology and gynecology nurses, pharmacists and bariatric surgeons. Once the diagnosis is made, the ideal treatment is complete excision. For patients with localized lesions, the outcomes are good but for large and invasive lesions, the prognosis is guarded.

The key is to prevent this cancer; thus patients should be encouraged to change lifestyle, reduce weight and eat a healthy diet.
