The clinician should suspect Heyde syndrome in an elderly patient who displays any combination of aortic valve stenosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, or evidence suggestive of AVWS. Evaluation and workup should first focus on ruling out the presence of life-threatening conditions before moving on to confirmatory studies.

Initial laboratory evaluation should at a minimum include the following:

- Complete blood count (CBC)

- Coagulation panel

- Metabolic panel

- Fecal occult blood testing

An electrocardiogram and echocardiogram should also merit consideration to assess the rhythm and structure of the heart if a recent study is not available for review. Imaging studies should follow at the healthcare professional's discretion in accordance with clinical exam findings and clinician gestalt. Examples include endoscopic referral or CT angiography for gastrointestinal bleeding and chest X-ray or CT studies of the thoracic cavity when suspicious cardiorespiratory findings are present.

**Assessment of VWF**

Studies to assess the function or fractional percentage of VWF multimers should be considered when AS and gastrointestinal bleeding are confirmed, especially in cases of gastrointestinal angiodysplasia refractory to endoscopic intervention. A few available laboratory studies are as follows:

- **Platelet Function Assay (PFA)**– PFA analyzes the ability of platelets to generate primary hemostasis.

- **VWF Multimer Assay**– the VWF multimer assay uses gel electrophoresis to sort different sized VWF multimers based on size. Quantitative analysis is then the means to determine the level of high molecular weight multimers (HMWM), which are necessary for normal hemostasis.

Compared to a VWF multimer assay, the time it takes for a result is much faster (hours to complete a PFA versus 7 to 10 days to complete the multimer analysis). For this reason, PFA is often the preferred laboratory modality to screen for AVWD and is a useful screening modality in the initial workup of Heyde syndrome.
