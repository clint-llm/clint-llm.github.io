At the crux of this disease process is primary hepatolithiasis - the formation of multiple intraductal calculi in the absence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction. These are primarily brown pigmented stones formed from calcium bilirubin, a product of increased rates of bilirubin deconjugation.

Chronic infection with common helminths such as Clonorchis sinensis and Ascaris lumbricoides are thought to induce biliary epithelial inflammation, reduce host immune response and subsequently increase susceptibility to ascending infection from translocating gut pathogens such as E.coli, Proteus, and Klebsiella.
