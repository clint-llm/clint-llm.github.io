The diagnosis of FA is heavily reliant on history and physical examination. The studies conducted serve to rule out alternative diagnoses and to evaluate for life-threatening complications of the disease. Evaluation to rule out other causes includes:

- Glucose level

- Vitamin E level

- Electromyogram

- Nerve conduction studies - notable for absent or reduced amplitude sensory nerve action potentials

Once a diagnosis of FA is suspected, the following tests should be performed:

**Genetic Testing**

Genetic testing is the cornerstone of the evaluation of patients with FA. A trinucleotide repeat expansion assay is available, and FA is theÂ only disease with pathological GAA repeats.

**Imaging**

Magnetic resonance imaging****(MRI) is the preferred modality for evaluation of the extent of atrophic changes. Patients suspected of having FA should have an MRI of the brain and spinal cord, which will show atrophy of the cervical/thoracic spinal cord and cerebellum.

Evaluation of common manifestations includes the following studies:

- An electrocardiogram can show tachycardia or atrial fibrillation.

- An echocardiogram typically shows symmetric concentric ventricular hypertrophy.

- Auditory testing shows absent waves III and IV, while wave I is preserved.

- Vision testing shows abnormal visual evoked potentials with absent or delayed latency and reduced amplitude of the p100 wave.
