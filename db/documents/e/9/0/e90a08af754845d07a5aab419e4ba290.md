Nurse monitoring is two-fold. First, one should monitor for patients who may be motivated to pursue natural family planning or who may be good candidates for natural family planning and facilitate the education of those patients. Patients may confide in the nurse any current or prior discontent with a contraceptive method. The nurse may be the one who elicits that patientâ€™s history of relevant religious background.

Secondly, nurses, especially in the outpatient setting, should monitor for signs that patients may not be candidates for natural family planning. Taking a good menstrual history may identify patients with irregular periods or abnormal uterine bleeding. Monitoring for patients who are unable to give an accurate description of the length or frequency of their periods is crucial, as these patients may be poor candidates for natural family planning. Because these methods require motivation on the part of both members of a couple, it is essential to monitor not only the patient but her partner if possible. The patient may herself be highly interested, but the partner may show signs of hesitance or concern.
