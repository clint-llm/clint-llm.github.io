End-stage renal disease can present with a constellation of signs and symptoms. Some include volume overload refractory to diuretics, hypertension poorly responsive to medication, anemia, mineral and bone disorders, and metabolic derangements including hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, metabolic acidosis, hypo/hypercalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia.

Other manifestations of uremia in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are:

- Pericarditis

- Encephalopathy

- Peripheral neuropathy

- Restless leg syndrome

- Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea

- Dry skin, pruritus, ecchymosis

- Malnutrition

- Erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, amenorrhea

- Platelet dysfunction

Uremic toxicity is an indication of urgent dialysis.
