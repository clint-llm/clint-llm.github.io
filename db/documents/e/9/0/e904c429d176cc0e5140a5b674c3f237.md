Vismodegib is available as a 150-mg oral-use capsule. It is dosed at 150-mg orally once daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

However, adverse effects associated with vismodegib may serve as a barrier to lifelong treatment. Recently in an article published in Lancet Oncology, intermittent dosing protocols were examined over 73 weeks, comparing two groups with different dosing, Group A and Group B.  Group A received 12 weeks of vismodegib followed by eight weeks of placebo, which was repeated until the 73-week mark. Group B was given vismodegib initially for 24 weeks, followed by eight weeks of placebo, and then alternating eight weeks of vismodegib with eight weeks of placebo until the 73-week mark.

Both groups A and B showed a reduction in the mean number of basal cell carcinoma lesions from baseline (62.7% and 54%, respectively). However, the number of treatment-emergent events was higher in group B. Treatment activity and adherence were also lower within group B when compared to group A. It is likely that researchers will examine different dosing protocols going forward to balance adverse effects with treatment effectiveness.
