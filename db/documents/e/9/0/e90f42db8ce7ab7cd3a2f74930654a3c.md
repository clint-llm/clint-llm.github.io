The evaluation of cutaneous malakoplakia is guided by the patient's history and physical examination. A skin biopsy of a suspicious lesion is essential to not only diagnose cutaneous malakoplakia but also exclude other neoplastic, inflammatory, or infectious processes. Histologic findings for cutaneous malakoplakia are characterized by Michaelis-Gutmann bodies and von Hansemann cells. Cultures of the lesion(s) may help further guide antibiotic treatment.
