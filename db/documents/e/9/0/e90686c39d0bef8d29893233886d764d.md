The cardiovascular system determines the MAP through cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Cardiac output is regulated on the level of intravascular volume, preload, afterload, myocardial contractility, heart rate, and conduction velocity. Systemic vascular resistance regulation is via vasoconstriction and dilation.

The renal system affects MAP via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system; this is a cascade that ends in the release of aldosterone, which increases sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubules of the kidneys and ultimately increases plasma volume.

The autonomic nervous system plays a role in regulating MAP via baroreceptors located in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. The autonomic nervous system can affect both cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance to maintain MAP in the ideal range.

The functions of the above organ systems in regulating MAP are discussed further under the Mechanism heading of this article.
