Several contraindications exist for the use of nitrate.

- Allergy to nitrates

- Concomitant use of phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors such as tadalafil and sildenafil

- Right ventricular infarction

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

PDE inhibitors and nitrates both cause vasodilation, and concomitant use may cause severe hypotension. Healthcare providers should make sure to inquire if the patients have erectile dysfunction and if they are taking medications for it.

Poor right ventricular contractility causes the patients to be pre-load sensitive, and nitrates may cause severe hypotension. Decreased left ventricular volume from decreased preload will worsen the outflow tract obstruction.

The following are conditions that require care with nitrate administration:

- Patients on chronic diuretic therapy

- Patients with low systolic blood pressure

- Patients with autonomic nervous system dysregulation

- Pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Patients on diuretic therapy can be volume depleted and can develop hypotension.

Patients who have low systolic blood pressure can develop severe hypotension.

Elderly patients and patients with autonomic nervous system dysregulation have a higher risk of postural hypotension.

Nitrates have not been evaluated fully in pregnancy and breastfeeding, so they should be avoided.
