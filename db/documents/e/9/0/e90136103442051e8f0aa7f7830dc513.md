Trichosporon spp. are yeast-like anamorphic organisms that belong to the basidiomycetes yeasts. Trichosporon species are broadly spread in nature but mostly found in areas where warm and tropical temperatures prevail. These organisms are usually found in substrates like soil; water areas like rivers, lakes, and even seawater; decomposing wood; air; foods like cheese; scarab beetles, and feces from birds, pigeons, bats, and cattle. In humans, they are occasionally found as part of gastrointestinal and oral cavity microbiota and can transiently colonize the respiratory tract, skin, and vagina.

Beigel first described the genus Trichosporon in 1865 upon discovering that it can cause a benign hair shaft infection. The absence of simple methods to distinguish among the species in the clinical microbiology laboratory led to multiple members of the genus Trichosporon being categorized together under the name T. beigelii. However, modern molecular techniques led to the discovery of several strains that are part of other fungi groups and the strain categorization of Trichosporon spp. species.  Currently, more than 50 different subspecies and around 16 different strains cause human disease.

Although most Trichosporon spp. has been cultivated in laboratories, the fungus is now an agent of opportunistic infections, mostly seen in immunocompromised patients.
