Mammalian single membrane-spanning guanylyl cyclases exist in at least seven varieties, including GC-A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. Guanylyl cyclases catalyze the conversion of GTP to cGMP and pyrophosphate. Nitric oxide, bicarbonate, and natriuretic peptides such as ANP and BNP, activate the guanylyl cyclase enzymes, which then form the cyclic GMP. Other activators of guanylyl cyclase enzymes include uroguanylin, guanylin, and guanylyl cyclase activating proteins. The cyclic GMP then serves as an intracellular second messenger that controls blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, sexual arousal, gut peristalsis, platelet aggregation, neurotransmission, long bone growth, lipolysis, intestinal fluid secretion, phototransduction, and oocyte maturation.
