Primary hyperaldosteronism is caused by aldosterone-producing adenomas, bilateral idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia, aldosterone-producing adrenal carcinoma, and familial aldosteronism. The increased amount of aldosterone potentiates renal sodium reabsorption and water retention, and potassium excretion. The increased sodium reabsorption by the kidneys results in plasma volume expansion which is the primary initiating mechanism for hypertension. This may induce tissue inflammation and heightened sympathetic drive, with subsequent development of fibrosis in vital organs, such as heart, kidneys, and vasculature. As a result, this may lead to the development of chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation, stroke, ischemic heart disease, and congestive heart failure.

Besides the elevation in sodium, patients often develop hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis. Nearly 1/5th of patients with Conn syndrome have impairment in glucose tolerance which is due to the inhibitory effects of hypokalemia on insulin secretion
