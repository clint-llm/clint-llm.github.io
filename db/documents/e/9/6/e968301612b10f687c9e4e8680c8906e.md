There are a variety of specific indications for a duodenal biopsy, but broadly the two main reasons are diagnosis and surveillance. Furthermore, it subdivides based on the technique of tissue collection, whether it is directed or random. Whether the biopsy is diagnostic or for surveillance purposes depends on the clinical scenario.

Biopsies are performed in a directed manner for suspected or obvious pathology such as a mass, polyp, nodule, ulcer, or abnormal mucosa. Biopsies are performed randomly in subjects with malabsorption, acute diarrhea in an immunocompromised patient, chronic diarrhea, suspected drug toxicity (e.g., aspirin), and systemic disease, such as lymphoma. The ampulla is an area in the descending duodenum that houses the distal common bile duct and pancreatic duct in which adenomas are very common; this is a particular concern in the condition, familial adenomatosis polyposis (FAP) syndrome, where duodenal surveillance is mandatory to assessÂ for the development of adenomas. Duodenal lactase activity can be determined in children with chronic diarrhea.
