**Management of Tibial Fractures**

Tibial plateau fracture: These fractures present with knee pain and effusion. They classically occur after a car hits a pedestrian's fixed knee, which is known as a "bumper fracture." They are classified using the Schatzker classification and managed by using nonsurgical or surgical methods to achieve stable alignment. Operative strategies include external fixation and open reduction internal fixation.

- Schatzker Classification

- Type 1: lateral split fracture
- Type 2: lateral split-depressed fracture
- Type 3: lateral pure depression fracture
- Type 4: medial fracture
- Type 5: bicondylar fracture 
- Type 6: metaphyseal-diaphyseal disassociation

Tibial shaft fracture: Compared to most long bone fractures, tibial shaft fractures are more likely to be open because the medial surface is adjacent to the subcutaneous tissue. The fracture can have a low or high energy pattern. The low energy patterns are a result of torsional injury resulting in a spiral fracture. The high energy pattern is from a direct force that causes a wedge or oblique fracture. Nonoperative treatment is chosen for low-energy fractures that are minimally displaced while operative treatment is indicated for high-energy fractures including external fixation, intramedullary nailing, and percutaneous locking plate. These fractures can lead to extensive soft tissue injury, compartment syndrome, malunion, and bone loss.

Ankle fractures involving the distal tibia: These injuries generally present with ankle pain and swelling and an inability to bear weight. They are usually the result of severe inversion or eversion of the ankle joint. The Lauge-Hansen and Danis-Weber classifications are commonly used to determine the type of fracture. There are also several specific distal tibial fractures that have their own name. The Pilon fracture involves the distal tibia and its articular surface with the ankle joint, and the Tillaux fracture involves the anterolateral distal tibial epiphysis. Distal tibial fractures are most commonly treated with open reduction and internal fixation.
