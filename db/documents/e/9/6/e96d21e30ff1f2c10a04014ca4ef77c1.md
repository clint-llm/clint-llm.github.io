OTFC toxicity manifests as miosis, somnolence progressing to coma, airway obstruction, and respiratory depression. In overdose situations, the priority is to remove OTFC from the oral cavity, establish a patent and protected airway and administer oxygen. Intubation and mechanical ventilation of the patient are considerations if needed. For clinically significant respiratory depression secondary to OTFC overdose, an opioid antagonist, naloxone, is administered. If the respiratory recovery is suboptimal, additional naloxone is administered, and the patient is monitored until initiating patient-initiated respiration, and appropriate oxygen saturation levels return. Naloxone is FDA approved for the treatment of suspected or known opioid overdose resulting in respiratory depression. Naloxone administration can be intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intranasal.
