Lid wiper epitheliopathy is a relatively new clinical entity, and epidemiological data on the condition is limited. While the prevalence of LWE is not well established in the literature, it is estimated to affect up to 88% of patients with dry eye disease.

No significant differences in prevalence rates based on sex have been reported for lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE). However, studies have revealed that individuals of Asian descent have a nearly twofold higher prevalence rate of LWE compared to non-Asians. Furthermore, contact lens wearers are more likely to experience LWE compared to those who do not wear contact lenses. These findings highlight the importance of considering ethnicity and contact lens use as potential risk factors for the development of LWE.

Currently, there is limited available data to establish definitive prevalence rates for lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE) across different age ranges. Further research is needed to gather more comprehensive and reliable data to accurately classify prevalence rates in various age groups. The absence of sufficient data emphasizes the importance of ongoing research and studies to gain a better understanding of the age-related patterns and prevalence of LWE.
