Alpha thalassemia traits are thought to be protective against malaria, and in populations with high incidences of malaria, the trait can be found in up to 90% of the population. Hemoglobin H is similar and found mostly in warm climates. The populations with the highest incidences are found in Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. Hemoglobin Constant Spring is the most common form of non-deletion alpha thalassemia. One percent to 2% of individuals living in northeastern Thailand, 5% to 8% of individuals in southern China, and one-quarter of women in an ethnic minority population in Vietnam are found to have Hemoglobin Constant Spring.
