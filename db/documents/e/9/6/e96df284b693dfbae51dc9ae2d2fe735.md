Pertinent anatomy for the reconstruction is similar to that of the oncologic breast surgery resection. The position of the inferior mammary fold (IMF) is of critical importance to the reconstructive surgeon as it is a reliable landmark for how far to extend the envelope into which the expander will be placed. This helps to define not only the vertical height and relative position of the reconstructed breast(s) but also the cleavage definition. Over dissection medially in the sternum area can cause symmastia, while improper placement in the vertical axis (or over-dissection inferiorly) will lead to vertical breast dystopia.
