History is a valuable tool in evaluating a patient for TLE. Worsening of the eruption with sun exposure supports a diagnosis of TLE, although this finding is not specific to TLE. A full-body skin exam should be performed when a diagnosis of TLE is suspected. TLE favors the face, neck, chest, and back, so special attention should be given to these body regions. Lesions present as edematous, usually annular, plaques with hues ranging from erythematous to violaceous. See images 3, 5, and 6. Epidermal change virtually excludes a diagnosis of TLE (TLE lesions lack atrophy, ulceration, follicular plugging, scarring, or dyspigmentation, and the presence of these features favors a diagnosis of DLE). Although uncommon, TLE may present with a Blaschkoid distribution, periorbital edema, or scalp involvement that appears similar to alopecia areata.

Lesions of TLE persist for days or weeks and chronically recur. Lesions do have the potential to regress spontaneously; however, patients may report recurrence during the summer months.
