High myopic eyes are plagued with a plethora of complications, and such patients are urged to have regular check-ups with a retina specialist. Any new visual complaints such as diminution of vision, floaters, flashes of light, metamorphosis, or scotoma should be immediately reported to a qualified retina specialist. Annual/biannual retina screening for myopic patients is mandatory to look for the development of a new lattice degeneration or a break in the retina.
