Lymph derives from interstitial space fluid. The lymphatic channels carry it to lymph nodes along with all kinds of exogenous and endogenous antigens and antigen-presenting cells. Antigen-presenting cells include dendritic cells, macrophages, and B lymphocytes. The antigen is processed and linked to major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) to stably export them to the cell surface for presentation to CD 4+ helper and CD 8+ killer T lymphocytes. CD 4+ helper T cells bind to and activate B cells that turn into mature plasma cells that secrete antibodies that fight infection.
