The nipple development in utero is seen around the third trimester wherein a mammary pit develops at the epidermis of the mammary bud. During the 9th month, this pit undergoes canalization, and the underlying mesoderm proliferates to raise it above the level of the areola leading to the formation of a nipple. Faulty developmental patterns in the mesoderm fail to raise the nipple above the areolar plane and can result in an inverted nipple.
