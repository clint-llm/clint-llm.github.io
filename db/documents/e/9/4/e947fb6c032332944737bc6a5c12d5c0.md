Clinically, patients may present unspecific neurologic symptoms; many patients remain asymptomatic throughout the clinical course. It is crucial to bear in mind that neurological sequelae do not necessarily occur after the diagnosis of endocarditis. Complete workup, neurological screening exams, and close follow-up are warranted. Antimicrobial treatment is the cornerstone of infectious endocarditis management, whereas targeting the underlying diseases is also essential to reduce morbidity and mortality in NBTE. Of note, in SLE patients, the disease activity does not correlate with NBTE and embolism. Management for endocarditis with ischemic stroke is debatable; however, thrombolysis is generally not recommended despite a few successful case series. Cardiac surgery is the indication in most of the endocarditis patients; nevertheless, the timing for patients with neurological sequelae as well as its role in embolism prevention remains controversial.
