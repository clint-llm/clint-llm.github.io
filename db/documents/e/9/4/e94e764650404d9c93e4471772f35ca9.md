Atopy affects a significant portion of the general population, usually estimated at 10 to 30% in developed countries. About 80% of atopic individuals have a family history of allergy compared with only 20% of the average population. In monozygotic twins, there is only 50% concordance. The susceptibility for atopic diseases is genetic, but rather than one or two causative dominant genes evidence suggests that there are many genes with moderate effects involved.

Allergic rhinitis occurs in 10% to 12% of the US population. The prevalence and morbidity rate is due to the geographic distribution of common allergens including dust mite and allergenic plants. Both sexes are equally affected.Â  The prevalence of bronchial asthma varies worldwide. It is a common disease that affects 5% of the population of Western countries. It causes in the US above 3000 deaths per year. Increasing mortality and morbidity rates occur despite substantial advances in immunotherapy.
