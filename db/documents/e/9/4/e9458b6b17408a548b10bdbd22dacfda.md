Calcineurin inhibitors are immunosuppressants used to manage autoimmune conditions including but not limited to lupus nephritis, idiopathic inflammatory myositis, interstitial lung disease, atopic dermatitis, and many more. In addition, they are used as mainstays for immunosuppression in solid organ transplants. This activity describes the indications, mechanism of action, contraindications to the use of calcineurin inhibitors. We will elaborate on the role of the drug as a valuable agent in all the conditions they are used for. This activity will also highlight the key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for health care team members in different specialties in their everyday practice.

**Objectives:**
- To elaborate on the mechanism of action of the four drugs that belong to the category of CNIs and appreciate the differences between them.
- To appreciate the utility of the drugs in our day-to-day practice.
- To have a thorough understanding of the toxicity profiles of the drugs so that patients can be counseled on the potential adverse effects.
- Establish very clear and concise monitoring guidelines and parameters while using CNI drugs.
