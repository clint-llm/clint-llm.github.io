Sweet syndrome, also called acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a rare disorder that typically presents with acute-onset tender plaques or nodules, fever, arthralgia, ophthalmologic manifestations, headaches, and rarely, oral or genital lesions. The diagnosis is made by identifying the typical features and the histology of the erythematous plaques. The goals of pharmacotherapy are to reduce morbidity and complications, and the best first-line option is systemic corticosteroids, or if lesions are limited, topical corticosteroids. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of Sweet syndrome and stresses the role of the interprofessional team approach on the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of Sweet syndrome.
- Describe the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with Sweet syndrome.
- Explain the treatment considerations for Sweet syndrome. 
- Identify modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by Sweet syndrome.
