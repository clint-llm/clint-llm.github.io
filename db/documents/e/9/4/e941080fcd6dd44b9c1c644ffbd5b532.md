In an ideal situation, EMS will have taken steps to decontaminate casualties before medical treatment center arrival. Expert consensus indicates that, when feasible, chemical decontamination should take place within one minute of exposure.

**Step One: Donning Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**

**Step Two: Remove Victim Clothing As Soon As Possible**

Clothing serves as a reservoir for chemical contaminants, especially liquid-based chemicals. Any attempt to decontaminate a clothed patient could result in the transfer of additional before onto the skin surface, or in the event of an injured patient, further introduction of chemicals into deep tissues. The initial step in the treatment process is to remove the patient’s clothing as soon as possible. Previous guidance indicated that the removal of clothing would reduce 80 to 90% of chemical contamination.

**Step Three: Remove/Inactive the Contaminant**

Once the patient has been disrobed, removed any solid or particulate material before initiating irrigation. Some dry chemicals can be exothermic and can cause additional harm to the patient when exposed to water. Remove these particles using a soft brush or cloth, or if available, a battery-powered hand-held vacuum. After removal of all clothing and particulate matter, then provide dry or aqueous decontamination. Dry decontamination products are generally only available in specific occupational, military, or HAZMAT unit locations.  They can be used before irrigation, although this will not be practical or available at most healthcare facilities. Dry decontamination can be performed using an absorptive material such as Fuller’s earth, activated charcoal, talcum powder, or absorptive materials such as paper towels or diapers to reduce dermal exposure before irrigation. The addition of a dry decontamination step may be more effective than aqueous irrigation alone. However, all used absorptive materials should be considered as hazardous waste, and a plan must, therefore, be in place to dispose of these expended materials.

Irrigation with water is essential to reduce contamination and toxicity, but some liquid soluble chemicals, especially organophosphates and similar insecticides, are not readily removed with water alone. The addition of detergent (mild soap) will result in enhanced removal of lipid-soluble chemicals, such as organophosphates, and will result in decreased toxicity and improved survival.

If open wounds are present, the areas should be thoroughly irrigated as well. Using a physiologic solution such as Lactated ringers or normal saline will help prevent pain and further tissue injury.

Many sources discuss the use of dilute bleach solutions to enhance decontamination. However, even a diluted 0.5% solution could potentially cause eye and wound irritation. The use of a one percent soap-water solution is nearly as effective as diluted sodium hypochlorite solutions for removing military-grade organophosphates.

If available and under the right circumstances, reactive skin decontamination lotion (RSDL) is an option as an adjunct to aqueous decontamination. RSDL consists of multiple components, including Dekon 139 and 2,3-butanedione monoxime (DAM), which chelate and inactive several military-grade chemical agents. RSDL has been formulated to remove and neutralize several agents, including organophosphates, vesicants such as mustard gas, and can be used to decontaminate T-2, a weaponized fungal toxin. It comes packaged with a pre-treated sponge. One sponge is not sufficient to completely decontaminate an individual and is intended for use on the face, neck, hands, and the inner surface of a respirator. RSDL is more effective than diluted sodium hypochlorite and soapy water alone.

Other options for chemical decontamination exist but do not have current approval for use in the United States. Amphoteric chelating solutions are currently available for use in some countries and have demonstrated effectiveness for both chemical decontamination as well as attenuating tissue injury from hazardous agent exposure. One review of one amphoteric chelating irrigation fluid suggested improved outcomes from chemical burns to the skin and eyes.
