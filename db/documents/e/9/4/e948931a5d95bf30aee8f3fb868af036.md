In adult patients, amiodarone can be given for VT/VF cardiac arrest via intravenous (IV)/intraosseous (IO) infusion as a 300 mg rapid bolus followed by an additional bolus of 150 mg IV/IO if VT or VF persists. If the patient achieves ROSC, a continuous infusion is started at 1 mg/min for 6 hours, followed by 0.5 mg/min. To treat all acute tachyarrhythmias in adults, amiodarone can be given IV 150 mg over 10 minutes, followed by a 1 mg/min infusion for 6 hours, followed by an infusion at 0.5 mg/min. The recommended total dose over 24 hours should not exceed 2.4 grams. Recommended oral dosing is 400 to 600 mg daily in divided doses for 2 to 4 weeks, followed by maintenance dosing of 100 to 200 mg daily. No dosage adjustment is necessary for renal impairment.

Pediatric advanced life support dosing is 5 mg/kg (maximum 300 mg per dose) rapid bolus IV/IO for cardiac arrest. This dose may be repeated two times if VF or pulseless VT persists. For perfusing pediatric tachyarrhythmias, the patient receives a similar loading dose; however, the time of administration stretches to 20 to 60 minutes - this can be followed by a 5 mcg/kg/min infusion, which may be titrated up to a max dose of 15 mcg/kg/min for a max of no more than 20 mg/kg within 24 hours.
