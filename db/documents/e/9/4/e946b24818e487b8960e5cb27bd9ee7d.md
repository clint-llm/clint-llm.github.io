The treatment of cranial subdural empyema is multimodal, including both medical and surgical treatment. Infectious disease service and neurosurgery service are indispensable. The use of antibiotic therapy alone is rare; however, it can be used if the patient is essentially doing well, has no major neurological deficit, the collection is small, and an early response is documented.

A prompt and accurate diagnosis will result in a more favorable clinical outcome, and this directly depends on the level of suspicion the clinician has as a result of the patientâ€™s history, physical examination, laboratory workup, and imaging findings. Treatment options, including multiple burr holes or a craniotomy for drainage and debridement, have been previously described in the literature. A craniotomy usually offers better results and fewer recurrences.

Intravenous antibiotic therapy, coordinated by the infectious disease team for 3 to 6 weeks, is required. Longer periods of therapy are required for those patients with osteomyelitis. In infants, subdural empyema is often secondary to meningitis, and antibiotic therapy is required for 6 to 8 weeks.

Further monitoring and follow-up can be done with laboratory workup. Imaging can be done with a repeat head computed tomography scan or brain MRI. Antiepileptic drugs should be given in view of the high incidence of preoperative and postoperative seizures.
