Diagnosing and managing neuropathies using the Romberg test may include input from various interprofessional healthcare team members, including an infectious disease specialist, neurologist, internist, and nursing staff.

The Romberg sign is an easily administered, no-equipment, bedside physical exam maneuver used since its description in the 19th century to help diagnose tabes dorsalis and dorsal column and proprioceptive dysfunction. A positive test is an inability to maintain an erect posture over 60 seconds with eyes closed. Due to its high specificity, a positive Romberg sign is highly suggestive of diagnosing a deficit involving the dorsal column and medial lemniscus pathways.

The examiner does not need extensive training, but precautions regarding the patient's safety and fall risk must have priority in case balance is lost during the test. The examiner must maintain close proximity with the patient so that the safety of the patient is given utmost priority throughout the exam. Since the Romberg test is not something inherently subjective in each case, the quality of the test is somewhat standardized.

A few observed variabilities of the test include:

- Range of postural instability that connotes positivity of the test (sway, a step to the side, or a fall). Electric analysis during the Romberg test has shown normal subjects, on average, deviate 6–7% of their body weight in the lateral direction and twice as much in the anteroposterior direction. They also tend to lean more forward with their eyes closed.

- Significance of the sway at the ankles versus sway at the hips

- Placing the feet together or in tandem

- Conducting the test with bear foot or with footwear worn

- Holding the hands at the side versus extending  forward or laterally

- Need for gentle pulling or pushing of the patient to one side during the test.
