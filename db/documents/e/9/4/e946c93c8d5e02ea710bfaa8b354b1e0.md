Pragmatic management of mycoses is dependent on the interprofessional healthcare team characterizing the fungal infection as discussed in the introduction, then selecting the most effective antifungal treatment regimen; this requires a strong understanding of public health/epidemiology, medical microbiology/mycology, clinical pharmacology, and healthcare infrastructure which dictates the application of the first three. There is currently a diverse and effective arsenal of antifungal agents. Still, the alarming global rise in drug-resistant fungi warrants judicious antifungal prescribing by clinicians, combinatorial strategies, utilization of antifungal adjuvants, and continued antifungal drug discovery/development.

Judicious prescribing begins with the healthcare team selecting the proper regimen based on culture and sensitivity data, patient history, and socioeconomic factors. Providers should work closely with pharmacists, and when appropriate, public health officials to provide therapy that appropriately treats infections. Nurses can also assess patient adherence, help administer the drug in the inpatient setting, answer patient questions, and watch for adverse drug reactions. The ultimate goal is to provide antifungal therapy without unnecessarily creating drug-resistant organisms, limiting adverse events, and reducing drug-drug interactions. Antifungal stewardship is essential to preserve the effectiveness of current antifungal agents.

Combination therapy comprises treatment regimens that include multiple antifungals from different classes and antifungal agents combined with non-antifungal agents. Non-antifungal drug targets include heat shock proteins, calcineurin, lysine acetyltransferase, lysine deacetylase, protein kinase C, and fungal sphingolipids.

Antifungal adjuvants can enhance and or extend the efficacy of existing antifungal regimens and limit resistance. Some of these encouraging adjuvants could eventually be the standard of care in antifungal-adjuvant combination therapy. The potential adjuvants include drugs with widely variable mechanisms of action like cyclosporin A, deferasirox, FK506, tamoxifen, and sertraline.

Antifungal drug discovery has been bolstered by the Orphan Drug Act (1983) and, more recently, the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act (2012). These policies incentivize pharmaceutical companies and researchers to pursue new leads and add to the existing collection of antifungals. The increasing prevalence of drug-resistant fungal diseases presents a unique challenge to antifungal drug discovery. Yet, there are several promising new drug/class pipelines, theoretical fungal vaccines, and the opportunity to generate compounds to inhibit resistance.

The caveat to all of these potentially promising leads in new drugs and drug classes is the time it takes from discovery to dispensing a new medication, estimated to be roughly 12 years.
