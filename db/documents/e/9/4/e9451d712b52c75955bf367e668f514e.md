Most arthropod bites and stings result in uncomplicated localized cutaneous reactions, and resulting complications are rare. In a small number of cases, fatalities may occur in the first hour following a bite or sting secondary to the development of anaphylactic shock. The risk of fatal anaphylaxis decreases significantly with the prompt administration of epinephrine.

The greatest medical impact of arthropod bites is the transmission of infectious diseases. The prognosis for arthropod-borne infectious diseases depends on the pathophysiologic effects of the specific organism transmitted.

Prognosis following arthropod envenomation is highly favorable and symptomatic treatment, and supportive care is often all that is required. Fatalities rarely occur, but an increased risk exists for children, the elderly, and those with significant underlying cardiovascular disease.
