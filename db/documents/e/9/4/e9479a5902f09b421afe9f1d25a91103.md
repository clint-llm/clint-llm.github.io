Surgery has a major role in the treatment of breast cancer. It is the basic way to use for local control of the disease. Radical mastectomy of Halsted, which removed the breast with axillary lymph node dissection and excision of both pectoralis muscles, is no longer recommended due to the high rate of morbidity without a survival benefit. Now, the modified radical mastectomy of Patey is more famous. It entails removing the whole breast tissue with a large part of the skin and the axillary lymph nodes. The pectoralis major and minor muscles are preserved. Breast-only removal without axillary dissection is referred to as simple mastectomy. This procedure can be performed in small tumors with negative sentinel lymph nodes. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) is aimed at removing the tumor plus a rim of at least 1 cm of normal breast tissue (wide local excision). A quadrantectomy involves removing the entire segment of the breast that contains the tumor. The last 2 procedures are usually combined with axillary clearance through a separate incision. Axillary procedures may include sentinel lymph node biopsy, sampling, partial (II), or complete (III) axillary lymph node dissection. Lumpectomy is the removal of a benign mass without excision of the normal breast tissue.
