Acquired digital fibrokeratoma (ADFK) is a rare, benign, fibrous tumor. It usually occurs in adults as a solitary lesion on fingers and toes. Since ADFK shares clinical and histologic features with other cutaneous conditions, careful examination is necessary for proper diagnosis and management. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of ADFK and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical patient history associated with acquired digital fibrokeratoma.
- Explain the treatment modalities of acquired digital fibrokeratoma.
- Review the differential diagnosis for acquired digital fibrokeratoma.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with acquired digital fibrokeratoma.
