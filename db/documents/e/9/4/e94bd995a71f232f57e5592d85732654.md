Postoperative rehabilitation is largely influenced by patient compliance. Although general guidelines are implemented for various therapeutic interventions, regimens are accelerated and decelerated based on individualized adherence and subsequent response to therapy. Return to work can take several months. Approximately 10% of patients may require secondary surgeries for complications. Thus, adherence to postoperative therapy must be stressed to optimize functional outcomes.
