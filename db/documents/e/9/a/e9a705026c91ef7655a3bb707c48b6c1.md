To understand the pathophysiology of periodontal disease, it is essential to know about the complex dental biofilm as well as the Immune response associated with the disease.

Dental plaque is a complex biofilm, which is the colonization of bacteria enclosed by a protective matrix. This matrix is composed of extracellular polysaccharide and glycoproteins providing a protective environment for microbes in the dental biofilm.

The initial layer deposited on the surface of teeth in the formation of dental plaque is "acquired pellicle."Streptococcus and Actinomyces species are the primary colonizers which are gram-positive, facultative bacteria.Fusobacterium species.

Gradually the host as a response to the bacterial infection by classic innate immune response.
