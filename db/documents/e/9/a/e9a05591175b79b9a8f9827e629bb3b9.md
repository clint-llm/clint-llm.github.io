Many patients with glaucoma, especially early in the disease, are not aware they have this condition until it is discovered on a routine eye exam. People generally slowly lose peripheral vision but retain central vision until the disease process is severe. This can present in a classic arcuate pattern on Humphrey visual field testing. On comprehensive eye examination, optic nerves may have a focally notched neural retinal rim or diffuse cup enlargement, a decrease in peripheral vision detected on visual field testing, and (although not required for diagnosis) an increased intraocular pressure reading on tonometry. Typically changes will be seen bilaterally but may not progress at the same rate, resulting in an asymmetric optic nerve cup. A cup to disc ratio of > 0.5 is considered suggestive for glaucoma and typically starts with a loss on the inferotemporal and superotemporal poles of the optic disc.

Normal-tension glaucoma patients will typically be asymptomatic and have an intraocular pressure of less than 21mm Hg. On slit-lamp examination, changes in the optic disc such as increased cup to disc ratio will be seen, disc hemorrhage in the nerve fiber layer may also be present. Patients also may have a history of vasospasm, coagulopathies, nocturnal hypotension, autoimmune diseases, vascular diseases, thyroid dysfunction, or sleep apnea.

In the acute angle-closure type, patients typically present with severe sudden ocular pain, redness, blurry vision/decreased visual acuity, headache, nausea, or vomiting, and may complain of seeing halos of light. Patients will have an unresponsive mid-dilated pupil on examination and a firm feeling eyeball on palpation. Typically, attacks are precipitated by pupillary dilation due to weak mydriatic, or dilating, drops. Intraocular pressure will typically be high and often in the 30-50 mm Hg range. Predisposing risk factors include an angle between the iris and the cornea around 20° or less on examination with gonioscopy and/or an anterior chamber depth of less than 2.5mm.

Patients with Secondary glaucoma will typically have a history of a recent ophthalmic procedure, trauma, or health condition causing neovascularization like diabetes. However, some patients will not have a clear precipitating factor in their history but will have sometimes subtle clinical exam findings pointing to the cause of the IOP elevation. On exam, findings can include exfoliative material on the anterior lens capsule, pigment deposition on the corneal endothelium, cell and flare in the anterior chamber typical of uveitis, abnormal blood vessels on the iris, or evidence of trauma; depending on the underlying etiology.
