During surgery involving the anal canal, the surgeon has a variety of techniques available to identify the transition between the upper portion and lower portion of the anal canal. Identifying the region of the pectinate line is vital to understanding the vascular supply and drainage and innervation of the segments of the anal canal for surgical considerations.

The tight space and compact anatomy of the anal canal contribute to a difficult compartment for surgical procedures. For instance, the anatomy of the anal canal makes sphincter-saving surgery during cases of lower rectal cancer very challenging. These surgeries have the potential for negative outcomes, such as anal sphincter compromise with incontinence or permanent colostomy. Given the limited window available for surgeons within the anal canal, other approaches have been explored, such as transvaginal, transperineal, trans-sacral, and abdominal.
