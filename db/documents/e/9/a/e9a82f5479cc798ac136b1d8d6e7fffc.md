A pre-procedural transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is used for evaluating suitable candidates and determining the LAA morphology and dimensions. Important elements to be determined are the shape and size of the ostium, the width of the landing zone, the LAA length, and the number, shape, and location of the lobes, if possible.

Also, the LAA size depends on LA pressure and the presence of sinus rhythm or AF. Hence, certain operators prefer measuring LAA dimensions during the procedure after saline infusion establishes an LA pressure of greater than 10 mm Hg. To rule out post-procedural pericardial effusion and device embolization, many institutions and centers perform a chest radiograph and a TTE. To verify the complete sealing of the LAA and the absence of a thrombus, a TEE is recommended after 45 days. Post LAA closure, various antithrombotic/anticoagulation regimens have been used, including warfarin, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), aspirin monotherapy, and no therapy. Therapy with either DAPT or DOAC does not significantly increase the incidence of device thrombus, stroke, or bleeding compared with standard warfarin therapy.
