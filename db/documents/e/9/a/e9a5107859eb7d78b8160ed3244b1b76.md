The diagnosis and management of polydactyly often requires an interprofessional team approach with healthcare providers such as geneticists, neonatologists, primary clinicians, and surgeons. It is necessary for clinicians to discuss with parents family history and counsel them properly about all the possible outcomes of the newly diagnosed baby. Neonatal health care workers also have a duty to advise those families with familial recurrence of polydactyly for taking genetic counseling regarding their risk assessment.
