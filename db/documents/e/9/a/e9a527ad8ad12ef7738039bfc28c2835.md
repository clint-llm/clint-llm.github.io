A physiatrist or neurologist with subspecialization in neurodiagnostic studies is consulted for electrodiagnostic testing. A specially trained technician is sometimes used to collect the nerve conduction studies and electromyographic results, which can be read and interpreted by the specialist after the examination; however, this is not recommended as the physician may need to change and adapt the examination in real-time based on the patientâ€™s individual presentation or particular test findings.
