The collection of blood samples carries significant safety risks for both personnel and patient if done improperly. Structured curricula designed to standardize collecting blood samples, educate participants on the risks, and address common errors can increase lab safety.

Healthcare workers should demonstrate a degree of competency before working with patients. Healthcare workers should utilize personal protective equipment and antiseptics to prevent accidental contamination of blood samples or infection. Personal protective equipment includes single-use nonsterile gloves, eye protection, and masks if there is a potential for blood exposure. Equipment such as trays or tube holders should be cleaned and disinfected if used on multiple patients. Disposal of all needles and syringes must be considered immediately after use. Using a sharps container can decrease the risk of a needle-stick injury.

For non-waived tests, laboratory regulations require, at the minimum, analysis of at least two levels of control materials once every 24 hours. To ensure accurate results, laboratories can assay QC samples more frequently. Quality control samples should be assayed after calibration or maintenance of an analyzer to verify the correct method performance. To minimize QC when performing tests for which manufacturers’ recommendations are less than those required by the regulatory agency (such as once per month), the labs can develop an individualized quality control plan (IQCP) that involves performing a risk assessment of potential sources of error in all phases of testing and putting in place a QC plan to reduce the likelihood of errors.

Westgard multi-rules are used to evaluate the quality control runs. In case of a rule violation, proper corrective and preventive action should be taken before patient testing is performed.
