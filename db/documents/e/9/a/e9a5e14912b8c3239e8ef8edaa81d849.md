Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant of pVHL using molecular genetic testing establishes the diagnosis of VHL even if clinical and radiographic findings are inconclusive. Various clinical criteria can establish the diagnosis, such as more than one CNS hemangioblastoma, one CNS hemangioblastoma, a visceral manifestation of VHL, or any manifestation with a family history of VHL.

Fundoscopy can detect retinal hemangioblastomas and other associated findings such as retinal detachment, macular edema, or cataracts. Glaucoma may be detectable on tonometry. An audiological evaluation should be done to evaluate for hearing loss caused by endolymphatic sac tumors.

Laboratory studies include serum and urinary catecholamines that can assist in the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas.

Imaging studies play a significant role in identifying VHL lesions. CNS hemangioblastomas are detectable on MR of the brain and spinal cord. Their typical appearance is that of a cystic lesion with an enhancing mural nodule.
