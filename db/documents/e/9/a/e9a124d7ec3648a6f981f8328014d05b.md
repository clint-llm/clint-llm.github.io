The ophthalmic veins are less well-defined and have more variability than the arteries of the orbit. For example, the diameter of the SOV ranges from 2 to 10 millimeters. Further, the roots of origin and communicating branches vary occasionally and give rise to the medial ophthalmic vein, which is usually unilateral. The IOV shows a much more variable organization. The length of the IOV is inconsistent in the literature, and it drains through a variety of indirect and direct routes.
