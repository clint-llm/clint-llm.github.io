The exact pathophysiology behind the development of idiopathic macular holes is unknown. But recent advances in the section of ocular diagnostics in the form of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) have made a big impact. Vitreo-retinal interface abnormality along with its tractional forces play a major role in the development of macular holes. Involutional foveal thinning also plays a role.

This tractional force may be tangential traction by pre-existing epi-retinal membrane or vertical by vitreomacular traction.

The successful anatomical closure of the macular hole after surgical removal of the vitreous indirectly proves its pathologic role. Trauma, in young patients with a gel vitreous body, causes sudden vitreomacular traction followed by forceful separation of them, leading to the formation of the macular holes.
