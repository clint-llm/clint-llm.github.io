Myofibroblastoma can be treated with local excision mainly for symptomatic relief.

Surgical excision is considered curative and local recurrence is not a recognized feature of myofibroblastoma. However, patients should be followed-up for a minimum of 24 months. There are no reports in the literature regarding the malignant transformation of these lesions.
