There are no absolute contraindications to the pediatric hearing aid fitting in a child with hearing that can benefit from hearing aids as determined from audiometry. Relative contraindications consist primarily of patient and family acceptance and usage. If the patient and/or family are not interested in utilizing a hearing aid, one should not be prescribed. Such feelings can have many causes, including the social stigma of hearing aid use, desires of the family (particularly if they are members of the Deaf community), or cognitive/motor inability to manipulate or insert the devices, among others.
