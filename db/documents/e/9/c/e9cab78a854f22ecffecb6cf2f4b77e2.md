Neurapraxia has an excellent prognosis. It is a non-axonal injury, and most patients experience recovery within 2â€“3 months.

For ulnar nerve injury, patients should be informed that half of the cases recover within six weeks; however, the remaining half can still be impaired at two years.

Half of the sport-related neurapraxic injuries resulted in < 1-week time loss, but in 9.4%, the athletes will lose their season.
