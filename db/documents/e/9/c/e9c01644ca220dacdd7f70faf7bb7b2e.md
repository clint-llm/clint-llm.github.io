Before initiation of ART, maternal risks of the ART techniques and pregnancy itself are discussed with the patient. Certain maternal conditions, particularly cardiopulmonary conditions such as pulmonary hypertension and heart failure, are relatively contraindicated conditions for pregnancy. Pre-conception counseling and evaluation to screen for such conditions should be conducted. Even in such patients, gestational carrier options can be utilized.
