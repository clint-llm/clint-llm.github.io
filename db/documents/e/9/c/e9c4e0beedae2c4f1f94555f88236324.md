Medication overuse headache (MOH) is thought to occur when medications intended to relieve a headache are consumed too frequently. This overuse causes a secondary type of headache. It was formerly known as a rebound headache, and when it occurs in a person with a migraine, the overly frequent analgesic use "transforms" episodic suffering into a chronic one. The exact frequency of taking the pain-relieving drug before developing medication overuse headache is variable and depends on the particular type of medication used. Causal agents include both simple and combination analgesics, such as NSAIDs, triptans, ergot derivatives, and opioids, but potentially any painkiller can be the trigger. Medication overuse headache is common in patients at risk of overusing acute medications. Anyone previously diagnosed with primary headache disorder is at risk for this condition, and the best characterized are those suffering from a migraine and tension-type headache.

According to the most recent ICHD-3b criteria, medication overuse headache is described as a headache occurring 15 or more days per month resulting from the overuse of acute headache medication for more than three months. Medication overuse headache tends to resolve when the offending medication is limited.
