HIV-associated nephropathy is defined as a collapsing glomerulopathy and associated tubulointerstitial disease, which may include tubular microcysts and inflammation of the interstitium. Diffuse effacement of podocyte foot process and endothelial tubular inclusions are mainstays when examined by electron microscopy. Staining for IgM, C3, and C1q in collapsed segments and mesangial areas is common by immunofluorescence.
