The Wood's light or lamp is often used to make a diagnosis of specific skin and hair disorders. By exposing human tissues to the light emitted by Wood's lamp, one can determine the cause. Wood's lamp emits black light which is invisible to the naked eye because it is in the ultraviolet spectrum. The lamp glows in dark environments because it also emits some light in the violet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. The traditional Wood's lamp is covered with a wood filter and emits wavelengths in the 320 to 450 nm range.

Today, there are several types of Wood's lamps on the market that filter out visible light. The medical Wood's lamp contains a magnifying lens, a variety of phosphors with different peak emissions, white light, and black drapes to exclude ambient light.
