C. difficile infections have increased over the last 20 years with almost 500,000 episodes and 29,000 associated deaths reported annually in the United States, which makes it among the most common nosocomial infections. C. difficile colitis in patients without antibiotic and healthcare exposure has led to the recognition of community-associated C difficile infection. The most common cause of infectious diarrhea in healthcare settings, C. difficile causes substantial morbidity and can potentially result in mortality in vulnerable inpatient populations. C. difficile colonization occurs in 13% of hospitalized patients with stays of 2 weeks and up to 50% of patients with stays more than 4 weeks. C. difficile can colonize the human colon; 2% to 5% of the healthy outpatient community will be colonized and will not manifest signs of infection.
