All patients presenting with suspicion or symptoms of hydrocarbon exposure should immediately be placed on a cardiac monitor as well pulse oximetry. There are no specific quantitative tests for hydrocarbons, but identification of the specific hydrocarbon substance may help guide management and anticipate adverse events. A chest radiograph is indicated in any patient suspected of inhalation or aspiration of hydrocarbons. However, initial imaging may be normal despite a patient displaying symptoms. Alternatively, initially asymptomatic patients may have abnormal radiographs later during their course. About 6 hours after exposure, patients will experience symptoms or have changes in pulse oximetry or chest radiography. ECG is indicated as well as a basic metabolic profile, hepatic function tests, and a complete blood count. Carboxyhemoglobin or methemoglobin levels may also be helpful if there is a concern for exposure to specific hydrocarbons mentioned previously.
