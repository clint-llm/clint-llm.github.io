Patients with clavicular fractures are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes an orthopedic surgeon, emergency department physician, primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and a physical therapist. Most patients with clavicular fracture first present to the emergency department and it is important to consult with the radiologist for the appropriate imaging studies. A thorough neurovascular and lung exam is necessary. The majority of clavicular fractures are managed with conservative care.

The orthopedic nurse should inform the patient that a visible prominence may be present for months and it is a normal part of healing. If the patient continues to have pain and difficulty with motion, then nonunion should be suspected. The patient should be educated that return to sports should only take place after complete healing has occurred. The healing of the fracture may take 8-12 weeks and most patients have a good outcome. However, a few patients may have chronic pain and limited range of motion of the shoulder.
