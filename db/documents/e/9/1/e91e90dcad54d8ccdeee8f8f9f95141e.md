The clinician should assess the rate of progression, the timeline of development, and the presence of pain with eyelid lesions is essential when evaluating the potential for malignancy. The patient's best-corrected visual acuity, color vision, extraocular motility, pupillary responses, and visual field should also be measured.

These exam findings are often affected by the pathology of the globe, orbit, ocular adnexa, and periorbital tissue. More specifically, the following should be noted during the evaluation of a potentially malignant eyelid lesion:

- Color of the lesion(s)

- Size, measured in millimeters with vertical and horizontal dimensions and depth as applicable

- The appearance of telangiectasic or atypical vasculature

- Distortion of eyelid architecture

- For lesions involving the palpebral conjunctiva - recommend double-eversion of the upper eyelid to evaluate the conjunctival fornix

- Madarosis

- Ulceration

- Poliosis

- Local lymph node enlargement

Working closely with a pathologist to prepare an ideal specimen is imperative for an accurate and timely diagnosis. A full-thickness biopsy of the lesion for histopathologic evaluation should be obtained before initiating therapy for malignant lesions. In addition, potential metastasis should be considered as eyelid malignancies may represent only part of a more extensive malignant process or metastatic disease.

Orbital imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides details of orbital and periorbital soft tissue, and computerized tomography allows for assessing bony structures. Both of these imaging studies are useful for planning treatment.
