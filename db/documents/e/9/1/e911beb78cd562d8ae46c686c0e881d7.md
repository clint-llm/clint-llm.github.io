Contrast agents are pharmaceuticals that increase the information content of diagnostic images. They serve to improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic images by altering the intrinsic properties of tissues, which influence the fundamental mechanisms of contrast. Strategic localization of the agent can regionally change the tissue properties and result in preferential enhancement. This activity reviews the role of MRI imaging, its indications, contraindications and potential complications.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the use of contrast for MRI imaging.
- Describe the indications of MRI.
- Recall the side effects of MRI.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication so that patients undergo safe MRI imaging with improved outcomes.
