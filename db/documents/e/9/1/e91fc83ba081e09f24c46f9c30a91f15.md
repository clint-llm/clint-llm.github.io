The cause of thyroid cancer has links to radiation exposure, iodine intake, diabetes, obesity, Hashimoto thyroiditis, exogenous estrogen use, and dietary choices.

In some studies, like the one reported by Knobel et al. in 2007, it was found that iodine intake was a predisposing factor for thyroid cancer

Some occupations have been correlated with an increased incidence of thyroid cancer. Occupational exposure to radiation, pesticides, and working in the textile industry has also shown an increased association with thyroid cancer.
