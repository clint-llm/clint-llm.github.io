Ultrasound can be used transvaginally or transabdominally to view the female reproductive anatomy, with a transvaginal approachÂ allowing for better visualization of structures. The uterus is located posterior to the bladder and anterior to the colon. The three parts of the uterus can be visualized with the use of transvaginal ultrasound, beginning most caudal: cervix, body, and then the fundus. The uterus contains the gestational sac during pregnancy which is typically visualized in the center of the uterine body at 4.5 to 5 weeks of gestation and is the first structure visualized in pregnancy.
