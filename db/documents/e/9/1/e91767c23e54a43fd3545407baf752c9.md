Carcinomatous meningitis is the dissemination of malignant cells from the primary tumor sites to leptomeningeal layers of the CNS. It occurs in the advanced stage of any cancer, solid as well as hematological malignancies. It is a rare complication with a dismal prognosis. It causes a wide array of symptoms according to the site of metastasis. CSF studies and MRI are the two important diagnostic tools. Treatment involves a multimodal approach consisting of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This activity highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients suffering from this disease.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of the development of metastasis in leptomeningeal layers.
- Review the evaluation process of carcinomatous meningitis.
- Outline the management options available for carcinomatous meningitis.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication.
