The treatment of an anal fistula depends on the location of the fistula as well as precipitating factors. Most fistulas are treated surgically, through a variety of different procedures depending on external and internal sphincter involvement. Complex fistulas, particularly those caused by Crohn disease, are treated medically. The most common options will be discussed in detail.

- Fistulotomy – Fistulotomy entails opening the fistula tract and possibly dividing sphincter muscle. This surgical treatment is very effective for simple fistulas with minimal sphincter involvement resulting in healing in 90% of properly selected patients.

- Endorectal advancement flap – This procedure is technically more challenging than fistulotomy. The endorectal advancement flap procedure involves closure of the internal opening of the tract, debridement of the tract, and mobilization of anorectal mucosa to cover the defect. The sphincter is not divided during this procedure but can be compromised during the flap with reports of incontinence up to 35%.

- Seton placement – Seton drain placement is often reserved for complex fistulas and used in a two-stage technique. Initial placement is used to gain source control, while the second stage often includes fistulotomy. Setons can be classified as ‘draining’ or ‘cutting.’ A draining seton is placed through the fistula tract and tied loosely in place to maintain long term drainage. Many materials can be used, including vessel loops, sutures, or newly available drain devices. A cutting seton is tied tightly around the fistula tract to slowly divide the sphincter complex as it can be tightened over time. This allows for the slow division of the sphincter with decreased risk of incontinence. A completion fistulotomy would then be performed. This two-staged technique will allow for complete healing of the fistula in 94% of patients.

- LIFT – The ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) procedure can be used for the treatment of simple and complex fistulas with an average success rate of 71%.

- Fibrin plug and glue – A fibrin plug is a treatment option that involves a collagen matrix used to block or plug the internal opening of the fistula tract. The treatment is appealing as it does not involve dissection or division of the sphincter complex and therefore, should not contribute to incontinence. Unfortunately, the treatment is less than 50% successful in the treatment of fistula-in-ano.

- Medical management – Antibiotics are often unnecessary in the setting of an uncomplicated and drained rectal abscess. Instead, antibiotics are reserved for immunocompromised patients, those with systemic signs of illness and the presence of cellulitis at the abscess. HIV patients may benefit from wound cultures and antibiotics.
