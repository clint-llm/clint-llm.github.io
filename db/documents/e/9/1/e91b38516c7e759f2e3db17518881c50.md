Exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO) usually affects adolescents and young adults during exercise. It is due to a narrowing at the upper airway and vocal cord level that happens during inspiration (while trying to take a breath in).Â This can cause noisy breathing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough.

The medical provider will likely want to rule out other conditions first, like asthma, reflux, or upper airway issues.

If the diagnosis of EILO is confirmed, the patient should be referred to speech therapy to learn breathing techniques that will help prevent EILO.
