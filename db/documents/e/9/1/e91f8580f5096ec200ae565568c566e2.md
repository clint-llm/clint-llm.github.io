Polydactyly consists of poly that means many and dactylos, which means digits. Polydactyly, also known as hyperdactyly, is the most common congenital anomaly of hand and foot. It is characterized by an extra finger or toe that may results from defective development during anterior-posterior patterning of developing limb. It may appear in isolation (non-syndromic polydactyly) or associated with other birth defects as a part of a syndrome (syndromic polydactyly).

Because it can be part of a syndrome, the clinician should be prepared to evaluate the newborn baby with polydactyly and consider the other syndromic presentations that may be associated with this anomaly. There is an increased tendency of polydactyly to involve the right hand rather than the left hand, the upper limb rather than the lower limb, and the left foot rather than the right.
