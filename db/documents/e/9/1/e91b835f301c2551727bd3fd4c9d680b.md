Small bowel obstruction is a common presentation to the emergency department. Due to the high morbidity and mortality associated with this disorder, an interprofessional team must evaluate and manage the patient. The triage nurse must be aware of the signs and symptoms of small bowel obstruction. Any delay in diagnosis can quickly turn fatal. With prompt diagnosis and management, the prognosis for most patients with small bowel obstruction is good. However, complete obstructions, even though treated, can have a high recurrence rate. When surgery is performed within 24 to 36 hours, the mortality rates are low, but if surgery is delayed, the mortalityÂ rates can exceed 10%. All patients at discharge should be educated about the signs and symptoms of recurrent bowel obstruction and when to present to the emergency department.
