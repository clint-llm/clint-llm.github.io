A thorough history of the type, dose, and duration of the culprit drug should be taken in cases of cinchonism. In addition, further history regarding past medical illnesses and the reasons for using the drug should be obtained. After an overdose, quinine is quickly absorbed. Peak plasma concentration is achieved within three to six hours; however, the elimination half-life may be prolonged to 24–26 hours. The classical features of cinchonism manifest within three to six hours of ingestion and include symptoms such as nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, sweating, deafness, and tinnitus.

With more severe toxicity, visual features initially appear 6 to 15 hours post-ingestion, beginning with the blurring of vision and disturbance of color vision.

**Pertinent Physical Exam**

Vitals signs: Assess for hemodynamic compromise, tachycardia, and hypotension.

General: Assess for appropriate cognition, as encephalopathy may signify cinchonism.

Eyes: Thorough examination of visual fields may demonstrate loss of peripheral vision with only central vision intact (tunnel vision) if the primary cause is from the optic nerve.

Ears: Rinne/Weber testing would demonstrate sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus.

Cardiovascular: Assess for tachycardia.

Neurologic: Gait assessment may reveal ataxia.
