Brainstem and midbrain surgery are technically highly challenging procedures, and careful avoidance of damage to the numerous critical structure in this region is paramount to ensure as patients have as good as the possible quality of life following surgery.

In adults, gliomas (malignant primary central nervous system tumors) are rare, constituting only 2% of brain malignancy in this population. The mean age of onset is in the sixth decade, and surgical treatment is often challenging and without the possibility of achieving total resection of the tumor. Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy are often employed, which has improved survival rates, but the overall median survival is still poor at 13.5 months.
