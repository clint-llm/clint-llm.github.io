The standard radiographic analysis of the ankle includes three views: the anteroposterior (AP, also sometimes referred to as dorsoplantar or DP) view, the internal oblique (or mortise) view, and the direct lateral view. The AP view is used to evaluate the ankle mortise, though the lateral portions of the talus and tibiotalar joint overlap with the lateral malleolus, obscuring that area from view. The lateral process of the talus is best evaluated on AP ankle radiographs.

The radiographic search pattern must include the evaluation of the soft tissues for swelling. Swelling about the medial or lateral malleolus is an important clue for underlying fractures or ligamentous injury. Ankle joint effusions may be identified by the presence of a soft tissue density in the expected position of the normal fat lucency anterior or posterior to the ankle joint. While many of the ligaments and tendons of the ankle and foot are not well-evaluated by radiography, the Achilles tendon is readily apparent. This tendon has an approximate average AP diameter of 6 mm. A size exceeding 8 mm may represent tendinous pathology from multiple sources, including tendinosis or tearing, post-surgical change, inflammatory arthropathies, or accessory muscles, among others.
