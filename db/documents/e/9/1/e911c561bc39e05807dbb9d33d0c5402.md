Histopathological examination is required for the diagnosis of Eosinophilic Granulomatosis (EG) to differentiate from other conditions like infections, malignancy, and benign tumors of the bone as their clinical presentation and laboratory findings are somewhat similar.

**Histopathological Finding:**

- Shows Langerhans cells, which are mononuclear histiocyte-like cells with prominent nuclear groovesÂ (coffee-bean) and admixed eosinophils (gives the pink appearance of cytoplasm).

- Scattered multinucleated Touton like giant cells, inflammatory cells, and areas of necrosis.

- Staining positive for CD1 antigen, S-100 protein, CD207 (Langerin), cyclin D1, PNA (peanut agglutinin), BRAF VE1 (50% of cases).

- Lack of nuclear atypia and atypical mitoses (differentiates from malignant conditions).

**Electron Microscopy:**

- Shows Birbeck granules inside Langerhans cells. Birbeck granules are "tennis racquet shaped" cytoplasmic inclusions with zipper-like appearance.
