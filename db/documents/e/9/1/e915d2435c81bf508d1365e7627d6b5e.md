The supraspinatus and infraspinatus receive its innervation from the suprascapular nerve. When there are signs of atrophy to these muscles, the nerve is usually at risk for compression neuropathy. If both muscles show signs of atrophy, then the compression is at the level of the suprascapular notch. When there is isolated atrophy in the infraspinatus muscle the level of compression is at the spinoglenoid notch.
