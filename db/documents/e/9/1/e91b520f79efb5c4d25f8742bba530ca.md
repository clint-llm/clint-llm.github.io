General anesthesia for sternotomy is dependent upon the type ofÂ operation to be performed. If single lung ventilation is required, patients should be intubated with a double lumen endotracheal tube.

The patient must be sufficiently sedated and paralyzed before opening the chest to avoid tachyarrhythmias and hypertension during anesthesia. In patients with severe aortic stenosis, the surgeon must be scrubbed and ready to open the chest in case an arrest occurs.

The lungs are usually deflated before sternal division.
