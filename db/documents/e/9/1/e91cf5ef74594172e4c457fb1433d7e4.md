As described above, three roots (parasympathetic, sympathetic, and sensory) are attached posteriorly to the ciliary ganglion, and it gives 8Â to 10 branches from the anterior border. These branches are known as short ciliary nerves. These branches arrange in two bundles and get distributed by 15 to 20 branches. These branches pierce the sclera around the optic nerve and run in grooves present on the internal surface of the sclera. These branches contain all three components (parasympathetic, sympathetic, and sensory fibers). Motor fibers distributed to sphincter pupillae, ciliaris muscles, and choroidal and iridial blood vessels.
