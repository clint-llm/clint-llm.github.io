Percutaneous lung lesion biopsy (PLLB) is a procedure that involves passing a needle percutaneously under image guidance (using thoracic computed tomography or CT scan). PLLB includes either needle aspiration  (TTNA) or biopsy (TTNB) to diagnose lung cancer which is by far the most common indication for percutaneous needle biopsy of the deep tissues of the thorax.

PLLB has one of the highest complication rates among procedures performed by radiologists, with complication rates of around 35%.
