Histologically, the fatty liver will reveal fat accumulation chiefly in the pericentral (centrilobular) zone. Universally one will note the presence ofÂ macrovesicular steatosis with the liver cells containing several large fat droplets which displace the nucleus. Sometimes the lipid deposits may be released due to rupture of the overtly distended liver cells and produce lipogranulomas, which are composed chiefly of macrophages and occasional lymphocytes.
