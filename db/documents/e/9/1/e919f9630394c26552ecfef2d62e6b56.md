Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a diagnostic imaging technique useful for the detailed characterization of the soft tissues without ionizing radiation. MRI imaging is noninvasive, and in some cases, eliminates the need for surgical intervention or invasive procedures when used correctly. This activity outlines the appropriate clinical use of MRI to evaluate for common clinical questions (and is not all-encompassing) and briefly reviews contraindications that are important considerations for the interprofessional team contemplating this imaging modality.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the appropriate use of MRI imaging broadly organized by anatomy.
- Review the appropriate use of gadolinium-based contrast and risk factors for developing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.
- Identify contraindications to MRI, specifically related to implanted hardware.
