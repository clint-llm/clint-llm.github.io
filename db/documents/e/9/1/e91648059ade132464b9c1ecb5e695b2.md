**Evaluation**

Once the underlying issues and healing impediments are determined, a formal wound assessment is performed. The evaluation of patients with complex wounds is best approached systematically since wounds are rarely secondary to only one sole cause. Assessment of both local and systemic contributing factors within each portion of the work-up is critical. Generally, ongoing nursing and clinician assessments and monitoring of wounds are similar. Physical examination should be the primary criterion for the diagnosis of local wound infection:

- Identify the wound location.

- Determine the cause of the wound:

- 
              
- Evaluate for foreign bodies or neoplastic processes.
              
              
- Consider bacterial colonization versus acute/chronic infection.
              
              
- 
                  
- Note that all open wounds will have bacterial colonization, yet this in itself does not constitute an infected wound.
                  
                  
- Diagnosis of infection is designated in the presence of erythema, pain, swelling, fluctuance, purulence, and loss of function.

- Determine the stage of the wound:

- 
              
- Stage I: Superficial, involving only the epidermal layer 
              
              
- 
                  
- Intact skin with non-blanchable erythema 
                  
                

              
              
- Stage II: Partial thickness affects the epidermis and may extend into the dermis 
              
              
- Stage III: Full thickness, extends through the dermis and into the adipose tissues 
              
              
- Stage IV: Full thickness, extends through the dermis and adipose, exposing muscle, bone, fascia, or tendon
              
              
- Unstageable: Full-thickness skin and tissue loss obscured by slough or eschar; thus, the true extent of tissue damage cannot be confirmed
              
              
- 
                  
- If slough or eschar are removed, a stage III or IV wound results

- Evaluate and measure the depth, length, and width of the wound

- 
              
- Granulation tissue: beefy red bleeding tissue that indicates healing in progress
              
              
- Fibrinous tissue: white-ish/yellow slough that does not bleed (not healthy)
              
              
- Eschar: roof or rim of black/charred-appearing callous-like tissue (not healthy)

- Measure the amount of undermining and tunneling

- Evaluate the wound bed for exposed bone, vessels, hardware, or subcutaneous fat

- Survey for presence, type, and amount of exudate:

- 
              
- Serous, serosanguineous, sanguineous, or purulent
              
              
- Minimal, light, moderate, or heavy

- Assess surrounding skin tissue for signs of injury (actinic changes), previous irradiation, arterial or venous insufficiency, lymphedema, loss of sensation, and dermal thinning (i.e., aging, steroid therapy)

- Check wound margins for tunneling, rolled edges, undermining, and fibrotic changes.

- Evaluate for warmth, pain, odor, purulence, delayed healing, or other signs of infection

- Observe pain

- For all wounds on extremities, a careful neurovascular examination of the entire limb is mandatory.

- Document findings and report unexpected results to the healthcare team

**Diagnostics**

- Surface swabs indicating the presence of pathogenic bacteria do not correlate with clinically significant infection. For local wound evaluation, wound swabs can be valuable for surveillance of the flora colonizing a wound but should not be used as a trigger to initiate therapy for wound infection.

- Wound biopsies can be invaluable for diagnosing invasive burn wounds; the presence of bacteria in the deep dermis on biopsy correlates with the risk of system sepsis in burn patients.

- 
              
- Bone biopsy demonstrating bacteria within the bone is the gold standard for diagnosing osteomyelitis.

- Laboratory studies can be a useful adjunct in managing chronic wounds; however, they are often misused, and an evidence-based, rationalized approach is necessary to utilize this expensive resource efficiently. Routine blood work is not required. Serum prealbumin may be valuable in determining nutritional status. A significantly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) can help confirm the diagnosis of osteomyelitis or be used in monitoring response to treatment.

- Ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful for delineating fluid collections, necrotic tissue, or inflammation in select circumstances.

- Assessment of peripheral perfusion via ankle/brachial index and toe brachial index (ABI/TBI) should be performed as it guides further management strategies. ABI does not provide reliable results in patients with non-compressible vessels, such as patients with diabetes or renal insufficiency, so TBI is also needed.

**Prevention**

The preventative measures that should be taken for patients with open wounds depend on the setting.

- Tetanus prophylaxis should be considered for acute lacerations

- Strict adherence to pressure-relief protocol, turning bed-bound patients every 2 hours, offloading pressure points, floating heels, optimization of wheelchair seating/bedding, social support and wound care, and assessment of nutritional status take priority in pressure sores

- Prophylactic antibiotics are necessitated in human/animal bites

- Any associated medical conditions must be aggressively optimized

- Preserving joint motion must be considered for patients with open wounds of the extremities:

- 
              
- Institute aggressive physiotherapy regimens to maintain or improve joint motion
              
              
- Utilize splinting to minimize joint contractures

**Interventions**

After careful adherence to preventative measures and preservation of critical function, a strategy for wound closure can be formulated with respect to multidisciplinary decision-making.

- The basic tenet of non-surgical therapy is debridement of dirty wounds and closure of clean wounds, first focusing on eliminating necrotic debris while controlling any associated infectious burden.

- 
              
- The utilization of wound dressings comprises the mainstay of non-surgical therapy, with a fundamental principle of employing debriding dressings for dirty wounds and occlusive dressings for clean wounds. 
              
              
- 
                  
- A commonly used debriding dressing is the “wet-to-dry” dressing, in which gauze is dampened, then positioned into the wound base. Evaporation dries the dressing, which becomes slightly adherent to the wound surface. Necrotic debris and biofilm are removed with the dressing on subsequent exchanges, leaving healthy tissue behind. Wet-to-dry dressings work through mechanical debridement. Conceptually, establishing a clearly outlined regimen for frequency of dressing changes is most important for optimized success; generally, twice daily is recommended, although some may require heightened frequency. Debriding dressings are indicated in infected wounds or those containing necrotic debris.
                  
                

              
              
- In clean wounds lacking necrotic debris with acceptable bacterial load(s), a dressing that maintains a moist environment should be utilized to encourage healing. This technique should not be employed for infected or dirty wounds. 
              
              
- Occasionally, circumstances necessitate antibiotic dressings. Mupirocin ointment has the added benefit of treating methicillin-resistant staph aureus (MRSA). Burn wounds are commonly dressed with silver sulfadiazine or mafenide acetate due to their high antimicrobial activity. The low toxicity and exceptional antimicrobial properties of elemental silver have led to the development and widespread use of silver-impregnated wound dressings. 
              
              
- Although multiple commercial variations in negative pressure wound therapy exist, all utilize a similar sponge-like material connected to a suction device. When applied appropriately and for the correct wound, negative pressure wound therapy can be efficacious and cost-effective. Negative pressure therapy, through extensive experimental and clinical trials, has confirmed the promotion of tissue perfusion, reduced edema, and, furthermore, favorably alters the wound-fluid composition and stimulates the formation of healthy granulation tissue. While negative pressure systems are easy to use and decrease the number of dressing changes, they are contraindicated in acutely infectious wounds.

- For problem wounds, surgical debridement remains the gold standard. Removal of necrotic tissue to permit thorough inspection of underlying tissue while eliminating dead spaces, allowing wide drainage of infectious fluid, reducing pressure, and creating a healthy surface for subsequent topical preparations are cornerstone intentions of surgical wound care.

- Necrotic bone segments serve as a nidus for infection in osteomyelitis, termed “sequestra,” thus, IV nor PO antibiotics alone can clear the bacteria from a focus of dead bone, and formal resection is required. Targeted antimicrobial therapy, along with source control via debridement of necrotic bone, drainage/irrigation or abscessed tissue, and optimization of medical comorbidities, are the main pillars of osteomyelitis therapy.

**Putting it All Together**

Taking the above information into consideration, walk through a formal wound evaluation.

For instance:

- What type of tissue is present in the wound?

- Is it normal, healthy tissue? Is it granular, necrotic, fibrotic?
- In red, granular tissue, the treatment is generally to keep it clean and moist, and offload pressure, to allow healing.
- If necrotic tissue is present, this should be resected (i.e., debrided) immediately to remove a potential nidus of infection.
- If faced with a dry wound and compromised vascular supply, the patient may need revascularization in the hands of their vascular surgeon or interventional cardiologist prior to debridement.

- Debriding a wound lacking adequate vascular supply will cause an increased size of the non-healing wound without addressing the underlying cause of halted healing.


- For fibrotic tissue, debridement must be performed to create a healing wound environment.

- This can be performed sharply, with a scalpel or curette, or via a chemical/enzymatic debridement.

- Is the wound wet or dry?

- A simple rule of thumb is that if it is wet, dry it; if it is dry, wet it.

- The idea is to keep the wound at an optimal moisture level for healing.


- Hydrogels are advantageous for keeping a relatively dry wound moist.
- Moisture-absorbing materials such as alginates are useful for drying out a weeping ulcer.

- Some wounds, such as venous stasis ulcerations, weep such high volumes of fluid that they require daily dressing changes simply to keep the surrounding skin from becoming macerated or excoriated from the secretions/fluid contents.

- Is the surrounding tissue healthy?

- Friable skin (fragile and thin) is challenging to address, as any adhesive may tear the skin, increasing the size of the wound.
- Macerated skin is found when the moisture from the wound is not well-controlled.

- Excess moisture softens the skin until it begins to break down, therefore increasing the wound size.

- Finally, is the wound infected?

- Cellulitic appearing skin is erythematous and edematous, with a focal increase in temperature.
- There is often purulent discharge and, depending on the offending organism, may have a strong odor.

- The presence of a strong odor, especially in venous stasis wounds, is not indicative of infection unless it is either noticeably worsened from normal or combined with other signs of infection, as heavy drainage will have a distinct odor by itself.


- In the case of lower extremity erythema and edema, especially where it is seen bilaterally, this may simply be vasculitis and not an infection.

- A useful test to employ in this scenario is to elevate the leg for 3 to 5 minutes; if the erythema resolves significantly during that period, it is likely vasculitis, not infectious.


- If there is an open wound and/or other reasons to be suspicious of infection, err on the side of caution.

- If an infection is suspected, be sure to take deep cultures of the wound as just swabbing the rim will likely culture a wide variety of organisms (a.k.a. skin flora.)

- Purulent discharge is a good source of culture.
- If the patient has comorbidities, is immunosuppressed, elderly or very young, an abscess cannot be completely drained, the infection does not respond to incision and drainage, or sepsis/bacteremia is suspected, the patient ought to be initiated on IV broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, making sure to take blood cultures before antibiotics are administered.
- For local treatment of infected wounds, debridement with copious irrigation is warranted; if there is a concern for abscess, incision and drainage are necessary to remove any nidus of infection.
- Imaging in these cases is vital, as the depth and extent of infection will change the type of treatment.

- On plain film X-ray, it is possible to see the destruction of bone, which is indicative of osteomyelitis (bone infection.)

- Generally speaking, bone with visible destruction from an infection needs combination therapy via complete resection in conjunction with a prolonged IV antibiotic(s) course tailored to cultural sensitivities for complete clearance.

While there are many factors to consider when approaching a wound, understanding the nature and underlying factors potentiating the wound in question will lead to successful evaluation and treatment.
