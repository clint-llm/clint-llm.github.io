Methadone can cause CNS depression and respiratory compromise; hence it should be used with extreme caution in patients with CNS-related pathologies such as trauma, increased intracranial pressure, dementia, delirium, etc. Methadone should not be used in conjunction with medications or substances with similar depressant effects such as other opioids, benzodiazepines, alcohol, antipsychotics, etc., unless necessary. Drugs that may increase the clearance of methadone or decrease its effects must also be used with caution to prevent precipitating withdrawal symptoms. The following examples are not an exhaustive list of drug interactions but provide some commonly documented drug interactions to monitor when using methadone.

Examples of drugs that may increase methadone effects and risk overdose symptoms:

- Ciprofloxacin

- Benzodiazepines

- Alcohol

- Fluconazole

- Cimetidine

- Fluoxetine

- Urine alkalizing agents

Examples of drugs that may decrease methadone effects and risk withdrawal symptoms:

- Efavirenz

- Phenobarbital

- Phenytoin

- Rifampin

- Ritonavir

- Carbamazepine

- Urine acidifying agents
