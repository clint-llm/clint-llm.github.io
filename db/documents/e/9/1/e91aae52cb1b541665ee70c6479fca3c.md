Penetrating injuries to the groin represent a challenging scenario with the potential for injuries of multiple organ systems. Hemorrhage associated with vascular injury is the most rapid threat to life. Early control of bleeding on-scene can improve outcomes by allowing time for transport to a Trauma Center for definitive care. The American College of Surgeons “Stop the Bleed” campaign focuses on the training of laypersons and first responders in control of hemorrhage, with training in the proper techniques of direct pressure, hemostatic agents, and tourniquet use; this training has been shown to increase layperson confidence and willingness to intervene in bleeding control scenarios.

Rapid presentation to an appropriate trauma center confers a survival advantage. In a comparison of prehospital transport via private vehicle vs. EMS in the urban setting, patients transported by a private vehicle following penetrating trauma had a lower risk of mortality than those transported by EMS
