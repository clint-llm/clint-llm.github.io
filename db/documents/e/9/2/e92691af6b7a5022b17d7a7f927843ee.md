Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) was first described by Muir et al. in 1967 and, independently, by Torre et al. one year later in 1968. Muir-Torre Syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is a phenotypic variant of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) which is also known as Lynch syndrome. It is caused by mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes which results in microsatellite instability. The hallmark features of Muir-Torre syndromeÂ are sebaceous neoplasms of the skin and visceral malignancies with colonic carcinoma being the most common. The association of mismatch repair gene mutations and visceral malignancies warrants an earlier and more frequent evaluation for malignancy.
