Leucovorin is a useful drug used in the setting of chemotherapy and methotrexate overdose/toxicity.

Care of patients undergoing combination chemotherapy with leucovorin can be challenging and requires an interprofessional team of clinicians from different specialties, nurses, and pharmacists. It is useful to know the symptoms of the toxicity of methotrexate. Early recognition of toxicity and early institution of treatment can reduce adverse outcomes.

When the clinician initiates leucovorin, they will do well to consult with the pharmacist to ensure proper dosing, the absence of potential interactions, and review the adverse events and corrective actions. Dosing and administration will fall to nursing; they must also be well-informed regarding early signs of adverse reactions and keep the team informed on patient tolerance and therapeutic progress. If any issues become apparent, the nursing staff should promptly involve the pharmacy and the clinicians for corrective action. These interprofessional actions will optimize leucovorin therapy results while minimizing adverse effects. [Level 5]
