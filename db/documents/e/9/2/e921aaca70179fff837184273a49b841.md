The obturator nerve originates from the L2 to L4 spinal nerve roots. It traverses along the iliopectineal line, enters the obturator canal, exits from the obturator forearm, and splits into the anterior and posterior branches. The gracilis muscle receives innervation from the anterior branch of the obturator nerve. The major pedicles contain the anterior branch of the obturator nerve. Typically, the anterior branch of the obturator nerve forms two divisions, one of which is superficial to the pedicle and one deep to the pedicle. From there, the nerve divides into two to six descending branches, which distally traverse the length of the muscle.

From the main branch of the obturator nerve that entered the muscle, one or two branches go proximally and supply the proximal gracilis. There are variations in the paths of the vasculature (arteries and vena comitantes) and the nerves; they usually follow each other intramuscularly, but not always.
