Patients treated with antipsychotic drugs may develop tardive dyskinesia. This condition is characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements such as facial grimacing with protrusion or twisting of the tongue. This condition occurs more commonly in senior women; however, the clinician should not rely on prevalence rates to detect which patients are most likely to develop this adverse effect. High dosage and prolonged treatment increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia becoming irreversible. If you suspect tardive dyskinesia in a patient, discontinue the drug as there is no treatment currently available to treat this movement disorder.

Patients undergoing therapy with ziprasidone are also at risk for the neuroleptic malignant syndrome; in this syndrome, patients present with muscle rigidity, high fever, autonomic instability (high blood pressure, diaphoresis), and altered mental status. If you suspect patients with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, supportive care is the most important in management. Treatment with bromocriptine, dantrolene, and amantadine, with discontinuation of ziprasidone, may help.

Lastly, hyperglycemia associated with coma, ketoacidosis, or death can occur in rare cases. Patients who have diabetes mellitus should take ziprasidone with caution. These patients should have monitoring daily.

Rare but fatal Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) has been reported with Ziprasidone exposure.

Antipsychotic drugs, including ziprasidone, may cause motor and sensory instability and postural hypotension, leading to falls, fractures, or other injuries.

Hyperprolactinemia, priapism, and dyslipidemia are reported in a few patients taking ziprasidone. Chronic hyperprolactinemia with hypogonadism may lead to decreased bone density. Hyperprolactinemia, leading to galactorrhea, gynecomastia, impotence, and amenorrhea, is also possible, secondary to the D2 receptor antagonism in ziprasidone, leading to an elevation in prolactin levels.

Common adverse effects found in more than 10 % of patients enrolled in the clinical trial were drowsiness, headache, dizziness, nausea, and lightheadedness. More than 5% of patients experienced orthostatic hypotension, akathisia, anxiety, skin rash, weight gain, constipation, dyspepsia, xerostomia, vomiting, diarrhea, visual disturbances, and pain at the injection site.

When co-administered, carbamazepine (CYP3A4 inducer) can reduce ziprasidone levels, resulting in subtherapeutic levels of ziprasidone and ketoconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor) increase ziprasidone levels.
