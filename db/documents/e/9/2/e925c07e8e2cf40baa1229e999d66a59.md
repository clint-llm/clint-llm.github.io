Pulsus paradoxus is best managed by an interprofessional team including nurses.Â  Pulsus paradoxus is not a disease state. It is a physiologic manifestation of an underlying disease process and treatment should address the underlying pathology. If cardiac tamponade is suspected and pulsus paradoxus is present, consideration should be made for urgent or emergent pericardiocentesis.
