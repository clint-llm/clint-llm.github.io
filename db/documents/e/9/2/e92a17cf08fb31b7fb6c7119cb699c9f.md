Calcium is the most abundant cation found in the human body and plays an integral role in neural transmission, enzyme activity, myocardial function, coagulation and other cellular functions. Most of the calcium is found in the bones as calcium phosphate while a small percentage is found in the cells and extracellular fluids. In the serum, about 45% of calcium is bound to proteins, 45% exists as free or ionized calcium that is the active form, while 10% is bound to anions. Systemic acidosis decreases calcium binding to albumin increasing serum levels while alkalosis causes the opposite effect. Serum calcium concentrations are highest in neonates and infants, decrease during childhood and adolescence, and stabilize at adult values by 17 years of age. Hypercalcemia is defined as serum calcium concentration two standard deviations above the mean values. The normal serum calcium ranges from 8.8 mg/dL-10.8 mg/dL. Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy accounts for 90% of the cases of hypercalcemia.
