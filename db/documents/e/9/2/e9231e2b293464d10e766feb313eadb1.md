Patients with type I tumors are treated with surgical resection to diagnose the lesion and to treat it. Some authors advocate adjuvant chemotherapy, but there is no consensus. Radiation therapy is not used for type I PPB. If type I pleuropulmonary blastoma recurs in a child as type II or type III PPB, then the treatment options for types II and III disease are used.

Type II and III PPB are both aggressive tumors. For patients with types II and III lesions, surgical resection is recommended if feasible, followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Intracavitary chemotherapy has been reported in the literature. There is a benefit of doxorubicin-based regimes. Recurrence is often local.

Radiation therapy can be used on individual basis in PPB patients. In general, if there is a small part of tumor that cannot be removed surgically and is resistant to chemotherapy, then radiation can be considered. Pleuropulmonary blastomas can widely metastasize. When PPB spreads to the brain, surgery followed by radiation therapy is often advised.  For recurrent tumors, we recommend high-dose consolidation therapy with autologous stem cell rescue.
