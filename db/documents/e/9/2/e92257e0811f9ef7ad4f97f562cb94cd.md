Sodium bicarbonate can result in a multitude of adverse effects, including:

- Metabolic alkalosis

- Headache

- Muscle pain and twitching

- Nausea or vomiting

- Bradypnea

- Nervousness or restlessness

- Unpleasant taste

- Increased frequency in urination

- Tissue damage/necrosis secondary to extravasation

Administration and extravasation of sodium bicarbonate have been known to cause chemical cellulitis due to its basic properties and have resulted in tissue necrosis, ischemia, and tissue death at administration sites.

In large dose administrations, it is known to increase edema and is more commonly noted in those with renal insufficiency, given its clearance via the kidneys.Â This increase in tissue edema appears to be due to an excess hyperosmolar state developed during the administration of sodium bicarbonate resulting in fluid retention. This condition can be especially challenging to manage in those with underlying cardiovascular comorbidities, including those with heart failure with intravascular fluid management difficulties.
