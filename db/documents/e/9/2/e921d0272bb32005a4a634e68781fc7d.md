**Dose-related Adverse Effects**

- Orthostatic hypotension/syncope can occur, especially when combined with another antihypertensive, nitrates, or a PDE-5 inhibitor. 

- These adverse effects occur most commonly after the initial dose or following the reinitiation of therapy; this requires patients to follow a multistep titration regimen to avoid syncope.

**Common Adverse Effects**

- Dizziness

- Fatigue

- Headache

- Weakness

- Tachycardia

- Upper respiratory tract infection

- Edema

- Rhinitis

- Dyspnea

- Allergic reactions

In a research study, researchers randomly assigned a total of 3,047 men were randomly assigned to groups of a placebo, doxazosin, or combination therapy with finasteride. Adverse effects of orthostatic hypotension and dizziness occurred significantly more in the groups taking doxazosin and combination treatment compared to the placebo group. Rates of adverse effects were reported to peak at year one during a mean duration of 4.5 years of treatment.
