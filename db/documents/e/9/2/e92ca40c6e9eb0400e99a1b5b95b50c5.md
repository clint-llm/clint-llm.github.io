Histopathological studies are not often done due to the well known clinical features and relatively benign course of the disease. Under the microscope, the tissue will show the infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages along with edema. In a very small percentage of cases, episcleritis may be an initial manifestation of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. A histological sample of this tissue will look much different than one from a simple case of episcleritis. This tissue sample will include signs of granulomatous inflammation along with signs of collagen necrosis and vasculitis.
