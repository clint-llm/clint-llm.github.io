Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is an inherited porphyria resulting in the accumulation of protoporphyrins in red blood cells that causes acute, painful photosensitivity and potential liver disease. It typically presents in early childhood with immediate pain and crying upon exposure to bright sunlight. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of erythropoietic protoporphyria and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathogenesis of erythropoietic protoporphyria.
- Review the appropriate history and physical exam findings of erythropoietic protoporphyria.
- Outline the management options available for erythropoietic protoporphyria.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients presenting with erythropoietic protoporphyria.
