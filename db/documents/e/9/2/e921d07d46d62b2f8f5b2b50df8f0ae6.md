Cobalt toxicity is a relatively rare diagnosis and may be challenging to identify in the typical clinical setting, such as the emergency room or outpatient clinic. The signs and symptoms associated with toxicity are seen in many more commonly diagnosed diseases.

Primary care or emergency medicine clinicians are more likely to interact with patients presenting with acute complaints. Consultation with certified specialists in poison information (CSPI), medical toxicologists, or clinical toxicologists at the nearest poison control center is key in creating the best management plan for a patient as well as educating the rest of the interprofessional team about diagnosis and management, helping decrease potential patient morbidity and mortality.

The management of cobalt toxicity is based on case reports and animal studies. There is epidemiologic data on several outbreaks of toxicity as well as in the occupational setting, mainly in the context of pulmonary exposures (i.e., hard metal lung disease). There are no randomized control trials concerning treatment.
