Early childhood caries possesses a clear clinical picture; however, it could be mistaken with developmental defects including dental fluorosis, amelogenesis imperfecta, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. The patient's medical, demographic and dietary history would aid in ruling out these conditions. It is worth noting that early childhood caries could coexist with developmental defects, which favors ECC development.
