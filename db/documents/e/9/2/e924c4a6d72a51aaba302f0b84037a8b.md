Although the costocervical trunk commonly originates from the second part of the subclavian artery, it can originate from its third part or be absent en bloc. The two usual branches of the costocervical trunk include the deep cervical artery and the superior intercostal artery, which can arise independently from the subclavian artery if the trunk is absent. The superior intercostal artery can originate from the thyrocervical trunk or some of its branches like the inferior thyroid artery and the scapular artery. There are also reports that the superior intercostal artery can originate from the axillary artery, aortic arch, vertebral artery, or the second intercostal artery
