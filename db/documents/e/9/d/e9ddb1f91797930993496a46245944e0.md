The prevalence of farmer's lung can be reduced by the regular application of preventive measures, along with financial incentives. Farmworkers should be educated about processes such as efficient drying of cereals and hay before storage, using silage extensively, improving the ventilation of farm buildings, and introducing mechanical feeding systems. Individual farmworkers should also be taught how to spot the early symptoms of farmer's lung. All farmworkers should be encouraged to wear respirators and masks when handling moldy fodder.
