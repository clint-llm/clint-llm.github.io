The exact pathophysiology of congenital exotropia is not well known. But strabismus is very commonly seen to run in families, which points towards an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The exodeviations are related to the excessive divergence tone that may exceed the convergence tone, leading to drifting of eyes outwards.

In due course of time, these patients often progress to intermittent exotropia. In the stage of intermittent exotropia, eyes are well aligned most of the time and dissociate spontaneously, especially when the patient is daydreaming or physically or mentally exhausted. The next stage is of constant exotropia, in which the patient is not able to fuse at a single object with both his eyes at one point.
