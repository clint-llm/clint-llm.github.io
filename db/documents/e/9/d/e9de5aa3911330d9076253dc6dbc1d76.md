The most common complications of anterior nasal packing are pain with insertion or removal of the pack, rebleeding with pack removal, and failure to achieve hemostasis. Sanguineous nasolacrimal duct reflux manifested as bloody tears occurs rarely and is not a true complication, albeit one that patients may find distressing. Other complications of anterior nasal packing include but are not limited to excoriation or pressure necrosis of the nasal mucosa, infections such as sinusitis or toxic shock syndrome, migration of the packing, and aspiration.

Posterior nasal packing increases the risk of airway obstruction and can induce a nasopulmonary reflex manifesting as bradycardia or respiratory depression due to increased nasopharyngeal pressure;Â patients are often admitted for continuous pulse oximetry. Excessive pressure in the nasopharynx may also result in necrosis of the soft palate, the prevention of which requires frequent examination.
