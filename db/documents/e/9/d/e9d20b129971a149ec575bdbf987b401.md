A broad range of clinical expertise plays a role in the treatment of cancer. Medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, specialists of involved systems (i.e., urologists in prostate cancer), and supporting staff all play a role in optimizing treatments and outcomes based on patients’ needs and wishes. Proper monitoring, managing adverse events and acquired comorbidities, counseling, and education on the various treatment options and all they entail can all be considered interprofessional responsibilities. An oncology-specialized pharmacist should be part of the treatment team to verify dosing and potential drug interactions, along with oncology-trained nursing staff trained in the administration of chemotherapy agents and awareness of possible adverse effects. The delivery of patient-centered care requires active coordination and regular correspondence between multiple disciplines of care.
