Histopathologic examination of EV lesions shares many characteristics of verruca-type lesions. Hyperkeratosis and parakeratosis, acanthosis with koilocytic cellular atypia and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm are characteristic of EV type lesions. The histologic finding of "blue cells" are pathognomonic for HPV infected keratinocytes in EV, and the "blue" appearance of these cells can be used as an indication of EV related disease. This "blue" appearance refers to cells exhibiting pale blue cytoplasm with the presence of abundant basophilic keratohyalin granules.
