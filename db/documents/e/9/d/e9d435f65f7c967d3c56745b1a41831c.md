The role of oxygen therapy in the prevention of ROP is of crucial importance. There is a history of targeting SpO2 to reduce rates of ROP. In 2001, an observational study suggested that rates ROP could be decreased by using a lower SpO2 target without increasing the risk of death.

With such strong data suggesting that lowering SpO2 is an unacceptable solution for the problem of increasing rates of ROP, other solutions have been suggested. International data networks that monitor neonatal outcomes have demonstrated that Severe ROP is associated with financial investment, both within and between countries. Best practices in neonatal care include improved nutrition, infection control, pain control, temperature control, and supportive developmental care. These basic neonatal best care practices were outlined by Darlow et al. in 2019.
