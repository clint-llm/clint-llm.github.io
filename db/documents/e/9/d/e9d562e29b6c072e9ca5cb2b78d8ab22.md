Appropriate workup is important to exclude an underlying cutaneous or systemic disorder and the workup should be based on patient profile, clinical history, and physical examination for a better understanding of the underlying condition.

Thus, the numerous etiologies of koilonychia warrant proper workup including a thorough history regarding any other underlying medical issues, medications, surgery, family history, diet and lifestyle choices. After getting a detailed history, a review of systems and physical examination is a good start. Depending on the findings on physical examination, pertinent blood work can be ordered. For example, a CBC can tell you if the patient is anemic and give you information about the size and chromaticity of the red blood cells. If the patient is anemic, an iron panel can be ordered for further evaluation. If the CBC is negative, other blood workups can be ordered at the physician's discretion keeping in mind the underlying systemic condition.

Patients of PVS presenting with dysphagia and long-standing iron deficiency anemia should be evaluated with an esophagogram to rule out esophageal rings and webs as they may be sometimes missed on esophagogastroduodenoscopy.

In cases in which the cause is unknown even after blood investigations, the possibility of hereditary/familial koilonychia should be considered.
