Optic nerve sheath decompression, more commonly known as optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF), is a surgical procedure performed to decompress the optic nerves by creating a window in the optic nerve sheath to release CSF from the subarachnoid space around the optic nerve. It is performed to alleviate vision-threatening papilledema or swelling of the optic nerve in the setting of elevated intracranial pressure. This procedure is generally done for patients with pseudotumor cerebri, a condition associated with elevated intracranial pressure and papilledema, or patients with progressive vision loss that are non-responsive or non-adherent therapy. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and complications of optic nerve decompression and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of papilledema.
- Describe the role of optic nerve sheath fenestration in preventing progressive vision loss in the setting of elevated intracranial pressure. 
- Describe the potential complications of optic nerve sheath fenestration.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to optimize outcomes for patients with optic nerve compression.
