Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) represent a valid electrophysiological tool in neurological pathologies. VEPs are the expression of the electrical activity of the visual pathways up to the optic nerve to the calcarine cortex. These potentials provide a non-invasive exploration method of the functionality of the human visual system through detecting neuronal pool activity responding to stimuli independently of the consciousness and attention state of the patient. VEPs have a clinical application in ophthalmological retinal pathology and neurological pathology related to the optic nerve and/or brain. VEPs have been used as an alternative method to assess visual acuity in non-verbal infants and adults with low intellectual abilities or potential malingerers and for surgical intra-operative monitoring. This activity describes the role of this instrumental examination in the diagnosis and follow-up of neurological and ophthalmological pathologies by the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the main type of VEPs used in studying neurological pathologies affecting the visual pathways.
- Identify the main degenerative disease explored by VEPs.
- Explain VEPs alterations in multiple sclerosis.
- Summarize the technical principles of VEPs.
