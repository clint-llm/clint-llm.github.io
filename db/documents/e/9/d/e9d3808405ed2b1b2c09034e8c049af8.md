**Epidural Hematoma**

Patients with epidural hematoma report a history of a focal head injury such as blunt trauma from a hammer or baseball bat, fall, or motor vehicle collision. The classic presentation of an epidural hematoma is a loss of consciousness after the injury, followed by a lucid interval then neurologic deterioration. This classic presentation only occurs in less than 20% of patients. Other symptoms that are common include severe headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, and seizure.

**Subdural Hematoma**

A history of either major or minor head injury can often be found in cases of subdural hematoma. In older patients, a subdural hematoma can occur after trivial head injuries including bumping of the head on a cabinet or running into a door or wall. An acute subdural can present with recent trauma, headache, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, seizure, and/or lethargy. A chronic subdural hematoma can present with a headache, nausea, vomiting, confusion, decreased consciousness, lethargy, motor deficits, aphasia, seizure, or personality changes. A physical exam may demonstrate a focal motor deficit, neurologic deficits, lethargy, or altered consciousness.

**Subarachnoid Hemorrhage**

A thunderclap headache (sudden severe headache or worst headache of life) is the classic presentation of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Other symptoms include dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diplopia, seizures, loss of consciousness, or nuchal rigidity. Physical exam findings may include focal neurologic deficits, cranial nerve palsies, nuchal rigidity, or decreased or altered consciousness.

**Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage**

Non-traumatic intraparenchymal hemorrhages typically present with a history of sudden onset of stroke symptoms including a headache, nausea, vomiting, focal neurologic deficits, lethargy, weakness, slurred speech, syncope, vertigo, or changes in sensation.
