Treatment of low urinary citrate is targeted, when possible, on the underlying etiology, such as improving dietary intake and stopping carbonic anhydrase-inhibiting medications. When this is not possible, or the cause is idiopathic, treatment is primarily by oral urinary alkalinizing medications.

Dietary measures alone can help raise urinary citrate levels, but very large amounts are usually required for any significant improvement.

Calcium citrate has not been adequately evaluated as a urinary citrate booster, although it is recommended as a calcium supplement due to its increased solubility compared to other calcium boosters. Its overall effect on stone production is relatively neutral. Any worsening of hypercalciuria is offset by increased urinary citrate levels and the intestinal oxalate binding effect of its free calcium.

**Potassium citrate supplementation is generally the treatment of choice for hypocitraturia.**Dietary measures alone are often insufficient and require very large quantities to affect significant improvements. Potassium citrate decreases the supersaturation ratio of calcium oxalate without significantly increasing the supersaturation of calcium phosphate.

Sodium citrate products and sodium bicarbonate have significant alkalinizing effects, but the excess sodium increases hyperuricosuria and worsens hypercalciuria.

Citrate absorption will depend on renal and gastrointestinal factors such as intestinal transit time, GI bypass surgery, and other absorptive characteristics and the presence and degree of any underlying metabolic and renal disorders such as acidosis, medullary sponge kidney, and renal failure. Potassium citrate therapy, while still useful, should be used somewhat cautiously in patients with struvite (triple phosphate or infection) stones, which generally require alkaline urine to grow.

Potassium citrate tablets are available in 5, 10, and 15 mEq dosages. These tablets are typically designed using a wax matrix for slow release, so patients should be informed that if they see the whole tablets appear in the stool, it does not mean the medication is not working.

Potassium citrate supplementation should be titrated until optimal urinary citrate and pH levels are obtained. This can be difficult to achieve as it requires significant patient compliance to periodically repeat the 24 urine testing and continue taking medication multiple times daily for which no immediate benefit is seen or felt. There are also limitations based on patient tolerance due to GI upset or just physically being able to swallow many relatively large tablets. Patient compliance is a serious issue, with 48% of patients stopping therapy in long-term studies due to cost and side effects.

The amount of citrate needed can be estimated from the following formula: 30 mEq of potassium citrate daily will increase urinary citrate by about 200 mg/24 hours. (Potassium citrate package insert.)

Serum potassium levels should be checked periodically, especially in patients with renal failure or a history of hyperkalemia. If patients develop hyperkalemia, no additional potassium should be administered. Sodium bicarbonate can be used to increase urinary citrate as it has no potassium and is quite inexpensive. Still, it also has a considerable sodium load, which can contribute to fluid retention and hypercalciuria. Besides its sodium load, sodium citrate has a minimal effect on calcium oxalate supersaturation compared to potassium citrate.

Liquid potassium citrate preparations are preferred in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients and those with short bowel syndrome, chronic diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as those who fail to respond adequately to potassium citrate tablets.

Some patients may develop gastrointestinal upset, abdominal discomfort, or diarrhea from potassium citrate supplementation. These side effects can be minimized by taking the potassium citrate with food or altering the form of the potassium citrate supplement.

Citrate supplements with lower potassium content are available. They include various combinations of potassium citrate, sodium citrate, magnesium citrate, citric acid, and sodium bicarbonate. There are several formulations available, both prescription and OTC. One popular formulation comes as a 10 mEq citrate packet. It contains 5 mEq of potassium citrate, 2.5 mEq of sodium bicarbonate, and 2.5 mEq of magnesium citrate. It has the equivalent citrate of a standard 10 mEq potassium citrate tablet with half the potassium content. It has other advantages, including better absorption, liquid formulation (so no large or difficult tablets to swallow), fewer overall side effects, lower cost, and no taste when consumed.

In distal renal tubular acidosis, treatment with potassium citrate directly corrects the metabolic acidosis, hypercalciuria, and hypokalemia while also reversing osteoporosis, halting nephrocalcinosis, and reducing calcium phosphate stone production. However, relatively large amounts of potassium citrate may be required.

Citrate also inhibits struvite stone formation despite an increase in pH due to its chelation effect on magnesium, complexing with calcium, and coating of struvite crystal surfaces.

About 20% of patients with hypocitraturia appear to be relatively resistant to citrate supplementation therapy. This is why a follow-up 24-hour urine test is recommended for all patients placed on potassium citrate therapy, as this "resistant" group will require more aggressive medical treatment to achieve optimal urinary citrate and pH levels.

Like uric acid stones, cystine becomes progressively more soluble in urine as the pH increases. Cystine stone formers generally require a urinary pH of at least 7, with 7.5 being "optimal." This may require very high levels of potassium citrate, up to 3 or 4 mg/kg/day, in divided doses.

Potassium magnesium citrate may be superior to potassium citrate alone in increasing urinary citrate and pH as well as kidney stone prevention.

**Suggested Recommended Therapy Targets for Hypocitraturic Stone Formers**

Optimal urinary citrate levels for most stone formers should be at least 640 mg/24 hours or 320 mg/L. (There is no direct harm in having higher urinary citrate levels as long as the urinary pH and serum potassium levels are acceptable.)

For calcium stone formers, the optimal urine pH is 6 to 6.5. For uric acid stone prophylaxis, maintenance therapy is generally considered optimal at a urinary pH of 6.5, regardless of the total citrate level.

For cystine stone formers, the optimal urinary pH is 7.5. As this may be hard to achieve, a pH of at least 7 is necessary to allow a reasonable solubility of 250 mg of cystine/liter of urine. (This goes up to 500 mg/liter at a pH of 7.5.)

Urinary pH levels above 7.2 are not generally recommended (except in cystinuria), as this will tend to promote calcium phosphate precipitation.
