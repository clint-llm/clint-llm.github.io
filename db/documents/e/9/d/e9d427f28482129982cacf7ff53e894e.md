CLinicians using epidural morphine and intravenous morphine should exercise extreme caution in patients with respiratory conditions such as COPD, acute bronchial asthma, or upper airway obstruction since it can further decrease the respiratory drive. Additionally, practitioners should avoid using morphine in cases of previous allergy or hypersensitivity reaction to morphine or other opioids. Since the epidural administration of morphine reduces gastroduodenal motility, clinicians should avoid using it in patients with confirmed or suspected paralytic ileus. Any absolute contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia, including coagulopathy, infection at the puncture site, or patient refusal, are also contraindications to spinal or epidural opioids.
