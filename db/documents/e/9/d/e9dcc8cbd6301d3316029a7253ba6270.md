Microtrauma, whether through repetitive use or compression forces, results in inflammation and injury of the flexor tendon-sheath complex. The greatest degree of force occurs on the A1 pulley, and hence, this is the one that is most commonly affected. Inflammation, over time, results in the tendon sticking within its sheath and is perceived by the patient as locking. Because the flexor tendon apparatus has superior strength, compared to the extensor tendon apparatus, patients classically do not have difficulty flexing their fingers. However, the inflammation causes the flexor tendon to catch in the flexor sheath during extension, and patients will notice locking when they attempt to extend their fingers.
