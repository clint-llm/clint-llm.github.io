ABG is recommended for evaluating a patient’s ventilatory, acid-base, and oxygenation status.

Rigorous quality control of the automated blood gas analyzers is also necessary for accurate results. However, advances in machine performance and quality assurance have now made most errors, in point of care analysis, of ABG’s attributable to clinical providers.

The American Association for Respiratory Care has published Clinical Care Guidelines for Blood Gas Analysis and Hemoximetry that provides current best practices for sampling, handling, and analyzing ABG’s.
