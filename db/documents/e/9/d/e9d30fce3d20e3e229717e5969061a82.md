The pathophysiology of MS is limited to the primary CNS. Two fundamental processes constitute general pathological process seen in MS patients:

- Focal inflammation resulting in macroscopic plaques and injury to the blood-brain barrier (BBB)

- Neurodegeneration with microscopic injury involving different components of the CNS including axons, neurons, and synapse

Together, these two primary processes result in macroscopic and microscopic injury. Lesions referred to as plaques occur in waves throughout the disease course and result from focal inflammation. MS plaques predominantly center around small veins and venules and show sharp margins. Myelin loss, edema, and axonal injury are the chief components of plaque pathology. BBB disruption during active plaque inflammation corresponds to enhancement seen on MRI. Over time, the inflammatory process subsides, resulting in an astrocytic scar.

Microscopically MS lesions show mononuclear infiltrate with perivenular cuffing and surrounding white matter infiltration. Monocytes and macrophages, which represent innate immunity, stimulate T-cell migration across the BBB. The overall net result is an injury to the BBB and the entry of systemic immune cells. Activation of microglia, the main antigen-presenting cells of the primary CNS, often precedes cell entry. CNS injury results in the initiation of cytotoxic activities of microglia with the release of nitrous oxide and other superoxide radicals. Recently, there has been a greater understanding of the critical role of B cells and antibody production in the pathogenesis of MS.
