Inferior vena cava syndrome (IVCS) is not a primary diagnosis, but rather a diagnosis of exclusion. It mimics a variety ofÂ etiologies, and the signs and symptoms can overlap with other lethal conditions. So a prompt diagnosis can prevent significant morbidity and mortality. In addition to imaging, a thorough history and physical examination are vital to the diagnosis of IVCS. Although IVCS can predispose to thrombus formation, it protects against pulmonary embolism coming from the lower limbs deep vein thrombosis.
