The exact etiology of breast milk jaundice has not been determined (idiopathic). In early-onset breastmilk jaundice that is visible on assessment in the first 2-3 days, the causes are closely related to other causes of physiologic jaundice such as dehydration or delayed stool, and are difficult to differentiate. Most of the proposed etiologies of late-onset breastmilk jaundice beginning at 4 to 5 days or later, involve the factors present in the human breast milk itself. Another area of investigation into the causes of neonatal jaundice has been the potential genetic mutations present in the affected neonates.

Some factors in human breast milk that may be related to the etiology of breast milk jaundice include proteins and enzymes thought to inhibit the conjugation of bilirubin that allows for its excretion. ÃŸ-glucuronidase is an enzyme naturally present in the body that deconjugates bilirubin in the intestinal brush border, leading to increased unconjugated bilirubin levels.

Several studies have shown that mutations in the coding region of the UGT1A1 gene increase the risk of developing breast milk jaundice. Mutations in this gene's regulatory region are known to cause Crigler-Najjar and Gilbert syndrome, two syndromes known to cause persistent hyperbilirubinemia
