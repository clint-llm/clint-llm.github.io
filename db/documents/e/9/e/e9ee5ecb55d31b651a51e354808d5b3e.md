The children undergoing surgery should be started on topical steroids, either prednisolone 1% or dexamethasone 0.1% 8/7/6/5/4/3/2/1 for one week each in tapering doses. In addition, a topical antibiotic in the form of tobramycin 0.3% or 0.3% moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin four times per day for 20 days should be supplemented to prevent secondary infection. These patients will need close follow-ups post-surgery to look for any signs of hypotony, inflammation, or infection. Moreover, the intraocular pressures need to be recorded every 3Â to 4 months for at least two years post-surgery.

Cycloplegic refraction will be needed every six months for these patients. Moreover, lifelong regular follow-up is needed every six months for intraocular pressure monitoring and early detection of any surgery-related complications. Cases failing angle or filtration surgery should be counseled for the need of GDD and risk of subsequent failure, amblyopia, blindness, and phthisis bulbi.
