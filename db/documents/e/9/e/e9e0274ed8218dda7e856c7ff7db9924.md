The suspected diagnosis dictates relevant laboratory testing.

For example, if Cushing syndrome is suspected, then evidence of hypercortisolemia is sought. This can be achieved by measurement of evening plasma cortisol and or salivary cortisol, and a 24-hour urine free cortisol. Also useful are plasma ACTH levels to identify the site of the lesion and the cortisol responses to dexamethasone suppression as detailed recently.

If primary hyperaldosteronism is suspected since the patient has hypokalemic alkalosis and hypertension, then the measurement of the plasma aldosterone (PAC) coupled with the aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR) is the most useful screening tests. PAC is generallyÂ greater than 15 ng/dl and the ARR greater than 30.

If a pheochromocytoma is suspected, measurement of plasma or urine metanephrines is the test of choice.

In the commonest form of adreno-genital syndrome due to a deficiency of 21-hydroxylase resulting in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency and ambiguous genitalia in females and iso-sexual precocity in males, the most useful test is 17-OH-progesterone levels.
