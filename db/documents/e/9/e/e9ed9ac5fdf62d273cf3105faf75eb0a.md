Transitional zones of the spine have a characteristic higher degree of flexibility and degrees of motion; however, this can make these segments more prone to injury. The thoracolumbar region is a fulcrum between the more rigid thoracic segment with facets that are coronally oriented to prevent flexion-extension, translation, and rotation and the lumbar segment whose facets are oriented sagittally to allow flexion-extension movement.

The kinetic energy conveyed to this region can make it vulnerable to degenerative disease pathologies and traumatic injuries in higher energy mechanisms.
