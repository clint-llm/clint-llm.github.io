**Opioid Safety**

Opioids can be associated with significant morbidity if not handled appropriately. On the other hand, they can be a great tool to control postoperative pain when used correctly in the appropriate patient. In the in-patient and out-patient setting, it is important to constantly reassess patient pain and make changes to the pain regimen accordingly. It is particularly important in the in-patient setting that a sedation status be performed before and after administration of each opioid medication or other medications with sedating effects, for that matter. This is recommended in the clinical practice guidelines by Hsu et al.

Pasero designed an opioid sedation scale to help monitor patients and guide medication regimen changes in the in-patient setting.
