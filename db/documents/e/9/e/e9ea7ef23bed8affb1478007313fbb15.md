Giving allergy immunotherapy should be given with tremendous care since it involves administering an agent that a patient is already known to be allergic to. Complications due to immunotherapy include systemic reactions such as anaphylaxis, large cutaneous reactions, and a local reaction at the injection site.

**Management of Complications**

- Topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, or cool compresses for local reaction

- Epinephrine is the mainstay treatment for anaphylaxis.

The physician should re-visit the benefit versus risk of continuing immunotherapy after systemic reactions.
