The popliteal artery branches into the anterior tibial artery and the tibiofibular trunk, with the tibiofibular trunk branching into the fibular artery and the posterior tibial artery. The anterior tibial and fibular arteries provide blood supply to the lateral leg compartment structures.

The blood supply of the lateral leg compartment is described below going proximally to distally

- The anterior tibial artery gives off the superior lateral fibular artery and the inferior lateral fibular artery, which supply the proximal fibularis muscles.

- The fibular artery gives off branches which supply the distal portions of the fibularis muscles.

- Small branches arise from the anterior tibial artery and fibular artery to supply the proximal fibularis tendons, while small branches of the anterior tibial artery supply the distal fibularis tendons.
