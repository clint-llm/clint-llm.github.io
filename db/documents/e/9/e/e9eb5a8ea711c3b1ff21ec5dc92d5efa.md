Balanitis is usually seen in uncircumcised males. There will be white or erythematous areas on the glans penis or foreskin. Phimosis may be seen as the condition progresses. Mattioli et al. show in their study that 15% of the foreskins studied showed hypospadias.

Malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma occurs in 3% to 6% of females and 2% to 8% of males.

Psoriasis is a chronic disease with red pruritic patches that can arise anywhere on the body. This condition is not contagious. It is an immune condition where skin cells turn over at an increased rate. Plaques are commonly seen and can present on the penis.

Contact dermatitis can arise anywhere on the boys and presents as a pruritic, erythematous area caused by contact with a particular substance. The affected area can look like a red rash with cracked skin.

Plasma cell balanitis, or Zoon balanitis, is a benign condition that usually presents in older men. The patient usually presents with a flat red plaque that sometimes has associated smaller red marks. Diagnosis requires a biopsy.

Leukoplakia can present very similarly to lichen sclerosis, where the plaque is white and flat. There can be a malignant transformation in this condition. Typically, it is the result of chronic irritation between the glans and foreskin.

Lichen sclerosus can be diagnosed based on clinical findings. A biopsy can be performed to rule out differential causes of symptoms. In patients who have lesions in the urethral, a cystoscopy to directly visualize the extent of the disease is warranted.
