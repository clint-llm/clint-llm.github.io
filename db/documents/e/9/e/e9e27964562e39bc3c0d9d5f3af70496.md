Ongoing research aims to define the role of ICBN integrity as it relates to patient quality of life. Previous studies have described a decreased quality of life secondary to postoperative neuropathic pain as a result of ICBN obliteration. However, a recent study by Saleh et al. concluded that only axillary dissection impacted the quality of life. The study involved three groups: one group had preservation of the ICBN and no ALND, the second had the protection of ICBN with ALND, and the third had no preservation of ICBN in addition to ALND. Results showed only patients with both ICBN disruption and axillary node dissection to have an altered quality of life.

In another study by Orsolya et al., quality of life was improved in patients with protected ICBN versus patients with complete transection of the nerve.

High-resolution ultrasound (HRU) is an option for locating the intercostobrachial nerve in the axillary area.
