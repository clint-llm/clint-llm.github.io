MCL remains a largely incurable disease with a median overall survival (OS) ranging from 1.8 to 9.4 years, depending on whether it is aggressive or indolent MCL. The choice of optimal treatment usually has its basis in the aggressiveness of the disease, performance status, age, and mantle cell international prognostic index (MIPI) score since there is no curative standard treatment established for MCL.

Indolent forms of MCL with low MIPI score, hypermutated IGH genes, SOX11 negativity, and non-complex karyotype may be monitored without immediate treatment. As such, watch and wait is appropriate in patients who have 1) Ki-67 = 30%, 2) maximum tumor diameter less than 3 cm, normal serum LDH level, 4) normal beta-2 microglobulin level, 5) no B symptoms, and 6) non-blastoid histology.

It is rare to find early stage I or non-bulky stage II that can be treated by involved field radiation alone or with nonaggressive regimens used for transplant-ineligible patients.

Symptomatic patients with classic MCL (aggressive MCL) that need treatments (Stage II bulky or stage III or stage IV can be classified as stem cell transplant eligible or nontransplant eligible based on performance status and comorbidities.

Aggressive chemo regimens used: RCHOP alternating with RDHAP; or NORDIC regimen ( Maxi RCHOP alternating with Rituximab and high dose Cytarabine or

Hyper-CVAD that includes a CHOP-like regimen alternating with high dose methotrexate and cytarabine

Once in CR or very good PR, autologous stem cell transplant is recommended

R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, prednisone), BR (bendamustine, rituximab), R-DHAP (rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin), hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone alternating with high dose methotrexate and high dose cytarabine)

Patients with relapsed or refractory disease require more aggressive treatment, which is typically a salvage regimen followed by HDC and autologous or allogeneic SCT. Other second-line targeted agents with fewer side effects that are now FDA approved include

Inhibit constitutively activated B cell receptor (BCR) signaling through inhibiting BTK downstream from BCR in mantle cell and also  immunomodulatory effects on T cells

Acalubritinib and  zanubrutinib bind to cysteine 481 of BTK and irreversibly inhibits target BTK; they have less action on off-targets

Ibrutinib: ORR 66%, PFS 12.3 months, OS 25 months

Acalubritinb PFS 20 months OS not reached at 26 month follow-up

Zanubrutinib ORR 84%

Acalubritinib and zanubrutinib are not effective for BTK C481 S mutation

Venetoclax approval based on Phase I ORR 75%, CR 21% in patients not previously on BTK inhibitors

Approved in combination with rituximab or ibrutinib

In relapsed MCL not exposed to BTK inhibitors, single-agent bortezomib OS 23.5 months, the median time to progression 6.7 months
