Patients with impending or pathologic fractures secondary to skeletal malignancy or metastasis require an interprofessional diagnostic work-up and treatment approach. All patients should undergo proper diagnosis and staging of the malignancy. Close attention should be paid to abnormal laboratory values or other comorbidities secondary to the malignancy that may require intervention. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy should be initiated when indicated. Surgical treatment should be devised to individually suit the patient and lesion with the goal of early mobilization and return to function. Overall, a patient-centered approach should be utilized.
