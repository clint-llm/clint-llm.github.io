Optimizing care of infants with BPD requires an interprofessional team approach that includes a neonatologist, nurses, pediatric pulmonologist, respiratory therapist, nutritionist, physical and occupational therapists, social worker and child life specialist. Training of the parent prior to discharge is critical. At the time of transition from hospital to home, adequate discharge planning is essential with setting up follow appointments and making sure parents have all the supplies necessary for taking care of their child.
