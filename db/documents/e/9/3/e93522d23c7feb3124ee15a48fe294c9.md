This test is performed when the physician suspects acute or chronic inflammation (e.g., SLE or rheumatoid arthritis [RA]) or infection. The utility of the hs-CRP for cardiac screening is debatable. There is some correlation between cardiovascular risk and elevated hs-CRP, but the application of this is still controversial especially given the poor specificity of this test, and it is currently undergoing more evaluation.
