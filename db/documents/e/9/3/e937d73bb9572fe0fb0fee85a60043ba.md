METÂ is contraindicated in patients who may not tolerate the added exertion or be able to actively participate in the treatment, such as critically ill, post-surgical patients, and those at an increased risk of bleeding. Patients with impaired integrity of bones, joints, and/or tendons should be considered as a relative contraindication to MET.
