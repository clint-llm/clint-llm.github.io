The prognosis of renal cysts varies widely with their etiology. Simple Bosniak type I cysts have a less than 1% chance of malignancy whereas Bosniak type IV cysts have a significant chance of harboring malignancy with a concomitantly worse prognosis. In recessive (pediatric) polycystic kidney disease approximately 30% of patients will not survive their first week of life and patients surviving beyond that will require lifelong dialysis or kidney transplant while also often having cystic liver disease. Dominant (adult) polycystic kidney disease has a variable onset but if it progresses to end-stage renal disease then the patient will require dialysis or kidney transplant.
