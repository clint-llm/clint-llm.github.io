Many hematologic disorders involve disrupted erythropoiesis and erythrocyte maturation, which introduces the potential for basophilic stippling on peripheral smears. Coarse basophilic stippling is always clinically significant. Fine basophilic stippling may be seen artifactually, as well as in a variety of clinical instances mentioned below.Â  Classically, coarse basophilic stippling is associated with heavy metal toxicity with a predominant emphasis on lead poisoning. Lead toxicity is attributed to coarse-appearing basophilic stippling due to inhibition of pyrimidine-5'-nucleotidase, thereby preventing degradation of ribosomal RNA in circulating erythrocytes.

Supporting clinical history classically entails environmental or occupational exposure to lead. Basophilic stippling can occur in cases of lead intoxication secondary to foreign bodies such as bullet fragments and retained shrapnel in active-duty military personnel.

Patients with anemia secondary to hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease can exhibit basophilic stippling that may be finer in appearance than observed in lead toxicity.

Megaloblastic anemia due to vitamin B12/folate deficiency or chronic alcohol use disorder can present with basophilic stippling as well.
