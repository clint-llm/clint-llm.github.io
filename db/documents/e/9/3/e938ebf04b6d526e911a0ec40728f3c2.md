As discussed above, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease has different phenotypes. Therefore, the differential diagnosis should be based on the clinical presentation and may include gout, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and erosive osteoarthritis.

The intra-articular radiological calcification seen in patients with CPPD is characteristic. In knee x-rays, chondrocalcinosis presents as a thin dense intraarticular opacification that runs parallel and separated from the bone cortex or as a calcifying opacification in the menisci.

Diagnosis of CPPD is presumed in patients with symptomatic joint disease who present the characteristic radiological findings of chondrocalcinosis.
