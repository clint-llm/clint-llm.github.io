Aspergillus species are molds that are present ubiquitously in the environment, especially in the organic matter. There are over 100 species worldwide, but most of the illness is caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus clavatus. An infection by Aspergillus species causes a broad spectrum of illnesses in humans and depends on the immune status of the host, ranging from hypersensitivity reactions to direct angioinvasion.

Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common ubiquitous airborne fungus causative organism for ABPA.

ABPA affects people who are asthmatic or have cystic fibrosis and are allergic to Aspergillus. The thick mucus in the airways of these patients makes it difficult to clear up the Aspergillus spores when inhaled. Genetic association:Â HLA-DR molecules DR2, DR5, and possibly DR4 or DR7 contribute to susceptibility; whereas, HLA-DQ2 contributes to resistance, and a combination of these may determine the outcome of ABPA in CF and asthma.
