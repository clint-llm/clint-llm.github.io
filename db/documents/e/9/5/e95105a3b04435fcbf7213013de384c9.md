Advance directives are legal documents that are completed in advance of the need for major medical decisions to specify which healthcare options are or are not desired, at present or in the future, and to designate an individual(s) who will speak on the patient's behalf if the patient cannot speak for his or herself. Variations in advance directive laws exist by state. Many states now have Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST), Medical Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST), Medical Orders for Scope of Treatment (MOST), Physician Order for Scope of Treatment (POST), Do Not Resuscitate Order/Clinician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (DNR/COLST), Transportable Physician Orders for Patient Preferences (TPOPP), or similar directives that put the salient points of the advance directive in the form of a medical order.
