Natural killer cells present a distinct group of circulating lymphocytes on the peripheral blood smear. On Wright-Giemsa-staining, they are visible as large granular lymphocyte morphology. They possess large nuclei containing coarse chromatin and prominent nuclei. Their abundant basophilic cytoplasm contains plenty of azurophilic granules that are negative for peroxidase staining.
