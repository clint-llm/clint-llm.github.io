The prognosis of NSCLC is dependent on the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging, and the performance status/comorbidities of the patient. Patients with poor performance status are associated with shortened survival. Poor appetite and weight loss are also poor prognostic signs.

Metabolic activity on PET scan has been shown to have a poor prognosis in stages I-IV NSCLC.
