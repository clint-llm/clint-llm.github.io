Malaria is a mosquito-borne infection caused by the parasite Plasmodia. It is present in most of the tropical areas all over the world. It manifests initially with nonspecific symptoms such as headache, malaise, fever, muscle aches, etc. These symptoms often occur at regular intervals coinciding with the erythrocytic stage. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of malaria and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the different plasmodia species in the etiology of malaria.
- Review the life cycle of Plasmodium ovale in the pathophysiology of malaria.
- Identify blood smear microscopy as a diagnostic method of choice in malaria.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by malaria.
