The current most effective therapy in these tumors is triple therapy, which is surgical resection plus radiation and chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy varies with each protocol, but a combination of vincristine, cisplatinum, cyclophosphamide, etoposide is common. Bevacizumab is used to block the vascular endothelial growth factor. Intrathecal methotrexate and topotecan can be included in the treatment protocol. Myeloablative chemotherapy has been used in some cases, followed by hematogenic stem cell rescue.
