A universal goniometer has three parts.

A body- It is designed like a protractor and may form a full or a half-circle. It has a scale for the measurement of the angle. The scale can extend either from 0 to 180 degrees or 180 to 0 degrees for half circle models or 0 to 360 degrees on full circle models. The intervals on the scales can vary from 1 to 10 degrees.

The fulcrum â€“ It is a screw at the center of the body that allows the moving arm to move freely in the body of the device. The screw-like device can be tightened to fix the moving arm in a particular position or loosened to permit free movement.

The fulcrum and the body are placed over the joint being measured.

The stationary arm is the arm of the goniometer that aligns with the inactive part of the joint measured. It is structurally a part of the body and is not movable independently of the body.

The moving arm is the arm of the goniometer, which aligns with the mobile part of the joint measured.
