Thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) is a serine protease inhibitor produced in the liver. It belongs to the SERPINA7 family. The encoding gene for this protein is on the long arm of the X chromosome and as such, inherited forms of TBG tend to follow an X-linked pattern. Approximately 27 different mutations have been identified to play a role in the etiology of the inherited form of complete TBG deficiency thus far. These mutations seem to be caused by a nucleotide substation or by a frameshift.  Missense mutations have been the only type identified so far in an inherited form of partial TBG deficiency.

Acquired forms of TBG deficiency are attributable to degradation and altered synthesis of the molecule. Patients with hyperthyroidism have been found to have an increase in the rate of turnover of TBG.  In terminal illness, interleukin-6 seems to play a role in altering the levels of TBG. Levels of TBG have been found to vary with fluctuations in sex hormones as well.  For example, estrogen has been known to cause an increase in TBG, while androgens have been found to decrease levels TBG.
