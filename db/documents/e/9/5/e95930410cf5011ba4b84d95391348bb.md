There are multiple pathologies that can result in hearing loss following trauma. They can be divided into those that cause conductive loss and those that cause sensorineural loss. In the case of stapediovestibular subluxation, a mixed hearing loss can be seen. More than one pathology can co-exist.

Conductive hearing loss:

- Hemotympanum

- Tympanic membrane perforation

- Ossicular chain dislocation

Sensorineural hearing loss:

- Post-traumatic inner ear hemorrhage

- Perilymphatic fistula

- Endolymphatic hydrops

- Stapediovestibular subluxation
