A nephrologist should be consulted for the evaluation of a patient in terms of:

- Differential diagnosis of the renal disease

- Indication for renal biopsy

- Requirement for hemodialysis

- Plasmapheresis

As these patients may present with serious and life-threatening pulmonary complications, a pulmonologist should be consulted to guide therapy.

A surgeon's assistance may also be needed when vascular access is needed for hemodialysis or plasmapheresis.
