Specialty care can be helpful in the rapid diagnosis and treatment of AUB-O. Most patients can be reasonably managed in the primary care setting. AnÂ OBGYN consult is necessary for cases with structural pathology or when surgical management is warranted. OBGYN consultation is also appropriate in patients with AUB-O who wish to conceive. A hematology-oncology referral is appropriate for patients with a known or suspected underlying bleeding disorder.
