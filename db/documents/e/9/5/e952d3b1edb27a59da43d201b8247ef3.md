Most underwater injuries are due to barotrauma. Barosinusitis occurs during rapid descent or increases in pressure twice as often as during ascent. Barotrauma occurs more readily in individuals with preexisting upper respiratory pathology or infections. Individuals who have a history of middle ear or sinus barotrauma are more likely to experience recurrent episodes and symptoms. Some common risk factors for barosinusitis include allergic rhinitis, bacterial sinusitis, viral upper respiratory infections, nasal polyps, and idiopathic sinus congestion. There has not been a proven correlation between sinus squeeze and septal deviation, alcohol, or tobacco use.
