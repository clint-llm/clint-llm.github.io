The following have been implicated in false-positive AFP results:

- Two weeks after radiodiagnosis involving the use of radioactive tracers

- Multiple gestations

- Gestational diabetes

- Cigarette smoking

- Race (slightly higher levels in black women and lower in women of Asian descent as compared to whites)

- AFP levels are also adjusted for weight

- Amniotic fluid specimens contaminated with fetal blood may exhibit abnormally high AFP values, which may lead to misinterpretation of test results.

- Human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA)

**Human Anti-mouse Antibodies (HAMA)**

Specimens from patients who have received preparations of mouse monoclonal antibodies may contain human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), which may give falsely high results. Results must always be considered concerning the clinical situation and previous results. This is particularly important when serial results are used to monitor a patient’s response to treatment.
