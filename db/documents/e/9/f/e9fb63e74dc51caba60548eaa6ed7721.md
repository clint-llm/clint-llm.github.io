Patients with advanced mitral valve stenosis may need to limit their activity to prevent overtaxing their hearts. Patients may also be given certain dietary restrictions, such as a low-sodium diet.

All patients with mitral valve stenosis, regardless of severity, may require medications to prevent complications like strokes, hypertension, and heart failure; these are usually necessary for the individual's lifespan, and the importance of medication adherence must be stressed to these patients.
