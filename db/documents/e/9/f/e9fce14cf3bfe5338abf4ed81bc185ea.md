Patients with exotropia need careful and detailed assessment by an optometrist and an ophthalmologist. Evaluation of binocular vision, stereopsis, control of fusion are essential to decide the management plan for the patient. The patient might need the pediatrician and psychologist's assessment to help deal with the social stigma associated with strabismus.

Genetic consultations are essential, particularly when parents have further family plans, as exotropia like other squints runs in families. These patients might present first to primary health care, a nurse, or an optometrist. All these professionals need to be aware of the condition's usual presentations and should be able to give parents gross insights about the disease and further prognosis.

The orthoptist would be responsible for keeping track of the stereopsis binocular vision. Progressive deterioration in the distance stereopsis is often the first indication of surgical intervention. Further, appropriate referrals should be made to the ophthalmologists, who should then do a detailed examination and take charge of managing the patient. Interprofessional care is needed to follow up with the patients. The nurses and counselors would ensure correct usage of postoperative drops, compliance with glasses, and orthoptic exercises advised to the patient.
