Type II hypersensitivity reaction refers to an antibody-mediated immune reaction in which antibodies (IgG or IgM) are directed against cellular or extracellular matrix antigens, resulting in cellular destruction, functional loss, or damage to tissues. Damage can occur through multiple mechanisms. This activity defines the involved pathogenic mechanisms, the clinical presentations, evaluation, and management of common forms of type II hypersensitivity reactions and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the immune pathogenesis of type II hypersensitivity reactions.
- Review the evaluation of the most common forms of type II hypersensitivity reactions.
- Outline the various treatment options for the most common forms of type II hypersensitivity reaction.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with a type II hypersensitivity reaction.
