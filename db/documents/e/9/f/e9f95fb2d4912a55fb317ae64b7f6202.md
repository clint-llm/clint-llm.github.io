Chronic pulmonary thromboembolic hypertension is a rare, dangerous, but potentially curable, thromboembolic disease. The lack of predictable predisposing factors, including a prior medical history of acute pulmonary embolism, should not discourage CTEPH from being included in the differential diagnosis of patients with a progressive reduction in exercise tolerance.

Key points:

CTEPH should be considered in all patients with pulmonary hypertension, as this is the only cause of PH that is potentially curable.

V/Q scan is a first-line screening tool for diagnosing CTEPH.

Diagnostic criteria for CTEPH include mPAP greater than 20 mm of Hg, PAWP less than 15 mm of Hg, elevated pulmonary vascular resistance over 3 Woods unit, and evidence of chronic pulmonary embolism on CT/MRI or V/Q scan.

Current medical treatment for CTEPH includes PAH-targeted therapy and oral anticoagulation.

The surgical treatment of choice in CTEPH patients is pulmonary endarterectomy.
