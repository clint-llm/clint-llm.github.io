The initial diagnosis and management of angioid streaks are primarily by the ophthalmologist, but follow up is usually done by the primary care provider and nurse practitioner. Angioid streaks are usually asymptomatic and do not need any treatment. However, these eyes are more prone to develop subretinal hemorrhage after trivial trauma and the clinical team, and specialty-trained ophthalmic nurse should educate the patient on the use of protective eyewear. Due to the rarity in the use of medications, a pharmacist with a background in ophthalmic medications should assist the practitioner in appropriate dosingÂ anti-VEGF agents are used.

All patients with angioid streaks should be screened for potential systemic associations. Examination of family members may give a clue to the systemic disease. Interprofessional collaboration is important for systemic associations including pseudoxanthoma elasticum and sickle cell disease. Various specialties to be included in the loop to manage a patient with pseudoxanthoma elasticum includes but may not be limited to gastroenterology, cardiology, neurology, pulmonary medicine, and genetics.
