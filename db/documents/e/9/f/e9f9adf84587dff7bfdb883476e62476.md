Baricitinib is contraindicated in patients with chronic kidney disease with GFR less than 30 mL/minute /1.73 m^2. It is not recommended for patients with severe hepatic impairment.

Patients with significant anemia with hemoglobin below 8mg/dL, lymphopenia with absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) less than 500 cells/mm^3, or neutropenia with absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1,000 cells/mm^3 should avoid Baricitinib until the counts recover.

Baricitinib should not be used in combination with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. Due to the lack of clinical data on human pregnancy and breastfeeding, it's been recommended to avoid its use during pregnancy and nursing.
