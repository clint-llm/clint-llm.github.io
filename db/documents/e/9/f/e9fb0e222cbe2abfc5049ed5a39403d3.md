If damage occurs to the posterior auricular nerve alone, either intentionally as part of a potential nerve graft or unintentionally as a complication of surgery, the patient will likely complain of difficulty moving the muscles with which it is associated.Â  As these muscles are mostly vestigial and unessential to quality of life, it is unlikely that it will impact the patient to any significant degree. As a branch of cranial nerve VII, the fibers of the posterior auricular nerve may also become paralyzed as part of greater facial nerve paralysis, such as in the case of Bell palsy.
