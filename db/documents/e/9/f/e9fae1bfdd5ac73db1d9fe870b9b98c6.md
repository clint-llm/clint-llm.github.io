The myth that shellfish allergy is secondary to iodine is still prevalent despite the dispelling ofÂ this false information in the literature. With that noted, any food allergy or a history of atopy is associated with an increased risk of reaction to contrast. Healthcare workers, including nurse practitioners, should always strive to get a thorough history of food and medication allergies and record it in the chart.
