Sickle cell trait is caused by abnormal hemoglobin called sickle hemoglobin or Hb S. Sickle hemoglobin is as a result of a point mutation in the beta globin chain. This point mutation replaces A with T at codon 6 of beta hemoglobin chain. This causes the switch from glutamic acid to valine amino acid. The valine-type hemoglobin causes red cells to sickle when exposed to a low oxygen threshold. Patient with sickle cell trait inherits HbS from one parent and HbA from the other parent making them heterozygous.
