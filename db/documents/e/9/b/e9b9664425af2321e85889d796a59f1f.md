Positional (non-synostotic) brachycephaly and/or plagiocephaly are the most common infant head shape abnormalities encountered in the primary health care setting. Parental reassurance and management with conservative measures such as repositioning education are usually sufficient, with improvements evident in most infants as they attain their developmental milestones.

Refractory cases of positional brachycephaly should be referred for helmet therapy, and any suspicious cases of craniosynostosis should be referred early for an opinion from an experienced craniofacial team. Early craniofacial referrals of synostotic brachycephaly may obviate the need for more extensive surgical interventions. Cosmetic outcomes following non-syndromic craniosynostosis repair are excellent for both open and endoscopic approaches with low redo rates.
