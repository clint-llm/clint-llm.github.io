Treatment of a CSF leak depends on the underlying cause, size, and location of the tear. If it is a small leak, it may resolve on its own, while larger leaks may require surgical intervention. Conservative treatment for a CSF leak typically includes bed rest and increased oral fluids. Other treatments, such as a lumbar epidural blood patch, may be recommended if the leak persists. A lumbar epidural blood patch involves injecting a small amount of the patient's own blood into the area around the spinal cord. This helps to seal the leak and reduce the symptoms associated with the leak. Other treatments for a CSF leak may include nasal packing, endoscopic repair, and surgical repair.

In cases of craniofacial trauma, it has been posited that conservative management and observation should be employed since a number of these resolve with no intervention. However, the risk of developing meningitis in these patients is up to 29%, so this course should be pursued cautiously.

Conservative treatment for a CSF leak may include bed rest: This helps reduce pressure on the affected area and allows the leak to heal. Pain management: Over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen may be recommended to relieve headaches and neck pain. Hydration: Drinking plenty of fluids helps to maintain adequate fluid levels in the body and reduce symptoms. Caffeine restriction: Caffeine can worsen symptoms and should be avoided or limited. Position changes: Avoiding activities that increase pressure on the affected area, such as coughing, sneezing, or straining, can help reduce symptoms. Acetazolamide in the dosage of 500 mg twice daily for the first week, followed by a lower dosage to 250 mg twice daily for a second week, seems to have a 100% success rate in the closure of the primary defect in spontaneous CSF leak with controlled ICP.

For mild occurrences of a CSF leak, conservative treatment is a viable option and may be successful in letting the leak heal on its own. However, more invasive therapies, such as surgical correction, may be required in more severe situations or if symptoms continue. Working closely with a skilled healthcare professional is crucial to choosing the right course of action for each unique instance.

The epidural blood patch (EBP) procedure is a commonly used treatment for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks. The procedure involves injecting a small volume of the patient's own blood into the epidural space surrounding the spinal cord to seal the leak and prevent further loss of CSF fluid.

The epidural blood patch procedure is valuable for neurosurgeons and other specialists treating CSF leaks. The procedure is simple, low-risk, and can quickly relieve symptoms in most cases. The success rates for EBP have been shown to increase with the volume of autologous blood, with a rate of 80% achieved with 10 to 15 ml and more than 95% with 20 ml.

The lumbar drain procedure involves the insertion of a catheter into the lumbar (lower back) region of the spinal canal, where the CSF fluid accumulates. The lumbar drain treatment is typically done to temporarily relieve symptoms and give the CSF leak time to mend. The size and location of the leak, as well as the patient's unique healing process, will determine how long the catheter must remain in place. During the surgery, a small incision is created in the lower back, and a thin tube is put through it. The CSF can then be removed from the body by connecting the tube to a drainage system. The patient often stays in the hospital for a few days following the procedure to be observed and get any necessary follow-up care. The surgery is often carried out under local or general anesthesia due to its low risk.

Surgery is recommended when the leak site has been identified, symptoms have been refractory to less invasive treatments, and severe symptoms persist.

The endoscopic nasal packing procedure involves the placement of small, absorbent material into the nasal passages to block the leak and prevent further loss of CSF fluid. The endoscopic nasal packing procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia and uses an endoscope, a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera attached, to visualize the inside of the nose. The surgeon identifies the site of the leak and uses specialized instruments to place the absorbent material, such as Gelfoam and/or fibrin glue, to patch the defect into the nasal passages. The packing material seals the leak and helps promote healing. The endoscopic nasal packing procedure is considered a safe and effective option for treating CSF leaks that originate in the nasal passages. The procedure is minimally invasive and does not require a large incision or prolonged recovery time, making it a popular choice for patients who want to avoid more invasive surgical options.

External Ventricular Drainage (EVD) procedure is a neurosurgical treatment option for a CSF leak. The EVD procedure involves placing a drain in the brain's ventricles to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to reduce pressure and allow for better healing of the CSF leak region. During the procedure, a small burrhole is made two to three centimeters anterior to the coronal suture and three centimeters com the sagittal suture. Another landmark for the borehole is the mid-pupillary line. The catheter is then inserted through the hole and into the frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. The right side is preferred due to the risk of the lesion to the dominant motor cortex. The tube is then connected to an external drainage system, which is used to remove the CSF. The amount of CSF removed is monitored until the CFS leak heals completely. The procedure is usually performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. It is followed by a period of observation to ensure that the pressure is successfully reduced.

In cases of iatrogenic injury during intracranial surgery, the obvious treatment is repairing the affected site, which may require multiple procedures or adjuvant therapy with the options described above.
