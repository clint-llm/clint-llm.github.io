Documentation and key components. A thorough history and physical is important at the first evaluation for a disability claim. In addition to noting the precise details of the injury and body parts affected, it is also important to note the functional limitations caused by the impairment. The functional history should include various environments (home, work, social, community, etc.) and different activities (ADLs and iADLs).

An important standardized scale is the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), which quantifies the patient’s level of independence.  The physical examination should use techniques and maneuvers that are standardized. These may include Manual Muscle Testing (MMT), Range of Motion evaluation with a goniometer, Modified Ashworth Scale for spasticity, and other special tests designed to identify the presence or specific injuries. These tests should be repeated at each visit to show progression or digression of the patient’s progress with therapy.
