Even a century after the first reports of the cases, the etiology of Plummer-Vinson syndrome remains unknown. Proposed etiopathogenic mechanisms include nutritional and iron deficiencies, genetic predisposition, and autoimmunity.

As patients with Plummer-Vinson syndrome may also suffer from malnutrition, vitamin B deficiency has also been suggested as a cause, although the evidence is weak and inconclusive. Other disorders associated with Plummer-Vinson syndrome include celiac disease, Crohn disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroid disease, raising the possibility that immune dysregulation may be involved in its pathogenesis, although this remains to be proven.
