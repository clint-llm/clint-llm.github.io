An integrated team of experts is required to manage and work up a proven or suspected case of an ENS due to the vast systemic and cutaneous manifestations of these syndromes. The evaluationÂ should begin with a comprehensive history, including prenatal, developmental, and past medical and family history. A complete full-body skin exam, including the mucosal surfaces, should be performed by a dermatologist who is familiar with the vast majority of ENS. An astute pediatrician should perform a full skeletal assessment with a referral for imaging by radiology, or second opinion by orthopedics and endocrinology in the case of coexistent rickets. Routine imaging of the CNS is not standard unless there are developmental concerns that can be gleaned from a thorough history. Therefore, small isolated epidermal nevi usually do not require further workup and are usually an isolated finding. Epidermal nevi, which are large, dentofacial in location, or have associated neurologic symptoms such as seizures, may warrant further imaging to rule out structural brain abnormalities. Subsequent referral for a workup by neurology is recommended in case of suspected neurologic involvement. Geneticists can help to stratify the genetic basis for the syndrome in question and counsel regarding the risk of recurrence in future generations.
