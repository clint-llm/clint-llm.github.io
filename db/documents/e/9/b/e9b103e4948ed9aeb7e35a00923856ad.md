The two staging systems used in the classification of osteosarcomas include

- Enneking system, and

- TNM system - proposed by the American Joint Committee of CancerÂ (AJCC)/International Union against Cancer.

While the TNM staging is based upon the size, nodal involvement, and metastatic extent of the tumor, the Enneking system uses the histological grade and extent in relation to the histological compartment. The histological grade is divided into low and high grade. The anatomical compartmentalization of the tumor may be intra-compartmental or extra-compartmental.
