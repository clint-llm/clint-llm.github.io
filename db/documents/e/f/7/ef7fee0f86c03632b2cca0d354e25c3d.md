A variety of conditions affect the middle cranial fossa and an understanding of this area of the skull base is paramount for any clinician or surgeon encountering these conditions. A non-exhaustive list of conditions affecting the middle cranial fossa includes pituitary adenomas, vestibular schwannomas, cavernous sinus thrombosis, cavernous sinus infection, cranial nerve palsies, and intracranial meningiomas. The surgical approach is highly dependent on the location of the pathology addressed. Vestibular schwannomas involve the posterior cranial fossa; however, often a CN VIII sparing middle cranial fossa approach will be used to preserve hearing. In the case of a tuberculum sellae meningioma, surgical approaches ranged from bilateral subfrontal to endoscopic endonasal approaches with the course of surgery depending on the location, size, and surgeonâ€™s preference. Recent literature has suggested that in the case of skull base meningiomas, combination surgical excision and stereotactic radiosurgery was acceptable management.
