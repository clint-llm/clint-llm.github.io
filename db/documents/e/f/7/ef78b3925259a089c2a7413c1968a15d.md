Virchow triad describes the pathogenesis of thrombus formation. Endothelial injury initiates the process. It is induced by trauma to the endothelium of blood vessels. Abnormal laminar flow induced by turbulence in arteries propagates the process. Valvulitis or an aneurysm induces it. Then hypercoagulability further enhances the thrombosis. Leukemia or coagulation disorders induce hypercoagulability. These three factors create a cascade of events leading to the propagation of thrombus that ultimately occludes the vessels and produces complications.
