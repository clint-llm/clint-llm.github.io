Surgical resection is a mainstay of sarcoma treatment. Patients that are operative candidates are encouraged to undergo resection. Prior to the 1980s, this consisted largely of limb amputations which, while having high rates of local control, led to increased morbidity and functional limitation. Currently, amputations make up <5% of all sarcoma surgeries.

A diligent pre-operative work-up is necessary, consisting of an MRI to determine the tumor extent. The modern surgical approach to sarcoma resections consists of a wide en-bloc resection with the goal of at least a 1cm margin of uninvolved tissue in all directions. A 2cm margin may be considered for tumors with infiltrative borders.

Macroscopic residual disease portends a poor prognosis. Low-grade tumors may still have acceptable local control with < 1 cm margin. Margins are classified as intralesional, marginal, wide, or radical. Intralesional margins run through a tumor and leave residual tumor.

For locally recurrent tumors, surgery may still be an option with either a wide excision or amputation. For wide excision, local recurrence-free survival at 5 and 10 years was 66% and 50%, respectively.

Tumors that are large and unresectable or present in the patient not deemed a surgical candidate may be observed if there are no symptoms. However, in symptomatic individuals, palliative surgery may be used.

Local control rates for low-grade sarcomas are approximately 5% and typically can be treated with surgery alone.

Given the rarity of these tumors and the need for a multidisciplinary approach to their treatment, it is recommended that patients be treated at high-volume centers that have the experience and expertise. Patients will require diligent follow-up, especially in the first few years posttreatment and continued physical therapy.
