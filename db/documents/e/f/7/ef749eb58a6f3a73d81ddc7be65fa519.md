With abnormal labor, cesarean delivery can be a life-saving procedure and may be medically necessary. Diligent management of labor aspires to minimize variation between providers as they resort to cesarean delivery for the management of abnormal labor. The new labor-management guidelines published in 2014 aim to decrease cesarean delivery rates and provide the best opportunity to improve outcomes and reduce costs as well as reduce future maternal obstetrical morbidity and mortality.
