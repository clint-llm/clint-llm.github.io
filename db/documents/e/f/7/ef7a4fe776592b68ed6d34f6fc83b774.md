The equipment required is similar to any standard operation with the addition of specific microsurgical equipment.  Surgeons require some magnification, either with loupes or a microscope or both. Microsurgical equipment includes micro sutures (8-0 - 10-0), jeweler’s forceps, microscissors, a vessel dilator, a microneedle holder, microvascular clamps, microsurgical hemoclips, and a micro-instrument wipe. Medications including heparin saline (100u/mL), papaverine, and possibly TPA. A venous coupler is often necessary for vein anastomosis.  Also, standard equipment for monitoring the flap is mandatory, typically this is a Doppler probe, but an internal doppler and other devices can be used depending on surgeon preferences.
