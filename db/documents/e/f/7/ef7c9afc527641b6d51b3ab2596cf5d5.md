At the initial presentation, it is very difficult to differentiate fungal endocarditis from bacterial endocarditis. Fungal endocarditis usually presents as subacute endocarditis. The most common presentation in all patients with fungal endocarditis is fever, which is usually prolonged (more than 2 weeks) and is often associated with chills, sweating, and fatigue. A new murmur, previously unrecognized murmur, or change in the quality of previously recognized murmur is another common finding in patients with suspected fungal endocarditis. Other clinical signs of fungal endocarditis include peripheral embolization in the extremities, brain, lung, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. Septic pulmonary embolism usually presents with fever, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, and hemoptysis. Embolism to the gastrointestinal tract may present as an acute abdomen secondary to acute mesenteric ischemia. With valvular destruction, a patient with fungal endocarditis may present with heart failure. The patient can also present with clinical signs ranging from weight loss, clubbing, petechial rash, splenomegaly, hypotension, septic shock, and death. It is rare to see peripheral findings unique to particular fungal infections, such as cutaneous macro-nodules (in candidiasis).
