Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is one of the worldwide leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In 2013 coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease were the first and third causes of death, which attributed to 84.5% cardiovascular death and 28.2% of all-cause mortality, respectively.

Cholesterol is a sterol compound found in most human body tissues. From a physiologic standpoint, cholesterol and its derivatives are vitally crucial for cell membranes and myriad metabolic processes in the body. Also, cholesterol is used to make hormones, fat-soluble vitamins, and bile acids. The primary source of cholesterol is from animal-based foods, such as eggs, dairy, and cheese. Based on density, cholesterol can classify as high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Triglycerides are also part of the blood-lipid profile.

Framingham Heart Study, a landmark study, is the first to demonstrate unequivocally that higher LDL concentrations were associated with a higher risk of ASCVD.
