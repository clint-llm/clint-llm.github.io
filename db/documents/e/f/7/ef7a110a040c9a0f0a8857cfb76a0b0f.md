The major cellular process behind gametogenesis is meiosis, which involves the division of 1 diploid (2n) cell into four haploid (1n) copies. Meiotic division occurs after DNA replication in oogonia (or spermatogonia). Two meiotic divisions follow DNA replication, neither of which will include additional intervening DNA synthesis. The first division serves to separate homologous chromosome pairs, while the second division will separate the sister chromatids. It is important to note that, in contrast to male gametogenesis, the cytoplasmic divisions are grossly unequal, with one half receiving the vast majority of the cytoplasmic contents and the remaining product (designated polar bodies) receiving a much smaller amount of cytoplasm. This asymmetrical division of resources serves to ensure adequate nutrients for the embryo after fertilization.
