Hyperlipidemia without accompanying hypertriglyceridemia does not present lipemia retinalis.

At triglyceride levels of:

- 2500 to 3499 mg/dL- the peripheral vessels look creamy and thin

- 3500 to 5000 mg/dL- posterior pole vessels have a creamy color

- At levels more than 5000 mg/dL, the fundus has salmon-color. Differentiation of retinal arteries and veins may be difficult by color (both have creamy color). Though clinical differentiation of the retinal artery and vein is difficult in such cases, the caliber of the vessel may give a clue.
