Complications of regional anesthesia techniques for eye surgery are rare, though they can put the sight or life of the patient at risk. The incidence of life-threatening events is low at 3.4 per 10,000 cases.

**Retrobulbar hemorrhage:**Retrobulbar hemorrhage has an incidence of 0.04% to 1.7%

**Ocular globe injury:**Ocular globe injury is also a rare complication, with incidence varying from 1 in 12,000

**Optic nerve damage:**Optic nerve damage occurring with modern techniques of ophthalmologic blockades is rare. The use of needles more than 31 mm in length has been associated with this complication. According to a study conducted by Unsold et al. (1981)

**Extraocular muscle injury:**The mechanism of extraocular muscle injury seems related to the direct injection of local anesthetic into the muscle, high volume of local anesthetic, and direct local anesthetic toxicity. Direct local anesthetic injection has been reported more commonly occurring in the inferior rectus, with strabismus, ptosis, and diplopia as principal signs. Ptosis can be a normal finding up to 24 hours after ocular surgery, though the persistence of other signs raises the suspicion of muscular or even nerve damage. Delayed recovery of more than six weeks may be related to permanent damage in up to 25% of cases.

**Central spread of the local anesthetic and brain stem anesthesia:**Fortunately, this life-threatening complication has a reported incidence as low as 0.3% to 0.8% of cases.
