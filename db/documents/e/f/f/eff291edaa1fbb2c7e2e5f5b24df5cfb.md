If the clinical examination is consistent with cutaneous lupus, a lesional biopsy should be taken from an active, erythematous plaque. A punch biopsy (4 mm is recommended on the trunk or 3 mm on cosmetically sensitive areas such as the face) should be performed to include the full thickness of the dermis. As discussed above, the classic histopathologic findings are abundant interstitial mucin and a dermal perivascular and periadnexal lymphocytic infiltrate.

If the histopathologic findings definitively support a diagnosis of tumid lupus, the patient should be evaluated for systemic disease, despite the weak association with SLE. The evaluation for systemic lupus includes a full history and review of systems, physical examination with special attention to lymphadenopathy or arthritis, and laboratory tests (ANA with anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm profiles), urinalysis, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, chemistries, ESR, CRP, complement levels (C3, C4), and antiphospholipid antibodies. For a more extensive autoimmune workup, autoantibodies such as SS-A/Ro and SS-B/La, anti-U1RNP, and anti-histone antibodies can be drawn.

If the histology is consistent with lupus but not definitive, a lesional biopsy can be sent for direct immunofluorescence (DIF). The most characteristic DIF finding in cutaneous LE is granular IgG and/or IgM deposition at the dermal-epidermal junction and around hair follicles. However, with tumid lupus specifically, DIF is often negative or nonspecific and therefore may not be as valuable as in other forms of cutaneous lupus.

Phototesting can be beneficial for diagnosing TLE; reproduction of lesions after UVA/UVB irradiation may support a diagnosis of tumid lupus.
