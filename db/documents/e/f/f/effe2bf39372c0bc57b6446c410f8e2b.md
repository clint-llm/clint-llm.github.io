Cardiac biomarkers are useful in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, specifically non-ST-elevation MI. Troponin is the most specific lab test and has two isoforms, I and T. Troponins peak at 12 hours and persist for seven days. Creatinine kinase MB is also specific to the myocardium. It peaks at ten hours; however, it normalizes within two to three days. LDH peaks over 72 hours and normalizes over ten to 14 hours. In clinical practice, LDH is not used to diagnose acute MI. Finally, MB has very low specificity for the myocardium and is not used clinically; it quickly rises and normalizes. High-sensitivity troponin has recently been approved for use inÂ the United States after having been heavily studied and utilized in Europe. Although it is more sensitive than conventional troponin, it is also less specific. Thus, potential challenges include numerous false-positive interpretations.
