The current classification of gastritis is based on time course (acute versus chronic), histological features, anatomic distribution, and underlying pathological mechanisms. Acute gastritis will evolve into chronic if not treated. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the most common cause of gastritis worldwide. However, 60 to 70% of H. pylori-negative subjects with functional dyspepsia or non-erosive gastroesophageal reflux were also found to have gastritis. This activity describes the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, histopathology, evaluation, differential diagnosis, and gastritis management. It also explores the role of collaboration amongst the professional team to enhance care delivery for patients with gastritis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of gastritis.
- Describe clinical approaches for the diagnosis of gastritis. 
- Review current treatment and management options used in gastritis.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the professional team to enhance care delivery in patients with gastritis, leading to successful patient outcomes.
