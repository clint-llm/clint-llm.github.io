Human brain development begins during the third week of gestation from the ectoderm. The notochord induces neurulation, a process by which the ectoderm above the notochord forms neuroectoderm to give rise to other structures. As a result, the neural tube begins to form. The brain continues to develop from the neural tube. Following the closure of this neural tube by week 6, the primary brain vesicles form. These primary brain vesicles include the prosencephalon (forebrain), mesencephalon (midbrain), and rhombencephalon (hindbrain).
