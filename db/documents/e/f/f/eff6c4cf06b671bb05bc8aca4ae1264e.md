- False enlargement of gingival tissue: pseudo-enlargement of the gingiva, caused by an enlarged underlying bony tissue. The gingiva here has no abnormality.

- Inflammation: chronically inflamed gingival tissue is red or violaceous, smooth, and tends to bleed on the touch.

- Familial or hereditary conditions: examples include familial fibromatosis, idiopathic fibromatosis, gingivomatosis, and hereditary gingival hyperplasia. The gingiva is pink, non-tender, involves the attached gingiva, the gingival margin, and the interdental papillae, and has a firm and leathery consistency.

- Physiological states: puberty and pregnancy are associated with gingival enlargement.

- Scurvy: vitamin C deficiency can produce very tender bleeding gingiva.

- Systemic diseases: leukemia, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis - their diagnosis can be corroborated hematologically.

A thorough history, physical examination, and investigations, including biopsy, may be required to confirm the etiology in all these conditions.
