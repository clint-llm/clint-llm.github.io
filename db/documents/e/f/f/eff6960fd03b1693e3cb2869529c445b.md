Hemophilia, which means love (philia) of blood (hemo), manifests with prolonged and excessive bleeding either spontaneously or after insignificant trauma. Hemophilia encompasses a group of inherited ailments that alter the body's normal blood coagulation. A hereditary hemorrhagic disorder resulting from congenital deficit or scarcity of factor VIII, hemophilia A, which is known as classical hemophilia, manifests as protracted and excessive bleeding either spontaneously or secondary to trauma.
