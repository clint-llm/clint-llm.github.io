The most common adverse effects include bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, high blood pressure, and phosphenes.

Ivabradine can cause bradycardia, sinus arrest, and heart block. Sinus node dysfunction, first- or second-degree atrioventricular block, bundle branch block, ventricular dyssynchrony, and or concomitant use of other heart-rate reducing drugs increase the risk of bradycardia. In the SHIFT trial, symptomatic bradycardia occurred in 5% of patients taking ivabradine compared to 1% in the placebo group. Asymptomatic bradycardia occurred in 6% of patients on ivabradine compared to 1% in the placebo group. Bradycardia led to permanent withdrawal from the study in 1% of patients on ivabradine and less than 1% of those in the placebo group.

Ivabradine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Concomitant use of verapamil or diltiazem with ivabradine should be avoided. Verapamil and diltiazem are CYP3A4 inhibitors; they increase ivabradine levels and hence the risk of bradycardia.

QT prolongation, torsade de pointes, and other arrhythmias may occur as a result of ivabradine-induced bradycardia.

Ivabradine increases the risk of atrial fibrillation. Discontinue ivabradine if atrial fibrillation occurs.

Visual effects (phosphenes) were observed in clinical trials. It has been proposed that this is due to ivabradine's inhibition of I(h) current in the retina. In the SHIFT trial, known phosphenes occurred in 3% of patients taking the ivabradine compared to less than 1% in the placebo group. This difference in the occurrence of phosphenes was statistically significant.

Ivabradine has been shown to cause fetal toxicity in animal studies.

Postmarketing adverse effects of ivabradine include syncope, hypotension, angioedema, erythema, rash, pruritis vertigo, and diplopia.
