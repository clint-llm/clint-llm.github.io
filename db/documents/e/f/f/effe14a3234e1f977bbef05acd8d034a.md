Pelvic BLT is an incredibly safe treatment modality due to its passive and direct or indirect approach. Many patients with pelvic somatic dysfunction that may not be able to tolerate more active and direct treatments such as high-velocity, low-amplitude (HVLA), muscle energy, or articulatory techniques can tolerate BLT well. Some absolute contraindications include patient refusal, inability to consent to treatment, fractures at the location being treated, as well as certain bone malignancies or osteomyelitis leading to compromised bone structure.
