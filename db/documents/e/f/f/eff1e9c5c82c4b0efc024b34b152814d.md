Protriptyline is an older tricyclic antidepressant which has little use today. Healthcare workers, including the pharmacist and prescribing nurse, should be familiar with newer antidepressants, which are much safer. Patients already on protriptyline should be gradually weaned off and started on the newer antidepressants if there are no contraindications.
