A broad category of congenital vascular anomalies from the aortic arch is referred to as a "vascular ring."

Symptoms are non-specific and are due to the abnormal anatomic course of the left pulmonary artery coursing between the esophagus and trachea. Once PAS is diagnosed, patients will be recommended to undergo surgical repair.

Glaevecke and Doehle first described PAS in 1897.
