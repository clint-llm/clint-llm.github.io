X-rays and computerized tomography (CT) of the chest aid in the diagnosis of a lung abscess. On imaging studies, lung abscess appears as cavitary lesions with infiltrates.

Lung abscesses are more prone to develop over the posterior segment of the right upper lobe and middle lobe followed by the superior segment of the right lower lobe and sometimes of the left lung in case of aspiration of oropharyngeal contents.

Complicated lung abscess can cause pyopneumothorax or pleural empyema. In such cases, pleural fluid analysis can aid in diagnosis. Lung abscess can get complicated if the patient is immunocompromised. In immunocompetent patients with adequate treatment, there is less chance of complications, and it usually resolves in three weeks. In cases of lung abscesses secondary to hematologic spread, blood cultures and echocardiography play an essential role in the management of lung abscess.
