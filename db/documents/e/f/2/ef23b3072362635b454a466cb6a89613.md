A focused history and physical exam can reveal findings suspicious for DVT in the upper extremity. The best way to confirm a diagnosis is with compression duplex ultrasonography. This test has a sensitivity of 97% and specificity of 96% for the determination of DVT in the upper extremity and is often the test of choice. However, several other imaging modalities including magnetic resonance and computed tomographic venography are superior to ultrasonography, but their clinical use may be limited by high costs, radiation exposure, and/or availability. The sensitivity of compression duplex ultrasonography is 97%, which is lower than magnetic resonance venography (100%). However, it is non-invasive, less expensive and widely available, thus remains the test of choice to diagnose upper extremity DVT. Laboratory studies are not required for diagnosis, but a coagulation assay can be ordered in patients suspected of having a hypercoagulable condition. In patients with a low suspicion of upper extremity DVT, a d-dimer test can help rule it out. A patient with upper extremity DVT complicated by PE may present with chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG should be performed because it willÂ most commonly demonstrate sinus tachycardia.
