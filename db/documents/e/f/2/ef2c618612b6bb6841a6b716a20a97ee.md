There are no evidence-based guidelines on the diagnosis and management of pancreatic pseudoaneurysm. However, expert evidence suggests that prompt diagnosis of the pathology at presentation is vital if survival is to be improved. Without treatment, the condition is fatal. Because bleeding is a major source of morbidity and mortality, consultation with an interventional radiologist is recommended. Embolization therapy carries far less mortality than surgery and should be the procedure of choice, when available.

The best way to treat pseudoaneurysms is to prevent them in the first place. The pharmacist should be vigilant about drugs that can cause acute pancreatitis and suggest alternatives to the primary care provider. In addition, the pharmacist should educate the patient on the harms of alcohol. In some patients with pancreatitis requiring anticoagulants, an interprofessional approach should be considered when selecting the medications.

The nurse should educate the patient and family members to abstain from alcohol, as it is one of the major causes of pancreatitis.

**Outcomes**

Small case series reveals that when an interprofessional team is involved, patients with pancreatic pseudoaneurysms can be successfully managed.
