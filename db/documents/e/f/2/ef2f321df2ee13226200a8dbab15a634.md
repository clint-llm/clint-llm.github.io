The prognosis in asystole depends on the cause of the rhythm, time of intervention, and success of ACLS. Resuscitation is generally successful in cases of cardiac arrest due to choking on food or pacemaker failure. Overall the prognosis is poor, and the survival is even poorer if there is asystole after resuscitation. Data indicate that less than 2% of people with asystole survive. Recent studies do document improved outcomes, but many continue to have residual neurological deficits.
