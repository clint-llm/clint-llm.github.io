This article introduces translational science, research, and the translational spectrum, including how eachÂ concept applies to healthcare simulation. To introduce the topic, this article begins with a description of the problem translational science aims to solve, followed by a brief history of why translational science has become a larger focus of national efforts and research endeavors. In the latter half of the article, the concepts of translational science and research are applied to medical education, specifically in the context of healthcare simulation.
