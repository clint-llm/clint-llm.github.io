The US healthcare system poses many challenges to HCPs: administrative burden, high patient load, and inefficiencies. Acknowledging and reducing implicit biases may seem like insurmountable tasks given these challenges. After all, how can you be emotionally available to recognize your own biases when you are barely managing to keep the ship afloat? A part of this reality is true; it is impossible to eliminate one’s own implicit biases and treat everyone equally all the time. However, studies have shown that practicing mindfulness, attentional control, and emotional regulation, in addition to showing compassion when able, positively impacts the culture of healthcare.

At the health systems level, providing implicit bias training courses for employees is not enough. Healthcare systems must 1) create stress-free spaces for HCPs to debrief and reflect on their experiences with implicit bias, 2) stop pressuring HCPs to constantly make major decisions during intense cognitive stress, and 3) provide opportunities for role-playing encounters with patients when implicit bias is perceived or acknowledged, as studies show the more HCPs practice these discussions, the more likely implicit biases are acknowledged and reflected upon in patient rooms.
