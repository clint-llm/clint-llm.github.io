Thiamine deficiency is characteristically associated with severe alcohol use disorder. Although Wernicke encephalopathy mostly affects people who have a thiamine deficiency due to chronic alcoholism, various other causes include severe malnutrition, hyperemesis gravidarum, prolonged parenteral nutrition, malignancies, immunodeficiency syndromes, liver disease, hyperthyroidism, and severe anorexia nervosa. Chronic alcohol consumption may cause thiamine deficiency due to impaired absorption of thiamine from the intestine, a possible genetic predisposition, inadequate diet, reduced storage of thiamine in the liver, and other nutritional deficiencies.
