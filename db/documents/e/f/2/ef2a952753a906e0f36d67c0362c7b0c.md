Shingles is a common infectious disorder in the elderly with significant morbidity. The condition has no cure but can be prevented in most patients via vaccination. When there is eye involvement, patients must be referred ASAP to an ophthalmologist.  Healthcare workers including the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, internist and pharmacist should educate the patient on the benefits of the vaccine.
