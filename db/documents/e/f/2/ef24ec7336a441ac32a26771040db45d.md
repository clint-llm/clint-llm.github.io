Workup of HSV keratitis proceeds in the following manner:

- **History:**It isÂ the first step to pinpoint the etiology of the disease.

- **External examination:**Distribution of skin vesicles may help distinguish HSV (vesicles concentrated around the eye) from HZV (vesicles extended to the forehead, scalp, and tip of the nose) keratitis.

- **Slit-lamp examination:**This is the most important step since it helps identify the characteristic signs of herpes keratitis. The ulcer bed is visualized better with fluorescein dye while the virus-laden cells at the margins with rose bengal dye.

- **Check corneal sensation:**This may decrease in herpes keratitis. Do this before instilling topical anesthetic.

- **Laboratory tests:**Herpes simplex is usually diagnosed clinically and requires no laboratory confirmation. If the diagnosis is in doubt, any of the following tests are options:
- Scrapings of a corneal or a skin lesions for Giemsa stain or Tzanck smear - ELISA testing is also available
- Viral culture
- HSV antibody titers. They rise after primary but not recurrent infection
