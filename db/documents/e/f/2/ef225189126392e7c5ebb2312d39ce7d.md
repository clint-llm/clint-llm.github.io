An interprofessional team, evidence-based approach for the initial diagnosis and close follow up is of utmost importance in Crigler-Najjar syndrome. It helps to enhance the overall outcomes by making an early diagnosis and timely therapeutic intervention, reducing the duration of future treatments, and preventing complications. The role of neonatologists in making a diagnosis based on the clinical background is crucial. Similarly, pediatric gastroenterologists, medical geneticists, and histopathologists assist in confirming the diagnosis.

Pediatric neurologists help in the management of cases complicated by kernicterus or early acute bilirubin encephalopathy. They help evaluate the extent of severity and help provide the details to parents on disease prognosis. Pediatric surgeons contribute to curative treatment by liver transplantation. Outcomes of hospitalized patients also depend upon the available hospital protocols and the quality of care received. While most patients with Crigler-Najjar type I syndrome await the curative liver transplantation, management can be safely and effectively done in a hospital setting to prevent kernicterus.
