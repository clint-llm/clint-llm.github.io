Craniopharyngiomas are rare benign tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). These patients usually present to the primary care provider with a wide array of symptomatology such as headaches, nausea and vomiting, visual disturbances, and endocrine disturbances. It represents a special challenge for the physicians that treat it; these physicians commonly include neurosurgeons, neuro-ophthalmologists, neurologists, endocrinologists, and pediatricians. Specialty trained nurses in perianesthesia, operating room, and critical care are necessary for care. The interprofessional team is essential for optimum outcomes. The challenge is due to the tumor's ability to adhere to the surfaces that surround it. For this reason, it is extremely difficult to control, and it is also notorious for its high rates of recurrence. However, the outcomes in most people are good.
