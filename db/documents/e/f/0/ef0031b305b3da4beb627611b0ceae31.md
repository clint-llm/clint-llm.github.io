The two vertebral arteries within the neck merge at the base of the skull to form one midline basilar artery. The blood supply of the medial IC mainly flows from the paramedian branches of the basilar artery. The lateral IC primarily receives vascular supply via the rostral trunk of the superior cerebellar artery, another branch arising from the basilar artery.

Previously, anatomists believed that the brain lacked lymphatic drainage. A growing body of evidence reveals the presence of a glymphatic system, which then may drain through the cerebrospinal fluid to the periphery.
