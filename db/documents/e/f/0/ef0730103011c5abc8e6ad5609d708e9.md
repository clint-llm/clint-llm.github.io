Infantile hemangioma is the most prevalent benign tumor of infancy. The estimated incidence is between 4% and 5%. Large facial segmental hemangioma has associations with PHACES syndrome (PS), which is an acronym for **p**osterior fossa malformations,**h**emangioma of the cervicofacial region,**a**rterial anomalies,**c**ardiac anomalies,**e**ye anomalies, and**s**ternal or abdominal clefting or ectopia cordis. It was first described in 1996 by Frieden and colleagues and named PHACE syndrome. After that, Boulinguez and colleagues changed the acronym to PHACES syndrome by adding sternal defects (S). PS is a rare congenital cervicofacial infantile hemangioma. It occurs in 2% of cases.
