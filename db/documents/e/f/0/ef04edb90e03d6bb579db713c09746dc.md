Patau syndrome, also called trisomy 13, is a clinical syndrome that occurs when all or some cells of the body contain an extra copy of chromosome 13. It is characterized by cleft lip, cleft palate, cerebral defects, anophthalmia, simian creases, polydactyly, trigger thumbs, and capillary hemangiomata. This activity describes the evaluation and management of Patau syndrome and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the epidemiology of Patau syndrome.
- Describe the use of chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis, and fetal free DNA analysis in the prenatal evaluation of Patau syndrome.
- Review the treatment considerations for patients with Patau syndrome.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care by counseling the family on the poor prognosis of Patau syndrome so they can make informed decisions about its management.
