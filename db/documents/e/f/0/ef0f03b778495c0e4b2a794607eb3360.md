In all cases where the CDC recommends tuberculin skin testing (TST) as a tool in the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis, IGRAs may be used instead, or as an adjunct in concordance with special requirements and criteria. Several sources of variability can affect IGRA results, not all of which are currently understood. Variation in reliability can involve multiple forms, including statistical variability when it comes to obtaining analytical data, responsive variability dependent on immune response, and manufacturing variability.

Although the assay manufacturers and the test users can remove or mitigate systemic sources of variability by optimization, spontaneous sources of variance are inevitable and must be compensated for when obtaining data. The pre-analytical or statistical variability serves as an interfering factor when the incubation period of blood samples becomes prolonged, or fluctuations in the accurate measurement of results may cause issues in the IGRA test and readings. Immunological response variability rests on the hostâ€™s ability to form an adequate immune response to TB, such as would be problematic in immunocompromised patients with HIV, chronic systemic steroid use, or malnutrition.
