There is no guidance regarding neoadjuvant, adjuvant, or salvage radiation dosing or technique for BSNS. Treatment plans have been very case-specific, and radiation has thus far been utilized as adjuvant therapy, both prophylactically and for positive surgical margins.

Due to the few cases reported in the literature and the lack of BSNS-specific photon radiotherapy or proton beam therapy (PBT) studies, no specific recommendations can be made regarding adjuvant photon radiation or proton beam therapy. However, based on broad studies of all sinonasal tumors, adjuvant radiation (photon or proton beam) may be considered in patients with advanced T-stage, bony or neural invasion, dural or intracranial involvement, positive margins, or tumors that cannot be completely resected due to high surgicalÂ morbidity.
