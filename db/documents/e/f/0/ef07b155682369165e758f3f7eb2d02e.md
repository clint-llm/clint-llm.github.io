Thoracic segmental spinal anesthesia offers many benefits not available with general anesthesia or with lumbar spinal anesthesia in some cases. This technique has made it possible to perform certain major operations on an awake patient at high risk for morbidity and mortality under general anesthesia. Other benefits include better pain control than opioids and a decrease in the opioid requirement during or after a procedure, which lowers the incidence of the side effects with these drugs. Furthermore, there is an earlier recovery of bowel function and decreased complications which result in a shorter length of in-hospital stay and patient satisfaction.

This procedure can also be valuable for postop pain in combination with other modalities. Lastly, the anesthetic dose is lower, so hemodynamic instability becomes minimal.
