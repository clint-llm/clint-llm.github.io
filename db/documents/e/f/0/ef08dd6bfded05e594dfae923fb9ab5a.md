Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder that affects multiple systems. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is characterized by an increased predisposition to hamartoma formation. TSC is usually diagnosed in childhood or infancy, and affected individuals may present with developmental delay, skin manifestations, or seizures. However, it may also be diagnosed later, based on a wide array of clinical manifestations. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tuberous sclerosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance outcomes for affected patients and families.

**Objectives:**
- Explain when the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis should be considered. 
- Outline the types of tuberous sclerosis.
