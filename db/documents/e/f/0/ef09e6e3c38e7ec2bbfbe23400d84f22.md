A cure is rarely achieved once lymphedema occurs. Meticulous treatment and preventive measuresÂ can help lessen symptoms, slow or stop disease progression, and prevent complications. Patients with chronic lymphedema for ten years have a 10% risk of developing lymphangiosarcoma. This tumor is highly aggressive, requires radical amputation of the involved extremity, and has a very poor prognosis. Five-year survival is less than 10%.
