In a world of evolving disease, accidental industrial or commercial contamination, as well as foreign and domestic terrorism, emergency providers must be able to provide safe and efficient resuscitation procedures to victims while wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Contamination events can take the form of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear threats (CBRN)Â that are often compounded by explosions and trauma (ET). Resuscitation follows the emergency medicine mantra of managing the airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) to sustain life, and regarding contamination gives preference to antidotes (AABCs). The most common schema for PPE is the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administrations (OSHA) PPE protection levels A, B, C, and D.

CBRN threats are common; they have been well documented throughout history. The nature of evolving viruses that cause Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) has required the use of PPE by emergency providers to avoid natural or nosocomial inoculation from airborne or contact means.Salmonella typhimurium causing 751 casualties.
