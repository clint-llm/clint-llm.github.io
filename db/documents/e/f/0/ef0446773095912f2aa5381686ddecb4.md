Hypertensive heart disease is a syndrome of complication relating to the cardiovascular complications associated with chronic hypertension. Hypertension ranks as the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for premature cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality and requires constant surveillance to identifying complications and slow their development. Prolonged hypertension promotes left ventricular hypertrophy which will eventually lead to heart failure (both systolic and diastolic). Eccentric hypertrophy leads to increased oxygen demand by the myocardium which can result in angina or ischemic symptoms.Â  Hypertrophy of the muscle can disrupt conduction pathways predisposing to atrial fibrillation which leads to ischemic stroke.

Acute alterations in blood pressure can predispose patients to intracerebral hemorrhage or retinopathy. Prolonged hypertension is the predominant risk factor for the development of cardiac disease including atherosclerotic disease, heart failure, valvular disease, atrial fibrillation as well as cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, retinal disease, and metabolic disease. Nearly half of strokes and ischemic heart disease are attributable to sustained hypertension.
