Hearing loss is one of the most common disabilities worldwide. Implantable hearing devices offer exciting developments in treating hearing loss in patients who previously had poor treatment options, including those with anatomic abnormalities, chronic draining ears, or severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. Examples of these new hearing technologies include bone-anchored hearing devices and implantable middle ear devices that offer hearing rehabilitation for conductive or mixed hearing loss and single-sided deafness. Cochlear implants also offer hearing options for patients with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. This chapter describes and highlights the interprofessional teamâ€™s role in evaluating and treating patients who undergo implantation of these new hearing devices.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of hearing loss.
- Describe the treatment considerations for patients with hearing loss.
- Describe the common complications of implantable hearing devices.
- Summarize how interprofessional collaboration and communication can improve outcomes for patients who require implantable hearing devices.
