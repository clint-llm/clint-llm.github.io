Acquired flatfoot appears to be associated with obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other disease processes that are treatable with a healthy lifestyle and weight reduction. Patients with adult acquired flatfoot may benefit from the treatment of their other medical comorbidities. Additionally, patients may prevent further disease progression once diagnosed with the use of an appropriate orthotic device. Most patients who use an orthotic device in conjunction with PT and or NSAID therapy will not need any surgical intervention.
