Platelets are a blood component that still does not have a substitute as their functions are complex. As described above, the process of collecting, processing, storing, and transfusing platelets is an interprofessional process requiring skill and precision. Nevertheless, platelet transfusion has its own risks, though a risk vs. benefit assessment is done before requesting its transfusion. Minimizing the risk of platelet transfusion and improving the outcomes is an evolving aspect of the field of transfusion medicine.
