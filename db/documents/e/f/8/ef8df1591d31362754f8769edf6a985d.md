The auricle is composed of skin, subcutaneous tissue, musculature, and perichondrium which supplies blood to the underlying cartilage.[1] An auricular hematoma is a collection of blood between the perichondrium and underlying cartilage.Â  The primary areas of cartilage in the ear include the tragus, helix, antihelix, triangular fossa, cymba concha, and concha cavum.[1] The blood vessels that supply the ear consist of the superficial temporal and posterior auricular artery.[6] With trauma to the ear, the perichondrium and vasculature are damaged, causing separation from the underlying cartilage and resulting in a potential space for blood to accumulate. Once blood fills this space, it causes vascular compromise of the adjacent cartilage and venous congestion that can result in histologic changes and ensuing cartilage deformity, resulting in an unsightly appearance of the external ear known as cauliflower ear.[1] A process of neocartilage development occurs that is an alteration of the normal histologic structure of the cartilage framework of the ear.
