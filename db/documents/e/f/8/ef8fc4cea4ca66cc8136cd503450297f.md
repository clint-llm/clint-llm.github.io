There are numerous normal physiological coronary artery variances. Starting with the coronary dominance, the PDA in 70% of patients arises from the right coronary artery (known as right dominance); in about 10% of cases, a branch from the LCx supplies the inferior segment of the heart (known as left dominance). In about 20% of cases, there is a dual supply from both the right coronary artery and the LCx (known as codominance).

In most cases, epicardial fat surrounds the coronary arteries. However, in 0.15% - 25% of cases angiographically and 5 - 86% on autopsy, the coronary arteries are embedded directly into the myocardium. This phenomenon is known as a myocardial bridge. The LAD is the most commonly affected artery, and the patients are usually asymptomatic even under stress testing.

Other physiologic variants include an acute take-off of the LCx in which the angle between the LMCA and the LCx is less than or equal to 45 degrees. This variant occurs in about 2% percent of the population.
