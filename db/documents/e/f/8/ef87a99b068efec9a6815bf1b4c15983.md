Acute esophageal necrosis is an uncommon condition that can present in a number of different ways include upper GI bleeding, signs of sepsis, or peripheral hypoperfusion. Medically co-morbid patients presenting with epigastric pain and hemodynamicÂ compromise should raise concern for urgent investigation and treatment. Early recognition and subsequent resuscitation form the cornerstone of management for these patients, regardless of diagnostic uncertainty.

Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is vital for diagnosis and should be performed as soon as possible. This may require liaising closely with the endoscopy department or even the operating theatre if the patient is not considered stable enough. Evidence of perforation will need surgical input, and long-term parental nutrition, guided by the dieticians, should be instigated early on. Nursing staff can coordinate and liaise activities between various clinicians, other professionals such as the dietician and the patient. Interprofessional care and communication with prolonged rehabilitation are clearly required in such cases to ensure a positive outcome.
