Biotin is a water-soluble B-complex vitamin. It is found in several food sources, such as milk, raw egg yolk, organ meats (liver, kidney), Swiss chard, leafy green vegetables, and brewer’s yeast. In addition, endogenous biotin is produced by colonic flora in the large intestine.

Apocarboxylase transforms into holocarboxylase through a catalytic reaction involving the attachment of biotin via the holocarboxylase synthetase enzyme. When holocarboxylase breaks down during proteolytic reactions, it releases biotinyl-peptides and biocytin. Biotinidase then recycles biotin from biotinyl-peptides and biocytin, making it available for carboxylases by increasing the free biotin pool. Biotinidase deficiency thus makes biotin unavailable for the four carboxylases, leading to blocks within the four pathways involving these key enzymes:

- Inefficient pyruvate carboxylase results in a buildup of lactic acid and alanine

- Propionate, 3-OH propionate, and methyl citrate become increased in the body due to deficient propionyl-CoA carboxylase

- 3-methylcrotonylglycine and 3-hydroxyisovalerate accumulate as a result of inefficient 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase

- Acetyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency leads to the accumulation of acetyl-CoA

Accumulation of these substrates leads to variable neurological and dermatological manifestations of the disease.
