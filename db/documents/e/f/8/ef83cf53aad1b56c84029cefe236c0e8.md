Incorrect gametogenesis can lead to several different pathologies, although an exhaustive discussion is not covered here. It is worth noting that aneuploidy is more common in female gametogenesis despite the higher rate of recombination also seen during female gametogenesis when compared with gametogenesis in males. Errors resulting in aneuploidy, regardless of etiology, will, unsurprisingly, lead to fetal chromosomal abnormalities such as Down Syndrome as well as miscarriage and age-related infertility. Meiosis I, in particular, is associated with age-related increases in chromosomal missegregation. Although aneuploidy, in general, is most likely multi-factorial, the age-related decline in the presence of cohesive molecules holding chromosomes together during meiosis leads to a predisposition of becoming aneuploid via nondisjunction of homologous chromosomes. In rare instances, nutritional defects during the differentiation of oocytes can interfere with their fertilization, causing a hydatidiform mole leading to gestational trophoblastic disease.
