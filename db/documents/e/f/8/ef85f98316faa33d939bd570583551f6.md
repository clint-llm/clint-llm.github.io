An interprofessional approach is fundamental for the success of the therapy. The professional figures involved are manifold and involve the pain therapist, the oncologist for the management of combined therapy, a nurse specialist in minimally-invasive procedures, an x-ray technologist. Very often, an interventional radiologist (e.g., CPB under CT guidance), and a palliative radiotherapist can be involved. In addition, psychological intervention is often required, especially for cancer patients who are subjected to enormous stress loads related to disease, pain, and consequent impairment of QoL.
