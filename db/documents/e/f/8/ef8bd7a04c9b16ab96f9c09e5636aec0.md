Common side effects of alpha-tocopherol supplementation include nausea, headache, changes in vision, gastrointestinal upset, risk of hemorrhagic stroke, mild increase in urine creatinine, and necrotizing enterocolitis. There is a potential risk of increased bleeding intraoperatively, as vitamin E is known to inhibit the aggregation of platelets. Yet, it has not been shown in those who are not already on antiplatelet or anticoagulants.

Alpha-tocopherol undergoes metabolism in the liver CYP450 enzymes and therefore monitoring for drug interactions if the patient is on medications that inhibit or induce these enzymes is recommended.
