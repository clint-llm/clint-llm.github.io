The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased over the past few decades, attributed to its overdiagnosis.

Health providers, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs) and other healthcare professionals (e.g., nurses and pharmacists), should operate as an interprofessional team. All interprofessional team members must coordinate their activities using open communication channels and maintain accurate and updated patient records. They should all be aware of these guidelines; this will prevent potential harm to patients from overtreatment of low-risk thyroid cancers and help appropriately treat patients with high-risk diseases. Reportedly, the overall cost of thyroid cancer in 2019 was nearly 21 billion dollars due to surgery costs.
