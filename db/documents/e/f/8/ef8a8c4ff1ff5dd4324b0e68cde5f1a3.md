Gyromitrin has the chemical formula C4H8N2O, and its chemical name is N’-ethylidene-N-methylformohydrazide.

The boiling point of gyromitrin is 143 C (289 F). However, monomethylhydrazine (MMH) boils at a lower temperature of 87.5 C (190 F)

Some websites and mushroom handbooks describe the technique of parboiling then drying, to detoxify the mushroom and render them edible. Patocka [2012] estimates that 99% of the gyromitrin can be removed by either drying or boiling the mushroom before eating it.

Michelot [1991] gives the values of an LD in humans (based on animal experiments) as 25 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg for adults and 10 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg for children. This roughly correlates to between 0.4 kg to 1.0 kg of fresh uncooked mushroom for an adult and 0.2 kg to 0.6 kg of fresh mushroom for a child. These are unlikely amounts of mushrooms to be ingested at one time.

Cooking hydrolyzes some gyromitrin, but after being ingested, gyromitrin is hydrolyzed rapidly in the stomach to N-methyl-N-formyl hydrazine (MFH), then converted in the liver by cytochrome P-450 oxidation into N-methylhydrazine (MMH). Of interest, this final chemical is also a component in rocket fuel, such as in the propellant mixture Aerozine-50 made by the Aerojet Company, which was used in Titan rockets.

Eleven other hydrazones, in lesser quantities, have been isolated from these mushrooms and may contribute to liver cytotoxicity.

A recent paper found that life-long foraging for gyromitrin mushrooms in the French Alps was associated with 14 cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, compared with a cohort.[10]
