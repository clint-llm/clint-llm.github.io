Review of literature implies a better prognosis for patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) in comparison to patients with IPF yet marginally worse than patients with CTD-ILD. One study demonstrated an expressively inferior survival in those meeting IPAF benchmarks when compared to a CTD-ILD patient and barely slightly better survival compared to an IPF cohort.

Another study showed somewhat similar results with the survival of the modified IPAF cohort identical to that of CTD-ILD (p=0.26), and significantly better than the IPF cohort (p=0.005).
