Menstrual-related headaches generally present similarly to nonestrogen-related migraines.

Most patients have a normal neurological exam, but some can experience cutaneous allodynia, which is the perception of pain produced by a small stimulus, such as brushing hair, touching the scalp, shaving, or wearing contact lenses resulting in sensitization of central pain pathways in migraine. Additionally, patients can have tenderness or difficulty resting on the allodynic side. Although rare, some studies suggest migraines can be potential risk factors to cause Bell palsy, sensorineural hearing loss, and oculomotor cranial nerve palsies.
