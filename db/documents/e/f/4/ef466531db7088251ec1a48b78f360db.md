Above the pectinate line, the anal canal derives from the cloaca, which has an endodermal lining. Below the pectinate line, the anal canal forms from the proctodeum and is of ectodermal origin. Therefore, the pectinate line is the fusion between endoderm and ectoderm.

The fusion of the proctodeal ectoderm with cloacal endoderm forms the cloacal membrane. The urorectal septum separates the cloaca into the ventral bladder and urogenital sinus and dorsal rectum and anal canal. The urorectal septum joins the cloacal membrane. Then, the cloacal membrane divides into an anal membrane and urogenital membrane.
