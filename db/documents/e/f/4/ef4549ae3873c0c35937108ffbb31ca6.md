It has been estimated that 10% of men in their 70s and 30% of men in their 80s will have at least one episode of urinary retention. It is more common in men than women, and the incidence increases with age.  Chronic retention may be either high pressure or low pressure. High pressure is potentially more dangerous as it can cause vesicoureteral reflux resulting in renal damage due to direct injury to the nephrons.

The incidence of post-obstructive diuresis following the alleviation of urinary retention is unclear but is reported to be up to 50% in some series.

Post-obstructive diuresis has also been reported in pediatric cases after repair of ureteropelvic junction obstructions.  This is sometimes, but not always, associated with renal tubular acidosis.
