Breast augmentation remains a highly popular procedure. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), reports that approximately 290,000 procedures were performed in the United States in 2016. The vast majority of patients have improved self-esteem and express satisfaction with their decision to have the operation. Given the number of women who have breast implants, doctors who treat these women for other conditions should have an awareness of the procedure and implants in general.
