# Introduction

The osmometer is a device used in clinical laboratories for measuring the concentration of particles in a solution, known as the osmolar concentration. This quantity can be expressed as osmolality (in units of mmol/kg) or osmolarity (in units of mmol/L). Clinical laboratories usually measure osmolality. Osmolality is considered more precise because weight is temperature-independent.

Four colligative properties of a solvent change if a solute is dissolved into a solvent. These properties are:

- Osmotic pressure

- Vapor pressure

- Boiling point

- Freezing point

These properties are tied to osmolality and depend on the solution's number of solute particles. Dissolving a solute into a solvent generally increases the osmotic pressure and boiling point and decreases the vapor pressure and freezing point of a solution. While any of the four colligative properties could be used to determine the osmolality of a solution, technical limitations restrict the commercial measurement of osmolality to freezing point, vapor pressure, and membrane osmometers. The freezing point depression method is the most common in clinical laboratories because it is the most accurate and simple method.

The general principle of freezing point depression osmometers involves the relationship between the number of moles of dissolved solute in a solution and the change in freezing point. For example, one mole of a dissolved solute reduces the freezing point of water by approximately 1.86 degrees Celsius (~35.35 degrees Fahrenheit).

The setup of a freezing point depression osmometer includes a temperature-controlled bath to allow for sub-freezing temperatures, a thermistor probe connected to a Wheatstone bridge circuit to measure the temperature of a clinical sample, and a thermistor readout circuit, which represents a combination of a galvanometer and a potentiometer.

On the other hand, membrane osmometers measure the flow of solvent (often water) from a pure solvent container across a semipermeable membrane into a solution containing a solute and the same solvent. The flow across the semipermeable membrane can be measured as the osmotic pressure of a sample and is related to the concentration of solute in the sample solution.

Alternative methods to osmometers can be used to measure osmolality, including electrical conductivity and specific gravity.

# Specimen Requirements and Procedure

Specimen requirements vary between the various commercially-available osmometers and are included in the respective machine's instruction manual and laboratory protocols for specimen preparation. Acceptable specimens, in general, include serum, heparinized plasma, tears, sweat, and urine.

The stability of different samples varies, though some general guidelines are as follows:

- Unspun serum/plasma (room temperature or refrigerated at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius): 3 hours

- Separated serum/plasma (room temperature or refrigerated at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius): 48 hours

- Urine (room temperature): 24 hours

- Urine (refrigerated or frozen): 7 days

The general procedure for osmometry starts with using a properly calibrated osmometer. A full calibration of osmometers is required at least every six months. It may also be necessary following a part replacement or service of the instrument or if the quality control (QC) reading is repeatedly out of range. For quality control, it is required that the laboratories run two controls at two different concentrations daily or with each batch of samples. Acceptable controls are generally within +/- 2 standard deviations from the mean. The institution's quality control policy and protocol and the instrument user manual should be followed to ensure accurate sample analysis.

# Testing Procedures

The testing procedure for specific osmometers varies and is referenced in the user manual for each device. A general procedure outline can be found below.

**General Osmometry Procedure**

- Enter or scan sample ID.

- Load the sample to be tested into the osmometer. For freezing point depression osmometers, a small amount of sample is drawn in a sampler with a plunger. The sampler tip is inserted into the instrument's sample port, and the analysis begins. Loading the sample into the osmometer may start the analysis automatically. Other systems may require the lab technologist to press a button to start the process.

- Record the sample osmolality.

- Once the test is completed, withdraw the sampler from the osmometer and discard the sampler tip. Ensure the sampler and sample chamber are both cleaned appropriately.

# Interfering Factors

There are a few limitations of Freezing point depression osmometers. Particulate matter can cause premature crystallization of samples; this can be avoided by centrifuging blood and urine samples or the filtration of urine samples. The presence of air bubbles in a sample may also result in the inadequate freezing of samples. Test samples that are allowed to evaporate, are non-aqueous in nature, or are highly viscous may not freeze well and yield an inaccurate result. High concentrations of substances, including ethanol, methanol, acetone, paraldehyde, trichloroethane, or propylene glycol, may not freeze reliably, leading to inaccurate results.

Finally, failure to clean the sample container after sample analysis can lead to the next osmometer measurement being skewed by the previous sample. Vapor pressure osmometers are limited by a lack of precision compared to freezing point depression osmometers. They cannot be used to measure the osmolality of solutions that contain volatile solutes.

# Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings

Certain sample types are more prone to inter-sample variability and may need two or more replicates. Volatile samples, for instance, may need to be performed in duplicate and agree within a certain range of mOsm. In these cases, the osmometer's specific protocol and user manual should be followed. The measurement range of osmometers varies depending on the instrument and sample being used; however, a common reportable range for freezing point depression osmometers is 0 to 2000 mOsm/kg. The normal reference range for serum is 275 to 295 mOsm/kg, and urine is 300 to 750 mOsm/kg, though these ranges may vary.

# Clinical Significance

**Serum Osmolality**

Changes in serum osmolality can be useful in differentiating the causes of various electrolyte and acid-base balance disorders.

Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 Na (mmol/L) + glucose (mg/dL)/18 + urea (mg/dL)/2.8

The difference between the calculated and measured osmolality is known as the osmol gap (also known as the osmolal or osmolar gap). A normal osmol gap is 2 or less, though according to some sources, it is greater than 10 mOsm/kg in the clinical environment.

An elevated serum osmol gap can be found in the following clinical scenarios/disease states:

- Pseudohyponatremia: A low reported serum sodium concentration (less than 135 mEq/L) in the presence of normal measured serum osmolality. This can be the result of hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia, in which case these molecules make up an increased portion of the serum sample, resulting in a falsely decreased sodium reading. Based on the aforementioned Smithline-Gardner equation, the falsely decreased sodium concentration will decrease the calculated serum osmolality, resulting in an elevated osmol gap when compared to the normal range measured osmolality.

- Exogenous substances: Ingestion of toxic alcohols such as ethanol, methanol, propylene glycol, and acetone can cause elevated osmol gap. The presence of an elevated osmol gap and suspicion of volatile alcohol poisoning often prompts further investigation by a volatile screen.

- Endogenous substances: Metabolic states such as diabetic ketoacidosis or alcoholic ketoacidosis increase the concentration of ketones in the bloodstream, increasing the osmolality within the blood and creating an osmol gap. Lactic acidosis can result in moderate lactic acidosis due to the accumulation of products from the breakdown of glycogen.

The value of change in the osmol gap can also give some insight into the cause of the elevation. For instance, renal failure and ketoacidosis often present with an osmol gap equal to or less than 15 to 20 mOsm/kg, while an osmol gap greater than 20 mOsm/kg often indicates alcohol or acetone accumulation. Lactic acidosis often results in an average osmol gap of approximately 11 mOsm/kg.

**Urine Osmolality**

Urine osmolality is useful in the investigation of various electrolyte disturbances, particularly in the presence of hypo- or hypernatremia.

In patients with low serum osmolality and clinically normal extracellular fluid volume, urine osmolality can distinguish between various etiologies. In these cases, urine osmolality >100 mOsm/kg is indicative of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), hypothyroidism, or glucocorticoid deficiency. On the other hand, a urine osmolality <100 mOsm/kg is seen in patients with primary polydipsia or Beer drinker's potomania.

**Stool Osmolality**

Measuring stool osmolality can be helpful in the evaluation of patients with diarrhea to differentiate osmotic diarrhea from secretory diarrhea. The stool osmotic gap is defined as the difference between the measured osmolality and a calculated osmolality (2*([fecal Na+] + [fecal K+]).

# Quality Control and Lab Safety

Accurate osmometry results require using a properly calibrated osmometer. More information on this is available in the specimen requirements and procedure section. The safe operation of an osmometer includes a variety of factors. The device must be plugged into an approved electrical outlet, as exposure to AC voltage could lead to electric shock, burns, or electrocution. Power cords should be adequately secured to ensure they do not create a walking or tripping hazard. The device should not be placed or operated on any wet, unstable, or non-leveled surfaces. Furthermore, osmometers should not be operated in an explosive atmosphere or areas with extreme or highly variable temperatures.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Determining serum and urine osmolality and identifying the difference between the calculated and measured osmolality (measurement of osmolar gap) are essential components in diagnosing and treating patients in various clinical scenarios. The modern osmometers in clinical laboratories are simple to operate and produce rapid and accurate results using a small volume of specimens. For better patient management, it is recommended that osmolality measurements are performed stat. This ensures better accuracy and minimum errors. Effective communication between all members of a patient's interprofessional care team, from laboratory technologists to nurses, physicians, pharmacists, and other health professionals, is necessary for patients to receive appropriate and timely medical care. A systematic process for stat measurement of osmolality is beneficial, as is a properly equipped and calibrated osmometer and fully qualified and trained laboratory technologists to run this instrument.
