Sideroblastic anemia is a rare disease. When patients are seen in primary care clinics with anemia, most are assumed to have iron deficiency anemia, which is more common. However, it is important for clinicians to keep the possibility of sideroblastic anemia in mind. It is the responsibility of theÂ primary care provider, nurse practitioner, and the internist to be able to recognize and diagnose this disease to appropriately manage the patient. Patients should be educated and be well informed about this disease as specific food or drugs can precipitate this disease. Patients with iron overload should be informed about the importance of avoiding iron-riched containing food like red meat. Also for patients taking medications that induce sideroblastic anemia, clinicians should emphasize the importance of avoiding that particular medication. The most common complication and the cause of mortality in these patients is iron overload. Clinicians and other healthcare workers should treat with iron chelating drugs in patients getting frequent transfusions. An iron overload could cause damage to various organs in the body including the liver, heart, pancreas, etc. causing more complications. More clinical research is also necessary to evaluate prognosis, and epidemiology of this disease.
