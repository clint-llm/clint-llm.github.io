Myocarditis is an inflammatory process of the myocardium. It can present in the acute, subacute, or chronic phase with either focal or diffuse involvement of the myocardium. In the United States and other developed countries, viral infections are most frequently the cause of myocarditis. In developing countries, rheumatic carditis, Chagas disease, and complications related to advanced HIV/AIDS also provide important causes of myocarditis. Myocarditis is diagnosed based on clinical presentation. Diagnosis is classically confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of myocarditis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the pathophysiology of myocarditis.
- Describe the signs and symptoms of a patient with myocarditis.
- Summarize the management of the patients diagnosed with myocarditis.
- Explain the importance of coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by viral myocarditis.
