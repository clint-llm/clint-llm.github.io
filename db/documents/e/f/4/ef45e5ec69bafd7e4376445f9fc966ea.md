CIDP is primarily a T cell-mediated process. However, the response to plasmapheresis suggests a possible role of B cell-mediated immune functions.

While many antibodies, such as GD1a, GD1b, GM1, and GQ1b, are associated with GBS, no particular antibody is associated with CIDP. Thus far, onlyÂ a few autoantibodies have been identified in association with CIDP variants, such as perinodal proteins such as neurofascin 140, 155, and 186.
