Wound Care: Daily cleansing and dressing. Medicated gauzes and chemical cautery.

Surgical options: Surgical excision of vegetative lesions.

Treatment for Oral Involvement: Magic mouthwash comprised of liquid dexamethasone; 5 cc rinse, 2x per day or clobetasol ointment.

Topical Options

- Class I steroids applied twice daily

- Topical tacrolimus for facial involvement or if sensitive to chronic steroid therapy

- Minocycline/nicotinamide at onset and relapse has been used with success and avoids systemic steroids

Intralesional Therapy:

- Triamcinolone is injected directly into refractory vegetative lesions

Systemic Therapy: The gold standard for treatment is systemic corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are thought to upregulate desmoglein expression in keratinocytes, resulting in rapid therapeutic effect. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants are the most effective in managing patients with pemphigus.

- Prednisone: 0.5 to 2 mg/kg/day for 2 to 4 weeks.

- Azathioprine: 50 mg daily, and upwards titrate to 2.5 mg/kg/day.

- Dapsone: 100 to 200mg daily. Ideal for mucosal involvement. May combine with mycophenolate or azathioprine.

- Mycophenolate mofetil: 30 to 40 mg/kg/day. Risk of side effects, lymphoma, and JC virus.

- Methotrexate: 15 mg/week. Safe and beneficial steroid-sparing agent.

- Cyclophosphamide: Works well for oral mucosa, but has extensive side effect profile.

- First-line combination therapies:

- Corticosteroid plus one of the following agents: rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, or IVIG.

If standard steroids and immunosuppressants are not sufficient, second-line treatments include:

- Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, with or without IVIG dosed at 2 mg/kg over 3 to 5 days every 4 weeks. Rituximab has shown to elucidate short-term remission in 95% to 100% of pemphigus patients and correlates with a decrease in anti-DSG3 titers.

- Pulse Therapy:  Intermittent high dose IV corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, to achieve faster results and minimize side effects of long-term steroid therapy.

The recommendation is to maintain remission for 1 year and then slowly taper therapy over another year, tailored to the individual patient and their co-morbidities.

Less common treatment options include plasmapheresis, immunoadsorption, and hematopoietic stem cell transplant.

Emerging Therapies: The goal is to offer long-term therapy with fewer side effects and less systemic immunosuppression.

- B cell-activating factor (BAFF): B-cell-activating factor co-stimulates B-cell responses. Patients with B-cell mediated autoimmune diseases often have increased BAFF, which makes it a novel therapeutic target.

- Proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) inhibitors: Proliferation-inducing ligand is a key biomarker in the regulation of B-cells, humoral immunity, and pathogenicity of autoimmune disease. Inhibitors are a therapeutic option.

- Anti-cytokine therapy, anti- interleukin (IL)-4 and anti-interleukin (IL)-6): Interleukins, particularly IL-4 and IL-6, have been implicated in pemphigus by exacerbating Th2 overexpression and isotype switching to IgG1 and IgG4, which have been shown to play a role in the loss of desmoglein.  Direct inhibition of IL-4 and IL-6 is a potential treatment for patients with pemphigus.

- Co-stimulatory and co-inhibitors- manipulators and inhibitors of pathogenic signaling pathways (p38MAPK, c-Myc, and EGFR) are currently being studied and may be targets for novel therapies.
