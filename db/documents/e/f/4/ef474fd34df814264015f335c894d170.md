The plexus divides into numerous branches and includes:

- postganglionic sympathetic fibers

- visceral afferent fibers

- preganglionic and postganglionic parasympathetic fibers

The branches are not given off directly, but they instead pass through the viscera via small subsidiary plexuses such as the middle rectal plexus, the prostatic plexus, and the uterovaginal plexus.

fThe superior hypogastric plexus is located within the abdomen at the bifurcation of the aorta, eventually leading to the left and right hypogastric nerves, forming a vast meshwork of solid nerve trunks. The nerve meshwork resides lateral to the rectum, bilaterally, and curve down and out as they make their way into the pelvis, eventually interconnecting the superior and inferior hypogastric plexuses. There are no ganglia within this nerve plexus.Â The majority of the sympathetic contribution to the hypogastric nerves are derived from the superior into the inferior hypogastric plexuses.
