Aplastic anemia presents at any age with equal distribution among gender and race. Symptoms related to the absent cell lineage (anemia, progressive weakness, pallor, and dyspnea; neutropenia, frequent and persistent minor infections, or sudden onset febrile illness; thrombocytopenia, ecchymoses, mucosal bleeding, and petechiae). Splenomegaly is not seen, and its presence suggests an alternative diagnosis. Labs will demonstrate macrocytic normochromic anemia with reticulopodia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. There must be no cytologic abnormalities as this would suggest an underlying hematologic process.
