Cervical cancer is the four ranked cancer among women worldwide. Cervical cancer is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) which is a sexually transmitted viral infection found in most adults during their lifetime.Â Primary and secondary prevention is key with cervical cancer, including HPV vaccination and regular cervical cancer and HPV screening. Treatment for cervical cancer includes surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy. People with cervical cancer may be asymptomatic in the early stages, but often present for workup with vaginal bleeding and pain with sexual intercourse. During treatment, people with cervical cancer may experience treatment side effects such as nausea, vomiting, dysuria, diarrhea, neutropenia, skin irritation, and more. Nurses play an important role in symptom management and coordination of care during a person's journey through cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship.
