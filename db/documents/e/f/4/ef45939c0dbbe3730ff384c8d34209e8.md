Management of sarcomas involves an interprofessional team that includes clinicians, specialists, pharmacists, and nurses. The team should discuss each patient should before making any treatment decisions. In addition to the oncologist, a surgeon, an orthopedist, a neurologist, a pain consultation, an internist, and a plastic surgeon should be consulted before any major surgery. When a patient is suspected of having sarcoma, a referral to an oncologist should be the first step. Sarcomas are resistant to chemotherapy and radiation, and surgery is the definitive treatment. However, an oncology-specialized pharmacist can consult with the radiation therapy team for combination therapy when warranted. Nurses will play a crucial role in the follow-up and offer patient counseling, contacting the appropriate clinician when the situation warrants. It is important to remember these tumors are known to recur, and the prognosis for most patients is guarded.

It is, therefore, incumbent on all members of the interprofessional team to monitor the patient throughout their treatment and beyond and to immediately communicate with the other team members if there are any concerns; this includes accurate and updated patient records so all members of the care team can access the same information. This interprofessional approach will yield the best patient outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
