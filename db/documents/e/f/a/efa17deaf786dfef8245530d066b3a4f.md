Pemphigus herpetiformis appears to be an IgG-mediated autoantibody that mainly targets the desmoglein proteins of the epidermis. The mechanism by which autoantibodies produce characteristic skin lesions in pemphigus herpetiformis is still debated. Some cases of drug-induced pemphigus herpetiformis have otherwise been reported.
