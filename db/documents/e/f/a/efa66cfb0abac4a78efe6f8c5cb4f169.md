To minimize the risk of IAN and LN injuries, clinicians must have a good understanding of neural anatomy during procedures around the mandible or on the floor of the mouth. Despite all reasonable preventive measures, however, nerve injury may still occur. This is why clinicians should weigh the risks and benefits of lower facial procedures and discuss them with patients to educate them, develop treatment plans, and obtain informed consent.

Once IAN or LN injury is identified, the clinician should assess the extent of damage by performing the neurosensory testing detailed above. Unfortunately, there is no universally accepted standard for managing IAN and LN injury. Treatment strategies vary among clinicians depending on experience and comfort level. Listed below are some of the more commonly employed treatment options for IAN and LN nerve injury.

**Conservative Management**

- Corticosteroids: High-dose corticosteroid therapy may be initiated immediately after injury to reduce inflammation, potentially minimizing the extent of nerve damage. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of corticosteroids in preventing the development of nerve deficits is weak; however, steroids are used widely by neurosurgeons after intracranial surgery and have been shown to improve outcomes in facial nerve palsy.

- Topical medications: For patients with pain due to nerve injury, there is some evidence that topical agents can help alleviate symptoms. Capsaicin, lidocaine, clonidine, and clonazepam can be applied to the affected areas.

- Systemic pharmacologic agents: Oral medications can also be used to relieve pain from nerve injury. The use of tricyclic antidepressants and membrane stabilizers such as antiepileptics, lidocaine derivatives, and muscle relaxants has been described.

**Surgical Management**

Surgical intervention should be considered when there is no improvement in neurosensory function for over three months, and the deficit is not acceptable to the patient.

- External nerve decompression: If nerve compression is suspected as a cause of the neurosensory deficit, surrounding structures may be released or removed to help relieve pressure on the nerve. A 2012 study published by Bagheri et al. reported an 85% rate of sensory recovery after decompression.

- Direct neurorrhaphy: A severed nerve may be repaired primarily via suture neurorrhaphy if there is not a significant amount of missing nerve and the ends can be brought together without tension. The reported likelihood of sensory recovery varies widely in the literature but may be as high as 90% with careful technique and optimal circumstances.

- Sleeves: If the nerve stumps cannot reach each other in a tension-free manner, but the gap between them is small, collagen sleeves may be used to facilitate nerve regeneration in the absence of direct end-to-end coaptation. Success rates exceed 80%, particularly when the gap is ≤3 mm.

- Nerve reconstruction with autogenous grafts: When the injury results in a gap between the nerve stumps >3 mm in length, nerve or vein grafts can be used to span the gap. Great auricular nerve or sural nerve grafts are most commonly harvested for this purpose, with the great auricular nerve being more convenient to use because of its location in the neck, while the sural nerve is better suited to providing longer graft segments, up to 40 cm if necessary. If there are no readily available nerves to harvest or the patient refuses to permit nerve harvest, posterior facial or external jugular veins can be used instead, although veins lack the structural architecture (endoneurium, perineurium, epineurium) that nerves have.

- Removal of the offending factor: When placement of a foreign body causes nerve dysfunction, the foreign body should be removed to limit inflammation and expedite recovery. For example, when dental implant placement leads to inferior alveolar nerve damage, the implant should be removed, ideally within 36 hours of placement.
