The relative frequency of various subtypes of endophthalmitis varies depending upon the geography, level of specialization at the ophthalmic center, and study duration. For example, studies before 2005 have very few cases of post intravitreal anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) injection endophthalmitis as anti-VEGF agents received first FDA approval in 2004.

In a recent retrospective cohort study in the U.S., acute onset endophthalmitis occurred in 0.04% of cataract surgeries and 0.016% of patients receiving an intravitreal injection.

Case series from Asian countries have reported an incidence of 0.023% to 0.076% of endophthalmitis in post-cataract surgery setting and 0.01% to 0.10% post intravitreal injections.

Among the intraocular surgeries, secondary intraocular lens implantation seems to have a very high risk (0.36%) for acute endophthalmitis, and trabeculectomy may have a high risk (1.8%, maybe up to 5.7%) for delayed or late-onset endophthalmitis especially after the advent of mitomycin-C or 5-fluorouracil.

Endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy had the lowest rates (0.046%) when compared with other ocular surgeries [secondary IOL-0.366%, combined penetrating keratoplasty (PK) with cataract surgery- 0.194%, PK- 0.178%, glaucoma surgeries -0.124%, combined trabeculectomy and cataract surgery- 0.114%, overall incidence after intraocular surgery-0.093%, and cataract surgery with or without IOL-0.082%] in a study.

There is no significant difference in the rates of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection of various anti-VEGF agents.
