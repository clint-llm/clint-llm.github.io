The pathogenesis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and unstable angina is the rupture of the coronary artery plaque resulting in acute thrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. Thus, the thrombus forms an integral part of the atherosclerotic coronary plaques. There is a consensus that intracoronary thrombus makes up a challenging target for revascularization because of its unique characteristics. It has a crucial impact on the performance and outcome of the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This activity reviews the cause and presentation of coronary artery thrombus and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of coronary artery thrombus.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with coronary artery thrombus.
- Summarize the treatment options for coronary artery thrombus.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the management of coronary artery thrombi and improve outcomes.
