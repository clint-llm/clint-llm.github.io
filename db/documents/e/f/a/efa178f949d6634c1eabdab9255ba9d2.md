Alginates are a family of compounds that naturally occur in the cell wall and extracellular matrix of various species of brown seaweed, often comprising up to 40% of the plantâ€™s biomass. Some species of bacteria have also been found to produce alginates, including the commonly infectious Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

The building blocks of alginates are guluronic and mannuronic acid, both monosaccharides closely related to glucose. These building blocks form long chains that, with the addition of water, generate an anionic polysaccharide scaffold within an aqueous matrix. Varying the proportions of guluronic and mannuronic acid generates alginate compounds with differing physical and chemical properties.
