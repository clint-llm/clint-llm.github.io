Practitioners should take a proper history regarding co-ingestions, particularly anticholinergics and cardiotoxic medications. Co-ingestion involving calcium channel blockers (CCB) may cause profound hypotension and cardiotoxicity. Various other cardiotoxic medications, for example, tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may potentiate beta-blocker toxicity. Underlying medical illnesses especially patients with underlying cardiac diseases are at increased risk of poor outcomes. Different beta-blockers have different half-lives that may range from several minutes to several hours. Therefore, efforts should be made to determine the exact beta-blocker involved.
