**Complete Blood Count**

Complete blood count with differential shows an absolute neutrophil count of less than 2000/microliter, which is a hallmark feature and required for the diagnosis of Felty syndrome, accounting for an increased risk of bacterial infections. Diagnosis of Felty syndrome can sometimes be made earlier if the patient’s blood counts are under surveillance for another reason, such as medications' toxicity monitoring. There is no correlation between splenic enlargement and degree of neutropenia.

**Serology**

Laboratory findings of RA, like positive rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP, are almost always present in FS. Antinuclear antibodies, anti-histone antibodies, and HLA-DR4 can also be present.

**Imaging**

Plain radiographs of small peripheral joints may show severe joint destruction. Imaging of spleen with ultrasound or radionuclide scan can be done to detect splenomegaly.

**Bone Marrow Biopsy**

Bone marrow biopsy shows myeloid hyperplasia in most cases with increased granulopoiesis and relative excess of immature forms described as “maturation arrest.”

**Histology**

Splenic histology in autopsies and post-splenectomy cases has shown non-specific findings such as congestion of venous sinusoids, reticular cell hyperplasia, and germinal cell hyperplasia.
