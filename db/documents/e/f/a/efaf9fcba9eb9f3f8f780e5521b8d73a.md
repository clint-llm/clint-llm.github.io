Tachypnea should be treated depending on the underlying cause.

If infants present due to transient tachypnea of the newborn, they can receive treatment with extra oxygen and, in some cases, may require some time in the neonatal intensive care unit.

If the tachypnea is due to asthma or COPD, patients can receive an inhaled medicine to dilate and expand the alveoli in obstructive lung disease. If tachypnea is due to pneumonia, antibiotics are indicated to treat bacterial pneumonia, but viral pneumonia can be treated supportively without antibiotics.
