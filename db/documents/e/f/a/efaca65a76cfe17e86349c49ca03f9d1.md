Making the correct diagnosis and gaining compliance with an appropriate treatment regimen is critical to effecting a mycological cure. Some treatments might require several weeks, so noncompliance is a common reason for treatment failure.

Relapse or recurrence after therapy remains a concern. Infection transmission from symptom-free carriers, like family and pets, needs to be identified. Adjuvant therapies might be required for adequate control of infection in the treatment-refractory patient and in the carriers, and disinfectant techniques should be employed to control exposure via fomites.
