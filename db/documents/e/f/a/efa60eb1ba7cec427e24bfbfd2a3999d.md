Part of the initial workup for acute back pain includes an assessment of the SI joint. SI joint pain is a common type of low back pain, and it is separate from the lumbar spine or paraspinal muscles often associated with low back pain. The spine and pelvis are connected posteriorly by the sacroiliac joint. The SI joint lies between the iliac bone and the sacrum. A common cause of SI joint injury includes trauma. Trauma can be repetitive, causing a series of small injuries that accumulate over time, such as in the case of an athlete, or can be significant trauma such as a pelvic fracture from a motor vehicle accident. Separately, SI joint injury is prevalent in pregnancy.

Furthermore, SI joint pain often occurs due to arthritis. Both degenerative osteoarthritis and inflammatory arthritis can lead to SI joint injury. Inflammatory arthritis of the SI joint is commonly known as sacroiliitis. When inflammatory changes are seen on imaging may be the sign of systemic disease. Imaging for SI joint dysfunction often includes an X-ray or MRI. Most cases of SI joint injury respond to conservative management, including physical therapy. However, some cases can require corticosteroid injections or even surgical repair.
