Laboratory tests should be done to rule out other conditions and assess for organ dysfunctions. The concern should be given to the possible presence of cardiac, gastrointestinal (GI), and urinary disorders and should include an echocardiogram, renal ultrasonogram, and intravenous pyelogram, respectively.

Radiographic evaluation of the cervical spine in patients with Klippel-Feil syndrome includes plain radiographs (X-rays), computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A thorough evaluation of the cervical spine is important prior to procedures like intubation, laryngoscopy, head manipulation, or intraoperative positioning due to the risk of atlantoaxial subluxation and craniovertebral dislocation to avoid any risk of causing spinal cord injury.

**X-Rays**

Commonly performed to illustrate the fusion of the vertebral bodies as well as facets and even spinous processes. The examination should include AP, lateral, and odontoid views in flexion and extension. These studies help to evaluate the stability of the atlantoaxial, atlantooccipital, and subaxial joints. The images of the thoracic and lumbar spine are necessary as well, since they may illustrate scoliosis, spinal bifida, or hemivertebrae. A wasp-waist sign (anterior-posterior narrowing) may be present. In a clinically stable patient, flexion/extension X-ray may illustrate spinal stability and movement.

**CT**

These images would provide additional details about the spinal anatomy and the bony structures, including bony fusion. These studies are especially useful for pre-operative planning when recommended.

**MRI**

MRI is useful in assessing the integrity of the spinal cord, disc space, nerve rootlets, ligaments, and rest of the soft tissue structures. This study can also illustrate other spinal cord abnormalities, such as Chiari malformations and diastematomyelia. MRIs are most useful in patients who present with neurologic deficits.
