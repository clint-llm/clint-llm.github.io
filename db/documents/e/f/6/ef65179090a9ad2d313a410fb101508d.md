Septic arthritis in the pediatric hip is an emergent surgical condition that if not rapidly treated, can lead to the rapid destruction of the hip, sepsis and even death. Septic arthritis of the pediatric hip needs to be differentiated from transient synovitis of the hip. Transient synovitis is a non-emergent and non-surgical condition that can resolve with symptomatic pain management and observation. It is important to recognize that that significant morbidity may result from the improper diagnosis of either of these conditions. Proper diagnosis includes identification of the infecting organism. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of the septic hip and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of the septic hip.
- Review the risk factors for septic hip in a child.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for a septic hip.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of septic hip and improve outcomes.
