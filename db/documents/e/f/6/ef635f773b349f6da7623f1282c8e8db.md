The purpose of gluconeogenesis is to maintain blood glucose levels during a fast. In the human body, some tissues rely almost exclusively on glucose as a metabolic fuel source. The brain, for example, requires approximately 120 g of glucose in 24 hours. While the brain is also capable of utilizing ketone bodies as an alternative fuel source, the testes, renal medulla, and erythrocytes all rely exclusively on glucose breakdown through glycolysis. For these tissues to function correctly, a steady influx of glucose into the bloodstream is essential. Hepatic glycogen stores are depleted following a 24-hour fast, after which time gluconeogenesis functions to synthesize glucose de novo from non-hexose precursors and maintain blood glucose levels.
