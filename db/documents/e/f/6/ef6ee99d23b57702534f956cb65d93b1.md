Closely related syndromes: Weber, Nothnagel, and Claude syndromes. These are all eponymously named syndromes relating to the midbrain's damage and are classically considered caused by cerebrovascular-related ischemia.

Weber syndrome is characterized by oculomotor palsy and contralateral hemiparesis. Underlying structures involved are thought to be the cerebral peduncle and oculomotor fascicles.

Claude syndrome shows oculomotor palsy and contralateral ataxia. Underlying structures involved are thought to be theÂ dentatorubrothalamic tract and oculomotor fascicles.

Nothnagel syndrome has oculomotor palsy and ipsilateral limb ataxia. Underlying structures involved are thought to be the superior cerebellar peduncle and tectum of the midbrain.
