The differential of pancreatic disease processes is challenging, but it can demonstrate significant morbidity and mortality in the population. Understanding the various imaging modalities available and when each is appropriate is of critical importance. CT and MR provide an excellent spatial resolution of the pancreatic anatomy and are the modalities of choice when considering the pancreas. EUS-FNA is highly specific and valuable in diagnosing pancreatic cystic lesions.
