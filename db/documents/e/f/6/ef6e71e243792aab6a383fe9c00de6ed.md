During the fifth week of the development of the embryo, the neural crest cells form, and the cells migrate on both sides in the thoracic region of the spinal cord, creating paired cell masses which is dorsolateral to the aorta that called ganglia. All these sympathetic ganglia are joined in a bilateral chain by longitudinal nerve fibers, which are called sympathetic trunks along each side of the vertebral bodies.

Plenty of neural crest cells relocate ventrally to the aorta to create neurons in the preaortic ganglia, such as the celiac and mesenteric ganglia. Some sympathetic axons migrate to a paravertebral ganglion when they can synapse with neurons; also they may descend or ascend at other points to synapse in the trunk. While other presynaptic fibers run without synapsing through the paravertebral ganglia, forming the viscera's splanchnic nerves to innervate the viscera.
