There is no cure for Gardner syndrome. The prognosis for a person diagnosed with Gardner syndrome varies; however, a patient with an APC gene mutation is almost certain to develop colon cancer by approximately the age of 40 if surgery is not performed and polyp growth controlled. Surveillance and management of symptoms are the most effective treatment options. Annual physical examinations, thyroid function evaluations beginning in the late teenage years, screenings 2 the colon can start as early as the age of 10 (continue every 1 to two years), and, possibly treatment with NSAIDs such as sulindac and COX2 inhibitors are all options to bettering the overall prognosis of a patient suffering from Gardner syndrome.
