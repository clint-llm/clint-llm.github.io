Dacryostenosis can evolve into an infection of the lacrimal sac (dacryocystitis), which, if left untreated, can cause complications such as endophthalmitis and orbital cellulitis. Signs and symptoms of acute dacryocystitis (erythema, swelling, warmth, tenderness of the lacrimal sac, and/or purulent discharge) must be identified. There is evidence that a relationship exists between congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction and subsequent refractive error disorders in children. In particular, 10% of children with congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction may develop anisometropia (with or without amblyopia).
