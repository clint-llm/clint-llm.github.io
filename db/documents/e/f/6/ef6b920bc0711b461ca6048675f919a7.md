Before starting biologic response modifier therapy, patients should undergo evaluation for latent TB with the past medical history of TB, tuberculin skin test, chest X-ray, and TB interferon. Latent TB should have treatment for nine months, and treatment with BRM can be started one month after the treatment initiation.Â This approach has demonstrated to decrease the rate of reactivation of TB.

All patients taking BRM should have monitoring for both treatment-related efficacy and safety. The patient's symptom relief, physical exam, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, autoimmune markers, radiography, CBC, and LFT can be used to monitor efficacy and safety.
