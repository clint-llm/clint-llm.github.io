In cystic echinococcosis, the prognosis is generally good compared to alveolar echinococcosis, where the prognosis is much worse, and the cure is dependent on early detection and complete surgical excision. Prognosis is poor when sites where surgical excision of the cyst poses a difficulty, especially when the heart and spinal cord are involved.
