An interprofessional team that uses a comprehensive and structured postoperative care strategy will help achieve the best possible outcomes. The role of nursing care cannot be undermined, especially in the event of surgical wound infections. Consultation with a social worker and community nurses might be necessary if the patient needs to be discharged home with a drain. A physical therapist might be needed in the event of deep vein thrombosis with long term immobility in the hospital. Communication, joint decision making, and cooperation remain the keys to positive outcomes. Early detection of symptoms and signs is the key to decreasing mortality, especially in this acute critical condition of myocardial rupture. Hence, interprofessional treatment should include an organized care framework paired with an evidence-based approach to coordinating and reviewing all collaborative operations.[Level III]

To improve outcomes and decrease the high mortality in LV rupture, prompt consultation with an interprofessional group of specialists is recommended. While cardiothoracic surgeons and anesthesiologists play primary roles during surgical intervention, cardiologists and intensive care specialists play a predominant role in pre/post-surgical management. Nurses play an important role as they monitor the vital signs, pre and postoperative management, and patient education. The pharmacist must ensure that the patient is on the right analgesics, antiemetics, and antibiotics in the event of wound infection.

Postoperative management of the patients required interprofessional integrated work to improve outcomes. Bed rest is essential as it prevents arterial hypertension or hypertensive crisis and is to be carefully checked by nurses. Heart rate control, optimum inotropic support, and avoiding agitation are best achieved by cooperation between the physicians, pharmacists, and nurses. Inotropic support postoperatively prevents tissue hypoperfusion.

In conclusion, left ventricular free-wall rupture is a potentially life-threatening mechanical complication of acute myocardial infarction. It mostly occurs in patients with ST-elevation MI. Other causes, such as infections and trauma, are also responsible. Diagnosis is markedly facilitated by a high index of suspicion and transthoracic echocardiography. Surgical intervention (Oxford CEBM level of evidence III) is the definitive treatment, and medical treatment includes fluids, inotropes, and vasopressors. American College of Cardiology highlights that making the diagnosis early is important, and the threshold for suspicion needs to be low. Emergent surgical intervention and stabilization of the patients improve survival.
