The prognosis of anisocoria depends entirely on the causative factor. There is no difference in mortality from most causes anisocoria compared to the general population, with the exception of two causative conditions.

Ruptured aneurysms causing a third nerve palsy have a very poor prognosis. Only fifty percent of patients survive a ruptured aneurysm after six months.

Anisocoria itself generally does not affect ocular health, and visual acuity usually is minimally affected. Visual prognosis is mostly based on the causative condition.
