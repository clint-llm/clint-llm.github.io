**Serum Testing**

Serum IgE testing is obtained by simple blood work; the clinician must specify each specific antibody to be tested and will be run with other similar allergens in panels. These panels are often expensive, and clinicians need to know how many different panels they are testing. Samples are analyzed via ELISA. In the ELISA, the antigen is placed on the plate, then the serum sample is added, and any IgE will bind to the allergen. The sample is then washed with an enzyme-substrate, and specific machines analyze the results. There are approved machines that read the results, and there can be some variations among the machines that physicians need to be aware of. RAST is no longer in use.

The other forms of allergy testing do not require specimen collections.
