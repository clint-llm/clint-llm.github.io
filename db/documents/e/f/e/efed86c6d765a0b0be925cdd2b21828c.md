Tricyclic antidepressants are one of the most frequently ingested substances used for self-poison in an attempt to commit suicide. A case fatality index is a tool used to measure ratios and compare toxic levels of drugs to one another.

Symptoms of intoxication and overdose can be grouped based on the organ system it affects. Overdose on doxepin can affect the central nervous system and cardiovascular system. Doxepin is known to block sodium and potassium channels on cardiomyocytes and can reduce cardiac action potential and depolarization and lead to cardiac arrhythmias.

Doxepin can also cause neurological effects such as coma, grand mal seizures, and respiratory depression.

Treatment options that are beneficial in patients with doxepin intoxication include sodium bicarbonate, hemodialysis/hemoperfusion, and in some cases, supportive therapy.
