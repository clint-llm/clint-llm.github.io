Congenital junctional ectopic tachycardia can occur without any previous heart surgery and can be even present at birth. It usually occurs in the first six months after birth. Postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardia usually occurs in patients who underwent repair of congenital heart defects. The risk factors that increase the risk of postoperative JET are postoperative use of dopamine, milrinone, higher postoperative core temperatures, electrolyte abnormalities, age less than six months, prolonged duration of surgery, and the type of surgery.
