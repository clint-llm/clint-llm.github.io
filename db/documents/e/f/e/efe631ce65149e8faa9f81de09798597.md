Patients who only have basic supportive measures have a mortality rate in excess of 90%. Even after surgery for pancreatic pseudoaneurysms, the mortality rates vary from 20-30%. The mortality for pancreatic pseudoaneurysm depends on the location of the pathology and not the type of treatment.

The highest mortality rates occur when the pseudoaneurysm is located in the head of the pancreas whereas surgery for the same pathology on the tail of the pancreas carries a low mortality

Embolization therapy has increased the success rates but there still is a high recurrence rate and overall mortality of about 16%.
