The frontal bone develops from neural crest cells controlled by Msx1 and Dlx5 genes; during development, the frontal boneÂ passes under membranous ossification.

The development of trochlea is not clear; recent studies describe the trochlea developing with superior oblique muscle tendon. It moves with the tendon and then develops as the fibrocartilaginous pully at 12 weeks of gestational age.

The supratrochlear nerve originates from the neural crest cell.
