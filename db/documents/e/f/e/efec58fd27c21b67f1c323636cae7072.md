Once the patient has undergone evacuation of lens abscess and culture reports are available targeted antimicrobial therapy should be given. Antibacterials and antifungals are the mainstays depending on the microorganism involved. Culture-negative cases can be treated with combination therapy. A detailed fundus evaluation by a retina specialist is a must in each case to rule out signs of posterior segment infection and inflammation.

Based on the clinical picture, the antibiotics and antifungals can be started at a dose of 6 to 8 times. If, on postoperative day 1, there is an infected corneal tear or hypopyon, and the focus of infection is there, the drugs should be given hourly. The medications should be tapered as the clinical condition of the patient improves. Steroids should be started under close supervision after 1 to 2 weeks of antimicrobial treatment. The patient should be explained and counseled regarding the prognosis of the cases and the need for suture removal and secondary IOL implantation. The patient should be followed up closely and counseled regarding the timely use of medications.
