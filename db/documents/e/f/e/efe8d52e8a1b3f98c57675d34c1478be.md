Wide local excision is the primary treatment for ALM.

The suggested excision depth is to the fascia or deep adipose, depending on the location. The AAD and AJCC guidelines suggest variable clinical, surgical margins depending on Breslow depth

- In-situ lesions: 0.5 to 1 cm clinical margins

- Breslow depth less than 1 mm: 1 cm clinical margin

- Breslow depth between 1.01 to 2 mm: 1 to 2 cm clinical margin

- Breslow depth greater than 2 mm: 2 cm clinical margin

Large defects on acral surfaces are hard to close primarily and may require skin grafting or flap reconstruction. Primary closure has better functional results, heals faster, leads to fewer patient complications, and has a lower cost.

Subungual melanomas are difficult to resect due to the proximity to the phalanx. The previous gold standard of treatment involved digit amputation.
