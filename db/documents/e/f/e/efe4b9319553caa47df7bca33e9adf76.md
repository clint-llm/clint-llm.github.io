Due to the rich blood supply and numerous Kupffer cells (stellate sinusoidal macrophages), the liver is a very common site for granuloma formation. Kupffer cells help clear foreign particles by phagocytosis and pinocytosis. When the macrophages are unable to clear the stimulus of inflammation, a further inflammatory process is initiated, resulting in an aggregation of macrophages around the source of the inflammatory stimulus. This aggregation, along with a peripheral cuff of lymphocytes, form an inflammatory focus called a granuloma.
