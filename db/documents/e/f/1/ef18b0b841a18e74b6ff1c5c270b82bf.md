Caution is necessary when prescribing stimulants for ADHD to patients with comorbid conditions such as pre-existing psychosis and bipolar illness because they may worsen behavior disturbances and thought disorders that might occur in these patients. Detailed psychiatric history, including a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression screening, should be considered in these patients to evaluate the risk of bipolar disorder.

**Cardiovascular Events**(US black box warning)

Sudden death is one of the main concerns associated with CNS stimulant treatment. Misuse or even usual doses of amphetamine in children and adolescents with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious heart problems may cause sudden death and serious cardiovascular adverse events. Avoid prescribing amphetamine to patients with known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, or other serious cardiac problems that could increase the risk of sudden death.

Evaluating cardiovascular status in patients before the initiation of stimulant medication is highly recommended. A careful history and physical exam, including all the possible risk factors such as a family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, should undergo assessment for the presence of cardiac disease. Additional cardiac evaluation with electrocardiogram and echocardiogram should take place if finding suggests cardiac disease.

**Abuse/Misuse/Diversion**(US black box warning)

Amphetamines are DEA Schedule II controlled substances with a high potential for misuse and dependence. Avoid administration for extended periods as it may lead to drug dependence. Particular attention should focus on the possibility of subjects obtaining amphetamines for non-therapeutic use. The drug should not be distributed to others, and healthcare professionals should prescribe or dispense the medication sparingly.

Assess the risk of abuse before prescribing, and monitor for signs of misuse and dependence while on therapy. Clinicians should exercise caution with this drug in patients with a history of ethanol or drug use disorder.

Documentation strongly suggests the interaction with concurrent use of amphetamine and monoamine oxidase inhibitor drugs is contraindicated as it may result in a hypertensive crisis.

Although available documentation is poor, pharmacologic considerations lead physicians to suspect the interaction of amphetamine and thiazide diuretics. The interaction may be life-threatening as it may result in increased exposure to amphetamine.

Concurrent use of amphetamine and serotonergic agents that inhibit CYP2D6 may increase amphetamine exposure and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.

Concurrent use of ascorbic acid and amphetamines may cause decreased amphetamine efficacy in patients.
