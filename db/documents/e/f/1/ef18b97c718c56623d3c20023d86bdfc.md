According to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, there are 12 injury-related emergency department visits for every 100 persons over the age of 65 annually. Geriatric patients account for a quarter of trauma admissions nationally. Cervical spine injuries are relatively common in the elderly population.

The percentage of elderly patients with trauma has been on the rise and will continue to increase into the ensuing decades.
