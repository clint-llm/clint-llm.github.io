Due to the lack of sensitivity and specificity of physical examination, prompt screening and testing are required to establish the diagnosis. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) help to distinguish between restrictive and obstructive impairment. An out-of-proportion decrease in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) may predict the development of pulmonary hypertension and the need for further investigation. In general, a low DLCO (<40% of predicted) or rapid decline in DLCO (≥ 15%), and a DLCO disproportionate to lung volumes (i.e., FVC/DLCO ratio > 1.6), is a trigger for a low threshold for suspicion for PH.

Six-minute walk test (6MWT) and oxygen saturation on exertion also give insight into the underlying presence of PH. A worsening six-minute walk distance (6MWD) despite stable PFT, need for oxygen supplementation on exertion, and slow heart rate recovery in one minute can predict underlying PH.

When there is high clinical suspicion of pulmonary hypertension, the consensus from experts recommends obtaining echocardiography and Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) or NT-proBNP. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is considered the most useful non-invasive screening test for PH. Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) can be estimated using the peak tricuspid regurgitation velocity, and systolic pulmonary artery pressures (sPAP) can be predicted using inferior vena cava (IVC) dilatation and collapsibility as a surrogate marker for right atrial pressures. TTE also helps to distinguish between pre-capillary and post-capillary hypertension by measuring left-sided parameters such as left atrial dilation and elevated diastolic filling pressures. Several studies, however, have shown that estimation of pressure through TTE can significantly overestimate the RVSP in chronic lung disease and lead to overdiagnosis of group 3 PH.

Serum biomarkers such as BNP or N terminal-pro-BNP concentrations are useful screening tools for assessing patients with ILD-related-PH. Serum BNP levels are an independent prognostic marker used for risk evaluation. BNP, however, loses sensitivity when PH is cofounded by left heart disease.

Pulmonary hypertension can be multifactorial and present as a spectrum of diseases due to the right and left heart disease. Right heart catheterization (RHC) is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of PH due to chronic lung disease and hypoxia. RHC can be valuable in distinguishing between pre- and post-capillary disease or the presence of combined pre-capillary and post-capillary disease. RHC is recommended for patients with exaggerated symptoms not explained by the extent of the underlying condition, patients undergoing evaluation for treatment with vasodilators, and patients being considered for a lung transplant. However, a low threshold for RHC is appropriate to confirm a PH diagnosis, particularly in those with high clinical suspicion of PH and right ventricular abnormalities on echocardiography (including dilation or enlargement and a low tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion) and in those with autoimmune ILD.

In addition to PFT and 6MWD, other useful testing modalities are chest Computed Tomography (CT) scans which can be very useful to evaluate ILD stability or progression when symptoms are disproportionate to the severity of the underlying ILD.

CT scan of the chest is commonly obtained in patients with COPD and ILD to measure the disease's extent and screen for lung cancer. There is no significant correlation between the extent of parenchymal changes seen on high-resolution CT imaging and the presence and degree of PH.

The ratio of the main pulmonary artery to ascending aorta greater than 0.9 in IPF predicted PH and worse outcomes.
