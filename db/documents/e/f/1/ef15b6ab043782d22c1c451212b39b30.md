ECCO2R is not an FDA-approved therapy in the USA. There are multiple clinical trials underway to explore its utility in clinical settings mentioned above: COPD and ARDS. Like any extracorporeal device, this is a very resource-intensive and expensive technology. With the potential for complications, there is a need for close monitoring by physicians, nurses, ECMO specialists, and perfusionists with specialized training. There are two other forms of ECCOR2 devices undergoing clinical trials, including respiratory dialysis and gas exchange catheters, the former removes the carbon dioxide in wet form using available dialysis equipment, increasing hopes of decreasing the cost and potentially reducing the complication rates.
