Patients with atrial flutter can be asymptomatic or present with symptoms as palpitations, lightheadedness, fatigue, and shortness of breath especially in the presence of rapid ventricular conduction.

Decreased exercise tolerance is another symptom that can be present during patient evaluation.

During the rapid ventricular rate, hypotension, syncope and near syncope can occur in susceptible patients with high ventricular rates.

Some patients remain asymptomatic until they develop acutely decompensated heart failure, tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, and embolic stroke.

The physical exam in patients with atrial flutter will show regular or irregularly regular peripheral pulse (due to variable conduction from the atrioventricular node), jugular venous distension, respiratory sounds with crackles in lung fields, tachycardia, abdominal distention, and lower extremities edema when congestion occurs.
