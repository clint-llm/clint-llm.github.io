These reactions can be diagnosed by a skin test of delayed hypersensitivity using antigens and confirmed by history and clinical presentation. For example, the tuberculin test in a patient with pulmonary tuberculosis can give an overwhelming reaction, but this would not occur in a patient with sarcoidosis. A patient should be tested with an array of allergens to prove which of them is causing the problem. The culture of microorganisms can be useful in demonstrating the cause of the delayed hypersensitivity disorder, especially for tuberculosis (sputum culture). Histopathology can be of chief importance in making a diagnosis of a DH reaction or disease. The suspected tissue can be biopsied to prove the nature of the disease and treated accordingly. Immunological testing should be carried out routinely and includeÂ complete blood cell count (CBC), T-cell subpopulation, radioallergosorbent test (RAST), and other tests include serology, chest x-ray, body radiographs, and also diagnostic ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scan.
