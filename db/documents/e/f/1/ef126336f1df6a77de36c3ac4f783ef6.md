Even though the sensitivity and specificity of the Ziehl-Neelsen stain for pulmonary tuberculosis can be up to 70% and 97.1%, respectively, several factors can interfere with accurate and valid reporting of results.

Pre-analytical factors such as wrongly labeling the sample, inappropriately storing and transporting the specimen, and poor technique for sample collection can all result in a discrepancy of the microscopy results. Sample for sputum microscopy must be expectorated from the lungs; failure to do so may significantly affect the sensitivity of this test as well. Exposure to direct sunlight and the excessive heat can also destroy a significant number of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum sample, thereby rendering the results compromised.

Analytical factors such as poor smearing, staining, and microscopy can also hamper the results of acid-fast microscopy. Appropriate smearing requires correct smear size, thickness, and fixation. Improper staining of the slides can be caused by slide contamination, incorrect staining time, over or under-heating the stain, and blotting the smear with paper for drying.

Post-analytical factors can involve mix-up and release of mismatched patient results and other clerical mistakes (e.g., inappropriately reporting a scanty result of "+3" as "3+"). Long turnaround time and incorrect result interpretation can also potentially hinder the use of acid-fast microscopy as a diagnostic tool.
