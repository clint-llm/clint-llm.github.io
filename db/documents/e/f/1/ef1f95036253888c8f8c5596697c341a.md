A multi-disciplinary team approach is required for timely accurate patient evaluation, management, and long-term rehabilitation of patients with lagophthalmos. Members of the team can include emergency, stroke, and family physicians, ophthalmologists, ENT surgeons, radiologists, neurologists, maxillofacial surgeons, nursing staff, speech therapists, dieticians, pharmacists, and physiotherapist.

Presentation of lagophthalmos due to different etiologies can presentÂ to an emergency as well as primary care staff, hence familiarity with the assessment and management is essential for clinicians. Nursing staff working on head and neck wards will need to recognize the signs and symptoms of facial nerve paralysis. Pharmacists will need to verify all dosing, medication checks, and liaise with medical staff in administering the medication. Rehabilitation will closely involve physiotherapists, speech and language therapists, and dieticians in patients with lagophthalmos secondary to facial nerve paralysis. A psychologist can also aid the patient's recovery from the psychological impact of facial nerve paralysis.
