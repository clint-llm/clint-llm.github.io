- Dissociative Experiences Scale -28-item self-report instrument whose items tap the absorption of outside information, use of imagination depersonalization, derealization, and amnesia primarily.

- Dissociation Questionnaire -63 questions that measure-measures identity confusion and fragmentation, loss of control, amnesia, and absorption.

- Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)- 36-question subjective questions around challenges in goal-directed work, impulsivity, emotional responses to situations, ability to self regulate emotions, etc.
