Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a very rare congenital cardiomyopathy. It is a disease of endomyocardial trabeculations that increase in number and prominence. This cardiomyopathy carries a high risk of malignant arrhythmias, thromboembolic phenomenon and left ventricular dysfunction. This disease also has other names like spongy myocardium, spongiform cardiomyopathy, hypertrabeculation, persisting myocardial sinusoids or zaspopathy. It can carries associations with complex congenital heart defects or skeletal myopathy. It represents the arrest of the normal maturation process of the myocardium. This disease can present throughout life with progressive left ventricular systolic dysfunction. This activity reviews the role of health professionals working together to manage left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy.
- Describe the evaluation of left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy.
- Summarize the treatment of left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy.
