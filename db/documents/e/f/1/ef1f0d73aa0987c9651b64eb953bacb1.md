As mentioned previously, PSAs are the most common complication that results after percutaneous procedures performed by a cardiologist, interventional radiologist, or vascular surgeon. Incidence has been reported from 0.5% to up to 9% in some series. There are other rare causes such as surgical intervention or blunt and penetrating trauma. There are a few case reports which have reported femoral artery PSA due to slipped capital femoral epiphysis treatment. However, percutaneous interventionsÂ are the leading cause of PSA formation.
