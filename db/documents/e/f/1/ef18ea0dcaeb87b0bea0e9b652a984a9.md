Alpha-blockers fall into three different categories.

**1. Nonselective Alpha-blockers (alpha-1  and alpha-2)**

Nonselective alpha-blockers include phenoxybenzamine and phentolamine. Both of these medications have FDA approval for use in patients with pheochromocytoma.

Phenoxybenzamine is irreversible and phentolamine is reversible alpha-blockers. Both are used intraoperatively to manage hypertensive crisis during pheochromocytoma removal.

Phentolamine sees occasional use in the treatment of cocaine-induced cardiovascular complications. In this situation, the use of β-blockers is less desirable due to the risk of unopposed α-adrenergic receptor-mediated coronary vasoconstriction and hypertension. Although it is worth mentioning that it is not a first-line agent for this condition.

**2. Selective Alpha-1 Blockers**

Selective alpha-1 blocker ends with the suffix "-osin." These medications include alfuzosin, doxazosin, terazosin, tamsulosin, and prazosin.

These medications are FDA approved to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).

These medications may also be options to treat essential hypertension. However, they are not typically first-line agents for the management of hypertension.

**3. Selective Alpha-2 Blockers**

Selective alpha-2 blockers include the medications yohimbine and idazoxan.

Yohimbine has been used to treat male sexual dysfunction, although the effectiveness has not yet been established and is not currently FDA approved for this use or any other uses.

Idazoxan is being used in research, but has no established clinical role has established.
