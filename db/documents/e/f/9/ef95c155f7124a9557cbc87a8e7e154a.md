Mediastinal seminoma is a malignant germ cell tumor in the mediastinum. The tumor usually occurs in the anterior-superior mediastinum in males aged 20-40 years old. The first-line treatment is with cisplatin based chemotherapy. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it must be promptly diagnosed and treated by a multidisciplinary team consisting of medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and thoracic surgeons. When treatment is started early survival rates are > 90% 5 year survival.
