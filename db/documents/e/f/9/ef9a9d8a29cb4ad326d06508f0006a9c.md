Each pancreatic endocrine cell releases one specific hormone. The alpha cells release glucagon, a peptide hormone that raises the concentration of glucose and fatty acids in the bloodstream and is the primary catabolic hormone in the body. The beta cells release insulin, a peptide hormone that decreases glucose concentration in the blood by stimulating glucose uptake by the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue via specialized receptors. The delta cells release somatostatin, which inhibits the secretion of both glucagon and insulin. The epsilon cells release ghrelin, a hormone that stimulates appetite, increases fat storage, and stimulates the growth hormone release from the pituitary gland. The PP cells release pancreatic polypeptide, which is a satiety hormone that decreases gastric acid secretion, gastric emptying, and upper intestinal motility. These cells communicate through extracellular spaces and gap junctions and influence the release of hormones by each other. For example, glucagon release by alpha cells suppresses insulin release by beta cells and vice versa, and somatostatin release by delta cells inhibits the secretion of both glucagon and insulin by the alpha and beta cells.
