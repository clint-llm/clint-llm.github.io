The evaluation of IPMNs usually starts with imaging to evaluate the characteristics of the cyst, involvement of adjacent structures, and evidence of distant metastasis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is first line. Computed tomography (CT) with pancreatic protocol is an alternative in patients whom MRIs are contraindicated. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with fine-needle aspiration (FNA) should be used to assess cysts with malignant features, including large size, dilation of the main pancreatic duct, and/or presence of a solid component. Cystic fluid cytology can be assessed to look for atypical or malignant cells. Fluid markers, especially carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), can help with the diagnosis as well. Cysts with a solid component and a dilated pancreatic duct or have malignant features on EUS and FNA should undergo surgical resection. Cysts with no concerning features should be monitored with MRIs.
