Chlorine gas exposure usually has a good prognosis, with most exposed individuals recovering without significant residual deficits. Pulmonary edema appears to be the most common cause of morbidity for moderate-to-severe exposures. This usually occurs within 2 to 4 hours of exposure to moderate chlorine concentration (25 to 50 ppm) or 30 to 60 minutes of severe exposure (greater than 50 ppm). Resolution of pulmonary abnormalities usually ensues a week to a month after exposure. Smokers and patients with asthma are likely to have persistent obstructive pulmonary defects.

Studies on theÂ long-term adverse effects from acute chlorine exposure are inconclusive, with some studies showing decreased vital capacity, diffusing capacity, and total lung capacity and others showing no consistent pattern of pulmonary function deficits.
