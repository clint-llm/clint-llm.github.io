Clonidine toxicity can impact many organ systems, and it is important to have an interprofessional team looking after the patient. The majority of patients initially present to the emergency department. Hence, all interprofessional team members (clinicians, including PAs and NPs, nurses, and pharmacists) should be familiar with the drug toxicity symptoms. The triage nurse should quickly admit the patient and inform the emergency department physician. All unstable patients need monitoring in an ICU setting.

Stable patients can be discharged and need to be educated on how to store the medication away from the reach of children properly. For those with intentional overdose, a mental health consult is necessary beforeÂ discharge.

The pharmacist should educate the patient on drug safety and keep the medication away from the reach of children. The dose of the drug should not be altered by the patient. If drug dosage is altered by a team member, the entire team looking after the patient should be notified. Only with open communication with the team members can the outcomes be improved.

For the majority of patients with clonidine toxicity, the prognosis is good with treatment. However, those who delay seeking treatment may suffer adverse cardiac or neurological problems. Deaths from clonidine toxicity are very rare.

The above points out the importance of an interprofessional team approach to clonidine toxicity to provide the best possible outcomes with a good prognosis. [Level 5]
