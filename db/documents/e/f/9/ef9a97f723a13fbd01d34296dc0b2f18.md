Rifampin is generally a well-tolerated drug but is associated with both dose-dependent and dose-independent adverse effects.

- Dose-dependent side effects include orange discoloration of body fluids like; tears (which can stain the patient's contact lenses), sweat, saliva, urine, and feces due to its excretion in these fluids, and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, anorexia, and diarrhea.

- Even though it is a rare presentation, in the case of diarrhea, testing for Clostridium difficile infection is indicated to rule out rifampin-induced pseudomembranous colitis. Adding metronidazole and discontinuing rifampin have been described to remarkably improve symptoms in these cases.

- Constipation is the most common side effect when used for pruritus associated with PBC.

- Hepatotoxicity can occur, especially in those with preexisting liver disease.

- Dose-independent adverse effects include hypersensitive reactions like urticaria, flu-like symptoms, thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and renal failure. These hypersensitivity reactions are common when used intermittently or for a prolonged duration. Many of the before-mentioned side effects tend to resolve after discontinuation of rifampin.
