**Cannabinoid Receptors in the Eye**

CB1 and CB2 receptors have been identified widely in the eye. CB1 receptors have been identified in corneal epithelium and endothelium, ciliary body, iris, Schlemm canal, trabecular meshwork, choroid, and many retinal layers: ganglion cell, inner and outer plexiform, inner nuclear, and outer segments of photoreceptors cells.

**Cannabinoids Effects on Intraocular Pressure**

THC has been identified as the metabolite relevant to IOP-lowering, and this potential to treat glaucoma has been the subject of research over the past five decades.

Reports about the use of THC to regulate IOP date back to 1971 when Helper and Frank published preliminary data about the effect of marijuana in lowering IOP, in which healthy patients demonstrated a 25% decrease in IOP after smoking THC.

Other delivery methods have been studied in human and animal models with variable results. Healthy human subjects received intravenous (IV) THC at different doses resulting in a moderate decrease in IOP (average 37% decrease) with a reported increase in heart rate and pulse.

One of the challenges of topical administration of THC is its poor aqueous solubility. In a study conducted in rabbits, combining a TCH prodrug with surfactants and cyclodextrins helped improve aqueous solubility and corneal permeability compared to THC alone. Its IOP lowering capacity was comparable in duration and potency to timolol and pilocarpine.

The exact mechanism by which cannabinoids decrease IOP has not been elucidated. It has been proposed that CB1 receptors in the trabecular meshwork, Schelmm canal, and ciliary body may modulate aqueous production and also improve trabecular outflow.

**Cannabinoids: Neuroprotective Effects**

It has been hypothesized that THC may play a role in neuroprotection. In one study, healthy human subjects were administered a low dose of dronabinol, a synthetic form of THC, and an improvement in optic nerve head blood flow at rest was noted. However, IOP, ocular perfusion pressure (OPP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) did not show any changes. Also, low-dose oral administration did not induce any psychoactive side effects.

In another study in healthy human subjects, oral administration of a slightly higher dose of dronabinol resulted in a significant decrease in IOP and improved retinal arteriovenous passage time, indicating an increase in retinal hemodynamics suggesting potential use in ocular disorders associated with inadequate blood perfusion. This study showed no adverse cardiovascular or respiratory side effects.

Other animal studies have shown that systemic administration of cannabinoids may increase blood flow to the choroid, iris, and ciliary bodyÂ and reduce retinal ganglion cell layer loss in animal models of ischemic/traumatic optic nerve injury.

There are three proposed pathways through which cannabinoids exert their neuroprotective effect: inhibition of glutamate, nitric oxide, and endothelin-1. It is known that glutamate is toxic to RGC in glaucoma and has been implicated in progressive degeneration in chronic optic neuropathies.

Cannabinoids also have vasodilation properties; once CB1 and CB2 receptors are activated, there is an inhibition of endothelin-1 release. Inhibition of endothelin-1 vasoconstrictive effect results in increased blood supply to the optic nerve head, which can play a neuroprotective role in disease progression.
