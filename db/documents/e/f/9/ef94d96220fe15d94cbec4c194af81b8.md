Acute cobalt toxicity can cause severe illness. Patients who have cardiomyopathy have an associated high mortality rate. There is little data on chelation in the treatment of non-arthroplastic cobalt toxicity. Chelation is likely to improve recovery from cardiomyopathy based on case reports in patients with arthroplastic cobalt toxicity.

The prognosis of arthroprosthetic cobalt toxicity is dependent on early identification and subsequent arthroplasty revision. Arthroplasty revision effectively decreases cobalt concentrations in blood and serum and is associated with clinical recovery.

The recovery degree likely depends on the duration of exposure to elevated levels. In some cases, patients are given chelation after removal and do not haveÂ complete recovery. Persistent symptoms range from tinnitus and hearing loss to a cardiomyopathy requiring left-ventricular assist device implantation.

Patients with hard metal lung disease often recover once the exposure source is removed.
