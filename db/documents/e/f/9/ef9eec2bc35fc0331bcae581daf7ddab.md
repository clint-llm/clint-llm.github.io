Patients with open fractures usually present to the emergency department; however, unlike the routine closed fracture, these fractures are always serious and need prompt treatment. The triage nurse in the ED must be fully aware of the seriousness of this injury and ensure prompt admission and referral to an orthopedic surgeon. Procedures are well established in most emergency departments on how to manage open fractures. The key is to minimize bacterial contamination of the wound and prompt management in the operating room. The outcomes of open wound do vary depending on the extent of the injury, degree of contamination, time to treatment and patient comorbidity. The latest data indicate that internal fixation does lead to better outcomes in most tibial fractures but in severe injuries, external fixation continues to be the appropriate choice. With prompt treatment, the risk of infection and non-union have also decreased. However, for most patients open fractures are always associated with a prolonged recovery period and most patients do develop some degree of functional disability.
