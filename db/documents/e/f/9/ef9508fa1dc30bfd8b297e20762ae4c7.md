Gastric polyps are intraluminal projections of mucosal or submucosal tissue. They are generally asymptomatic and, as such, are typically found incidentally on upper endoscopy. While these lesions are typically benign, they do have the potential of containing local dysplasia and progression to invasive cancer. This risk can be mitigated by proper understanding and management of gastric polyps. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of gastric polyps and explains the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of gastric polyps.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of gastric polyps and their subtypes.
- Outline the management options available for gastric polyps and their subtypes.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and improve outcomes for patients with gastric polyps.
