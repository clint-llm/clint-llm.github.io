A cystocele is not a life-threatening condition on its own. However, it is progressive, and if left without proper management, it can cause a myriad of symptoms and conditions. Due to the protrusion of the bladder wall into the vagina, women might experience urinary symptoms and voiding dysfunction, which might be implicated with urinary tract infections and kidney damage. If the prolapse is beyond the vaginal opening, the mucosal tissue of the vagina can develop ulcers, and it is more prone to bleeding and infection. The psychological burden stemming from sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence can also be significant.
