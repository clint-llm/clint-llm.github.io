The primary care physician or gastroenterologist determines the most appropriate bowel preparation for a patient. Often, the decision can be collaborative because the primary care physician may have greater knowledge regarding medical history that may contraindicate certain bowel regimens. The gastroenterologist is most likely to decide on care because they have more in-depth knowledge about bowel regimens and can educate and instruct the patient on properly administering the regimen. In the inpatient setting, the nursing staff plays a pivotal role in monitoring the patient for complaints, side effects and ensuring complete and proper administration of the regimen.
