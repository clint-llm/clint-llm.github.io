W. Waldeyer coined the term "chromosome" in 1888.Â Sexual chromosomes are essential in development. The sexual organs that will develop will depend on the presence or absence of the Y chromosome in the cells of the embryo. With a Y chromosome, the embryo will become a boy, while with two Xs, a girl will grow.

We can find many different chromosomes. Chromosome 1 is the largest of the human chromosomes, made up of approximately 249 million base pairs of the nucleotide, and accounts for approximately 8% of the entire DNA within a human cell.

By convention, chromosomes are numbered based on the quantity of nucleotides present (size):

- Chromosome 2 with about 243 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 3 is the third largest and has nearly 200 million nucleotides.

- Chromosome 4 has approximately 192 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 5 with 181 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 6 with about 170 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 7 with about 158 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 8 has over 146 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 9 has over 140 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 10 has about 135 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 11 has just under 135 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 12 has approximately 132 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 13 has about 114 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 14 has approximately 106 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 15 has around 100 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 16 has approximately 89 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 17 has approximately 79 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 18 has about 76 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 19 has nearly 64 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 20 has approximately 62 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 21 has approximately 47 million nucleotides

- Chromosome 22 has approximately 50 million nucleotides
