Pain on mandibular movement, headaches, and referred pain point towards a muscular cause; tenderness on TMJ palpation and joint sounds suggest an intraarticular problem.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging study to assess the TMJ due to its capacity to accurately show joint effusion, disc displacement, and soft tissues.
