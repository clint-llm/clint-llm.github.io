Antacids are a group of drugs that have been on the market for many years. They were initially first-line defense against peptic ulcer disease; however, the discovery of proton pump inhibitors revolutionized the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Currently, antacid use is restricted to relieving mild intermittent gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) associated with heartburn.

Antacids are medications that do not require a prescription; in other words, they are self-prescribed. Antacids are a combination of various compounds with various salts of calcium, magnesium, and aluminum as active ingredients. The antacids act by neutralizing the acid in the stomach and by inhibiting pepsin, which is a proteolytic enzyme. Each of these cationic salts has a characteristic pharmacological property that determines its clinical use. Antacids have therapeutic use for the following

- Heartburn symptoms in GERD

- Duodenal and gastric ulcers

- Stress gastritis

- Pancreatic insufficiency

- Non-ulcer dyspepsia

- Diarrhea caused by bile-acid

- Biliary reflux

- Constipation

- Osteoporosis

- Urinary alkalinization

- Phosphate binding in chronic renal failure
