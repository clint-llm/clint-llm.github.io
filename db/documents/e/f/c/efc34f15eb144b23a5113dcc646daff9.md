The diagnosis and management of tricuspid regurgitation is with an interprofessional team consisting of a cardiologist, cardiac surgeon, internist, primary care provider, and nurse practitioner.Â The preference of treatment depends on the severity of tricuspid regurgitation, etiology, and the presence and the extent of associated abnormalities including pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and other valve conditions.

Management of severe tricuspid regurgitation includes medical therapy, counseling regarding pregnancy and physical activity, consideration of tricuspid valve surgery, and evaluation and treatment of the underlying cause.

Mild cases are usually managed medically but severe cases require open heart surgery. The tricuspid valve can be repaired or replaced depending on the status of the leaflets. Because of the risk of thrombosis, all mechanical valves in the tricuspid position need anticoagulation. Patients need to be monitored for INR regularly. The outcomes of tricuspid regurgitation are usually fair to good.
