**History**

When evaluating for thiamine deficiency, the typical history may include poor nutritional intake, excessive alcohol intake, or the patient belonging to the special populations of individuals previously mentioned (pregnant women, recipients of bariatric surgery, patients with prolonged diuretic use, anyone with poor overall nutritional status, etc.).

Initial symptoms of B1 deficiency include anorexia, irritability, and difficulties with short-term memory. With prolonged thiamine deficiency, patients may endorse loss of sensation in the extremities, symptoms of heart failure including swelling of the hands or feet, chest pain related to demand ischemia, or feelings of vertigo, double vision, and memory loss. Additionally, close friends and family of the patient may describe confusion or symptoms of confabulation.

**Physical Exam**

Dry beriberi:

- Evidence of symmetric peripheral neuropathy with motor and sensory changes

- Diminished reflexes

Wet beriberi - cardiovascular compromise related to impaired myocardial energy metabolism and dysautonomia:

- Dilated cardiomyopathy

- Tachycardia

- High-output congestive heart failure

- Peripheral edema

Wet and dry beriberi often have overlapping features, and in either condition, paresthesias may be a presenting feature.

Wernicke’s encephalopathy (WE) is a classic triad of ocular abnormalities (nystagmus, ophthalmoplegia), confusion, and gait changes such as ataxia.

Wernicke’s encephalopathy with additional symptoms of memory loss and psychosis with confabulation is consistent with WKS.
