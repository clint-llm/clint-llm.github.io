DFUs are most common in patients who have diabetic peripheral neuropathy and angiopathy as well as a foot deformity, such as Charcot foot. The combination of an insensate foot and structural and biomechanical alterations present a perfect composition for a small scrape or cut or an area of prolonged pressure to develop into an ulcer in a fairly short period in a patient with DM and poor glycemic control. The classic Charcot or "rocker bottom" foot that is seen in longstanding patients with DM places the patient at even greater risk for developing ulcers on parts of the foot that are not designed to be major weight-bearing surfaces. Most patients with DFUs have poor glycemic control and do not regularly inspect their feet or receive routine podiatric care as primary prevention. Prolonged hyperglycemia impairs leukocyte function and makes these wounds prone to infection with both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.
