**Band shaped keratopathy:**Spheroidal degeneration and Salzmann nodular degeneration are important differentials of BSK.

**PBK and ABK:**Corneal decompensation secondary to Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy is an important differential. Examination of the other eye helps differentiate between two.

**Striate keratopathy:**Corneal edema secondary to Descemet's membrane detachment is an important differential.

**Whorl keratopathy:**Iron lines are among the major differentials.

**Exposure keratopathy:**Inferiorly located corneal ulcer is an important differential diagnosis.

**Infectious crystalline keratopathy:**Bacterial keratitis, viral keratitis, fungal keratitis, cystinosis, Bietti crystalline dystrophy, Schnyder crystalline dystrophy, and many other conditions mimic ICK.

**Metabolic keratopathy:**Being bilateral and diffuse in cases of MPS, it may get confused with corneal dystrophies like congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy or congenital hereditary stromal dystrophy. Arcus can be a differential diagnosis for the KF ring.

**Filamentary keratopathy:**One differential is mucus debris on the ocular surface.

**Climatic droplet keratopathy:**The fine variants of spheroidal degeneration are often mistaken for microcystic corneal edema.

**Lipid keratopathy:**Interstitial keratitis is an important differential.

**Superficial punctate keratopathy:**Microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis and Thygeson's punctate keratopathy are major differential diagnoses for SPK.

**VKC related keratopathy:**Atopic keratoconjunctivitis is the major differential.

**Keratopathy related to SJS/TEN:**Mycoplasma induced rash and mucositis; and erythema multiforme are major differential diagnoses.
