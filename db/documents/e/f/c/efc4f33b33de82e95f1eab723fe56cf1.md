Ergotamine/caffeine, also known as ergotamine tartrate, is FDA approved to terminate or prevent vascular headaches such as migraines, variations of migraines, or cluster headaches. Since this is a migraine-specific agent, it is for use in patients who present with more severe symptoms and whose migraines have not responded to NSAIDs or combination analgesics. Additionally, because there are other medication options for the acute treatment of migraines that have fewer side effects, it is recommended that clinicians weigh the options and only prescribe ergotamine/caffeine to patients with attacks greater than 48 hours or frequent headache recurrence.Â Ergotamine/caffeine is also indicated for autonomic failure because it improves seated blood pressure and presyncopal symptoms; this is not an FDA approved indication.
