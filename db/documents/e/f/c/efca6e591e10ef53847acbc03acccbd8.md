Lafora disease is an autosomal recessive disorder. Siblings have a 50% chance of being carriers and a 25% chance of having the disease. Therefore, genetic counseling for families is extremely important as prenatal testing and diagnosis is possible.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of Lafora disease is crucial for the development of appropriate treatment strategies. Lafora disease remains a disabling and potentially lethal condition that would certainly benefit from more in-depth research and advancement in epilepsy therapy.
