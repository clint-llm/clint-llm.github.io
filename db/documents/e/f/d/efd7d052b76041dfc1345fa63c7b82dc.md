The blood supply to the proximal radius is provided primarily by the radial and radial recurrent arteries. The radial recurrent artery travels proximally to anastomose with the radial collateral artery. Blood supply to the middle and distal radius is through the radial, posterior interosseous, and anterior interosseous arteries.

Lymph from the radius drains via the deep lymphatic vessels which follow the deep veins such as the brachial, ulnar, and radial veins.  These vessels drain into the humeral axillary lymph nodes.
