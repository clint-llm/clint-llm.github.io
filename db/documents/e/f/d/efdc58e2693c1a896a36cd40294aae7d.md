Vertebral artery dissection (VAD) is a rare cause of stroke in the general population; however, represents one of the more common causes of stroke in patients younger than 45 years of age. ItsÂ signs and symptoms can be vague, and diagnosis can be elusive.

The majority of dissections are intracranial. It is estimated that vertebral artery dissection may be responsible for at least 20% of ischemic strokes in young people.
