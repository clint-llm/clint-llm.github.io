Crohn disease is extremely complex and difficult to diagnose and manage, and such it requires an interprofessional team including primary care clinicians, specialists (gastroenterologists and dermatologists), NPs and PAs, nurses, and pharmacists. All these disciplines need to coordinate their activities and communicate openly to work as a unit to improve patient outcomes. [Level 5]

The disorder has many extraintestinal manifestations that may sometimes precede the intestinal symptoms. The skin manifestations may present around the perianal and orofacial area. The primary caregiver, nurse practitioner, emergency department physician, and internist may be the first to see patients with cutaneous Crohn disease. Without a biopsy, the diagnosis is not possible. Hence, a thorough history should be obtained, and if abdominal symptoms are present, the patient should be referred to the gastroenterologist for management. These patients are typically managed medically, but many need surgery to manage the complications. These patients often develop severe anxiety and stress about the diagnosis, and hence a mental health consultation should be made early in the course of the disease. The outlook for patients with Crohn disease is guarded. Almost every patient will develop a serious complication, and the overall quality of life is poor.
