Lewy bodies (LB) are protein inclusions containing disaggregated oligomers of many cellular proteins. The German neurologist named Friederich Lewy

The disaggregation of alpha-synuclein, Ub, and LN are a pathognomonic neuropathological finding on autopsy in patients with PD, and DLB, found in many regions within the central nervous system including the cerebral cortex, limbic cortex, substantia nigra, hippocampus. Structurally, they are single, multiple, or polymorphic. It characterizes them into two major groups: classical or cortical LB. The classifications are based on morphology, cellular components, and location within the brain. Although Lewy Bodies are implicated in many of these disorders, it is debatable whether they are a consequence of cellular damage and dysfunction within the neuro integrity or a cause itself of the clinicopathological symptoms seen in patients. This article briefly covers the different anatomical, clinical and biochemical pathologies involved with Lewy body formation. The goal is not to provide an exhaustive description of LBs, rather a snapshot that can be useful for the everyday clinician interested in the topic.
