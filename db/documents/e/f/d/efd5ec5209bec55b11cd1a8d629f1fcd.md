Due to the various ocular tuberculosis manifestations, a clinical diagnosis is quite challenging. Developing the diagnosis of ocular TB begins with a complete history, physical exam, and fundoscopic exam. Gupta et al. identified broad-based posterior synechiae, retinal vasculitis without choroiditis, retinal vasculitis with choroiditis, and serpiginous-like choroiditis as features of ocular TB with specificities of 93%, 97%, 99%, and 98%, respectively. However, all have poor sensitivities.

- Tuberculin skin test (TST) and/or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) to evaluate the cellular immune response to M. tuberculosis by the patient. Both tests have their strengths and limitations.

- Chest x-ray or high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest to reveal hilar lymph node enlargement, pulmonary infiltrates, cavitation, or other signs of pulmonary TB.

- A fine-needle aspiration biopsy or tissue biopsy attempt may be made as the culture of M. tuberculosis is the gold-standard diagnosis.

- Anterior chamber fluid or vitreous humor sample can be used in molecular diagnostic testing via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This is becoming the method of choice because of better accuracy and rapid test results compared to culture. A case-control study of 22 patients with known TB uveitis demonstrated a 77.2% sensitivity and 92.1% specificity for PCR detection of M. tuberculosis in aqueous and vitreous aspirates.

- The WHO recommends the use of Xpert MTB/RIF assay, an automated real-time PCR, for rapid and simultaneous detection of TB and rifampicin resistance. Xpert MTB/RIF assay is currently used with sputum samples; it has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use with ocular fluids.

A definitive diagnosis of TB uveitis is only made when M. tuberculosis, or its DNA, is isolated from ocular fluids. In most cases, ophthalmologists are unable to make a definitive diagnosis. Still, the patient may have ophthalmological features consistent with ocular TB, confirmed TB exposure (positive TST or IGRA), or evidence of a tubercular lesion on a chest x-ray or CT scan. If one of these features is present, the diagnosis of “presumed ocular TB” should be made, and treatment should be offered.

Treatment begins with antituberculous therapy (ATT) trial. Patients are evaluated for response to a four-drug course of isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. After 4 to 6 weeks of treatment, a positive response is taken as evidence for ocular TB, and treatment should be continued.
