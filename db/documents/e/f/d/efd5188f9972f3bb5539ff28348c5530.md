The increasing role of viral pathogens in pneumonia and the increased recognition of bacterial and viral coinfections in patients with pneumonia necessitate a higher clinical index of suspicion and early identification of viral pulmonary pathogens. This activity describes the evaluation and management of viral pneumonia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the most common pathogens associated with viral pneumonia.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with viral pneumonia. 
- Identify the type of viral pneumonia that can be prevented by vaccination.
- Outline the importance of collaboration among the interprofessional team to enhance patient care by educating patients about methods for preventing viral pneumonia.
