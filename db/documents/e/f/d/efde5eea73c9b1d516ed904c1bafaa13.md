# Continuing Education Activity

The most effective management of diabetes mellitus demands an interprofessional approach involving both lifestyle modifications with diet and exercise and pharmacologic therapies as necessary to meet individualized glycemic goals. Lifestyle modifications must be combined with oral pharmacologic agents for optimal glycemic control, particularly as type 2 diabetes mellitus progresses with continued loss of pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin production. This activity outlines the indications, mechanisms of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of oral hypoglycemic medications, so providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes where glycemic control and diabetes play a role in outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the various mechanisms of action of oral hypoglycemic drugs.
- Review the adverse events associated with each class of oral hypoglycemic medications.
- Summarize the contraindications to each class of oral hypoglycemic drugs.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients who can benefit from therapy with oral hypoglycemic medications.

# Indications

The most effective management of diabetes mellitus demands an interprofessional approach involving both lifestyle modifications with diet and exercise and pharmacologic therapies as needed to meet individualized glycemic goals. Healthcare practitioners must encourage patients to combine lifestyle modifications with oral pharmacologic agents for optimal glycemic control, particularly as type 2 diabetes mellitus progresses with continued loss of pancreatic beta-cell function and insulin production.

**Oral Hypoglycemic Medications**

- Sulfonylureas (glipizide, glyburide, gliclazide, glimepiride)

- Meglitinides (repaglinide and nateglinide)

- Biguanides (metformin)

- Thiazolidinediones (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone)

- α-Glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose, miglitol, voglibose)

- DPP-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin)

- SGLT2 inhibitors (dapagliflozin and canagliflozin)

- Cycloset (bromocriptine)

**FDA-approved indications**for the use of oral hypoglycemic drugs primarily focus on type 2 diabetes mellitus.

**Non-FDA approved indications**of oral hypoglycemic drugs, such as metformin, are for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus, treatment of gestational diabetes mellitus, treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with menstrual irregularities, and prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in PCOS patients undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) or in vitro fertilization (IVF), and management of antipsychotic-induced weight gain.

# Mechanism of Action

**Sulfonylureas**bind to adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels (K-ATP channels) in the beta cells of the pancreas; this leads to the inhibition of those channels and alters the resting membrane potential of the cell, causing an influx of calcium and the stimulation of insulin secretion.

**Meglitinides**exert their effects via different pancreatic beta-cell receptors, but they act similarly to sulfonylureas by regulating adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels in pancreatic beta cells, thereby causing an increase in insulin secretion.

**Metformin**increases hepatic adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activity, thus reducing hepatic gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis and increasing insulin-mediated uptake of glucose in muscles.

**Thiazolidinediones**activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), a nuclear receptor, which increases insulin sensitivity and resultant peripheral uptake of glucose and increases the level of adiponectin, a fat tissue-secreted cytokine, that increases not only the number of insulin-sensitive adipocytes but also stimulates fatty acid oxidation.

**Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors**competitively inhibit alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the intestinal brush border cells that digest the dietary starch, thus inhibiting the polysaccharide reabsorption and the metabolism of sucrose to glucose and fructose.

**DPP-4 inhibitors**inhibit the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP- 4). These deactivate glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), among others. Therefore, these influence glucose control through multiple effects, such as decreasing glucagon release and increasing glucose-dependent insulin release, decreasing gastric emptying, and increasing satiety.**SGLT2 inhibitors**inhibit sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2) in proximal tubules of renal glomeruli, causing inhibition of 90% glucose reabsorption and resulting in glycosuria in people with diabetes which in turn lowers the plasma glucose levels.

**Cycloset**, a sympatholytic dopamine D2 receptor agonist, resets the hypothalamic circadian rhythm, which might have been altered by obesity. This action results in the reversal of insulin resistance and a decrease in glucose production.

# Administration

# Monitoring

- Fasting blood sugar, pre-meal blood sugar, and hemoglobin A1c are measured semi-annually in patients with good blood sugar control and quarterly in those who did not meet treatment goals or have a change in therapy.

- In patients taking metformin, initial and frequent monitoring of hemoglobin, RBC indices, and renal function tests before therapy initiation, and at least every year. The clinician should repeat these tests every 3 to 6 months if the glomerular filtration rate is 45 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and every three months if the glomerular filtration rate is from 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2. Serum vitamin B12 and folate levels should be measured if the patient is on long-term metformin to rule out megaloblastic anemia.

- In patients taking pioglitazone, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin are measured before initiation and periodically. Signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain, features suggestive of bladder cancer (hematuria, dysuria, and urinary urgency), and periodic ophthalmologic exams require monitoring.

- Note any signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia (fatigue, excessive hunger, profuse sweating, numbness of extremities), abnormal liver function, and weight fluctuations (due to the potential to cause weight gain) in patients taking sulfonylureas.

- In patients taking acarbose, serum creatinine and serum transaminase levels should be monitored every three months during the first year of treatment and periodically thereafter.

- Renal function (baseline and periodically during treatment) and LDL require monitoring for patients with SGLT 2 inhibitors.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Oral hypoglycemic agents are often prescribed by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner or PA, endocrinologist, and internist. However, it is essential to educate the patient on changes in lifestyle, which include dietary modifications and exercise therapy. A dietary consult is often necessary to educate the patient on a healthy diet. The patient should be urged to join an exercise program, stop smoking, and lower body weight. No matter what oral hypoglycemic agent the clinician prescribes, interprofessional team members must know the adverse effects and potential for interaction with other medications, offer counsel on diet and exercise, and work collaboratively to optimize therapeutic results.
