Fluoroscopic percutaneous coronary intervention is a widely performed procedure for the last several years. In comparison to thrombolysis, percutaneous coronary intervention reduces morbidity and mortality significantly in patients with myocardial infarction. In chronic coronary syndrome patients, it has proven to improve the quality of life. Compared to CABG, it is associated with a shorter hospital stay, no scar on the chest, and early mobilization after the procedure. Because of advancement in percutaneous coronary intervention over time, survival improvement in patients with coronary artery disease was noted.
