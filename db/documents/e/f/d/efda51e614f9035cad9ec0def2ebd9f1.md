Primary treatment initiation is critical for the preservation of vision. CAR associated with untreated anti-recoverin antibodies may lead to severe vision loss and even no perception of light.

Systemic steroids can be used for treatment, but they have variable outcomes. The use of corticosteroids has been seen to be more efficient in the short-term management of CAR associated with recoverin-mediated auto-antibodies. Keltner and colleagues first used serum auto-antibody guided prednisone to control the intraocular disease in a cancer patient. The dose of initial oral prednisone may be as high as 1 to 2 mg/kg/day.****Intravitreal triamcinolone and sub-tenon triamcinolone (40 to 60 mg) are other treatment options.

Intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg/day for three days) when integrated with resection of the primary neoplasm can lay down notable short-term improvement as reported by C Dot et al. The use of intravenous methylprednisolone is associated with more favorable outcomes as compared to oral prednisone and hence can be used to initiate the treatment.

Multiple steroid-sparing immunomodulatory agents have been used in the treatment of CAR, but no single therapy has shown consistency or long time efficacy. Systemic azathioprine (100 mg/day), cyclosporine (100 mg/day), and mycophenolate mofetil (2 g/day) have been used in the management of CAR. Parallel and synchronous use of multiple agents can be done to hold up the visual decline.

Ferreyra and colleagues showed that supplementation of immunosuppressive agents [azathioprine (100 mg/day), cyclosporine (100 mg/day)] causes improvement in visual acuity and visual fields with stabilization in ERG (electroretinogram) in CAR patients associated with recoverin autoantibodies.

Guy and colleagues showed stabilization in patients with CAR using intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG). IVIG (400 mg/kg/per day for five days) can improve both visual acuity and visual field.

The use of IVIG and plasmapheresis in the treatment of CAR is appropriate if given before the onset of irreversible neuronal degeneration.

Newer treatment modalities include the use of newer monoclonal antibodies such as alemtuzumab (anti-CD52, pan-lymphocyte) in the dose of 30 mg intravenously three times a week for four months) and rituximab (anti-CD20, B-cell) in patients who have failed prednisone and intravenous immunoglobulins.

Rituximab in the dose of 1000 mg twice a week of 2 doses or 375 once a week for four weeks, when combined with immunosuppressive agents (such as prednisone, azathioprine, infliximab, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate), gave beneficial effects in the form of stable or improved visual outcomes in 77% of eyes in a retrospective case series of 16 patients (30 eyes) with autoimmune retinopathy (including one melanoma-associated retinopathy, six CAR, and nine npAIR patients).

Ohguro and colleagues showed improvement in ERG and a delay in the progression of the disease by pharmacological reduction of intracellular calcium (nilvadipine) in experimental animals. The anti-recoverin antibodies get localized in the photoreceptor cells to block the recoverin function and regulate rhodopsin, resulting in enhancement of phosphorylation of rhodopsin and induction of apoptotic cell death.

By decreasing the phosphorylation of light-dependent rhodopsin or by antagonism of the intracellular calcium levels, retinal dysfunction may be prevented. Adamus and associates demonstrated that nifedipine might protect from apoptosis in an experimental CAR model.

Antioxidants and vitamins like lutein, vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta carotene (in non-smokers) may help stabilize the retinal degeneration and the disease course, though their exact role may need further evaluation. Future treatment for CAR is directed towards the inhibition of VEGF receptor 1 to prevent the penetration of antibodies. Calcium modulation and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) gene transfer may cause a delay in apoptosis.
