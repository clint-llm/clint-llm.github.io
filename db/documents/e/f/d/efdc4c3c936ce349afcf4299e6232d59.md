Coronary bifurcation lesions are the most common of the complex coronary lesions. Some estimates have reported that these are found in up to 20% of all PCIs.

- Coronary artery calcification is a nonspecific term, and the amount of calcification can vary greatly. The majority of the population has some degree of calcification and atherosclerosis, though it may not be significant enough to cause significant stenosis.

- Chronic total occlusions (CTO) are extremely common as well. CTOs are present in 20% of individuals undergoing non-urgent angiography.

- Estimates for unprotected left main coronary artery (ULMCA) disease vary. One study cited its prevalence in 5% of individuals who underwent coronary angiography.

- Approximately 300000 individuals undergo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in the United States annually. Among those with saphenous venous graft, 8 to 12% experience early occlusion before discharge. Approximately 15 to 30% of saphenous vein grafts experience occlusion within the first year after CABG. About 50% of individuals have saphenous vein graft failure within 10 years of surgery.
