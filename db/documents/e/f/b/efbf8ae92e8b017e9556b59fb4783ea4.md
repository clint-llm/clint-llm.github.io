Workplace violence in the healthcare system is vastly understudied. While there is no universal definition of workplace violence (WPV), the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health defines WPV as “an act or threat of violence on a spectrum that ranges from verbal abuse to physical and even lethal assault towards persons at work or on duty.”

Differing methods of categorizing WPV are found. One means of dividing WPV is based on the nature of the aggression. Violence may be physical, verbal, or psychological.

Another means of classifying WPV is based on associated intent.

- Type I refers to acts of violence, usually with criminal intent, without any legitimate professional relationship with the organization or its employees. These are generally associated with crime, such as thievery or terrorism.

- Type II WPV refers to violence by patients, former patients, or their visitors.

- Type III is violence by colleagues and staff.

- Type IV is similar to Type I but replaces the criminal association with a personal one with an employee.
