Once a diagnosis is made and surgery awaited, parents should receive counsel about symptoms that should prompt them to seek professional help immediately due to the potential for fatal airway compromise. Care is necessary so as not to intensify the pre-existing anxiety of the family.

Parents should also be counseled regarding the possibility of persistent noisy breathing up to a year post-surgery, due to tracheomalacia and/or bronchomalacia caused by the vascular ring.
