Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive multisystem progressive disorder that results in mucus in various organs becoming thick and sticky. The disease primarily affects patients' upper and lower airways, causes long-lasting lung infections, and limits the ability to breathe over time. Dornase alfa is an inhaled medication that thins mucus, used to manage and treat cystic fibrosis. It has been shown to decrease respiratory tract infections in selected patients with forced vital capacity (FVC) greater than 40% of predicted. This activity outlines the indications, action, and contraindications for dornase alfa as a valuable agent in the therapy for cystic fibrosis, pleural effusion, and emphysema.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the mechanism of action of dornase alfa.
- Identify the potential adverse effects of dornase alfa.
- Summarize the monitoring needs for patients on dornase alfa.
- Outline the importance of improving collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients receiving dornase alfa.
