Dialysis fistula creation is a commonly performed procedure for patients who suffer from the end-stage renal disease who require permanent vascular access for hemodialysis. Arteriovenous fistulas are the preferred initial access compared to prosthetic grafts or hemodialysis catheters. The most common arteriovenous fistula techniques include the radiocephalic fistula, brachiocephalic fistula, and transposed brachiobasilic fistula. This activity outlines the preparation and complications of dialysis fistula creation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing dialysis fistulas.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for dialysis fistula creation.
- Outline common complications of arteriovenous dialysis fistulas.
- Summarize the techniques involved in arteriovenous dialysis fistula creation.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes in patients with the end-stage renal disease with arteriovenous dialysis fistulas.
