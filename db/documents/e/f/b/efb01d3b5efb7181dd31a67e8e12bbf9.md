FA cannot be prevented as the condition is inherited with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. The age of onset is usually in childhood or early adolescence, most commonly in children 8 to 15 years old. Those families with an affected child have a 25% chance of having another child with the disease. In cases of a consanguineous union, the risk of having a child with FA is higher.

Genetic screening and counseling are essential before pregnancy to determine the carrier status and risk for FA offspring. The defective gene can be passed from one parent, and the child will be a carrier.

As the disease has no cure, symptoms worsen as time progresses, and most patients end up requiring mobility aids such as wheelchairs, lose their vision and hearing, and develop other medical complications such as diabetes mellitus and scoliosis. Those patients with less severe symptoms can live longer and, in some cases, beyond their sixties. The most common cause of death in patients with FA is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
