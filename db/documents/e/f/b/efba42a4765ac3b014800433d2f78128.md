In all those people who are diagnosed with autoimmune diseases, it is essential to educate them on the signs and symptoms of developing renal disease. They need to be educated on lifestyle modifications like weight reduction, decreased amount of salt in the diet, and increased fiber intake as these are linked with decreasing the probability of developing hypertension, which in turn leads to renal impairment. Moreover, once the disease is diagnosed and treatment is started the importance of regular follow-up should be emphasized. Early diagnosis and treatment compliance are the only ways to prevent a patient from undergoing hemodialysis for life.
