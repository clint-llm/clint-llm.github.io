On the day and time of patient's choice, with the people of his/ her choice at the place chosen by the patient (ideally), the 'Comfort care' is initiated with a pain medication infusion (usually an opiate) with an anxiolytic drug (usually a benzodiazepine).

Family members are encouraged to spend time with the patient, with efforts to minimize the nursing interventions. The family is encouraged to have legacy building measures like taking pictures, making handprints with the patient if possible.

If the patient survives more than the expected duration, he/ she may be moved to an in-patient hospice care or home hospice care with the required support. After the death of the patient, the medical team member needs to confirm it, note the exact time, complete the death certificate, and any related documents. It is humane to contact the grieving family and express the medical team's condolences. It is important for the medical staff to address and relieve their own moral and emotional stress from such clinical encounters. Informal and formal measures, including counseling, can be used to overcome this distress, as it may lead to empathy fatigue and burn-out if ignored.
