Patients presenting with visual complaints should undergo a complete physical examination, including a thorough neurologic evaluation. Signs and symptoms of neurologic emergencies, such as an acute change in mental status or the presence of new focal neurologic deficits, should prompt rapid acquisition of vital signs and appropriate airway, circulation, and breathing management.

A visual acuity test and complete cranial nerve assessment should be performed in all individuals to assess for visual deficits. The examiner should place particular attention on the pupillary examination as well as visual field testing. A bitemporal visual field defect localizes the pathologic lesion to the optic chiasm, whereas the presence of a homonymous visual field defect suggests damage to the areas posterior to the optic chiasm such as the optic tract, optic radiations, or primary visual cortex in the occipital lobe. Homonymous hemianopsia, in conjunction with an afferent pupillary defect, localizes the lesion to the optic tract.
