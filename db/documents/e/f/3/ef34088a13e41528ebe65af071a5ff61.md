Minor dental infection is common in the United States; by age 65, over 90% of people will have experienced dental caries.

Tobacco use and diabetes are the most commonly associated comorbid conditions with odontogenic neck infections. In the last few decades, dental, odontogenic, and deep neck infections have decreased with the widespread use and availability of antibiotics; however, the proportion of deep neck infections from odontogenic origin has increased and is currently the leading cause of deep neck infection in adults in the United States.
