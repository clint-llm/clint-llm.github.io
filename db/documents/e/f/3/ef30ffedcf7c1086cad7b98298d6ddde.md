AF is a huge financial burden on health care. Therefore, managing AF requires an interprofessional approach with close involvement of various health care professionals such as primary care physicians, cardiologists, electrophysiologists, neurologists, surgeons, pharmacists, and nursing staff.

Ensuring guideline-directed treatment of AF is pivotal in improving overall outcomes and reducing health care costs. Nurse-led, guideline-based clinics supported by appropriate software and cardiologists have shown superior results in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalizations.
