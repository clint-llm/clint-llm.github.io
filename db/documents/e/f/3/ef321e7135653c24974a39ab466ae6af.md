Extravasation - If extravasation is suspected, the infusion should stop immediately. Any obvious fluid collection shouldÂ be aspirated, and the extremity elevated. The antidote, sodium thiosulfate, should be administered.

Secondary malignancy - Leukemia is the most common secondary malignancy after treatment with cisplatin, and this typically occurs many years after completion of treatment.

Tumor lysis syndrome can occur after treatment with many chemotherapeutic agents and manifest as hyperuricemia, alteration in hemodynamics, hyperkalemia, and azotemia. Uric acid-reducing treatments may be necessary.
