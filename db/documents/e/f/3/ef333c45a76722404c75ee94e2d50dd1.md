Research on the topic of vulvodynia is ongoing. Twenty-five percent of adult Americans suffer from a chronic pain condition. Patients in pain are often neglected and under-treated. This pain condition is severe and debilitating and can be devastating to the patients suffering from it. The scientific level of evidence for almost all treatment regimens is poor, with very few randomized controlled trials having been performed. Treatment outcomes vary in the studies we have, but the majority of women improve with treatment. Practitioners should be encouraged to take their patients seriously and remember that this condition exists. If the practitioner is uncomfortable treating the condition or does not have the education and experience to treat the condition, they should query the National Vulvodynia Association and find a practitioner who does.
