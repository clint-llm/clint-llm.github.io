The complications for SIS and sonohysterosalpingogram include pain, bleeding, and infection. Patients should be advised to take pain medication generally one hour before the procedure. Most advocate the use of ibuprofen 400Â to 600 mg orally one hour before the procedure. Patients should be advised to look for signs of infections, including fever, abnormal vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, or tenderness up to one month after the procedure. A mild amount of bleeding is common after the procedure, which usually resolves within 24 hours. Additional bleeding may warrant evaluation.
