Medical professionals will work with dying patients in all disciplines, and the process is difficult as care shifts from eliminating or mitigating illness to preparing for death. This is a difficult transition for patients, their loved ones, and healthcare providers to undergo. This activity provides paradigms for the process of moving toward death as well as a discussion of how they should and should not be applied, supporting the interprofessional team to address the unique needs of their patients and guide them and their loved ones through the process.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the five stages of death, as outlined by Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.
- Describe alternative paradigms for experiencing death and grief, in addition to those introduced by Kubler-Ross.
- Explain the potential underlying process generating these outwardly demonstrated stages to provide a context for supporting patients, families, caregivers, and healthcare providers experiencing death.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in a dying patient.
