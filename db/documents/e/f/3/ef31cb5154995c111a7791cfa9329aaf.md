Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 5 Management of Domestic Incidents (HSPD-5) was issued in 2003 to “enhance the ability of the United States to manage domestic incidents by establishing a single, comprehensive national incident management system.” The National Incident Management System (NIMS) is a nationally standardized and comprehensive system of incident command and management that is scalable to incident magnitude, location, and complexity. NIMS applies to all entities who may respond to a disaster, whether it is public, private, tribal, state, and federal. However, the system has its basis upon the premise that all responses begin and end locally.
