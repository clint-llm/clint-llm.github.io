The prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma depends on both tumor burden and liver dysfunction. Tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) does not account for the degree of performance status and liver dysfunction. The most widely staging system is the Barcelona clinic liver cancer (BCLC). Among other staging systems include the Chinese University Prognostic Index,Â Japan Integrated Staging, Cancer of the Liver Italian Program.

The BCLC offers the most prognostic information, including patients' performance status, liver burden, and liver function.
