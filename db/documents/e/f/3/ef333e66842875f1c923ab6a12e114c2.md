Endotracheal intubation is an essential resuscitative procedure in the emergency setting. Direct and video laryngoscopy are the two most common approaches utilized for endotracheal intubation. Endotracheal intubation indications include altered mental status, poor ventilation, and poor oxygenation. This activity describes the technique of endotracheal intubation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients who undergo this procedure.
