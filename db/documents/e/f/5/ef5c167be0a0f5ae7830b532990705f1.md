Pulmonary papillomas are benign lesions with a good prognosis when they are completely removed. They can rarely recur when they are incompletely removed. Rare malignant transformations are possible in squamous cell papillomas. HPV-associated papillomas (subtypes 16, 18, and 31) are recognized as having malignant potential. Laryngotracheal papillomatosis can spread into the lower respiratory tract in up to 5% of the cases. Bronchial and alveolar involvement may be related to prior treatments or reflux disease.
