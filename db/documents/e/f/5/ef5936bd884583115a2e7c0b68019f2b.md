Milia lesions are diagnosed on clinical findings. Although seldom required, incision and drainage of the keratinous content of milia can corroborate the diagnosis. Additionally, persistent and widely distributed milia may require investigation for other causes of primary and secondary milia, such as an underlying genodermatosis, especially when other clinical findings are present.
