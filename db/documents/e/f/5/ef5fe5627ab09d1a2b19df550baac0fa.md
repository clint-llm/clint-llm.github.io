Physiologic and anatomic variants are important for guidance during vascular surgery. Some studies related a higher risk of aneurysm formation in the MCA with certain MCA variants. A retrospective study of 350 patients used computed tomography angiography (CTA). Bifurcation of the MCA before the genu without a dominating post-division trunk was the most common variant; however, variants include bifurcation and trifurcations before and after the genu. Also, the study observed upper, lower, middle, and no branch domination. Aneurysms appeared predominantly in the M1 surgical segment. However, they also appeared in the M2 segment, lenticulostriate vessels, and near cortical branches. A study suggested that domination of upper post-division trunk of the MCA have a higher risk of MCA aneurysm formation. The anatomic variants can partly explain the aneurysm formation and stroke incidence. A deeper insight into the implication of these variants warrants further studies.
