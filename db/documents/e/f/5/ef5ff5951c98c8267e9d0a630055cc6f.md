There is often confusion over the meaning of capacity versus competency while providing medical care.  It is an important distinction to understand to best serve the patient and their needs while protecting the emergency medical service (EMS) provider from legal repercussions. Capacity is the ability to learn, process, and make decisions based on the information given. In an emergency management context, this means the patient being treated has the capacity to understand the risks, burden (financial and otherwise), and the benefits and alternatives to the proposed treatment (medical decision-making capacity). Competence is a legal (not medical) term, stating that a court of law has decided whether a person can make their own decisions. A person is competent only as deemed by a court (although a medical person can make their own determination towards competency). A person has the capacity to make a medical decision based on real-time assessment. Any emergency medical technician or paramedic has the ability, and the duty, to assess each patient's capacity so that they are best able to serve the patient's needs.
