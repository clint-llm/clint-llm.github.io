- Medications for primary pulmonary hypertension are not recommended for patients with pulmonary hypertension secondary to COPD.

- Depression and anxiety are very common in end-stage lung disease, and pharmacological agents can be used accordingly.

- Statin therapy does not reduce exacerbation.

- Long-term oral corticosteroids are not recommended.

- ICS alone is not recommended.

- Combination treatment with LABA and LAMA is more effective in reducing exacerbations as compared to monotherapy.

- A combination of SAMA and SABA improves symptoms and FEV-1.

- Theophylline has little bronchodilator effect in stable COPD and is associated with modest symptomatic benefits.

- Assessment and appropriate management for comorbidities in a patient with COPD independently influence mortality and hospitalizations.

- Excessive correction of hypoxia in a patient with longstanding COPD can sometimes lead to hypercapnia. This is due to the loss of compensatory vasoconstriction with ineffective gas exchange, as there is a loss of hypoxic drive for ventilation. Also, increased oxyhemoglobin decreases the uptake of carbon dioxide due to the Haldane effect.

- The only interventions that decrease the mortality of COPD are smoking cessation and continuous home oxygen.
