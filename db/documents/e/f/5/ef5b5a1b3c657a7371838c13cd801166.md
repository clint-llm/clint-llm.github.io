**Genetic Obesity Can Be Classified as Monogenic and Polygenic Obesity [included under nonsyndromic obesity] or Syndromic Obesity**

**1. Syndromic obesity**: This can be further classified as obesity caused by chromosomal rearrangements like Prader-Willi syndrome, WAGR syndrome, SIM1 syndrome, and pleiotropic syndromes, including Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Cohen syndrome, etc.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is caused by the deletion of paternal 15q.11-13-the Prader-Willi Critical Region (PWCR) in most cases or by maternal uniparental disomy in 20 to 30% of cases. The PWCR on the maternal chromosome is normally genetically imprinted; hence the loss of the paternal PWCR causes Prader-Willi syndrome. PWS characterized by mental retardation, dysmorphic facies, hypotonia, short stature, and hormonal deficiencies in addition to obesity. It is associated with severe hyperphagia and food compulsivity in childhood. The genes in the PWCR that are lost include NPAP1, MAGEL2, SNURF-SNRPN, MKRN3, and NDN, which leads to lower expression of proconvertase-1 in the hypothalamus, contributing to obesity.

Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is an autosomal recessive disease seen more in families with a history of consanguinity. It is characterized by problems in the BBSome, which is a unit of motility for cilia. Sixteen genes have been implicated in various forms of BBS. Children affected by this disorder present with learning disabilities, dyslexia, progressive rod-cone dystrophy, hypogonadism, type 2 diabetes, labile behavior, renal abnormalities, and polydactyly.

Other causes of syndromic obesity include 5p13 microdeletion syndrome, 16p11.2 deletion, Albright hereditary osteodystrophy associated with GNAS mutation, Alstrom syndrome-ALMS1 mutation, CHOPS syndrome-AFF4 mutation, Carpenter syndrome-RAB23 mutation, Cohen syndrome-VPS13B/COH1 mutation, Rubinstein Tayabi syndrome-CREBBP mutation, OBHD syndrome-NTRK2 mutation, Kleefstra syndrome- EHMT1 mutation, etc.

**2. Monogenic obesity:**Monogenic obesity can be further classified into autosomal dominant or autosomal recessively inherited forms of genetic obesity. Monogenic obesity generally involves mutations in the leptin signaling pathway leading to suppression of anorexigenic and activation of orexigenic pathways. To understand the many forms of monogenic obesity, it is crucial to understand the intricate functioning of the leptin signaling pathway. Normally, leptin acts on the leptin receptor [LEPR], which increases the levels of proopiomelanocortin [POMC] and cocaine and amphetamine-regulated transcript [CART]. POMC, in turn, increases the levels of proprotein convertase 1/3, which increases the formation of alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone [alpha-MSH]. Alpha-MSH then acts on the melanocortin 4 receptor [MC4R] in the hypothalamus to initiate the feeling of satiety. Also, leptin normally suppresses the neuropeptide Y (NPY)-agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-Y1R orexigenic pathway.

- Autosomal recessive inheritance: Mutations in the leptin gene located on chromosome 7, leptin receptor located on chromosome 1, PCSK 1 located on chromosome 5, and POMC located on chromosome 2 are examples of mutated genes that have an autosomal recessive inheritance. Homozygous mutations in the leptin gene are generally seen in consanguineous families and can be treated with metreleptin. Mutations in leptin receptors are frameshift, missense, or nonsense mutations that cannot be treated with metreleptin. POMC generates both alpha MSH and Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Patients with POMC mutations develop central adrenal insufficiency and skin hyperpigmentation. Mutations of POMC can be inactivating or nonsense mutations, and patients can be treated with setmelanotide and hydrocortisone.

- Autosomal dominant inheritance: Mutations in genes SH2B1 located on chromosome 16, MRAP2 located on chromosome 6, and LPR2 located on chromosome 2 are examples of mutated genes with an autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in genes-BDNF located on chromosome 11, SIM1 located on chromosome 6, NTRK2 located on chromosome 9 give rise to abnormal proteins involved in hypothalamic neuronal differentiation leading to the development of severe obesity and cognitive impairment. Mutations in MC4R have codominant inheritance and constitute the commonest cause of monogenic obesity, with a prevalence of 0.5% to 6% in different populations. Setmelanotide cannot be used in these cases of impaired or loss of function of MC4R because its action depends on the normal downstream signaling of MC4R.

- Other gene mutations that can cause obesity include NPY gene mutations, ghrelin receptor mutations, MC3R gene mutations, and FTO mutations (the most significant gene mutations contributing to obesity in adults and children).

**3. Polygenic obesity:**Sixty percent of inherited obesity is polygenic. Polygenic obesity is associated with mutations in CYP27A1, TFAP2B, PARK2, IFNGR1, as well as UCP2 & UCP3-which code for uncoupling proteins in skeletal and brown adipose tissue, ADRB1-3 which code for the beta-adrenergic receptors affecting energy utilization and lipolysis, and SLC6A14-which regulates tryptophan accessibility for serotonin synthesis which affects appetite control and energy balance.

**Epigenetic Modifications Linked to Obesity**

- DNA methylation/demethylation-the most common mechanism of epigenetic modifications seen throughout the genome. Methylation is governed by the action of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), and demethylation is carried out by ten-eleven-translocation (TET) enzymes. Variations in the methylation of CpGs in the genome constitute the "Differentially Methylated Regions" (DMRs).

- Histamine modification by acetylation and methylation. Histone modification regulates five essential adipogenesis genes, including Pref-1, c/EBP beta, C/EBP alpha, PPAR gamma, and aP2.

- Histone variants: Histone macroH2A1.2 inhibits adipogenesis and increases leanness while promoting metabolic health.

- ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes' involvement leads to further acetylation, phosphorylation, or methylation of genes.

- The addition of micro-RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, piRNAs, or siRNAs leads to pre and post-transcriptional variations in RNA.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have identified differential methylation sites in CPT1A, ABCG1, and SREBF1 genes in the blood, associated with BMI variation. Differential methylation of LY86 in blood leukocytes is seen between obese and lean people. Variation in the waist to hip ratios varies with ADRB3 methylation in blood. Other significant epigenetic changes causing variations in BMI have been seen in PGC1A, HIF3A, FTO, TCF7L2, FASN, CCRL2, ELOVL2 genes.

In prenatal famine, differential methylation in CDH23, SMAD7, INSR, CPT1A, KLF13, RFTN1 genes has been studied from adult whole blood samples. In intrauterine growth retardation, pancreatic islet failure and insulin resistance are linked to decreased acetylation of histones 3 and 4. Maternal high-fat diets have been linked to adipose tissue hyperplasia by reduced methylation of promoter Scd1. Maternal obesity has been associated with hypermethylation of POMC in the fetal brain and hypomethylation of dopamine reuptake transporter promoting fat and sugar cravings in children.
