Communication is a multifunctional event transmitting messages of information, emotions, and attitude to other people. The significance of communication in the clinical setting is its quality to improve patient outcomes.

Communication is an essential element of collaboration. TeamSTEPPS as an IPE program develops HCP in the art of communication and establishes skill sets as a standard of practice.

IPE is purposeful to expand collaboration and its elements as an essential requirement for clinical practice. From this perspective, the interprofessional collaboration will advance cooperation in education, healthcare practice, research, and policy-making for continuous quality improvement in patient care services.
