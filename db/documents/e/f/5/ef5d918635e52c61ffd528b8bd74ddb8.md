In developed countries, it is unlikely that vitamin E deficiency occurs due to diet intake insufficiency, and the more common causes are below.

- Premature low birth weight infants with a weight less than 1500 grams (3.3 pounds)

- Mutations in the tocopherol transfer protein causing impaired fat metabolism

- Disrupted fat malabsorption as the small intestine requires fat to absorb vitamin E

- Patients with cystic fibrosis patients fail to secrete pancreatic enzymes to absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K

- Short-bowel syndrome patients may take years to develop symptoms. Surgical resection, mesenteric vascular thrombosis, and pseudo-obstruction are a few examples of this issue

- Chronic cholestatic hepatobiliary disease leads to a decrease in bile flow and micelle formation that is needed for vitamin E absorption

- Crohn's disease, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and liver disease may all not absorb fat

- Abetalipoproteinemia an autosomal-recessive disease, causes an error in lipoprotein production and transportation

- Isolated vitamin E deficiency syndrome an autosomal recessive disorder of chromosome arm 8q

In developing countries, the most common cause is inadequate intake of vitamin E.
