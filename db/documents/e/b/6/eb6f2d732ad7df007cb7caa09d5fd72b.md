The most common tracheal resection indication is acquired subglottic or tracheal stenosis secondary to prolonged intubation and tracheostomy, unresponsive to conservative balloon dilation or CO2 laser scar-excision.

The excision of malignant tumors is another indication for tracheal resection. Tracheal neoplasms are rare and account for less than 0.01% of all tumors and 0.2% of malignant respiratory tract lesions.

Further indications include airway trauma, inhalation burns, radiation, tracheoesophageal fistulas, tracheoinnominate fistulas, congenital lesions, post-infection lesions, cartilaginous fibrosis, calcified nodules, and idiopathic causes such as idiopathic laryngotracheal stenosis (ILTS).
