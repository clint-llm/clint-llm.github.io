Though the exact pathomechanism underlying the premalignant and malignant manifestations of chronic arsenic exposure is unknown, there are several hypotheses that have been proposed and researched in several parts of the world. Arsenic metabolism in the body has a key role in most of these theories. Some such tested theories are as follows:

- Genetic polymorphism of enzymes involved in the metabolic pathway; arsenite methyltransferase (AS3MT) is the main mediator in the biomethylation of arsenic.

- Global DNA hypomethylation due to depletion of S-adenosylmethionine in cells during the process of arsenic biomethylation. This leads to aberrant gene expression in cells, resulting in carcinogenesis.

- Reactive oxygen species generated during the metabolism of arsenic causes oxidative DNA damage, resulting in chromosomal abnormalities and sister chromatic exchange.

The development of premalignant and malignant lesions is further facilitated by an individual's genetic susceptibility. This includes polymorphism in the DNA repair pathway genes (e.g., ERCC2, XRCC3), tumor suppressor gene (TP53), glutathione S-transferase superfamily enzymes, IL10, TNF alpha, and NLRP2. Studies have demonstrated an exaggerated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in chronic arsenic toxicity. Recent studies have revealed the role of arsenic-induced epigenetic alterations i.e., changes in gene expression in the development of premalignant dermatoses and malignancy.
