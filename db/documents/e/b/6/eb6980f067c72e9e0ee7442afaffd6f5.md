**Postpartum Endometritis**

Postpartum endometritis is the most common postpartum infection.

Cesarean delivery, on the other hand, is the most important risk factor for endometritis and is associated with a 5 to 20-fold increase in risk for postpartum endometritis when compared to spontaneous vaginal deliveries.

A Cochrane Review noted the following frequencies of postpartum endometritis:

When left untreated, fatality rates have been estimated to be as high as 17%.

**Acute Endometritis**

PID most commonly affects younger adultsÂ and teenagers, 15 to 29 years of age. If untreated, approximately 10-20% of people with genital chlamydia or gonorrhea infections may develop PID.

**Chronic Endometritis**

The true prevalence of chronic endometritis is difficult to estimate, given the generally mild presentation. In people with recurrent pregnancy loss, however, a meta-analysis of 12 studies by Pirtea et al. estimated a prevalence of nearly 30%.
