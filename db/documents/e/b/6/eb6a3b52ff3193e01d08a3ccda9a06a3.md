Treatment includes switching to DDD or VDD modes in a dual chamber device. Up-gradation to a dual chamber device is necessary for single-chamber pacemakers. Concomitantly if the patient has LV dysfunction and low EF, then a CRT will be the preferred device for implantation/up-gradation.

Standard heart failure therapy is warranted for patients with LV dysfunction.
