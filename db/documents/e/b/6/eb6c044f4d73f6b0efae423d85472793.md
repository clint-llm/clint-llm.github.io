The exact etiology of PMS/PMDD is not known. There are, however, risk factors associated with the development of PMS/PMDD, some of which are well-established while others are speculative.

**Proven Risk Factors**

- Past traumatic events: Traumatic events and preexisting anxiety disorders are risk factors for the development of PMDD. The underlying mechanisms are unknown, making further investigation necessary.

- Cigarette smoking: There is a strong association of moderate-to-severe forms of PMS with current smoking status compared to non-smokers (relative risk [RR] 2.1). The risk is elevated even for former smokers (RR 1.8), and the risk of incident PMS tends to increase with the quantity of cigarette smoking (RR of 1.93 for 20 pack-years). Further, the risk of PMDD is significantly higher for women who began smoking during adolescence.

- Obesity: There is a strong linear relationship between BMI at baseline and risk of incident PMS (p003). For each 1 kg/m2 increase, there was a significant associated increase (3%). The risk of PMS rose significantly in women with BMI at or higher than 27.5 compared with women with a BMI of less than 20.0 kg/m2. RR in women with a BMI of 35.0 kg/m2 was 1.66.

**Speculative Risk Factor**

- Genetics: Twin studies have implicated heritable factors in the development of PMS/PMDD. Recent studies have provided support for the involvement of the gene that codes for the serotonergic 5HT1A receptor
