The superior mesenteric artery supplies the midgut from the ampullary region of the second part of the duodenum to the splenic flexure of the large intestine. The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery arises from the SMA and, along with the superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, supplies the head of the pancreas.

**Marginal Artery of Drummond**

The distal branches of the superior mesenteric artery (right colic, ileocolic, and middle colic) and the inferior mesenteric artery (sigmoid and left colic) supply the colon. They are also connected to each other by an intricate arterial arcade along the mesenteric border known as the Marginal Artery of Drummond. This arcade of blood vessels is a normal vascular structure in many healthy people, but it may be absent in others. The marginal artery of Drummond is clinically important because it serves as a collateral supply to the colon when there is a blockage in one of the mesenteric vessels. In people who do not have the marginal artery of Drummond, an ischemic event can lead to bowel infarction and necrosis.
