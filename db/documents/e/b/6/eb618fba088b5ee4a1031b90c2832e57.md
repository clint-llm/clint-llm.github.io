Anasarca and edema both are defined as an increase, swelling, or expansion of interstitial fluid volume. This accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space occurs as the capillary filtration exceeds the amount of fluid take out by lymphatic drainage. When edema is massive and generalized, it is called anasarca and it can be caused by a variety of clinical conditions like heart failure, renal failure, liver failure, or problems with the lymphatic system. In this article, we will refer to the term anasarca when referring to instances of the severe form of edema as not every patient with edema has anasarca. The manifestation of anasarca in patients can vary, but it usually becomes clinically apparent as the interstitial volume exceeds 2.5 -3.0 liters.
