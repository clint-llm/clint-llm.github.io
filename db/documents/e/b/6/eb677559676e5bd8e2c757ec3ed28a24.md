The history of events for patients with a cardiac injury is often straightforward, detailing some mechanism injuring the chest or back. However, some individuals may give alternative stories due to potential legal ramifications or altered mentation.  A subset of patients may also be unconscious or without a pulse with the only information available from first responders.

The physical examination of a patient with potential cardiac trauma should typically follow the primary and secondary survey of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS).  Along with obtaining initial vital signs, and after ensuring the airway and breathing or intact and not compromised, a brief evaluation of circulation and the cardiac system should occur.  Inspection for obvious anterior/lateral chest wounds, auscultation for the presence of muffled heart tones, murmurs, and arrhythmias, and palpation for strength and presence of pulses should be done.  After completing a primary survey, the secondary survey should include further examination for a potential cardiac injury, such as evaluating for distended neck veins and evaluating for signs of trauma to the posterior and lateral torso. While a patient may have stable vital signs and few features to suspect a cardiac injury, findings concerning cardiac trauma include hypotension, tachycardia, arrhythmias, visible trauma, distended neck veins, muffled heart sounds, and other signs of shock.
