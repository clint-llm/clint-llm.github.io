The most common associated systemic disorders include rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. In addition, pyoderma gangrenosum has an association with both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Pyoderma gangrenosum is associated with ulcerative colitis in 5% to 12% of cases and is associated with Crohn disease in 1% toÂ 2% of cases. It is not clear if the development of pyoderma gangrenosum correlates with severity or flares of inflammatory bowel disease. Furthermore, pyoderma gangrenosum does not always resolve when the associated bowel disease is treated. In a study of 103 patients with pyoderma gangrenosum, 20% of the patients had hematologic disorders, and 19% of the patients had seronegative arthritis.
