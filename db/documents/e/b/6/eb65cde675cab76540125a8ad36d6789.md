It is imperative that protected health information remains confidential because disclosing it to unauthorized recipients, whether intentionally or by accident, can have deleterious consequences for patients. For instance, in correctional facilities, the improper disclosure of protected health information can potentially result in inmates assaulting other inmates with health conditions that carry a significant social stigma. Even upon their release, these individuals can face discriminatory treatment by the general populace that hampers their reintegration into public life. While transmitting PHI generally requires the patient's explicit consent, there are exceptions where it is transmittable without consent. For example, in a correctional facility setting, PHI can be disclosed without consent for payment purposes, judicial proceedings. If there is a serious threat to a person's health or well-being, that can only be averted through disclosure.
