The prevalence of dysphagia varies with the underlying etiology, age of patients, sources of information (self-reported versus objective assessment), and place of assessment (community versus hospital versus ICU).

The prevalence of dysphagia is approximately 10% to 22% in Americans aged 50 and over.

In hospitalized patients, approximately 14% to 18% of patients have symptoms of dysphagia. In nursing homes, patients with symptoms of dysphagia are in the range of 30% to 60%.

The reported frequencies of dysphagia in patients with stroke vary between 19% and 81%.

In patients in intensive care, a recent systematic review showed that the incidence of post-extubation dysphagia (PED) from a total of 14 studies and 3520 individuals, was in the range of 3% to 62%.

In idiopathic achalasia, the mean incidence is approximately 0.3 to 1.6 per 100,000 people per year in adults.

The disease is equal in frequency in men and women, but the incidence increases with age. Achalasia is commonly diagnosed at the age of 50 years. The incidence in people over 80 years old is approximately 17 per 100,000 per year.

Dysphagia is a common symptom in the elderly. A study reported that 63% of elderly patients who denied any history of swallowing problems showed abnormal swallowing evidence on radiologic swallow studies.
