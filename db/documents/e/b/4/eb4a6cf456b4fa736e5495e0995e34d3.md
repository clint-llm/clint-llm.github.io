Most injuries from shark attacks are non-fatal. In one review of 86 consecutive cases, the majority (81%) of patients had only minor injuries that required simple sutures. However, patients with more extensive wounds were associated with higher morbidity and rates of limb loss. In the fatal traumas, most deaths occurred as a result of exsanguinating hemorrhage from vascular injury.
