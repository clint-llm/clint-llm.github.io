Computed tomographic (CT) scan: Non-contrast head CT scan is usually performed first as it is easier to obtain. It will show a sellar/suprasellar mass associated with intralesional hemorrhage. Ischemia or necrosis of the gland/tumor can not be identified. Contrast examination is done afterward to delimit the size of the tumor as the hemorrhagic products, and contrast-enhancing areas are hyperdense to the brain.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): Brain MRI is performed to improve the definition of the lesion. MRI is the diagnostic imaging modality of choice.

Hormonal evaluation: Pituitary hormonal evaluation is required, as nearly 80% of patients present with a deficiency of at least one of the anterior pituitary hormones.

Grading system: A 5-grade classification based on the clinical presentation spectrum had been recently proposed for treatment decisions and outcomes.
