Nitrogen narcosis can be prevented in different ways. Limiting the depth of a dive is one of the least invasive. It is agreed upon that the maximum depth limit for a diver to use compressed air is 30 to 50 meters. Beyond this, a gas mixture other than air is suggested for use to prevent nitrogen narcosis. For dives greater than 50 meters the diving community commonly substitutes helium or helium-nitrogen as the diluent gasses for oxygen. Helium has not been shown to have an anesthetic or narcotic effect on divers at depth breathing compressed gases.  Helium imposes a greater decompression burden upon divers than does nitrogen.

Treatment of narcosis involves early recognition of symptoms by the diver or the diver’s partner while at depth. Symptoms resolve completely within minutes upon ascent of the diver. If the symptoms persist, the dive should be aborted.
