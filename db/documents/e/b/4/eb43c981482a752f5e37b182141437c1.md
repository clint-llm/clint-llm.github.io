Trastuzumab is a biologic antineoplastic agent that, at the time of its FDA approval in 1998, was among the first available “targeted” chemotherapies. In the United States, it is licensed for the treatment of the following:

- **HER2-positive breast cancer**:**adjuvant therapy -**Approved for combination use with anthracycline- or taxane-based chemotherapy. The maximum recommended duration of adjuvant treatment is one year.

- **Metastatic HER2-positive breast****cancer -**Approved as monotherapy or for combination use with paclitaxel.

- **HER2-positive gastric cancer -**Used in combination with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Compared with chemotherapy alone, trastuzumab plus chemotherapy modestly improved survival (median 13.8 months vs. 11.1 months).

Trastuzumab has reported efficacy for the off-label neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.
