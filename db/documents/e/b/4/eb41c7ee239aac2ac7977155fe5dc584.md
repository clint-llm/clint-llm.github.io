The protozoan Entamoeba histolytica causes amebiasis. There are three species of intestinal amoebas. Entamoeba histolytica causes most symptomatic diseases. Entamoeba dispar is nonpathogenic, and Entamoeba moshkovskii is reported increasingly, but its pathogenicity is unclear. These organisms are spread via the oral-fecal route. The infected cysts are often found in contaminated food and water. Rare cases of sexual spread have also been reported.
