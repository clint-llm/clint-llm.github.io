Treatment of NSIP depends on the cause and the severity of the disease:

- Mild disease: These patients usually have mild symptoms and minimal impairment on their pulmonary functions tests. Close follow up and observation for evidence of disease progression may be adequate.

- Moderate to severe disease: These patients have moderate to severe symptoms, with significant impairment on their pulmonary function tests as well as diffuse changes on HRCT chest scan. In this scenario, we typically start with systemic steroid therapy (prednisone) at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg ideal body weight (IBW) up to a maximum dose of 60 mg per day for 1 month, followed thereafter by a dose of 30 to 40 mg per day for an additional 2 months. For those who respond/stabilize with this treatment, the prednisone should be gradually tapered over 6 to 9 months to a dose of 5 to 10 mg per day or every other day with a goal of potential cessation in therapy after 1 year. Typically, patients are monitored on prednisone for 3 to 6 months to assess for response to treatment and tolerance prior to consideration for a second immunosuppressive agent like azathioprine or mycophenolate. However, for patients with a more severe initial disease, clinicians may start systemic steroid therapy along with a second immunosuppression agent together.

- More severe disease may require hospitalization: These patients may require pulse methylprednisolone at a dose of 1000 mg per day for 3 days, followed by systemic prednisone therapy as outlined above. Rarely is an additional pulse therapy needed.

- Refractory disease despite systemic steroid and immunosuppressive agents: Consideration may be given for cyclophosphamide, rituximab, or calcineurin inhibitors. Those that are not responsive may be considered for lung transplantation.

- It is important to be mindful of potential adverse effects to steroid therapy and continue to assess the risks and benefits of steroid therapy. Further, consideration should be given to Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis in those patients on greater than 20 mg prednisone daily for more than 1 month, or those on multiple immunosuppressive agents, as this infection may significantly worsen lung function.

Treatment of the secondary causes:

- Drug induced: Removal from the exposure may be sufficient.

- Connective tissue disease: Treatment is focused on the underlying cause. Coordination with a rheumatology specialist may be helpful as well.

- HIV infection: Exclude infections and then start antiretroviral therapy. Systemic steroids can be used for those who fail to improve.
