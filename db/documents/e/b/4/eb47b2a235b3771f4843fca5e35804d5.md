Even though phlebitis can occur without an underlying infection, simply as a result of catheter-related mechanical or chemical irritation, an infection should always be in the differential diagnosis. Septic thrombophlebitis can occur spontaneously; however, the majority of cases with superficial, peripheral vein involvement result from breaks in the skin, as with venipuncture done for phlebotomy, or intravenous injection. In some instances, intravenous catheters, such as peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC) lines can be the initiating culprit in peripheral vein as well as deep veins such as superior vena cava (SVC). With inferior vena cava or SVC, STP occurs most often as a consequence of an indwelling catheter.

Other conditions such as Lemierre syndrome, pylephlebitis, STP of the dural sinuses, and pelvis veins often result from an invading infection from a near non-vascular structure. For example, STP of the pelvic veins may result from endometritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, intra-abdominal infections, abdominal surgery, childbirth, or septic abortion. Lemierre syndrome, which is thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein, is most often caused by pharyngitis but may occur secondary to a dental infection.  Dural sinus STP may result from an ear, nose, or throat infection, such as mastoiditis, otitis media, or even meningitis.
