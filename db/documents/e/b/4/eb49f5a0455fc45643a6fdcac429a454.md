The phrenic nerve supplies sensory innervation to the diaphragm. Pain arising from the diaphragm is often referred to the tip of the shoulder, also known as the Kehr sign. For example, a patient with a subphrenic abscess or a ruptured spleen may complain of pain in the left shoulder. The hiccup reflex is due to irritation of the phrenic nerve. It results from sudden spasms of the diaphragm which pull air against the closed fold of the larynx. The phrenic nerve must be identified during thoracic and open-heart surgery. It may be injured during the taking down of the internal mammary artery, which is used for coronary artery bypass. The phrenic nerve often is injured in infants undergoing congenital heart procedures. Once the phrenic nerve is injured, the diaphragm will become paralyzed. On a chest X-ray, the diaphragm will appear elevated. Ultrasound or fluoroscopy can be used to make the diagnosis of a paralyzed diaphragm. If only one side of the diaphragm is paralyzed, most patients can overcome the deficit and lead normal lives. If both sides are paralyzed, phrenic nerve stimulation, intercostal nerve transfer, or a permanent tracheostomy with ventilation dependence is required. Diaphragmatic plication is sometimes done in symptomatic patients when only one diaphragm is paralyzed. Patients who have spinal cord trauma may be able to breathe despite being paralyzed because the phrenic nerve has a higher origin at C3 through C5.
