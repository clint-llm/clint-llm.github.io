The basis of medical complications and mortality statistics is from the largest series of 473 patients, followed over 40 years in New York.

PrognosisÂ in these patients is determined by the existence of pulmonary complications (respiratory failure due to chronic pulmonary disease) and malignancy (especially lymphoid), in which the appropriate and early therapy can prevent or slow down their development.

Non-infectious complications have a prevalence of around 60 to 70%, and the risk of death because of them is 11 times higher.

Deaths due to bacterial infection have been reduced dramatically with the rise of immune globulin therapy.

Overall mortality in CVID patients, according to age and sex-matched population controls, is around 20%.

Malignant cells in these patients do not show greater resistance to standard protocols of treatment, but are more likely to widespread and, therefore, determine the need for a more aggressive therapy, which could bring poorly tolerated adverse effects.

On the other hand, the lower amounts of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and circulating class-switched memory B cells, and increased amount of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) can be used to predict the risk for mortality because of a higher prevalence of autoimmune disease, granuloma formation, recurrent bacterial pneumonia, and lymphoid hyperplasia.

It is unclear to what range IgG replacement could prevent complications.
