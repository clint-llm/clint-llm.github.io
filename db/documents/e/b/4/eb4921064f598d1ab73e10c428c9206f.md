Many surgical cases show the risk of damage to the visual cortex.

Cortical mapping allows surgeons to localize specific regions of the visual cortex by stimulating the brain parenchyma with an electrode and asking the patient to report what they saw. This patient feedback is crucial when a differential diagnosis of malignancy from normal brain tissue is difficult. With this and other similar techniques, surgeons can make informed decisions on where to cut and what structures they can safely remove.
