Cervical spine injuries, although uncommon, can result in significant and long-term disability. The cervical spine encompasses seven vertebrae and serves as a protection to the spinal cord. The segment of the spine most susceptible to injury is the cervical spine based on its anatomy and flexibility. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of various cervical spine injuries and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the various types of cervical spine injuries and the pathophysiology accompanying each type.
- Summarize the relevant steps in performing an examination and evaluation of cervical spine injuries, including any indicated diagnostic imaging.
- Describe the various treatment modalities based on etiology for cervical spine injuries.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes with cervical spine injuries of various etiologies.
