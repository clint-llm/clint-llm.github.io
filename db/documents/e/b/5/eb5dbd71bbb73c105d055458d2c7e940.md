The most common infectious agent causing acute bronchiolitis in children is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)

If an adenovirus is identified, most clinicians use it to tailor investigations because the natural course of the infection often presents as a prolonged febrile illness. Human metapneumovirus is not tested routinely. This etiological agent should be suspected when the patient tests negative for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), yet the clinical picture suggests a similar infection. Influenza positive patients might benefit from antiviral treatment.
