Cutaneous invasion of M. tuberculosis causes the disease. This invasion can be exogenous or endogenous. Endogenous invasion is usually due to spread of pulmonary tuberculosis by hematogenous or lymphatic dissemination. Exogenous invasion is due to direct inoculation of bacteria. This leads to an immune cascade within cutaneous cells that leads to the formation of granulomas, the hallmark of tuberculosis. These present with a variety of clinical lesions.
