MEN2 is a group of rare familial cancer syndrome with high penetrance and variable expressivity. Most common organs affected by this condition are endocrine glands like thyroid glands, adrenal glands and parathyroid glands among other tissues which are derived from neural crest cells. As 25% of the patients diagnosed with Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) have underlying RET proto-oncogene mutations, it is pertinent to screen for genetic mutations and other associated common tumors with the help of biochemical and radiological screening. First degree relatives also should be counseled for genetic testing so that they can also be provided with adequate prophylactic medical and surgical care to decrease overall morbidity and mortality. For MTC, the whole thyroid gland should be excised even if it is in the pre-neoplastic stage, but It is extremely necessary to perform adrenalectomy before thyroidectomy to avoid fatal complications during the surgery. Prior to unilateral or bilateral adrenalectomy, patients should be treated with alpha-blockade preoperatively and also should receive glucocorticoid stress coverage while awaiting transfer to the surgery.
