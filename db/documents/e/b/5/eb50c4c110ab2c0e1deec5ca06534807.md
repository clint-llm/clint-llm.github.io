Encourage close monitoring of patients on anticoagulation suspected of bleeding. This includes:

- Monitoring hemoglobin serially

- Monitoring heart rate and blood pressure, and electrocardiogram

- Administering blood products if indicated

- Monitor for indicators of internal bleeding like back, joint, or flank pain

- Monitor for dark or smoky colored urine

- Minimize unnecessary intravenous line placement or venipuncture
