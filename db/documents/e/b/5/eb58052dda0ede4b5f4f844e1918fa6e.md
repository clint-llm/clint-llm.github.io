Microscopic colitis is a common cause of chronic watery diarrhea that becomes more common as we age. Two types of microscopic colitis are collagenous and lymphocytic colitis. Patients with microscopic colitis typically present with chronic, watery, non-bloody diarrhea. This process is often overlooked and can easily be confused for irritable bowel syndrome or other conditions including infection or inflammatory bowel disease. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of microscopic colitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the presentation of microscopic colitis.
- Summarize the most definitive test for the diagnosis of microscopic colitis
- Outline the risk factors for developing microscopic colitis.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst interprofessional team members to enhance care coordination for patients with microscopic colitis.
