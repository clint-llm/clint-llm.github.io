The glossopharyngeal nerve carries sensory, efferent motor, and parasympathetic fibers. Its branches consist of tympanic, tonsillar, stylopharyngeal, carotid sinus nerve, branches to the tongue, lingual branches, and a communicating branch to cranial nerve X (vagus nerve).

Special visceral efferent fibers (branchial motor) are the main motor fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve and supply motor innervation to the stylopharyngeus muscle. This muscle is responsible for elevating the larynx and pharynx, especially during speaking and swallowing.

General visceral efferent fibers (visceral motor) provide parasympathetic innervation to the parotid glands. The fibers originate in the inferior salivary nucleus then travel with the tympanic nerve through the foramen ovale, and synapse at the otic ganglion.

General visceral afferent fibers (visceral sensory) carry sensory information from the carotid sinus and carotid body.

General somatic afferent fibers (general sensory) provides sensory innervation to the upper pharynx, the inner surface of the tympanic membrane, and the posterior third of the tongue. Special sensory fibers provide taste afferents from this portion of the tongue as well.
