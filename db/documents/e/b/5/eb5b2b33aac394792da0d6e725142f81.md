Viral encephalitis is inflammation of the brain parenchyma caused by a virus. It is the most common type of encephalitis and often coexists with viral meningitis. Viruses invade the host outside the central nervous system and then reach the spinal cord and brain via hematogenous spread or in a retrograde manner from nerve endings. This activity describes the evaluation and management of viral encephalitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the history and physical exam findings typically seen in patients with viral encephalitis.
- Review the evaluation of encephalitis. 
- Outline treatment options for viral encephalitis. 
- Summarize how the coordination of the interprofessional team can lead to rapid diagnosis of viral encephalitis and subsequently decrease associated morbidity and mortality in affected patients.
