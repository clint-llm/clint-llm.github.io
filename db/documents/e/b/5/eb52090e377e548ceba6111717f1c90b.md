To discuss moisturizers of the skin, we need a brief discussion on the skin barrier structure and function and the mechanism of maintaining water balance.  The stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis, is the primary physiologic barrier of the skin and is of critical importance in maintaining water balance.. Below a critical water concentration, the corneodesmosomal connections remain intact, which results in a build-up of corneocytes and the appearance of dry, flaky skin.
