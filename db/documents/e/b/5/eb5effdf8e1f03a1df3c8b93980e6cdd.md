Adequate history and examination are crucial parts in evaluating, assessing the location of the lesion, and treating patients with ataxia. The medical history should include age, gender, neurological, drug, toxin, and occupational exposures. Family history is essential. Systems review should assess the presence of constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and night sweats. A past medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and neurological diseases is essential.

Clinicians should ask the patients if any of the symptoms and signs are present, the level of functional disability in activities of daily living, onset, and progression. Common signs and symptoms include abnormalities in gait, slurred speech, difficulty in walking, abnormal eye movements, difficulty swallowing, increased fatigue, incoordination in fine motor movements such as handwriting, buttoning shirts, typing, tremors, vertigo, and problems in cognition.

A general and neurological physical examination is an integral part of the evaluation. A complete neurological examination, including mental status, cranial nerves, and cerebellar examination, is critical. Grading and level of functional disability are assessable with the use of scoring systems such as the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale, Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS), and for patients with Friedrich's ataxia, the Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale.
