As per the recent estimates by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), C. difficile infects approximately half a million Americans each year. Among those infected with C. difficile, about 29,000 patients had fatal outcomes within a month of the initial diagnosis, and 15,000 of these deaths could be directly attributed to C. difficile infection. Contrary to the popular belief that C. difficile is typically a hospital-acquired infection, recent studies have revealed that approximately 41% of the infections caused by C. difficile are community-acquired.
