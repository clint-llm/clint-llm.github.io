Specific goals for CQI projects can be developed through benchmarking, where performance is compared to similar institutions or core measures. Each goal should have metrics that are tracked to determine the outcomes of interventions. A successful CQI initiative is the result of a careful and thoughtful structured planning approach. For example, once clear goals have been established, various methodologies are possible to develop interventions. Before implementing CQI, careful planning and "groundwork" needs to be done, which may include articulating CQI goals, identifying specific clinical outcomes and administrative outcomes for the organization's future state, evaluating current processes to identify what functions and does not function in the organization's current state, understanding how healthcare information technology can help your organization meet its goals, and developing a plan to collect data going forward and compare progress to benchmarks.

AfterÂ this framework is set and the organization is 'fit' for CQI, organizations can utilize CQI strategies.

**Strategies for Interventions**

Lean: Developed by Toyota Corporation, Lean methodology is a process of improving value to customers and employees with a focus on the reduction of waste. Kaizen is a core concept of lean and is concentrated on continual improvement. Lean defines 7 types of waste, i.e., transport, inventory, motion, waiting, overproduction, over-processing, and defects. The goal is to reduce the amount of non-value-added activities, thereby increasing the amount of time and effort spent on value-added tasks.

Six Sigma: Developed at Motorola by Bill Smith in (1980), Six Sigma methodologies are focused on reducing error rates. Six Sigma refers to six standard deviations from the mean. If a process reaches Six Sigma, error rates should be less than 3.7/million opportunities. The process proceeds through 5 phases: define, measure, analyze, improve, and control (DMAIC).

PDSA: Plan-Do-Study-Act, also known as the Deming cycle, is a four-step process for quality improvement. During the planning stage, objectives and desired outcomes are defined. The 'do' phase allows for the implementation of the plan from the first stage. During the 'study' phase, results are then gathered and studied to determine what effect the plan has had. Finally, during the 'act' stage, if the process has achieved the goal, it is then controlled to ensure continued compliance, or if it has failed to achieve the goal, a new PDSA cycle is implemented to adjust to better meet outcomes.

Baldrige Award Criteria: This methodology focuses on improving the entire organization and instituting and nourishing a culture focused on CQI. It evolved from an award for organizational excellence through self-assessment into the methodology as implemented across the industry. The Baldridge Criteria focuses on enterprise-level improvement through improved communication, productivity, and effectiveness in seven categories: leadership, strategic planning, customer focus, measurement (including analysis and knowledge management), workforce focus, operations focus, and results. An important caveat to the Baldrige Criteria is that each of these seven criteria needs a champion in the organization to lead and manage improvement. This is because the Baldrige Criteria are suited for enterprise-level improvement rather than a single business or service entity.

It should be noted that no single CQI methodology, including Lean, Six Sigma, PDSA, and Baldrige, is thought to be superior to the other methodologies. Rather, the selection of a methodology should incorporate the organization's goals, the feasibility of the data and other resources, the skill sets of those involved, and, ultimately, the strategy that best fits the organization.
