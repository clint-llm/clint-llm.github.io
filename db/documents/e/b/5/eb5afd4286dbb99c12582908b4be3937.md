Celiac disease can have a similar symptom profile of chronic diarrhea. Celiac disease should be tested for by serologic testing. If necessary, this can also be tested for by small bowel biopsy, which shows flattening of villi.

Crohn disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that typically will cause diarrhea. This particular disease typically will present with patchy colitis and has various other characteristics such as perianal disease, like fistulas of fissures. On biopsy, granulomas are generally present along with transmural inflammation.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) that is diarrhea-predominant is also a consideration. IBS is typically considered a diagnosis of exclusion. Typically, symptoms of IBS include not only diarrhea but crampy abdominal pain that is improved by defecation and frequent changes in the consistency and frequency of bowel movements.
