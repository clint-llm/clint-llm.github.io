Due to the presence of iodine channels in lactating breast tissue, RAI is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding women.

Radioiodine has been found in breast milk for up to one month following the administration of therapeutic radioiodine-131.

The ATA additionally recommends all women of childbearing age undergo a pregnancy test before RAI therapy and avoid pregnancy 6 to 12 months following treatment.
