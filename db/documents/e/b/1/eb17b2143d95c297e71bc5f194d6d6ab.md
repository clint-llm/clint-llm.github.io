The prevalence of traumatic causes for PNI emphasizes the importance of patient safety education and patient use of personal protective equipment. Furthermore, patients should be encouraged to have a low threshold to seek care should they develop abnormal sensory, motor, or autonomic responses.

To decrease iatrogenic PNI, healthcare providers should be familiar with the local anatomy where the provider may be placing a needle, an orthotic device, a bandage, a tourniquet, positioning a patient, or performing a procedure.  Patients should undergo informed consent before interventions that include divulging the risk of unintended tissue damage, including nervous tissue.

Providers should be conscientious and cautious when positioning patients and performing procedures. Detailed documentation regarding nerve preserving technique is highly recommended. However, not completely protective against successful litigation.
