Forms of NRT do not need to be prescribed by a doctor; most are available over the counter. Patients should follow directions for each form of NRT. Even though there are different brands and forms, evidence shows no more significant effect of one type of NRT over another. Although some studies show no benefit to using NRT for longer than eight weeks, others have found that a longer duration of treatment with nicotine patches may be associated with an improved smoking cessation rate. The initial dosing usually depends on the number of cigarettes smoked daily, and heavier smokers should use increased strength/dose of nicotine therapy. Clinicians can prescribe various forms of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation.

**Nicotine Transdermal Patches**

It comes in different brands; some patches are designed for 24 hours at 5-mg to 52.5-mg dosages, while the higher doses are for heavier smokers. Other patches are designed to be only worn 16 hours a day and come in 5-mg to 25-mg doses. Patches require an application to a non-hairy, dry, clean area of the arm or upper body. Press onto skin for 10 seconds. Then, apply to a different area each time. Treatment is for about 8 to 10 weeks. The highest dose is started for patients over 45 kg who smoke more than ten cigarettes daily. The nicotine patch is the easiest NRT (patient compliance is better) and provides continuous nicotine delivery, among other NRT products. Generally used patch strengths are 21 mg, 14 mg, and 7 mg. If the patient smokes more than ten cigarettes per day, it is advisable to start with a 21 mg patch daily and gradually taper down to 14 mg and then 7 mg. If the patient smokes less than ten cigarettes daily, a 14 mg patch per day is usually prescribed and then tapered down to a 7 mg patch.

**Nicotine Gum**

It is available in different doses, at 2 mg and 4 mg. It is commonly used as a short-acting NRT. The patient chews the gum slowly until it tingles and chews until the itch disappears. Chew when the urge to smoke strikes. Recommended is 8 to 12 pieces of gum. To improve absorption, smokers should avoid acidic beverages such as coffee or carbonated drinks.

**Nicotine Lozenges**

These are available in 1-mg, 1.5-mg, 2-mg, and 4-mg doses. Users should allow 20 to 30 minutes to dissolve slowly and should not chew or swallow. Recommended is 8 to 12 lozenges daily.

**Nicotine Inhalation Cartridge**

It comes in 10 mg. The cartridge should be inserted into the inhaler and then popped into place. Inhale deeply or puff consecutively in short breaths. This type of NRT addresses both the physical and behavioral aspects of dependence. Recommended is 6 to 16 cartridges per day.

**Nicotine Nasal Spray**

It comes in 0.5 mg per spray. The patient should blow their nose before use. Then, tilt the head back, insert the bottle's tip, and spray once in each nostril.

**Nicotine Sublingual Tablet**

It comes in a 2 mg dose and is unavailable in the United States. Patients should understand not to use two doses back to back. If the patient misses a dose, they should take it as soon as possible. However, if it is close to the time of the next dose, they can skip the missed dose.

**Use in Specific Patient Population**

**Hepatic Impairment:**In smokers with moderately impaired liver function (Child-Pugh score 7), total clearance is decreased by 40–50%. There is no data about nicotine's pharmacokinetics in smokers with a Child-Pugh score>7. However, these patients are anticipated to show more significant effects on the clearance of nicotine than patients with moderately impaired liver function. Therefore, clinicians should consider dose reduction.

**Renal Impairment:**Nicotine clearance is decreased by approximately 30%  in patients with moderate renal impairment and approximately 50% in subjects with severe renal impairment. Clinicians should consider dose reduction.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**Tobacco smoke contains nicotine, hydrogen cyanide, and carbon monoxide, which are hazardous to the fetus. The NRT does not deliver hydrogen cyanide and carbon monoxide. However, preclinical studies have indicated that nicotine can cause fetal harm. Therefore, clinicians should motivate pregnant women to discontinue smoking using comprehensive behavioral interventions. In addition, if NRT is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while using NRT, clinicians should counsel the patient on the hazard to the fetus. (according to manufacturer's labeling). Evidence of pharmacotherapy interventions in pregnancy (including NRT) is limited and inadequate to make explicit recommendations. According to the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), comprehensive behavioral interventions are efficacious and are therefore suggested.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**Professional consensus is to avoid smoking and use short-acting NRT immediately after breastfeeding.
