Complications largely divide into early and late complications.  Early complications involve hematoma, bleeding, postoperative infections including perichondritis, dehiscence, and necrosis of the skin.  The most worrisome postoperative complication is a hematoma. Hematoma formation can lead to cartilage and skin necrosis. If not addressed immediately, the hematoma can progress to infection which could worsen cartilage necrosis and lead to cauliflower deformity. Cartilage necrosis can also result from over tightening of the sutures and sometimes excessive pressure from the dressing. Postoperative hematomas are usually seen between one to three days after surgery. Pain is one of the main symptoms and should prompt a timely examination.

Other late complications include excessive scarring suture extrusion, hypersensitivity, and most importantly poor aesthetic outcomes. Unsatisfactory aesthetic outcomes are the most common complication of otoplasty.
