The radial artery, ulnar artery, and anastomoses provide the blood supply of the wrist. The radial artery predominantly supplies the thumb and the lateral side of the index finger while the ulnar artery supplies the rest of the digits and the medial side of the index finger. In particular, vascular supply takes place via the anastomotic network consisting of three dorsal and three palmar arches, which arise from both the radial and ulnar arteries, that overlie the carpal bones.
