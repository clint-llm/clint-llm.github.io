When women have skin changes during pregnancy, it is important to work as an interprofessional team because there are many causes of dermatosis. The primary care provider, nurse practitioner and obstetrician should seek a consult from a dermatologist before making any recommendations on treatment.

Systemic steroids may be required in gestational pemphigoid and impetigo herpetiformis. Antihistamines and topical steroids are all that is required in treating PUPPP and atopic eruption of pregnancy.

Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the most effective pharmacologic treatment for intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and has the most benefit for mother and fetus. UDCA 450-1200 mg/day reduces total bile acids in cord blood, colostrum, and amniotic fluid.

The outcome of women with skin disorders of pregnancy are generally good with no adverse effect on the fetus.
