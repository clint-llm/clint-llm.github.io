The prognosis of CBS largely depends on the underlying cause of vision impairment or loss, with multiple symptoms associated with chronic ocular disease lasting multiple years.

One study highlighting this association found that 75% of patients with macular disease reported hallucinations for at least five years or more. In contrast, the prognosis is better in conditions where visual impairment can be quickly corrected, such as cataracts.

The prognosis of CBS can also be variable, with remitting visual hallucinations in those with slow progressing or stable vision impairment.

Lastly, outside of the visual hallucinations associated with CBS, the condition has also been associated with the development of dementia. One study showing this association found that 26% of individuals with CBS developed dementia around an average of 33 months.
