Patient education is critical to the management of pheochromocytomas. It is important for them to understand the episodic nature of symptoms prevalent in the condition. They should be informed that episodes of severe hypertension may be precipitated by medications like dopamine receptor antagonists, beta-blockersÂ (typically non-selective), tricyclic antidepressants, corticosteroids, sympathomimetics, and neuromuscular agents, or may be noted in the setting of surgery or induction of anesthesia. Common episodic symptoms would include:

- Headaches

- Sweating

- Heart racing

- Shortness of breath

- Chest pain

- Anxiety

All patients diagnosed with pheochromocytoma, especially those with a known family history of von Hippel Lindau syndrome, multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, and neurofibromatosis type 1, should be advised of the need for genetic screening of their relatives.

Several blood, urine, and imaging tests are available to assist medical professionals in diagnosing pheochromocytoma. Options for treatment include medications to control blood pressure and other symptoms. Options for surgical removal of the tumor are also available depending on several factors.
