Specific syndromes and disorders can affect the ear structure and dampen its function

- **Structural abnormalities:**Structural abnormalities like preauricular pits and tags, stenotic and atretic ear canals can be associated with hearing loss.

- **Mandibulofacial dysostosis:**This is an autosomal dominant condition, also known as Treacher Collins syndrome, characterized by downward slanting palpebral fissures, auricular malformations with preauricular blind fistulas, stenosis and/or atresia of the external ear canal and ossicular abnormalities.

- **Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum:**This spectrum is characterized by abnormal development of the first two branchial arches, resulting in anotia, preauricular tags, and atretic ear canals.

- **Craniofacial dysostosis:**This is a rare syndrome, also known as Crouzon syndrome, that results in premature skull bone fusion, which causes the ear to be atretic or to have stenosis and low set ears
