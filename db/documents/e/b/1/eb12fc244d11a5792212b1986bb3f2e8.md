A coronary artery is a well-developed trilaminar structure. The innermost layer is termed the tunica intima, which is lined with endothelial cells that make contact with the circulating arterial blood.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been primarily used for revascularization of complex coronary artery disease (CAD) since 1968.
