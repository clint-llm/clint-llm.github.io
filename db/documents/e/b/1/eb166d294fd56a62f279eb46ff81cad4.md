Acute retrosternal chest pain that is sharp and pleuritic presents in over 95% of cases of acute pericarditis.

The most important physical sign in pericarditis is the pericardial friction rub.

Other critical clinical signs to be aware of areÂ signs of tamponade such as raised jugular venous pressure (JVP), muffled heart sounds, and decreased blood pressure. If pericardial tamponade is concerned, checking for a pulsus paradoxus is recommended. It is defined as a drop of systolic blood pressure by more than 10 mm hg during inspiration.
