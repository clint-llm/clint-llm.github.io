The utilization of wrist splints may be either required or recommended. In situations such as during post-operative or post-reduction periods, the splint will be required to keep anatomical or near-anatomic alignment to allow for proper healing. For athletes, proper splinting can provide adequate protection in order to allow some of them to return to play while healing.

There are three main types of custom-molded splints that will be utilized for wrist injuries or pain, which are volar, thumb spica, and sugar tong. A volar splint is utilized for injuries involving carpal bones (excluding scaphoid and trapezium) and soft tissue injuries of the wrist. Thumb spica is utilized for suspected injuries to the scaphoid, de Quervain tenosynovitis, and injuries or pain of the thumb. Of note, a thumb spica should be performed for both confirmed and suspected scaphoid fractures, as the risk is high for avascular necrosis due to its blood supply. Confirmed or suspected scaphoid fractures require orthopedic follow-up for further monitoring and/or intervention. Sugar tong is utilized for acute injuries of the distal radius and ulna, as it will provide volar and dorsal support while limiting supination and pronation of the forearm.
