Patients who have experienced a concussion show a poorly understood but complex array of neuronal, metabolic, and ionic changes. The mechanism of injury seems to be associated with axonal shearing. This causes rapid depolarization, neurotransmitter release, and ionic shifts where potassium ions leak extracellularly, and they are replaced with sodium and calcium intracellularly. This results in dysregulation of the cerebral blood flow leading to edema.Â Thus increased glucose utilization combined with the injury-related decrease in resting cerebral blood flow creates an energy mismatch.
