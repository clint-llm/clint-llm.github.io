American Trypanosomiasis, also known as Chagas disease, is a potentially life-threatening zoonotic illness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease is most commonly seen in Central and South America, Trinidad, and the southern United States. However, it is less common outside of rural areas where vectors are commonly found in rustic housing. The vector-borne disease is transmitted through vertical transmission between mother and fetus or via contact with contaminated feces/urine of the reduviid bug (triatomine bug, kissing bug) and hence serves as the intermediate host for the parasite. Other modes of transmission include transfusion of blood products, transplant of the infected organ, or by consumption of infected food or drinks. Major complications of this disease includes cardiomegaly, gastrointestinal disease, and in some case peripheral neuropathy.
