Three extensive studies have shown that the mortality rate of acquired hemophilia A (AHA) lies between 8% to 22%. Still, more recent studies have shown lower mortality rates owing to the anti-hemorrhagic treatments.

Low FVIII is associated with a lower rate of complete remission and survival. Besides incomplete remission, other risk factors for death includeÂ advanced age and underlying malignancy.

However, in the post-partum period, AHA has an excellent prognosis in about 97% of the patients.
