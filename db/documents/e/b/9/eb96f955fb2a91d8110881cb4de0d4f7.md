Angelman syndrome (AS) is a challenging disorder with complex management. Due to no definitive cure, the management aims to control symptoms and improve the quality of life.

Once AS is suspected, the patient should be evaluated by an interprofessional team. Neonatal nurses should be tuned to the physical features of AS, and a full neurologic exam should be carried out. They should also provide support to the parents. Early diagnosis and treatment improve the prognosis of individuals with AS.

Pediatricians need to have a high degree of suspicion when a patient presents with symptoms of AS. When AS is suspected, methylation studies and FISH must be done to confirm the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is critical to incorporate a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurologist, developmental specialist, speech therapist, and a geneticist. Genetic counseling can help calculate future recurrence risk of AS and plan subsequent pregnancies.

Early intervention, developmental evaluation, and therapies should be started since infancy, to improve and reach the maximum developmental capacity of the patient. A family meeting and follow-ups will help the parent to be actively involved in the management of the patient. Other commodities should be evaluated and treated by every subspecialty to prevent any further possible complications. [Level5]
