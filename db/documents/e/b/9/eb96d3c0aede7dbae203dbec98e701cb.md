Electron microscopy (EM) uses a beam of electrons to produce an image of the specimen instead of light, generating higher-resolution images that better identify histological structures. With EM, ultrastructural features of the epithelium, like adherens junctions, tight junctions, gap junctions, desmosomes, hemidesmosomes, and the basal lamina, which separates the epithelium from connective tissue, can be identified
