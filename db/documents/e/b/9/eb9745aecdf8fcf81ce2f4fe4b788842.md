Dental impression materials are used to copy oral tissues, create a dental impression, and then pour gypsum into them to produce a dental cast. A dental cast is used to analyze and diagnose a clinical case, manufacture removable and fixed prostheses, and build occlusal splints and mouthguards. Beyond the teeth, impression materials are utilized to fabricate maxillofacial prostheses such as obturators (maxillectomy and cleft lip and palate), ear prostheses, and prostheses of the eyes.
