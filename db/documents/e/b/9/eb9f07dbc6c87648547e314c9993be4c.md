MDMA differs from other amphetamines due to the attachment of the methylenedioxy group, which is structurally similar to the psychedelic hallucinogen mescaline. Because of this, MDMA is a chemical compound that shares properties of both amphetamines and hallucinogens.

Desired effects of the drug include sympathomimetic arousal, sensual enhancement, feelings of euphoria, and emotional closeness to others.  Other effects include nausea, trismus, and bruxism. These effects are attributable to the increase in circulation of the neurotransmitters mentioned above, dopamine and serotonin. Blood pressure and heart rate elevations are secondary to the adrenergic effects of an increase in circulating norepinephrine acting on alpha, beta-1, and beta-2 receptors.

In addition to its effects on neurotransmitters, MDMA has also been found to increase the blood levels of arginine vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone), leading to fluid retention. This effect, coupled with excessive water intake, has been implicated in the development of life-threatening hyponatremia and coma.
