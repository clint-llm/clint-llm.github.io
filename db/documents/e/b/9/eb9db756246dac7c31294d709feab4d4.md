It is important to emphasize to the coaching staff to encourage athletes to seek medical attention if they are experiencing any unusual pain or symptoms. Athlete education is also of paramount importance. Within our military sports medicine practice, we spend a great of time talking to our patients regarding proper footwear selection, training surfaces and running/race/walking techniques. Clinicians should also encourage using a shoe made specifically for running or walking versus a general type of athletic shoe. Health care providers require knowledge regarding appropriate running shoes for an athlete's foot type (normal arch, high arch, flat arch).

Additionally, athletes should be encouraged to undertake a slow, gradual increase in time, pace, and distance. Cross-training with cycling, swimming, and elliptical is also highly encouraged. Lastly, patients should receive counsel on the importance of a proper diet, including caloric intake and appropriate intake of vitamins and minerals, especially calcium and vitamin D.
