Derived from the foxglove plant (Digitalis spp.), digoxin is a cardiac glycoside that historically was used for "dropsy" (edema) and is currently used as an inotrope to improve systolic dysfunction in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and as an atrioventricular nodal blocking agent for managing atrial tachydysrhythmias. Digoxin may improve the quality of life in CHF patients, but it does not confer a mortality benefit, and its narrow therapeutic index limits its utility. Digoxin toxicity can present acutely, by an intentional or accidental overdose (i.e., therapeutic misadventure), or chronically, such as when patients on digoxin develop an acute kidney injury. Similar toxicity can occur after exposure to cardioactive steroids in plants such as oleander, red squill, or dogbane or from animals such as Bufo toads.
