The prognosis of most pediatric facial trauma is excellent, especially in the absence of underlying fractures. Even if fractures are present, children have a remarkable ability to remodel bone and rarely have either need for surgical intervention or any lasting bony deformity. The most common sequela is scarring, particularly from burns or lacerations near the lips or around the eyes; generally, this is cosmetic but can have functional deficits. Scarring can be reduced with meticulous daily application of sunscreen to the site of the wound for 6-12 months after suture removal or adhesive dissolution.
