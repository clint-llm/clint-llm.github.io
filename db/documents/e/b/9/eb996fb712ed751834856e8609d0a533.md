The adductor pollicis is innervated by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve (C8-T1). Understanding the pathway of the ulnar nerve is important for assessing clinical symptomatology of neuromuscular upper extremity injuries. The ulnar nerve is the terminal branch of the medial cord of the brachial plexus and it courses distally, running posterior to the medial epicondyle of the elbow at the cubital tunnel. Once in the forearm, it pierces the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris, giving off several branches to innervate two forearm muscles. It then traverses the wrist by traveling superficial to the flexor retinaculum and enters the hand via the Guyon canal. Once in the hand, it divides its superficial and deep branches. The deep branch specifically travels between the muscles of the hypothenar eminence to the deep compartment of the palm to join the deep palmar arterial arch. In addition to the adductor pollicis, the deep branch also innervates the hypothenar muscles, the medial two lumbricals, the interossei of the hand, and the palmaris brevis.
