The standard initial dose of glimepiride is between 1 and 2 mg once daily, taken orally before the patient's first meal. Patients who are prone to hypoglycemia should be started at 1 mg once daily and titrated slowly to an appropriate dose. Following initial therapy, the standard maintenance dosage is at 1 to 4 mg once daily; however, this can be gradually titrated up to 8 mg once daily, depending on the patient's blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels. It is important to note that current guidelines do not have a fixed dosage regimen for glimepiride, and the dose requires adjustment according to the patient's blood glucose levels and hemoglobin A1c.

When used for combination therapy with metformin, the clinician should attempt to identify the minimum effective dose of each drug as the risk of hypoglycemia increases with the use of metformin with glimepiride.
