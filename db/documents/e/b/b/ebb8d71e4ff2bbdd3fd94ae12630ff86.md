Pseudohyponatremia is an uncommon, underrecognized spurious lab abnormality. In the absence of true hyponatremia, pseudohyponatremia is not independently associated with increased morbidity or mortality. Pseudohyponatremia requires recognition as an inappropriately abnormal lab finding that warrants further evaluation to assess for a potential explanation. Consultation with the appropriate specialist, based on the likely etiology, is recommended. Serial follow-up in the outpatient primary care setting is also the recommended approach to ensure the resolution of abnormal lab value and compliance with further therapy. An interprofessional healthcare team comprised of clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists, exercising open communication and coordinated activity can assess and address all the potential etiologies and optimally drive patient care.
