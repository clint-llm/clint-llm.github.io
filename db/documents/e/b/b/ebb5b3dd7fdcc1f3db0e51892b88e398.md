A mycotic aneurysm is an infection of vessel wall which can be bacterial, fungal, or viral in origin; they are a rare but severe complication of systemic infection and atherosclerosis, which often presents multiple diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. To avoid the high morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, it requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of mycotic aneurysms and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of mycotic aneurysms and their presenting features in different sites of involvement.
- Review appropriate evaluation procedures for a suspected mycotic aneurysm.
- Outline the management options available for mycotic aneurysms.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance therapy for mycotic aneurysms and improve outcomes.
