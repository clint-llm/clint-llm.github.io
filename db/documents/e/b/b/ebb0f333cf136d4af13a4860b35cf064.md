Herpes simplex encephalitis is caused by Herpes Simplex Virus type 1(HSV-1) or type 2 (HSV-2). HSV-1 causes encephalitis in children beyond the neonatal period and in adults, and it is the most common etiology for sporadic non-seasonal encephalitis worldwide. HSV-2 commonly causes encephalitis in neonates and the immunocompromised. Herpes simplex encephalitis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in adults and children despite antiviral treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of herpes simplex encephalitis, stressing the need for close coordination and communication between various healthcare professional teams to ensure the best outcome for individual patients.
