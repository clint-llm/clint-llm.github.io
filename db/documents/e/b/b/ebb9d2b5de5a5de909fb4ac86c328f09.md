While osteopetrosis is a disease of primary bone sclerosis, many conditions can lead to similar osteosclerosis in a secondary way. The following conditions must be considered when evaluating a patient with osteosclerotic bone noted on radiographic evaluation:

- Beryllium, lead, and bismuth poisoning

- Fluorosis

- Myelofibrosis

- Paget disease

- Cancer (lymphoma or osteoblastic bony metastases)
