Patients using bromocriptine should take a pregnancy test if amenorrhea occurs due to the possibility of pregnancy and diminished prolactin secretion in the fetus with continued use.Â Clinicians should discontinue bromocriptine if pregnancy is confirmed unless otherwise recommended by a physician.

Patients taking bromocriptine should also receive liver function tests (LFTs) to check for elevated liver enzymes and be given a cardiovascular assessment before using the drug.
