- Loose anagen syndrome is an inherited and often self-limited condition resulting in short hair that is easily broken and often does not require cutting.

- Lifestyle modifications that minimize trauma or manipulation of hairs are the best initial form of therapy.

- If treatment is desired topical minoxidil can be tried to lengthen the anagen cycle and reduce shedding.

- The prognosis is generally good with improvement often beginning during adolescence.
