Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy happens secondary to many etiologies, differing in their pathophysiology and presentation. A summary of possible etiologies is listed here:

- Gestational thrombocytopenia

- Immune thrombocytopenia

- Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA): TMA in pregnancy divides into pregnancy-specific TMA and non-pregnancy specific TMA due to differences in management.

- Pregnancy specific TMA

- Pre-eclampsia (PEC): 
- Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets (HELLP) syndrome
- Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP)


- TMA not specific to pregnancy

- Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP)
- Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS)

- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

- Hereditary thrombocytopenia (HT): Further classify according to the size of the platelet, genetic defect and inheritance pattern (WAS gene, HOXA 11 gene, MYH9 disorders, etc.)

- Others
- Bone marrow failure syndromes

- Aplastic anemia
- Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS),
- Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN),
- Leukemia/lymphoma 
- Marrow infiltrative disorders


- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH),
- Drug-induced thrombocytopenia,
- Type IIB von Willebrand disease (VWD).
- Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)

It is also worthwhile to distribute the etiology of thrombocytopenia according to the trimester and the platelet count.

**First Trimester**

- Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) (most common)

- Hereditary thrombocytopenia (HT)

- Others (Please see above for a detailed list)

- Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)

**Second Trimester**

- **Platelet count greater than 100 x 10/L**
- Gestational thrombocytopenia
- ITP
- Pre-eclampsia/ HELLP
- HT/Others/TMA

- **Platelet count under 100 x 10/L**
- ITP (most common)
- HT
- Pre-eclampsia/HELLP
- Others
- Gestational thrombocytopenia 
- TMA

**Third Trimester**

- **Platelet count more than 100 x 10/L**
- Gestational Thrombocytopenia (most common)
- Pre-eclampsia/ HELLP (second most common)
- Others/TMA/ITP/HT

- **Platelet count less than 50 x 10/L**
- Pre-eclampsia/ HELLP (most common)
- ITP
- Others
- TMA
- Gestational thrombocytopenia/HT
