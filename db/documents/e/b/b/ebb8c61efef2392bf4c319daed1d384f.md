Loose anagen hair syndrome has an estimated incidence of 2 cases per million per year and is either spontaneous or inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with incomplete penetrance. Most cases occur in young children with light colored hair with an average onset at 3 years of age. This diffuse hair loss must be distinguished from other types of non-scarring alopecia and may account for up to 10% of cases of childhood alopecia.
