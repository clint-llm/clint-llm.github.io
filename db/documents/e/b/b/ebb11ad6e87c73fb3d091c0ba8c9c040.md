The diagnosis is based on taking a careful history including the autoimmune diseases in the patient and family, examination of the mucosas, extragenital skin and completed by a gynecological exam. Thus, the diagnosis of LS is usually clinical. But in some cases, a biopsy can be performed. However, atypical histology does not rule out the diagnosis.

Biopsies should be performed in case of:

- Atypical clinical presentation

- Suspected malignancy

- Nonresponse, after an appropriate duration, to recommended first-line treatment

The workup of the condition should include investigation of thyroid function, and according to symptoms investigation of the other autoimmune diseases.
