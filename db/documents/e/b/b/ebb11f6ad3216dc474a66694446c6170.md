Acute renal colic is severe pain resulting from the presence of a stone in the urinary system. The stone can be present anywhere along the path between the kidneys and urethra. Nephrolithiasis refers to kidney stones, or renal calculi, and, in conjunction with ureteral calculi, are the primary cause of acute renal colic. Nephrolithiasis has a lifetime prevalence of five to fifteen percent and an incidence of 0.5% in North America and Europe. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of nephrolithiasis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients affected by this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most common locations for renal calculi.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with acute renal colic.
- Summarize how to evaluate a patient with acute renal colic. 
- Explain the importance of a cohesive interprofessional team in treating patients with acute renal colic.
