Outside of the physician provider, one or more other assistants may be necessary to hold or manipulate instrumentation throughout the procedure. These assistants could consist of resident physicians, medical students, nursing staff, medical assistants, or trained office personnel. Usually, their assistance is necessary for exchanging guide catheters, flushing the device, or manipulating the balloon inflation device.
