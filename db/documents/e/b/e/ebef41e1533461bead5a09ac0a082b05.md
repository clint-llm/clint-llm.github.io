Less than one in every four patients will require surgery even if the condition progresses to a symptomatic full-thickness tear.

Multiple authors have debated the importance of corticosteroids beyond eight weeks.

At this time, there is much debate about the surgical treatment of the supraspinatus tendonitis and its associated pathology. Some studies show good improvement with isolated subacromial decompression with or without acromioplasty.

With regards to prognosis, a significant portion of untreated supraspinatus tendonitis may go on to rotator cuff tears. In some patients, these early changes may be subclinical and may not present until the tear has been present for some time. Keener et al. described asymptomatic shoulders with rotator cuff changes visible on ultrasound. He found that a significant portion of these patients had a rotator cuff defect that enlarged and became symptomatic over time.
