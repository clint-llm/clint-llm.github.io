21-hydroxylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency in one of the enzymes required for the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal glands. 21-Hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia but can be a challenge to diagnose and treat. This activity reviews the use of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement as the mainstays of treatment and highlights the role of a well-coordinated interprofessional care team in improving outcomes for patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiologic basis of 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
- Describe the expected history and physical findings for a patient with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
- Outline the recommended screening tests to evaluate for 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
- Summarize the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
