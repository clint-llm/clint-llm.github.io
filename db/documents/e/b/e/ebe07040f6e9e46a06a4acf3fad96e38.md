Tramadol is an opioid and, like other opioids, selectively bind to different opiate receptors in the central nervous system. The liver enzyme, CYP2D6, converts tramadol to its active metabolite M1, which has a stronger affinity for the mu receptor compared to the inactive form. Tramadol does not bind to the mu receptor as much as morphine. Unlike other opioids, tramadol does not reverse its course completely after the administration of naloxone. Along with the partial agonist activity on the opioid receptors, it also inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine.
