Treatment consists of medical management with prolonged antifungal therapy and consideration of surgery. Potassium iodide, cotrimoxazole, amphotericin B, imidazoles, and hyperbaric oxygen have been used with varying success. Standard treatment is with potassium iodide and triazoles (particularly itraconazole). Due to relative resistance to antifungals, prolonged daily therapy for months is recommended.

Surgery alone has a limited role as there is a risk of recurrence; therefore needs to be used in conjunction with antifungal therapy. Surgery in nasofacial conidiobolomycosis in the early stages can limit severe cosmetic damage. Still, in advanced stages, facial reconstructive surgery may be necessary as extensive fibrosis persists even after eradicating the fungus. Nasal symptoms and central facial swelling improve with antifungal treatment and surgical excision. Cryotherapy has been tried with limited success. In cases of gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis, resection of the affected bowel followed by prolonged antifungals is very important.

Hyperbaric oxygen leads to free radicals, increases the fungicidal activity of neutrophils, and causes vasodilation increasing perfusion to affected tissues. Hyperbaric oxygen can theoretically help with the healing process, but further studies are needed.
