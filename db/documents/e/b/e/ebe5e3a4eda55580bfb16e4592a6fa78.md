The cumulative data among multiple studies on BVN ablation demonstrated consistent, reproducible, clinically meaningful, and statistically significant improvement in reducing pain and improving function in patients with diagnostic evidence of vertebral pain. Among 11 clinical studies with direct patient data, 3 reviews, 2 clinical guidelines, and 1 systematic review published to date, there is a consensus that the procedure is effective at short-term and perhaps long-term in patients that meet the above-described indications.

Documented improvements in pain reduction measured by the visual analog scale, functional disability measured by the Oswestry disability index, opioid utilization reduction, and improved quality of life measured by the short-form 36 and EQ-5D-5L have been reported. In fact, studies have pointed out that there is evidence that BVN ablation is more beneficial than the current standard of care for the treatment of low back pain from damaged vertebral endplates.

The current literature with level Ia-IV studies consistently exhibits positive outcomes with a minimal clinically important difference in reducing pain and improving function, and based upon the available present data, society guidelines strongly recommend BVN ablation in a subset of patients with chronic axial LBP, particularly those with pain greater than 6 months of duration, unresponsive to conservative treatment for at least 6 months, and with diagnostic evidence of vertebral endplate damage (MCs) suggesting a vertebrogenic etiology.
