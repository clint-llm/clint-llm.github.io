- Iatrogenic pneumothorax is a patient safety indicator (PSI) condition.  It is a traumatic pneumothorax secondary to an invasive procedure or surgery.

- The most common cause is the placement of a subclavian central venous line (CVL).

- Other causes include pulmonary needle biopsy (transthoracic and transbronchial), nasogastric tube placement, or positive pressure ventilation. There are case reports after placing nebulizer kits and acupuncture to the chest wall.

- The presentation is mainly pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea with decreased to absent breath sounds on the affected side during or after a procedure.

- Treatment should not be delayed for imaging.

- The diagnosis is ideally made clinically. Ultrasound evaluation to check for pneumothorax is emerging as a very accurate and rapid tool.

- Treatment is needle decompression followed by tube thoracostomy. VATS and open thoracotomy are reserved for recurrent or severe cases.
