More than half of the cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernia are suspected prenatally during the routine anomaly scan done between 18 to 24 weeks of gestation.Â Visualization of abdominal contents in the thorax and mediastinal shift to the contralateral side of the diaphragmatic defect on ultrasound examination are characteristic features of CDH. However, mild cases may not be identified until later if the defect is small, and there is an absence of herniation of abdominal contents into the thoracic cavity. A right-sided CDH with the herniated liver can be difficult to diagnose as the echogenicity of the liver is similar to that of the lung tissue on ultrasound. In such instances, a color Doppler ultrasound examination helps identify the presence of ductus venosus and intrahepatic vessels in the thoracic cavity. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being used in the assessment of the severity of CDH and other associated anomalies. The degree of lung hypoplasia, the position of the liver, and co-existing anomalies determine the survival chances and prognosis in CDH. The lung area to head ratio is a marker of the degree of lung volume. It is calculated by measuring the lung area of the contralateral lung divided by the fetal head circumference. Metkus et al. reported from a cohort of fetuses with CDH diagnosed before 25 weeks gestation that a lung-to-head circumference ratio (LHR)>1.35 was associated with 100% survival and an LHR <0.6 with no survival.
