Volvulus occurs when portions of the bowel get entangled upon a mesenteric axis, which can cause impairment of the blood supply or can result in complete or partial obstruction of the bowel lumen. This condition usually affects the colon. Colonic volvulus is a rare occurrence in the United States, attributing to approximately 4% of causes of large bowel obstruction, followed by cancer and diverticulitis. Of note, there are certain regions of the world where colonic volvulus happens more frequently. In areas of the Middle East, India, South America, Africa, and Russia, colonic volvulus attributes for approximately 50% of all accounts of colonic obstruction. The regional areas listed above have been coined the "volvulus belt."Â Sigmoid volvulus occurs more frequently compared to cecal volvulus.
