Patient counseling, preoperative discussion, and informed consent are paramount. It mitigates dissatisfied patients, provides realistic expectations, and prepares patients for potential complications and revision surgery. Patients following MWL often undergo several procedures to address excess skin and lipodystrophy in many areas not limited to the arms, chest, back, abdomen, and thighs. As a result, these patients are at a greater risk of complications, especially when such procedures are combined in 1 operation.

In a meta-analysis of 29 studies including nearly 1600 patients, the most common complications included unfavorable scarring (9.9%), recurrence of skin ptosis (7.8%), and wound dehiscence (6.9%).

The incidence of seroma (collection of fluid in the upper arm) and infection was 5.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Less common complications were nerve-related (2.5%), lymphoedema or lymphocele (2.5%), skin necrosis or delayed healing (2.3%), and hematoma (2%). Revision surgery was required in 7.5% of patients to improve the aesthetic outcome, whilst re-operation for non-aesthetic reasons was uncommon (1.6%). Furthermore, combining liposuction with brachioplasty reduced the incidence of complications (p<0.05).

In a prospective study of nearly 2,300 patients undergoing brachioplasty, the authors intended to capture major complications; they reported that hematoma (1.7%) and infection (1.1%) were the most common major complications.

Further insight from their study revealed that male gender and having combined procedures were associated with increased risk of hematoma, whilst a BMI = or > 30 was independently associated with increased infection risk. Therefore, judicious patient selection and informing patients about the increased morbidity as appropriate facilitates thorough preoperative counseling and tailors expectations.
