The utility of the polysomnogram (PSG) stems from the array of physiologic data gathered during sleep. As such an extensive evaluation, there are also many potential diagnoses, the nuanced scoring, and diagnostic criteria beyond the scope of this article. Several examples of possible diagnoses are evident from the indications above.

OSA, however, deserves special attention because of its prevalence.

Obstructive hypopneas (OHs) are a partial reduction in airflow, also with continued respiratory activity. Scoring obstructive hypopneas requires a drop in the signal by at least 30% for ten or more seconds (typically scored based on the nasal pressure transducer channel) associated with a decrease in peripheral oxygen saturation of at least 3% from baseline or an EEG arousal.

EEG, EOG, EMG, and body position sensor or visual confirmation of body position are essential to identify supine stage R sleep. For most patients, OAs and OHs are most likely to occur during supine REM. Once identified, OAs and OHs are combined and averaged throughout sleep to give the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI).

An AHI of 5 events/hour or less is considered normal for adults. Mild OSA is 5 to 14 events/hour, moderate 15 to 30 events/hour, and over 30 events/hour qualifies as a severe disease.
