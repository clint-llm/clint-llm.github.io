All patients should be admitted to the intensive care until, with more severe cases going to a burn unit. The case fatality rate of Streptococcal TSS may exceed 50% whereas non-streptococcal TSS is less than 3%.  The CDC does not recommend routine screening and chemoprophylaxis of household contacts of patients with invasive Group A Strep (GAS) infections.

In two large prospective trials, only five cases of invasive GAS occurred amongst almost 2000 household contacts. However, based on risk factors for death from invasive GAS, the CDC states “health care providers may choose to offer chemoprophylaxis to household members aged 65 years or those at increased risk of sporadic invasive GAS infection”. While there are no large trials with evidence-based regimens, should you choose to treat household contacts, seven to ten days of oral cephalexin is a reasonable choice.
