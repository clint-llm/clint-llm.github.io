Cutaneous leiomyomas are rare lesions that are difficult to diagnose and treat. Thus, they are best managed with an interprofessional team that includes the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, dermatologist, plastic surgeon, and pathologist. The problem with the treatment is that the lesions tend to recur. While surgery is the ideal method of treatment, excessive excision for a benign lesion is considered too aggressive. Pharmacological means of treatment have not met with much success. Observation in asymptomatic patients is a reasonable alternative. All patients need follow up because these lesions can grow and compress adjacent structure. Some patients with inherited lesions are prone to renal cell cancer and thus close follow up is necessary.
