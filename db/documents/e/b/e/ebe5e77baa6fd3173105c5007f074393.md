Sensory innervation anterior to the eustachian tube opening is via the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V2), which travels through the sphenopalatine ganglion. The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) provides posterior sensory innervation. Muscles originating in the nasopharynx receive their motor supply from the vagus nerve (CN X), except for the tensor veli palatini muscle, which is supplied by the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3).
