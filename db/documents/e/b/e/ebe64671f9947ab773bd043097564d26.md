Posterior cerebral artery (PCA) strokes can be challenging to diagnose, due to the variability in symptoms, which may be nonspecific and inconsistent upon initial presentation. This is further complicated in that patients are not always aware of their symptoms, making it more difficult to establish a timeline. PCA strokes can restrict the blood supply of multiple brain regions, including the occipital lobe, the inferomedial temporal lobe, a large portion of the thalamus, and the upper brainstem and midbrain. This activity examines the presentation, evaluation, and management of posterior cerebral artery strokes and stresses the role of an interprofessional team approach to the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the signs and symptoms that may be caused by a posterior cerebral artery stroke based on location and severity of the regions of diminished perfusion.
- Describe the components of stroke evaluation.
- Review the gold standard test for diagnosing a posterior cerebral artery stroke.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to enhance outcomes for patients affected by posterior cerebral artery strokes.
