The pathophysiology for premature atrial contractions has not been well established. This is due in part to the relatively benign nature of the condition and the unnecessary invasiveness of electrophysiologic studies on humans to find a cause. Common theoretic mechanisms for this condition are based around abnormal automaticity of the cardiac myocytes, increased eliciting events from chemical or physical instigators, and reentry of a retrograde impulse. For these causes, structural heart damage or chemical use may be found during the history and physical examination.

Genetic causes have also been studied, albeit in animals. Nevertheless, an LKB1 (cardiac-specific liver kinase B1) gene deletion has been associated with defects in ion channel formation of the atria. This has been shown to alter generation and conduction of action potentials, which predisposes the atria to remodeling, fibrosis, and ultimately atrial fibrillation.
