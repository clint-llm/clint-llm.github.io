Methylene blue is a medication used in the management and treatment of methemoglobinemia, a condition in which hemoglobin decreases its ability to carry oxygen. This activity reviews the indications, action, adverse effects, and contraindications for methylene blue as a valuable agent in the therapy of methemoglobinemia, vasoplegic syndrome, Plasmodium Falciparum, and Isofosfamide-induced Encephalopathy, as well as for diagnostic purposes such as sentinel lymph node mapping during breast procedures and parathyroid gland mapping during parathyroidectomies. This activity will highlight the indications, mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent for members of a healthcare team managing patients with methemoglobinemia and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for the administration of methylene blue.
- Identify the potential adverse effects of methylene blue.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient experiencing methemoglobinemia.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst a medical interprofessional team to enhance care coordination for patients receiving methylene blue.
