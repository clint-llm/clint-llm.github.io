The primary clinical significance of microdermabrasion lies in cosmetic and aesthetic benefits. It is a minimally invasive procedure that can offer evened skin tone, bright complexion, reduced appearance of dark spots, and wrinkles, with cleaned-out pores and improved smoothness of the skin. Microdermabrasion has also been shown to enhance transdermal drug delivery by allowing the drug to diffuse more freely in the viable epidermis. The theoretical benefits of this are thought to include improved transdermal insulin delivery, transdermal vitamin C delivery, transdermal lidocaine delivery, and transdermal 5-fluorouracil delivery. Although there are several ongoing clinical trials with promising results, the feasibility of using microdermabrasion in a clinical setting to enhance transdermal drug delivery is still unknown.
