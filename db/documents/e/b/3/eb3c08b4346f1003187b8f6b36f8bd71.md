The prognosis of chronic headaches is variable. Anxiety and mood disorders, elevated stress levels, insufficient sleep, poor headache management, and low socioeconomic status are the primary prognostic characteristicsâ€”patients with higher expectations for treatment display a better prognosis for decreased headache intensity and frequency. No specific age group has an improved response to treatment. Incidence at an older age generally correlates to less severe symptoms. Employed patients responded better to treatment than those patients on medical leave.
