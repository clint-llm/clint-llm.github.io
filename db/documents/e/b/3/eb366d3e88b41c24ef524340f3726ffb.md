Spinal arteries originate from branches of larger arteries that supply the internal organs. The subclavian arteries of the neck branch into the vertebral arteries and ascending cervical arteries of the spine. The posterior intercostal arteries of the spine branch from the thoracic aorta while the lumbar arteries of the spine originate from the abdominal aorta. The lateral sacral arteries branch from the internal iliac arteries in the pelvis. Each of these arteries supplying the spine splits into anterior and posterior branches. The anterior branch supplies blood to the vertebral body, and the posterior branch supplies blood to the vertebral arch. Radicular arteries course along the middle, supplying the interior of the vertebral canal and vertebral column.

Radicular veins drain the smaller veins of the spinal cord and the internal and external vertebral veins. They empty into segmental and intervertebral veins. Blood flows from these vessels into one of three large vessels depending on the location. The superior vena cava drains the area of the cervical spine. The azygous and hemiazygous veins drain the thoracic area, and the inferior vena cava drains the lower regions of the lumbar and sacral spine.
