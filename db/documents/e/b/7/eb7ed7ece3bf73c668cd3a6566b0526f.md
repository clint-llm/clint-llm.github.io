A fundus camera with excitation and a barrier filter is used for taking photographs. There are two categories of fundus cameras used for ICGA, digital flash cameras and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopes (SLOs). In a digital flash camera (including FF 450 plus by Zeiss and TRC-50DX by Topcon), the light source is white light. Its excitation filter transmits rays of wavelength between 640 and 780 nm and barrier filter between 820 and 900 nm. In SLOs (including Spectralis by Heidelberg, Mirante by Nidek, and California by Optos), laser monochromatic light is used for excitation. The Spectralis uses a diode laser (790 nm) for excitation.

The standard intravenous dose of ICG for an adult individual is 25 mg in 5 ml solvent.
