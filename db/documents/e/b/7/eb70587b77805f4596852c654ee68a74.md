CBS is described and understood as a transient condition not associated with significant adverse consequences or complications outside of worsening hallucinations. CBS complications mainly pertain to the psychological effects of the illusions experienced by patients.

Patients often fail to inform any medical staff or family and ultimately start believing they are becoming mentally ill.Â Further illustrating this phenomenon, a study in 2014 showed that approximately 32% of those with CBS are emotionally distressed from their hallucination.
