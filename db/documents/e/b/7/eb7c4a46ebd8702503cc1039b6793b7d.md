**Normal Origin Variants**

The origin of the LAD is a trifurcation of the LMCA into a LAD, LCx, and ramus intermedius instead of the regular bifurcation consisting of the LCx and LAD.

**Normal Course Variants**

Usually, the coronary arteries travel through the epicardial fat, but in rare cases, a coronary artery may travel into the heart muscle; this is called a myocardial bridge. The mid LAD is the most commonly involved coronary artery. The myocardial bridge usually involves the proximal segment, however other segments can be affected. The length of the myocardial bridging is variable, but it typically ranges from 10 mm to 50 mm. Most patients with myocardial bridging are asymptomatic, and no abnormalities are observable during functional stress testing. However, occasionally when the muscle contracts, the blood vessels that travel underneath become occluded, and symptoms of the acute coronary syndrome can present.

**Normal Termination Variants**

A "wraparound LAD" is a term coined to describe a normal variant course of the LAD when it wraps around the cardiac apex and supplies a part of the inferior apical wall.
