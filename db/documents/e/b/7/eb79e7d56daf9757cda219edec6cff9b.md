**American Society of Hematology (ASH) Clinical Practice Guidelines on Venous Thromboembolism**

Below is a summary of the salient points from the latest clinical practice guidelines published by ASH on the diagnosis and management of VTE.

- In patients with low pretest probability for VTE, the initial test to obtain is a D-dimer.

- A ventilation-perfusion scan or a CTPA should follow this test if the results are positive, while a negative test rule out VTE.

- In patients with low pretest probability for PE who present to an emergency department, PERC rule may be used to determine whether D-dimer testing is needed.

- A positive D-dimer alone cannot be used to make the diagnosis and must be followed up with additional testing. D-dimer is still the recommended initial test of choice in

- In patients with low pretest probability under evaluation for possible recurrent VTE. 

- A ventilation-perfusion scan or a CTPA should follow this test if results are positive, while negative test rules out VTE.

- A positive D-dimer in suspected cases of initial or recurrent lower extremity DVT should be followed up with a proximal lower extremity ultrasound or whole leg ultrasound.

- Routine use of anti-factor Xa to guide low molecular weight heparin dosing, even in those with renal failure or with morbid obesity, is not a recommendation. 

- Dose adjustment or alternate agents are the advised approach in these cases.

- In cases of life-threatening bleeding from vitamin K antagonist treatment, 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) is the recommended therapy.

- In cases of life-threatening bleeding from oral direct Xa inhibitor treatment of VTE, 4 factor PCC merits consideration in addition to stopping the anticoagulation agent.

- Recombinant Xa, inactivated zhzo may also be a consideration.
