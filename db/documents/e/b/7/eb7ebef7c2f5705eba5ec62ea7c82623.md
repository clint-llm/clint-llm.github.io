Blood supply to the lumbar plexus is complex. The plexus embeds itself in the posterior aspect of the psoas major muscle. Due to this anatomical relation to a large muscle, it can share its blood supply. The primary blood supply of the plexus comes from the lumbar branch of the iliolumbar artery, a branch of the internal iliac artery.  The lumbar plexus has protection from ischemic damage due to multiple collateral arterial systems that it receives from small arteries of the psoas muscle. Therefore, ischemic injury to this area during aortoiliac surgery is uncommon.
