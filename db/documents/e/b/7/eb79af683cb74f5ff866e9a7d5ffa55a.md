CT is a commonly used diagnostic and screening imaging tool for numerous indications. The American College of Radiology publishes its recommended indications for clinical applications of CT on its website under the title of the American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria. CT offers advantages over X-ray and nuclear imaging in accuracy and clarity for detecting many but not all abnormalities.

Compared to MRI, CT is less expensive and can be performed more quickly. CT is often a first-line imaging modality for detecting and characterizing infections, tumors, traumatic injuries, skeletal disorders, and vascular disorders. CTA has replaced invasive fluoroscopic imaging in many circumstances for evaluating vascular disorders, such as vascular malformations, aneurysms, and blockage. CT does have disadvantages, such as high exposure of patients to radiation and lower resolution than x-ray. As such, for imaging certain types of fractures, an x-ray remains superior to a CT.
