Surgery such as wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy, elective node dissection, or both is the definitive treatment for early-stage melanoma. When performing the wide local excision, first consider the surgical margins. If the primary closure is not feasible, skin grafting or tissue transfers may be needed.

Agents that may be used in adjuvant therapy include the following:

- Interferon alfa

- Pegylated interferon

- Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)

- Ipilimumab

Agents that merit consideration for the treatment of advanced-stage (stage IV) melanoma include the following:

- Dacarbazine

- Temozolomide

- Interleukin-2

- Cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (CVD)

- Cisplatin, dacarbazine, carmustine, and tamoxifen

- Carboplatin and paclitaxel

- Ipilimumab

- Pembrolizumab

- Trametinib

- Vemurafenib (BRAF Positive)

- Dabrafenib (BRAF Positive)

- Peginterferon alfa-2b

- Nivolumab
