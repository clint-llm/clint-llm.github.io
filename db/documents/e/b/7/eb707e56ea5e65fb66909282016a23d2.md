Though there are no clinical signs and symptoms particular to TBG deficiency, there is usually a strong family history in inherited forms of TBG deficiency.  Patients with acquired TBG deficiency may present with symptoms consistent with an underlying illness such as severe liver disease or protein-wasting nephropathy.  The patient's history could also suggest the use of anabolic steroids or androgens. Physical examinations are within normal limits, in both acquired and inherited forms and any variation are usually be attributable to a secondary disease process.
