The hyoid shows a wide range of anatomical variations, most likely owing to the asymmetry of the greater and lesser horns. Therefore, the hyoid is considered one of the most polymorphic parts of the human body. The commonest variation of the hyoid takes place in the process of ankylosis of the joints between the horns (greater and lesser horns) and theÂ body of the hyoid. Ethnicity, sex, age, height, and weight of the subject contribute to the morphological variations. These variations can happen unilaterally, bilaterally, and multiple variations can occur in the same individual.
