SPENÂ are uncommon and are often indolent pancreatic tumors of unknown etiology with low malignant potential. These commonly present in young women suggestive of the possible role of hormonal factors. Diagnosis of these tumors is by diagnostic imaging. The definitive treatment is surgery, which is often curative in the majority of cases and associated with excellent long term prognosis. These neoplasms should be a consideration in the differential diagnosis of any cystic pancreatic tumors, specifically in a young woman. Despite the indolent nature of SPENs, most patients require major pancreatic resection. Surgery can be curative regardless of size or location of the tumor and local recurrence or metastasis after complete resection is rare.
