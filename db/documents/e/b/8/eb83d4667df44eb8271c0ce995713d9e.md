1. Complications from a pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, and other systemic thromboembolic phenomena as well as increased risk of bleeding from systemic anticoagulation

2. Membranous nephropathy (MN) leading to hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, compromising cardiovascular health

3. Progression of membranous nephropathy to chronic kidney disease (CKD) with reduced eGFR. CKD-related complications like anemia, bone-mineral disorders, and vitamin D deficiency

4. Complications and side effects of immunotherapy:

- Increased risk of infections (fungal, viral, and bacterial)

- Increased risk of malignancies over time, like bladder cancer, specifically with cyclophosphamide

- Renal tubular acidosis, stones from chemotherapy (proximal renal tubular acidosis)

- Cytopenias due to bone marrow suppression

- Infertility risk with cyclophosphamide

- Mycophenolate mofetil: gastrointestinal side effects, cytopenias, teratogenicity, and hence the need for dual contraception during therapy

- Reactivation of infections like tuberculosis and hepatitis B with rituximab

- Infusion hypersensitivity reactions

- Calcineurin inhibitors associated nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, renal parenchymal fibrosis, hair loss, and pancreatic toxicity

- Steroids increase the risk of infections, bone diseases like avascular necrosis of large joints, metabolic syndrome, hypertension from salt and fluid retention, psychosis, and gastrointestinal irritation, to name a few

5. End-stage kidney disease requiring renal replacement therapies and concomitant complications inherent to the procedure

6. Risk of catheter-associated bacteremia, hypotension, neurological side effects, and accelerated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality

7. Post-transplant recurrent MN:

- Prevalent in 30% to 50% of patients with positive anti-PLA2R antibodies on initial presentation

- Pathophysiology of recurrent (de novo) MN is different from primary MN
