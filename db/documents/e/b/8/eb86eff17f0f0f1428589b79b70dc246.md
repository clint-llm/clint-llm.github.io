CVI is considered a structure normally present in the fetal brain, which decreases in size after full-term birth and an uncommon variant in the adult.

The persistence in children between the ages of 1 and 10 is around 30%. Cheng found an incidence of CVI about 21% at the ultrasonography of children born preterm, while a CT study based on the analysis of 442 adults showed an incidence of 7.24% for the CVI.

CVI was present in 5.54% of a population of 505 neurosurgical patients between 2 months and 79 years old. No statistically significant difference existed in the frequency of CVI between the genders and age groups. CVI is considered to be twice as frequent as the cavum vergae.
