Clinical presentations of ciliary dysfunction are highly variable. Most newborns with primary ciliary dyskinesia develop neonatal respiratory distress with atelectasis on chest radiographs. Unlike other causes of respiratory distress in newborns, which occur in the first few hours after birth, respiratory distress from primary ciliary dyskinesia occurs 12 to 24 hours after birth in full-term infants.

Four main clinical features have been described in primary ciliary dyskinesia, including unexplained neonatal respiratory distress, early-onset year-round wet cough, early-onset year-round nasal congestion, and laterality defects.

Patients typically present in childhood, with a median age of diagnosis around five years of age. Typically, they present due to year-round respiratory infections with mucopurulent sputum and chronic daily cough.

About half of the patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia also have situs inversus totalis, including transposition of the right and left lung.

Physical examination may reveal the following signs:

- Inflammation of tympanic membranes

- Perforation with hearing loss

- Right-sided apex beat and heart sounds, if associated with dextrocardia

- Evidence of situs inversus, such as the spleen and liver on the incorrect side

- Digital clubbing due to chronic and recurrent lower respiratory infections
