Mental health disorders must be optimized before spinal cord stimulator implantation. Comorbid major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are prevalent comorbidities associated with chronic pain. The treatment of underlying anxiety and depression can have a lasting impact on the efficacy of a spinal cord stimulator and the treatment of the primary pain disorder. A primary care provider, cognitive-behavioral therapist, and psychiatrist are often needed to address the patient's mental healthcare. Both pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment options are often necessary.

Many patients who are candidates for a spinal cord stimulator suffer from failed back surgery syndrome. Coordination of care between the primary care provider, orthopedic or neurosurgeon, and the pain medicine physician is needed.
