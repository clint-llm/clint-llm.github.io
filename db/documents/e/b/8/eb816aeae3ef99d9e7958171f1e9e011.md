Diabetic lumbosacral radiculoplexus neuropathy (DLRPN), also known as diabetic amyotrophy, Bruns-Garland syndrome, proximal diabetic neuropathy, diabetic polyradiculopathy, multifocal diabetic neuropathy, femoral-sciatic neuropathy of diabetes, diabetic myelopathy, diabetic motor neuropathy, diabetic mononeuritis multiplex, and paralytic neuropathy classifies as part of the diabetic neuropathy spectrum. The various terms that allude to this disorder constitute evidence of the contrasting viewpoints regarding the anatomical localization and underlying pathophysiology of this disorder.

Initial recognition of this condition, dates back to the late 19th century, as Leyden first described it in 1877 and Auche in 1890, but the original description of DLRPN is attributed to Bruns in 1890 by most authors.****It was not until the 1950s when Hugh Garland brought into being the term “diabetic amyotrophy.” In his research, he described the clinical course of 12 patients with asymmetrical, progressing, diffuse lower extremity pain, motor-weakness, accompanied with muscle wasting, weight loss, and areflexia, with a clear relation to uncontrolled diabetes and close to complete recovery with appropriate glycemic management.

The anatomical and pathophysiologic mechanism of diabetic amyotrophy is not completely understood, but there is evidence of injury to the peripheral nerves, nerve roots, lumbosacral plexus, with accompanying axonal degeneration, demyelination, inflammation, ischemia, and immune-mediated microvasculitis.
