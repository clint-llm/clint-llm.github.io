1) In allergic fungal sinusitis (AFS), the microscopic findings of tissue obtained from surgical debridement reveal Charcot-Layden crystals, much like those seen in patients with asthma. Besides, patients have notable polyposis, “eosinophilic appearing mucin” inside the sinuses, and elevated serum IgE levels.

2) In the fungus ball, as the name indicates, an “entangled mass of fungal organisms in fibrinous, necrotic exudate” is seen.

3) As discussed above, invasive fungal sinusitis (IFS) most commonly presents among immunocompromised patients. Necrotic vascular thrombosis of the mucosa could be visible on histopathology of acute IFS likely secondary to the vascular thrombosis that the fungi create as they invade the sinuses.

4) Submucosal granulomatous inflammation is a feature in granulomatous invasive fungal sinusitis (GIFS), which most commonly presents in immunocompetent patients. Some studies suggest that a significant number of chronic fungal sinusitis cases progress to GIFS, and this transformation requires routine checking through biopsy.
