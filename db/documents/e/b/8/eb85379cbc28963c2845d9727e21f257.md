Glaucoma affects over 70 million people worldwide. Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most prevalent form of this disease, while PG accounts for about 1-1.5% in the Western world. PDS and PG primarily affect White-race individuals with myopia, showing a similar distribution between genders, yet PG shows a male predominance.

The low non-White prevalence could be due to the different behavior and anatomy of the iris.

However, other studies have reported a 35 to 50% lifetime risk of developing PG in cases with PDS.
