Glottic insufficiency is characterized by incomplete closure of the vocal folds when phonating, which causes inappropriate leakage of air through the glottis on attempting to phonate and there is an increased risk of aspiration. A wide range of laryngeal symptoms including dysphonia, dysphagia, and aspiration with recurrent lung infections may result. The causes are equally wide-ranging and can include anything that prevents complete closure of the vocal folds (static or dynamic), such as neoplasms, reactive changes, functional and neurologic changes, focal neurologic deficits, trauma, and many others.
