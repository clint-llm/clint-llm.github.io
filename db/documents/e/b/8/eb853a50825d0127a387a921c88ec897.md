Radiographic findings enable the differentiation of primary from secondary types. The primary type can be diagnosed if radiographs indicate no underlying joint pathology. MRI and MRI arthrography are also helpful in making the diagnosis. MRI can help differentiate and diagnose the bursal extension of the disease process. In the hip bursal extension into the iliopsoas and obturator externus, the bursa has been identified in up to 71% of the cases. An evaluation of patients with findings that suggest secondary synovial chondromatosis should include an attempt to identify underlying arthritic processes.

**Radiographs**will show multifocal, rounded, articular, or periarticular calcific densities (pathognomonic of synovial chondromatosis).

**Serial radiographs**are indicated after treatment to monitor the recurrence or development of degenerative changes.

**Cross-sectional imaging  (computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):**This can be helpful in the early pre-mineralization stage of the disease.

**MRI:**T1- weighted images will show loose bodies with low signal intensity but higher than the muscular tissue. Whereas, in T2- weighted images, loose bodies will display a high signal intensity typical of the high water content of cartilage.

**CT:**Better visualization of the mineralized areas, which are hypointense in all MRI sequences.
