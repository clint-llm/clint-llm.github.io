Cluster headaches can involve both the parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers from the greater petrosal and deep petrosal, respectively. A cluster headache can involve both sides of the autonomic system, sympathetic and parasympathetic.

The deep petrosal can be damaged at several different parts either traumatically or iatrogenically. Trauma to the skull can injure the nerve at various points depending on where the trauma occurs. Trauma to the neck and carotid can also damage the sympathetic plexus before it forms the deep petrosal nerve. Iatrogenic injuries include those to the carotid plexus from a neck surgery such as dissection, those that may occur during sphenoidal surgery, and vidian neurectomy.
