The evaluation and management of newly diagnosed rapid eye movement behavior disorder require a multi-disciplinary effort involving a sleep specialist, neurologist, and primary care provider to maximize these patients’ wellbeing. Injury prevention is paramount and may require both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. The looming prognosis of a neurodegenerative disorder in association with RBD will likely provoke anxiety and mood disruption and will require management on its own. Including family members is also a key element of support for these patients.

Unfortunately, there are no established means of predicting the development of neurodegenerative disease nor effective management to slow down the disease process. This makes the discussion with patients on the prognostic timeline and the decision of optimal treatment management truly difficult. Close follow-ups and multi-disciplinary communication are critical.

Future research is needed to identify potential biomarkers and neuroprotective strategies to prevent further neurodegeneration in high-risk individuals.
