Gallbladder disease can be a difficult diagnosis. Early suspicion with proper testing will make the diagnosis. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team. Having a skilled radiologist and emergency physician will often be the critical first step in properly diagnosing gallstones. Early intervention by an experienced surgeon is also vital. Practitioners should remember that not all gallstones will require surgery. The correct clinical decision must be made as a group recommendation between the primary care physician, nurse practitioner, radiologist, gastroenterologist, the patient, and the surgeon. The primary care clinicians should encourage patients to eat a healthy diet, maintain healthy body weight, eat a low-fat diet, and abstain from prolonged fasting. Nurses monitor patients perioperatively, educate patients and their families, and inform the team of changes in patient status. Close communication between the team members if vital to lower the morbidity of gallstones.
