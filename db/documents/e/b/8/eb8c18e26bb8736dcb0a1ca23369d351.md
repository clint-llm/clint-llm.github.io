Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is a typical monogenic disorder with the recurrent heterozygous gain of function mutation in the ACVR1/ALK2 gene located on chromosome 2, both in the sporadic and inherited cases, and involves the BMP (bone morphogenetic proteins) signaling pathway. This ACVR1/ALK2 gene encodes for a transmembrane serine/threonine (ser/thr) kinase receptor ALK2, which binds with the BMPs present in the bone matrix.

These BMPs induce the development of heterotopic bone in the skeletal muscle. The majority of cases of typicalÂ Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva show a similar genetic mutation which consists of a change of nucleotide in the codon at position 617 (guanine->adenine) in the ACVR1/ALK2 gene.

Some additional mutations are also noticed in exons 4 through 7 within the ACVR1/ALK2 gene, which results in a change in the expression of two domains, including Ser/Thr kinase and the glycine/serine-rich. Both of these domains play an important role in intracellular signaling.
