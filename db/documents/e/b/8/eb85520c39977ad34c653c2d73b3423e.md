K-wires are removed after 4-6 weeks. An additional cast is recommended after K-wore removal for 2 to 4 weeks. Immobilization in a long-arm cast (above the elbow) is indicated until there is clinical and radiographic evidence of healing. Range of movement exercises is started following cast removal. However, contact sports and heavy weight-lifting should be avoided for 1 to 2 months after the removal of the cast.

The mean arc of motion at the time of cast removal was 64 degrees in a study by Bernthal et al. Patients treated surgically had slower recoveries but no significant difference beyond week 18. Older age, a more extended period of immobilization, and more severe injuries will also have slower recoveries.
