Patients should be given information that when they have chronic kidney disease, their kidneys cannot make enough erythropoietin which causes their red blood cells to drop and anemia. Most such patients develop anemia, which can happen early in the illness and worsen with time.

Changes to diet can help prevent or manage anemia, and a dietician's help in this regard can play a significant role.

Patients should store ESA or iron as advised by the manufacturer, as some products need to be kept in the fridge. All CKD patients should be encouraged to let their providers know if they notice any bleeding or experience symptoms of anemia.
