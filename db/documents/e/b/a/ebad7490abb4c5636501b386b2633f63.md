Pressure-controlled ventilation is a modality utilized in patients with an indwelling endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube that affords the practitioner the ability to ventilate a patient with a maximal peak pressure. In contrast to volume-controlled ventilation, pressure-control involves the selection of an inspiratory pressure instead of a tidal volume target. The setting of an inspiratory pressure, as well as an associated positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), will allow a provider to control the peak pressure, thereby protecting from barotrauma.
