Digoxin's therapeutic half-life is between 30 to 40 hours, but this may change in overdose. Digoxin excretion is primarily renal, and for this reason, patients with poor or worsening renal function, such as patients who are elderly or have CKD, are more likely to develop toxicity. Digoxin levels start to plateau at 6 hours, which is after tissue redistribution has occurred; earlier levels may thus be misleadingly high. Cardiovascular toxicity may have delayed manifestation of up to 8 to 12 hours post-ingestion.
