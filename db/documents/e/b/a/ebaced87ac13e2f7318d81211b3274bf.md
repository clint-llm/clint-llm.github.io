A multidisciplinary team (MDT) approach is vital in the diagnosis, investigation, and treatment of patients with an oral mucosal cancer diagnosis. Primary care and dental professionals may spot early pre-cancerous changes or tumors themselves and refer to secondary care. Radiologists are key in interpreting imaging and performing ultrasound-guided biopsies for diagnosis. A combination of otolaryngologists, maxillofacial, and plastic surgeons may be involved in the surgical evaluation, planning, and surgical procedure itself. Histopathologists will be involved in diagnosis and staging. Oncologists provide specialist input with regards to chemoradiotherapy.

Cancer nurse specialists are vital in co-ordinating care and being the first point of call for support and advice for patients. After treatment, surveillance for disease recurrence must be carried out and will involve a range of teams for some years to come. MDT meetings where inter-professional discussions on individual patient cases take place are key to establishing integrated decision making and good outcomes.
