The heart receives its blood supply from coronary arteries, which is divided into right and left major branches

Microembolization occludes small vessels,Â which often leads to microvascular dysfunction and development of back pressure in the coronary tree, which can also lead to myocardial ischemia and its accompanying symptoms. Microembolization usually occurs in the setting of existing coronary artery disease with fragments of a plaque that is disturbed, spontaneously or due to coronary intervention, which then progresses to micro-circulation and clogs up the small arterioles and capillaries.
