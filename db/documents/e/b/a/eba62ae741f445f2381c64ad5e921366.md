In adults, the internal and external iliac arteries bifurcate from the common iliac arteries at the fifth lumbar to the first sacral (L5-S1) vertebral level.

During fetal development, the internal iliac artery conveys oxygen-poor, nutrient-poor fetal blood to the placenta via the umbilical artery. The umbilical artery is within the umbilical cord and is a critical component of fetoplacental circulation. At birth, the portion of the umbilical artery that is extracorporeal contracts and is ultimately removed from neonatal circulation. Within the neonate, the proximal portion of the umbilical artery persists as the patent portion of the umbilical artery but the distal portion that communicated with the placenta contracts and becomes occluded. The non-patent remnant of the umbilical artery is evident as a fibrous cord called the medial umbilical ligament, which represents the path of the umbilical artery in utero.
