Frostbite is a clinical diagnosis. Using additional laboratory testing may be helpful in determining the extent to which comorbid conditions may be contributing to tissue ischemia. Technetium-99 (Tc-99) triple phase scanning and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may help to determine extent of amputation in the first few days after injury.
