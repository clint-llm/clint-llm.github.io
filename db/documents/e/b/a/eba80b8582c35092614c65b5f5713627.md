Healthcare workers and nurse practitioners who encounter patients with abnormal muscle activity should consult with a neurologist to determine the cause and management. There are many causes of abnormal muscle activity, and in some cases, electromyography or a muscle biopsy may be warranted. Once the diagnosis is made, the interprofessional team must work together to coordinate patient education and treatment management. Typically these are complex, difficult diseases to treat, and only with a coordinated effort between clinicians, specialists, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and in some cases, physical therapists will the best outcome be achieved.
