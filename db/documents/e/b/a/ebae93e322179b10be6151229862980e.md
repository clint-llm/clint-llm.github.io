The main anatomical variations concerning the flexor retinaculum involve the median nerve. As previously stated, the median nerve enters the carpal tunnelÂ deep to the flexor retinaculum. A bifid median nerve occurs in some humans, which occurs when the median nerve splits proximally to the flexor retinaculum instead of distally, like normal anatomy.
