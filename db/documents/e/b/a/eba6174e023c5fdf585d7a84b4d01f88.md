Most of the normochromic, normocytic anemias are a consequence of other diseases; a minority reflects a primary disorder of the blood. This may be due to anemia of chronic disease (inflammation, neoplasia), renal failure, endocrine failure (hypothyroidism, hypopituitarism), marrow failure (pure red-cell aplasia, aplastic anemia, infiltration), acute blood loss, and polymyalgia rheumatica.

The etiology of normocytic normochromic anemia depends on whether the anemia is hypoproliferative (i.e., corrected reticulocyte count <2%) or hyperproliferative (i.e., corrected reticulocyte count >2%).

**Normal/Decreased Reticulocyte Count**

**Normal Bone Marrow**

- Anemia of chronic disorders (neoplastic, infections)

- Anemia of renal failure

- Endocrinopathy (myxedema, Addison disease, hypothyroidism, panhypopituitarism)

- Anemia of liver disease

- Early iron-deficiency anemia

**Abnormal Bone Marrow**

- Marrow infiltration (leukemia, myelofibrosis, metastasis)

- Hypoplastic anemia

- Aplastic anemia

- Medication side effect

**Increased Reticulocyte Count**

**Hemolysis**

- Intrinsic: Inherited defects of hemoglobin, RBC membrane, or enzyme; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria

- Extrinsic: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

**Hemorrhage**
