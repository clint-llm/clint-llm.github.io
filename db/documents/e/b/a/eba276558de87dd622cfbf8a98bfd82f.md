The papillary muscles arise from the walls of the left and right cardiac ventricles. The classic description of the left cardiac ventricle is as containing two papillary muscles: the anterolateral and posteromedial.

The general understanding is that the papillary muscles arise uniformly from the smooth surface of the ventricles. Nevertheless, a recent cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) study has identified a 'cypress-tree' root-like structure at the base of the papillary muscle of the left ventricle with many thin projections which coalesce before forming into a thick muscle pillar.

The primary function of these muscles is the proper functioning of the valves, i.e., opening and closer of the atrioventricular orifice. When the ventricles contract during the systole, simultaneous contraction of the papillary muscles taut the chordae tendinae. This arrangement prevents prolapse as well as the inversion of the cusps of the mitral and tricuspid valves.
