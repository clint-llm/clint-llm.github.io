The management of septic bursitis requires an interprofessional effort. The majority of patients are first seen by the emergency department, primary provider or nurse practitioner. Once the condition has been diagnosed, some patients may be referred to the orthopedic surgeon for more definitive treatment. Most patients are managed as outpatients but the duration of therapy remains unknown. Because there is a potential of developing osteomyelitis, these patients must be closely monitored. Duration and type of therapy are debated. Recommendations include a minimum of 10 days of treatment in mild cases, and repeat aspirations and continuation of antibiotics until bursal fluid is clear of infectious signs in severe cases. Treatment can usually be guided by clinical response and culture results. The outcomes in most patients with septic bursitis are good.
