When patients with stents present with chest pain to the primary care provider, internist, and nurse practitioner, one should always consider stent thrombosis. These patients should be immediately referred to the cardiologist for further investigation and treatment. Stent thrombosis, when it occurs acutely, can be fatal if not treated right away. The triage nurse should be aware of this condition and immediately admit the patient and consult with the emergency department provider. Careful monitoring by the nursing staff is required with frequent reports to the providers. Due to the complexity of treatment, a specially trained cardiac pharmacist should assist with medication selection, dosing, and monitoring working with the clinical team. The prognosis depends on many factors, including patient age, duration of thrombosis, number of stents involved, and response to medical treatment. In some cases, an urgent coronary bypass is required.
