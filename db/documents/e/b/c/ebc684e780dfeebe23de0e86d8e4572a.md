Few or no obvious clinical manifestations occur at birth with mild forms of the disease. The incidence of congenital infection with rubella is high during the early and late weeks of gestation (U-shaped distribution), with chances of birth defects much higher if the infection occurs early in pregnancy.

Congenital defects occur in up to 85% of neonates if maternal infection occurs during the first 12 weeks of gestation, in 50% of neonates if infection occurs during the first 13 to 16 weeks of gestation, and 25% if infection occurs during the latter half of the second trimester.

Serious birth defects include the following

- Congenital heart defects (patent ductus arteriosus, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, ventricular septal defects, atrial septal defects)

- Auditory (sensorineural hearing impairment)

- Ophthalmologic (cataracts, pigmentary retinopathy, microphthalmos, chorioretinitis)

- Neurologic (microcephaly, cerebral calcifications, meningoencephalitis, behavioral disorders, mental retardation)

- Hematologic (thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, petechiae/purpura, dermal erythropoiesis causing “blueberry muffin” rash)

- Neonatal manifestations (low birth weight, interstitial pneumonitis, radiolucent bone disease leading to “celery stalking” of long bone metaphyses, hepatosplenomegaly)

- Delayed onset of insulin-dependent diabetes and thyroid disease.
