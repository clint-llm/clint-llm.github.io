**Treatment of Clinical Symptoms**

**(a) Hematological and immune deficiency**

- The only cure is an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Therefore, HSCT should be done as soon as the diagnosis is established.

- Outcomes are most favorable when the HSCT is done before the development of the accelerated phase. Hence, the accelerated phase must be ruled out or in remission before HSCT can be conducted.

- If signs of accelerated phase are evident, then hemophagocytosis should be brought into a stage of remission before HSCT.

- The guidelines for the treatment of the accelerated phase are the same as that for familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and include combination therapy of dexamethasone, cyclosporine A, and etoposide. Around 75% of individuals achieve remission by eight weeks. Relapses are not uncommon, and the treatment response declines over time.

- The 5-year survival rate was reported to be 62%. It was seen that success was more prevalent in individuals with HLA-matched donors. Transplantation that took place during the accelerated phase had a higher rate of mortality. However, those in remission had better outcomes after an HSCT.

**(b) Ocular symptoms**

- Visual acuity might be improved by correcting refractive errors.

- Sunglasses should be worn for protecting sensitive eyes against UV rays.

**(c) Hypopigmentation:**Individuals must wear sunscreen to prevent skin cancers and sun damage. The degree of protection depends on the severity of hypopigmentation.

**(d) Neurological manifestation:**since the symptoms are progressive in nature, rehabilitation should be started for older patients as early as possible during the course of the disease.

**Prevention of Secondary Complications**

- Protect against exposure to infectious agents as much as possible.

- NSAIDs should also be avoided as they can exacerbate bleeding tendencies.

- Prompt and aggressive use of antibiotics to treat bacterial illnesses.

- The use of widespread antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental or invasive procedures is controversial. However, it should be considered in those with a compromised immune system and neutropenia.

- Immunizations should be administered.

- Prior to any invasive procedures, intravenous desmopressin should be given for 30 minutes to help control bleeding. Platelet transfusion might be necessary for those with serious trauma or extensive bleeding.

**Monitoring**

**(a) Classical Chediak Higashi**

- There are no specific guidelines for surveillance.

- The current standard is to evaluate for HSCT as soon as possible once the diagnosis is established.

- An ophthalmologic examination is also necessary

**(b) Atypical or adult-onset form of the disease**

Annual screening that should include the following:

- Ultrasound of the abdomen to detect the presence of hepatosplenomegaly

- A complete blood count to check for signs of cytopenias

- Signs of liver disease including hypofibrinogenemia and hypertriglyceridemia.

- Check levels of serum ferritin concentration

- Monitor levels of interleukin-2 receptor

- A bone marrow biopsy or a lumbar puncture if there is suspicion of CNS involvement or symptoms of accelerated phase

- Ophthalmologic exam

**Management in Pregnancy**

There is limited data that is available for individuals with Chediak Higashi. However, it is reported that there is no impact on pregnancy or labor. The course of the disease also had no effect on mothers diagnosed with the disease.
