Histologic evaluation of tissue samples is needed to diagnose solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura. The classic histologic phenotype of SFTP is hypocellular with stroma of thick collagen bands separating irregularly arranged fascicles which consist of spindle cells. The arrangement typically results in a “patternless pattern.” Capillaries are frequently present.

In the hypercellular presentation, the tumor consists of solid nests of tumor cells with scant or absent collagen fibers. The cells appear more ovoid rather than spindled. Very often, hemorrhage and necrosis can be seen in these tumors.

Histologic findings indicating malignancy include hypercellularity, high mitotic index (>4 mitoses per high-powered field), varying degrees of pleomorphism, hemorrhage, and necrosis.
