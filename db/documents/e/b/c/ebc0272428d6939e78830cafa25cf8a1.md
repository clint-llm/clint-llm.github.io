As mentioned before, placement of the PAC helps for diagnosis of multiple conditions

PAC can help to determine causes of shock, as cardiogenic versus other causes as septic shock or distributive shock by obtaining SvO2

PAC is used to determine the cause of pulmonary hypertension for proper treatment after classification in the different groups of pulmonary hypertension.

PAC can help to determine the intracardiac pressurea and valvular abnormalities.

PAC also helps to determine intracardiac shunts and to determine hemodynamic state before the procedure.

PAC is an important procedure for diagnosis and management of different conditions and despite the underuse of this procedure, still useful.

PAC can be used to estimate pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to give indirect assessment of left sided filling pressures.
