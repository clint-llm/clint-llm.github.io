Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. That means this drug works to cause an accumulation of carbonic acid by preventing its breakdown. The result is lower blood pH (i.e., more acidic), given the increased carbonic acid, which has a reversible reaction into bicarbonate and a hydrogen ion.

Carbonic anhydrase is found in the proximal tubule of the nephron and red blood cells. It works to reabsorb sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride. Once acetazolamide inhibits carbonic anhydrase, sodium, bicarbonate, and chloride get excreted rather than reabsorbed; this also leads to the excretion of excess water. The clinical result is a decrease in blood pressure, decreased intracranial pressure, and decreased intraocular pressure. Bicarbonate excretion also increases the acidity of the blood. Aqueous humor levels decrease in the eyes, and there are compensatory mechanisms for increased blood acidity, for example, hyperventilation.

The entire process of excretion inhibited by carbonic anhydrase is essentially working to acidify the urine and reabsorb bicarbonate. Acetazolamide will derange the whole process by increasing sodium in the urine and increasing bicarbonate which alkalinizes the urine. Diuresis is the other result.

In the eye, the inhibitory activity of acetazolamide reduces the secretion of aqueous humor resulting in a reduction in intraocular pressure, which is beneficial for glaucoma. Acetazolamide is also used in treating idiopathic intracranial hypertension, as it inhibits enzymes in the choroid plexus and reduces the production of CSF, resulting in a decrease in intracranial pressure(ICP).

In epilepsy, inhibition of carbonic anhydrase by acetazolamide seems to retard abnormal, excessive, paroxysmal electrical discharge from neurons. Carbonic anhydrase expression is extensively detected in CNS. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide affects the delicate equilibrium among CO2, H+, and HCO3- in the neurons and modulates the activity of ligand-gated ion channels at the neuronal level, such as GABA-A signaling. In addition, studies report their capacity to modulate Ca2+ kinetics through ligand-gated Ca2+ channels and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC). Carbonic anhydrases rapidly decrease or increase H+ and HCO3 − in the neurons. Acetazolamide modulates the abnormal GABA-A-mediated depolarization that generates epileptic waves and has been shown to block epileptiform activity by inhibiting HCO3 -efflux. The integration of the above-illustrated mechanisms may explain the antiepileptic effect of acetazolamide.

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Well absorbed

Distribution: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as acetazolamide are avidly bound by carbonic anhydrase; consequently, tissues rich in enzymes, such as kidneys and RBC, will have higher concentrations of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide)

**Metabolism:**Acetazolamide does not undergo metabolic alteration.

**Excretion:**Plasma half-Life: 6-9 hours; renal excretion is the primary route of elimination.
