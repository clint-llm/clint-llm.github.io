Diverticulitis can occur anywhere in the colon; hence, the presentation may vary according to the site involved. For instance, diverticulitis in the right colon may present similarly to acute appendicitis. Similarly, diverticula in the transverse colon may appear as peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, or cholecystitis. Therefore the list of differential diagnoses is extensive as follows:

- Acute gastritis

- Acute pancreatitis

- Acute appendicitis

- Acute cholecystitis

- Acute pyelonephritis

- Cholangitis

- Mesenteric ischemia

- Constipation

- Irritable bowel disease

- Irritable bowel syndrome

- Pelvic inflammatory disease

- Ovarian cyst

- Ectopic pregnancy
