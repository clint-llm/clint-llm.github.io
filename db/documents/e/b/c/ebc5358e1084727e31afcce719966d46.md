The management of peripheral vertigo is optimal with an interprofessional team, including nurses and pharmacists. Many treatments exist for peripheral vertigo, but none is reliably effective. In many cases, the clinician will trial one agent, and if it does not work, attempt another remedy. The quality of life of most patients with peripheral vertigo is poor. Drugs like antihistamines are often not well tolerated, and corticosteroids have serious adverse effects.
