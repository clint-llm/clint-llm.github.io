Natural Killer cells represent the third lymphocyte population (Following T and B cells), and they play essential roles in the frontline's defense of the innate immune system.Â The term natural killer suggests that these cells can kill the target cells without pre-stimulation. In contrast to other immune cells, which demand a considerable period of time to induce their cytolytic activity, NK cells provide ready-to-kill machinery in the immune system.

These cells play various roles in several organ systems; for instance, there is emerging evidence linking NK cells with the development of autism spectrum disorder. The lower degrees of NK cells infiltration in solid tumors correlate with the favorable prognosis. In addition, excessive stimulation of NK cells promotes cell senescence in tissues, laying the foundations for aging. NK cells are important for the body's salutogenic response in dealing with various physiological and non-physiological stimuli throughout life.
