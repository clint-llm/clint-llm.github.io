Some special focal epileptic syndromes include the following:

**Benign Epilepsy with Centrotemporal Spikes**

Benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) is a benign form of focal motor epilepsy in children, featuring centrotemporal spikes. It accounts for 6% to 10% of all childhood epilepsies. The age of onset is 3 to 13 years with a peak at 7 to 8 years. It is more common in boys. Some reports suggest autosomal inheritance. Centrotemporal spikes are characteristic of BECTS but not pathognomic, as they can be seen in more complex epilepsy syndromes as well. Seizures typically occur during sleep, either shortly after falling asleep or just before awakening. Classically, the unilateral lower face is involved with facial twitching, paresthesia, and dysarthria. Hemi convulsions may occur, especially in young children. They can rarely become generalized. The seizures are brief, occurring in clusters, followed by prolonged seizure-free intervals. Typical EEG findings are high amplitude diphasic spike or sharp waves with prominent aftercoming slow waves in the contralateral centrotemporal area. BECTS have an excellent prognosis, and most children achieve remission by puberty regardless of antiepileptic drug therapy. Pharmacotherapy is usually not needed in the majority of cases. Anti-seizure drugs like valproate may be used in severe cases or with frequent symptoms.

**Early-Onset Benign Occipital Epilepsy**

Also known as panayiotopoulos syndrome, early-onset benign occipital epilepsy accounts for 1% to 2% of children with focal epilepsy. The age of onset is 3 to 8 years with a peak at 5 years. It is more common in girls. Seizures are almost always nocturnal and present with autonomic symptoms, most commonly nausea and vomiting. The seizure frequently lasts longer than 30 minutes, and about one-third of patients may develop focal status epilepticus.  Early-onset benign occipital epilepsy may evolve into generalized seizures, and consciousness may be impaired. Ictal EEG shows rhythmic theta or delta activity with intermixed spikes that start posteriorly. Most children have occasional seizures and do not require pharmacological treatment.

**Late-Onset Benign Occipital Epilepsy**

Late-onset benign occipital epilepsy is also known as Gastaut type epilepsy. It presents in mid to late childhood with a peak age of eight years. It manifests as frequent, often more than 15, brief visual seizures mostly visual hallucinations or blindness. Typically, there is no impairment in consciousness unless there is a secondary generalization.

**Epilepsia****Partialis Continua**

Epilepsia partialis continua is also known as partial continuous epilepsy and represents a type of focal motor status epilepticus. It is characterized by continuous rhythmic or semi rhythmic clonic movements of one muscle group that remain localized and continue for hours, days, weeks, or months without spreading to other parts of the body. Any muscle group can be affected, but distal musculature is more commonly affected. They may develop at any age. Several acute or chronic cerebral lesions may cause these partial seizures. These seizures are often mistaken for slow tremors or movement disorders. They are particularly common in Rasmussen syndrome. This type of seizure activity responds poorly to AEDs, and all patients should be evaluated for an underlying lesion that may be amenable to surgical treatment.

**Supplementary Sensorimotor Seizures**

These seizures originate from the supplementary sensorimotor area (SSMA) and are characterized by rapid onset, asymmetrical posturing involving one or more extremities. Typically, both sides of the body are affected. These seizures are usually brief, lasting 10 to 40 seconds, but maybe frequent, occurring in clusters. SSMA seizures tend to occur during sleep. Speech arrest and vocalization can happen during these episodes. Consciousness is typically preserved. Only a few patients who experience SSMA seizures actually have SSMA epilepsy. These seizures can get misdiagnosed as nonepileptic or psychogenic seizures because the involvement of all extremities with preserved consciousness can be misleading.
