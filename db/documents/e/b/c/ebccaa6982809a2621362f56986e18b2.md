Platelets are most commonly visualized via a peripheral blood film.  Blood can either be taken directly from a finger prick or a venous sample stored in an anticoagulant blood bottle. The blood smear requires preparation without excessive delay following obtaining the sample, as delay can lead to clumping of platelets and pseudothrombocytopenia. Blood should be smeared thinly onto a slide to produce a monolayer of cells and allowed to dry. Once dry, the smear should be fixed with alcohol and stained.

For functional platelet studies, washed platelet suspensions are often necessary. Platelets are sequentially centrifuged and resuspended in a buffer solution (Tyrode’s albumin buffer) to isolate them from the plasma and clotting factors that normally surround them. This process allows examination of the intrinsic properties of the platelets in a controlled suspension rather than of the interaction between platelets and their natural plasma environment.
