As stated, carvedilol is a non-selective adrenergic blocker and, more specifically, is a non-selective beta-blocker with alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonist properties.

Carvedilol decreases blood pressure mainly by reducing arterial vascular resistance through its alpha1-blocking properties, causing a reduction in afterload. It is highly useful in managing hypertension in patients with renal impairment, where clinicians should avoid diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI).

**Pharmacokinetics**

**Absorption:**Carvedilol is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentration (Cmax) in 1 to 2 hours after administration. The absorption rate is slower when the carvedilol is administered with food, but the bioavailability is unaffected. Carvedilol is well absorbed but has poor systemic bioavailability (25%) due to substantial first-pass metabolism.

**Distribution:**Carvedilol is a highly lipophilic drug extensively distributed into tissues. The volume of distribution is high(approximate Vd=1.5 L/kg).

**Metabolism:**Carvedilol is metabolized by oxidation in the liver, followed by glucuronidation and conjugation. The metabolism is predominantly mediated by Cytochromes P450( CYP2D6 and CYP2C9).

**Excretion:**Carvedilol is primarily excreted into the bile and eliminated via feces, while urinary excretion accounts for only 16%. The elimination half-life of carvedilol is generally 6–7 hours.
