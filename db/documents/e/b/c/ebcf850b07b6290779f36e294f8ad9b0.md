**Genotype Correlations**

The difference between phenotypes (DMD and BMD), relies on a reading frame rule, stating that if the pathogenic variant does not alter the reading frame, then the expression will be milder, i.e., BMD; while, on the contrary, should express as DMD (severe phenotype).

DMD-associated DCM involve pathogenic variants affecting the muscle promoter and first exon.
