An interprofessional approach to myopericarditis is recommended.

Myopericarditis is not an uncommon problem and is usually of viral in etiology. The condition has diverse presentations and hence is best managed in an interprofessional team that includes an intensivist, cardiologist, radiologist, infectious disease specialist, physical therapist, and an internist. Even though most cases of myopericarditis have a good prognosis, the clinical focus should be on identifying the patients with large pericardial effusions or patients with significantly lowered systolic function as these patients need aggressive medical therapies to prevent morbidity and mortality. In the absence of data from randomized trials, treatment recommendations of myopericarditis are based on expert opinion.
