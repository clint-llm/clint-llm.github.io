Careful patient selection for implant-based reconstruction needs to be undertaken, particularly in patients who may or will require adjuvant radiation therapy for their malignancy. Placement of a tissue expander in patients undergoing concurrent radiation may fail to expand, have poor wound healing, and have poor projection. Complication rates can be as high as 60% for tissue expanders in radiated fields.[5]

Patients who are active smokers are at high risk of infection and poor wound healing. These patients need to undergo counseling for smoking cessation. Many surgeons will not offer reconstruction (particularly with expanders and implants, though potentially autologous tissue) to active smokers.
