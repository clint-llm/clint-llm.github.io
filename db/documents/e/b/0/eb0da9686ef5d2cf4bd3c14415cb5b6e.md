**Retrobulbar Hemorrhage**

One of the most feared complications in cosmetic surgery is vision loss, which in blepharoplasty is most likely to be due to retrobulbar hemorrhage causing optic nerve/retinal ischemia secondary to raised intra-orbital pressure. Though retrobulbar hemorrhage is well-described, vision loss is thankfully very rare. The majority of these cases present within the first 24 hours, especially in the first 3 hours after surgery.

**Infection**

It is a rare complication, though patients with diabetes and immunocompromised patients are at increased risk. Early infections can present with edema, erythema, pain, and fever. It may progress to cellulitis and abscess formation. The patient is managed on intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics.

**Diplopia**

It can be transient or permanent. Transient edema can cause diplopia, which will resolve within a few days. Permanent diplopia is a result of damage to the inferior oblique muscle and will require surgical correction. This is thankfully very rare.

**Lower Lid Malposition**

Complications such as scleral show, lid retraction, and ectropion are possible with a subciliary approach. Milder grades of scleral show can be treated conservatively with massage and steri-strips. Ectropion in the early postoperative period is most likely due to unaddressed lower lid laxity, which should be identified preoperatively and corrected with lid tightening procedures. Ectropion can also occur in a more delayed fashion after over-resection of skin, which may sometimes require skin grafting. It is prudent to be very cautious in resecting skin in the lower eyelids.

**Corneal Abrasion**

Ocular injury includes corneal abrasion, ulceration, etc., which are rare. Topical antibiotic drops with patching may be required.

**Dry Eyes**

Temporary dryness is common, which usually will resolve 1 to 3 weeks after surgery. Topical lubricants are required in symptomatic patients.
