Because there are numerous causes of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction and injury, surgical consideration requires individualization for each patient. The overall goal of any form of treatment, surgical or not, should be focused on reducing pain and preserving or enhancing day-to-day functionality.

Surgical intervention may also help prevent upper extremity deformity due to contractures or spasticity that may present with an upper motor neuron injury. Examples of surgical procedures that are options for a patient with severe upper motor neuron disease include tendon lengthening, muscle origin release, myotomy, tenotomy, neurectomy, arthrodesis, and joint osteocapsular release. Surgical interventions are chosen based on an individual patientâ€™s level of functioning.
