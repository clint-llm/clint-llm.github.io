Normal variation in colloid osmotic pressure has been a topic of research. For example, mean colloid osmotic pressure is 21.1 mmHg in those younger than 50 years old, and significantly lower at 19.7 mm Hg in those between ages 70 and 89.

**Critical Care and Congestive Heart Failure**

Critical care is a setting in which the clinical manifestations of abnormal fluid balance are seen and have a crucial influence on patient outcomes. Pulmonary edema, for example, can result when the gradient between COP and pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) is reduced – PAWP in this example represents the outward hydrostatic pressure in the pulmonary vascular space. Rackow showed that the greater the decrease in COP-PAWP gradient, the greater the increase in the severity of pulmonary edema.

In left ventricular failure, due to the significantly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic volume and pressure, the PAWP is proportionately increased resulting in the reduced COP-PAWP gradient. Fluid enters the pulmonary interstitial space, i.e., pulmonary edema. During such circumstances, the edema fluid will be more in the dependent areas because the patient experiences increased shortness of breath when lying down (orthopnea). Clinically it will be different from other edema states secondary to reduced plasma protein concentration which results in edema in all interstitial spaces and, therefore, generalized clinical edema (anasarca).

We can measure colloid osmotic pressure to better understand the mechanism of pulmonary edema in left ventricular failure. The primary insult, an increase in left ventricular filling pressure, causes a sequence of counterreactions aimed at restoring fluid balance. A filtrate depleted of protein passes by ultrafiltration through the lung capillaries, thereby creating a higher COP in plasma that may partly counterbalance the elevated hydrostatic pressure accumulated. The lymphatic system of the lungs provides a safety mechanism to remove fluid from the air spaces until this mechanism is saturated.

Investigators have tried to manipulate the COP-PAWP gradient by increasing the plasma COP via albumin infusion as a way of restoring intravascular blood volume and reversing the fluid loss to the interstitium. After all, albumin accounts for roughly 80% of the total oncotic pressure exerted by blood plasma on interstitial fluid. Infusion of albumin alone may produce improvement in 40% of critically ill patients, according to one study, while adding a potent diuretic like ethacrynic acid improved that percentage to 70%.

**Hypoalbuminemia States**

Hypoalbuminemia may occur clinically as a result of impaired albumin absorption (Kwashiorkor) or albumin loss from the gut (protein-losing enteropathy), impaired protein synthesis by the liver (chronic liver disease), or protein loss through the kidneys(nephrotic syndrome). Under such circumstances, the colloid osmotic pressure will be significantly reduced resulting in water and solutes escaping into the interstitial space from the capillaries. These are all causes of generalized anasarca resulting from reduced colloid osmotic pressure.

**Pregnancy**

Pregnancy is another physiologic circumstance in which fluid shifts take place between intravascular and interstitial spaces, with COP playing a role. An increase in plasma volume takes place in normal pregnancy, which accounts for a fall in COP assuming there is no corresponding increase in colloids. Red cell volume increases during pregnancy as well, although less than plasma volume, which causes a decrease in hematocrit during the first and second trimester of normal pregnancy. Wu and colleagues directly measured serum total solids (STS) as a marker of COP, since the principal component of STS is albumin, the main colloid determinant of COP. They found that STS (and therefore COP) fell gradually during pregnancy to a low point between 30 to 34 weeks gestation and proceeded to rise toward term, following a quadratic equation parabolic trend. Correlating this with mean blood pressure indicates the direction of fluid shifts throughout pregnancy.

**Type 1 Diabetes**

Damage to the microvasculature is one of many physiologic changes that occur in long-standing diabetes. The disturbance in capillary permeability to proteins, in particular, leads to changes in the transcapillary colloid osmotic gradient. Patients with long-standing Type 1 diabetes without nephropathy had reduced interstitial colloid osmotic pressure with increased transcapillary osmotic gradient compared to normal subjects.
