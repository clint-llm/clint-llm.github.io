Osteofibrous dysplasia is a rare condition usually found in younger children < 10 years old. It affects males more than females. It most frequently occurs in the first two decades of life. OFD is usually localized to the tibia, but the ipsilateral fibula is occasionally involved. Within the tibia, the mid diaphysis is the most commonly affected area. The involvement of the radius and ulna have also been reported. The progression of the lesion generally halts with the achievement of skeletal maturity.
