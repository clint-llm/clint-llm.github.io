Treatment for primary hyperaldosteronism includes laparoscopic resection for adenomas. This procedure will usually resolve hypokalemia,Â but hypertension can persist in up to 65% of patients postadrenalectomy. Surgery is the preferred treatment for patients with unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma. After unilateral adrenalectomy, almost all patients have the resolution of hypokalemia and moderate improvement in blood pressure control.
