There are many approaches to the management of cervical discogenic pain syndrome, which are dependent on the cause, severity, and clinical presentation. The initial approach is always aggressive nonsurgical treatment. This includes the use of NSAIDs, partial rest, proper posture, and body mechanics, along with home-based exercise programs. Spontaneous recovery is usually common within the first few weeks. Physical therapy should be focused on maintaining proper posture and body ergonomics. The McKenzie approach has been utilized to develop a specific rehabilitation exercise program based on baseline ROM and repetitive motions of the cervical spine.

Patients who do not respond to appropriate conservative therapies and have persistent radicular pain, progressive neurologic deficits, motor weakness, or signs of cord compression may consider surgical intervention. Patients with discogenic neck pain can potentially benefit from anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery.
