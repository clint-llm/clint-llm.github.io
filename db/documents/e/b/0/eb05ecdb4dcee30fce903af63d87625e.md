Treatment options for CPA tumors include observation, radiation therapy, or microsurgery. Observation is suitable for elderly/unstable patients and in tumors with little/no evidence of growth. The tumor is monitored with routine annual scans, and tumor growth necessitates aggressive treatment. Another disadvantage of this approach is that the cranial nerve function becomes difficult to preserve with delay in treatment.

**Radiation therapy**provides adequate tumor control with low rates of recurrence.

It should be remembered that any surgical approach is quite a challenge in treating the CPA tumors as it involves complex regional anatomy, enormous vital structures present in the surgical field, and as it allows a very narrow surgical corridor to operate.

**Microsurgery**offers a definitive solution. The goal of microsurgery is complete tumor removal as well as hearing preservation. The different surgical approaches that can be used are translabrynthine, middle fossa, and retrosigmoid approach.

The middle fossa approach is most useful to resect the intracanalicular extension of the tumor. Disadvantages of the MF approach include temporal lobe retraction, hematoma following rupture of the middle meningeal artery, and a higher risk of facial nerve injury.Â Translabrynthine approach can be used in patients without any serviceable hearing as the surgical morbidity of this procedure is low as compared to others.
