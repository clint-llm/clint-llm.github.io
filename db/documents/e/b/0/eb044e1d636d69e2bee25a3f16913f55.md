Treatment is not necessary for breast milk jaundice unless the total serum bilirubin level of the infant is greater than 20 mg/dL. If this occurs, the recommendation is for phototherapy treatment. Phototherapy is the use of light to convert bilirubin molecules into water-soluble isomers that can be excreted by the body.Â  If the total serum bilirubin level remains below 12 mg/dL, the recommendation is to continue breastfeeding of the infant and to expect the resolution of jaundice by 12 weeks of age. If the total serum bilirubin level is between 12-20 mg/dL, and further investigation shows no evidence of hemolysis, the recommendations are the same.
