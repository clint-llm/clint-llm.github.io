**Underlying Duodenal Pathology**

The leading causes of perforated peptic ulcers remain NSAIDs use and H. pylori.H. pylori infection is another contributory factor for duodenal ulcers. Possibly, H. pylori, by inducing gastric metaplasia, stimulating Immune response and gastric acid secretion, and reduce mucosal defense, can cause duodenal injury and subsequently duodenal perforation.

**Iatrogenic**

The Stapfer classification categorizes post-ERCP duodenal perforations in four types. The endoscope itself causes type I perforations (lateral or medial duodenal wall perforations). Type II perforations or peri-Vaterian injuries occur during sphincterotomy. Type III perforations or distal bile duct injuries caused by basket or wire instrumentation and type IV perforations diagnosed by retroperitoneal air on imaging and usually are asymptomatic.
