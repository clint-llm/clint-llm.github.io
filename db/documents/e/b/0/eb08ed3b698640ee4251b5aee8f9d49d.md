Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare but serious post-infectious immune-mediated neuropathy. It results from the autoimmune destruction of nerves in the peripheral nervous system causing symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and weakness that can progress to paralysis. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of Guillain-Barré syndrome and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
- Describe the use of electromyography and nerve conduction studies in the evaluation of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
- Summarize the management of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by Guillain-Barré syndrome.
