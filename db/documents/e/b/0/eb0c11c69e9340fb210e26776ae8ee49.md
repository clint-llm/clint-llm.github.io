Gingivitis is the commonest of periodontal diseases. It is more prevalent in males as compared to females since it has been found that females tend to follow better oral care regimes. It is commonly seen in children and adults. Studies have found gingivitis to be more prevalent in people with low socioeconomic status as people with high socioeconomic status tend to show a more positive attitude towards the maintenance of oral hygiene. Also, they have better access to health care options. Studies reveal that gingivitis is more prevalent in pregnant women as compared to non-pregnant women. Moreover, more severe forms of gingivitis have been more often seen in pregnant women

The most frequently seen types of gingivitis are plaque-induced, hormonal, acute ulcerative necrotizing, drug-induced, or spontaneously presenting hyperplastic gingivitis. Categorically, the more predominant form of gingivitis is plaque-induced. In fact, this type accounts for far more cases than all other variants combined
