Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is the inability to urinate after a surgical procedure despite having a full bladder. It can be a source of great distress to the patient, or it can go unnoticed. It can be easily reversible with minimal provider interventions, or it can have lasting effects on the patient. Its prevalence is cited anywhere from 5% to 70% in the literature; regardless, it is not an uncommon diagnosis post-operatively in the hospital, emergency department, or clinical setting. Having the ability to recognize and manage POUR is essential for any provider responsible for the treatment of a postoperative patient.
