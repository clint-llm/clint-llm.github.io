Other chronic airway diseases that can mimic ACO are congestive heart failure, bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis obliterans are included in the differential diagnosis of ACO.

Wheezing is a symptom of congestive heart failure (CHF), which is sometimes challenging to distinguish from ACO. The diagnosis of CHF can be made based on a history of orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, fine basal crackles on chest auscultation, and characteristic features on chest radiography.

Other conditions like bronchiectasis can present as ACO. However, the physical examination of bronchiectasis patients reveals coarse crackles and potentially clubbing in addition to aberrant findings on computed tomography (CT) scans and chest radiography.

Bronchiolitis obliterans is most frequently observed after viral infection, bone marrow transplantation, or associated with connective tissue diseases. CT scan findings often include tree-in-bud nodularity and a mosaic pattern of lung parenchyma.
