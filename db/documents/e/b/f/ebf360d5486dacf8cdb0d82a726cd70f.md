Mutations in ryanodine receptors primarily correlate with a range of myopathies and cardiac arrhythmia disorders. The Human Gene Mutation Database contains 563 mutations in the type 1 ryanodine receptors and 287 mutations in the type 2 ryanodine receptors known to cause inherited disease.

For example, in malignant hyperthermia, findings indicate that disruption of the N-terminus and central domain interaction within the ryanodine receptor becomes disrupted, leading to increased activity of the channel.
