Otitis externa is a diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal of bacterial etiology that is best managed with an interprofessional team approach. This team may include the primary clinician, nurses, and pharmacists. Current treatment guidelines recommend topical antibiotics with steroids and pain medications as first-line treatment. Providers have frequently prescribed oral antibiotics despite evidence-based data that recommends their avoidance.
