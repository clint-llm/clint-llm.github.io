The radial artery graft is considered the second option as a conduit after the left internal mammary graft in coronary artery bypass grafting. Multiple studies have shown better patency rate and survival with radial artery graft as compared to saphenous vein graft. This activity reviews the utility of radial artery grafts for coronary artery bypass surgery and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for using a radial artery bypass graft.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to radial artery bypass graft.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of the potential complications and their clinical significance of radial artery bypass graft.
- Outline some inter-professional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance radial artery bypass graft and improve outcomes.
