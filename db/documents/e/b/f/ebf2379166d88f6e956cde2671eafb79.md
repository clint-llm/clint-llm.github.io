The infection enters the epidural space by direct extension from a contiguous site or by hematogenous/lymphatic seeding from a remote site.

Contiguous infections include vertebral osteomyelitis, discitis, retropharyngeal/perinephric/paraspinal/psoas abscesses, decubitus ulcers, and persistent dermal sinus tracts. Local invasion from superficial infections can also occur following penetrating injuries, surgery, or spinal procedures. Such procedures might be as simple as a lumbar puncture or paravertebral injection, or as complex as epidural catheterization or CT-guided needle biopsy.

Approximately 25% to 50% of SEA come from hematogenous spread into the epidural space. Of those, the majority (about 15%) are from skin or soft tissues. Endocarditis and infected intravascular catheters, respiratory tract infections, urinary tract infections, abdominal infections, dental abscesses, and complications from gastrointestinal surgery are also possible.

IEA is mostly a localized lesion with a central collection of pus surrounded by a wall of inflammatory reaction. Dura is rigid and tight around the base of the skull and therefore prevents the downward transmission of the infection into spinal epidural space. SEA spreads quickly since spinal epidural space is a connected space and the infection is more of a granulation tissue rather than a purulent nature.
