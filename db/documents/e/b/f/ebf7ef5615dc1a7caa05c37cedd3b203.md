- A semen analysis will usually show azoospermia in about 10% to 15% of male patients seeking help for infertility.

- There are generally two types of azoospermia: obstructive and non-obstructive.

- All male patients with azoospermia or severe oligospermia are recommended to undergo karyotype evaluations.

- Klinefelters syndrome is a common cause of non-obstructive azoospermia. The diagnosis is made by a karyotype examination.

- Genetic abnormalities are common in men with non-obstructive azoospermia.

- The specific diagnosis for non-obstructive azoospermia is typically made by histological appearance and generally requires a testis biopsy.

- Non-obstructive azoospermia is generally composed of Sertoli cell-only syndrome, maturation arrest, or severe hypospermatogenesis.

- The presence of any sperm in any semen analysis increases the chances of successful micro-TESE.

- Favorable indicators are younger age, normal-sized testes, no fertility issues in the female partner, focal disease, and the presence of any visible sperm on histological examination of the testis biopsy.

- In maturation arrest, the late stage is more advantageous than the early stage.

- Patients who are considering micro-TESE and ICSI should have karyotyping, genetic testing, a Y-chromosome microdeletion assay, and genetic counseling.

- Micro-TESE is much more successful than TESA but requires surgery by a skilled microscopic-trained surgeon.

- Surgeons should try to find a dilated and opaque seminiferous tubule.

- Various techniques are available to help patients who have some level of sperm reproduce. The success rate, however, varies.
