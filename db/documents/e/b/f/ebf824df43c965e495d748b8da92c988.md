The pectinate muscles or musculi pectinati compose the walls of the atria.  They are parallel ridges in the walls of the right atrium. The crista terminalis is a smooth muscular ridge in the superior portion of the right atrium.  It divides the musculi pectinati and the right atrial appendage from the smooth surface of the right atrium.
