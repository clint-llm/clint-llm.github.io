Although estrogen toxicity is not commonly described in the literature, numerous studies have shown that chronic exposure to estrogen poses a risk for the development of hormone-sensitive malignancy, increases the estrogen-containing risk of dementia and cardiovascular diseases in postmenopausal women treated with hormone replacement therapy. Symptoms of excess estrogen exposure includeÂ heavy menstruation, irritability and mood swings, headaches, sleep disturbances, breast cyst, endometriosis, fibroids, gallbladder disease, and thyroid disorders. Excess estrogen should also be considered in males who present with symptoms of infertility and gynecomastia.

High estrogen levels should raise suspicion for exposure to environmental estrogen, overexpression of the aromatase enzyme, and ectopic production of estrogens from hormone-producing malignant tissues. In addition to concerns for estrogen excess, it is crucial to consider drug-to-drug interactions that may induce or inhibit estrogen CYP3A4 metabolism in the liver.
