Blepharoplasty refers to the aesthetic or functional surgical manipulation of the upper or lower eyelids. Upper and lower lid blepharoplasty both have their own set of indications and may be undertaken during the same procedure or at different times. Knowledge of the anatomy of the upper and lower eyelids is key to the identification of deformities that may be amenable to surgical correction while also preventing unwanted complications from these same surgical procedures. This activity reviews the technique of blepharoplasty, its indications, contraindications and the role of the nursing and surgical teams in the management of pre and postoperative patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the techniques of blepharoplasty.
- Describe the indications for blepharoplasty.
- Describe the complications of blepharoplasty.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients undergoing blepharoplasty.
