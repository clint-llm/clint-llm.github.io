Inherited and acquired hemophilia A (HA) causes significant morbidity resulting from deficiency of factor VIII (FVIII), which is critical to normal coagulation. Managing patients with HA is complex and requires replacing FVIII for bleeding prophylaxisÂ and treating acute bleeding episodes.

Emicizumab was created to circumvent challenges associated with frequent intravenous administration of FVIII and offer a standardized treatment option for Hemophilia A patients with and without inhibitors.
