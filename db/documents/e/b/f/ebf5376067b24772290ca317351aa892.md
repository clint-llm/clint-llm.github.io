Knowledge, education, and care should be coordinated between medical teams of physicians, nurses, and other health professionals, as well as with coaches, athletes, and families to identify commotio cordis and improve access to immediate treatment options. Today many sporting organizations have a healthcare professional (either a nurse or a physician) at the venue to assist and advise on safety. More important, nurses and physicians play a major role in education and teaching the public about effective resuscitation measures. Finally, these healthcare professionals also attend to any medical emergency during a sporting event.

**Outcomes**

There is evidence from a data registry that survival has improved concomitantly with increased awareness and access to medical care and public defibrillators. (Level IV) Data show that at least 59% of individuals have survived Commotio cordis in recent years, and each year the survival rates are improving. The key reasons for the mortality are the failure of timely resuscitation and the presence of congenital heart disease. However, the standardization of resuscitation out of the hospital has seen a steady increase in survivors from all types of cardiac arrest, including commotio cordis.
