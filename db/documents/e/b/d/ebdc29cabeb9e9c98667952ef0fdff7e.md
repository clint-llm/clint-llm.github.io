Cutaneous abscesses are localized collections of pus that occur within the dermis and subcutaneous space. They occur virtually anywhere on the body; however, common locations for an abscess to develop are the groin, buttocks, axillae, and extremities.

In most cases, a cutaneous abscess can be diagnosed clinically on the basis of physical examination alone. The classic characteristics of an abscess are erythema, induration, tenderness to palpation, and fluctuance. Care must be taken to differentiate between cellulitis and abscess, as the treatment for cellulitis is antibiotic therapy without drainage. Typically an abscess will be fluctuant on exam, whereas this is not a feature of cellulitis. In cases of equivocal clinical findings, ultrasonography can be used to assess for the presence of an abscess, in addition to providing information on size and location.

Studies have been done to compare the use of physical exam and ultrasonography in the detection of an abscess. A prospective study in the pediatric population revealed that in cases when abscesses could not be diagnosed clinically, bedside ultrasound had higher sensitivity and specificity than the exam alone.
