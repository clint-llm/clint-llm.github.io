Hungry bone syndrome is a state of profound hypocalcemia that can persist for prolonged periods, most notably after parathyroidectomy and thyroidectomy. The hypocalcemic state can be challenging to control and requires varying doses of supplementation to avoid untoward morbidity for patients. This activity is aimed to illustrate the presentation, underlying pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of hungry bone syndrome and ultimately to help improve awareness and knowledge of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the features of hungry bone syndrome.
- Review the proposed pathophysiology of hungry bone syndrome.
- Identify patients at risk and propose means of preventing hungry bone syndrome.
- Outline the diagnosis, treatment and proposed means of preventing hungry bone syndrome.
