Postoperative rehabilitation protocols are a balance between permitting soft tissue healing while preventing post-operative stiffness. Most surgeons will place post-operative patients into immediate immobilization. Duration varies from one to six weeks. A typical post-operative protocol may entail a period of soft tissue rest to protect any repairs. Pendulum rotation may begin immediately, but further range of motion is initially discouraged. After this time, passive, active-assist, and active range of motion is started with the supervision of a physical therapist. The goal is to return to play to the pre-injury level. Comparing arthroscopic versus open stabilization procedures, a 2017 systematic review found no difference in return to play rates and patient-reported outcomes. In all surgically treated patients, over 65% of athletes returned to their pre-injury level of play.
