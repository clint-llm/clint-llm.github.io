The overall mortality rate for spinal cord infarction has reportedly been between 9 and 23%, and the majority of deaths occur shortly after the initial injury.

More severe presenting symptoms and lack of significant improvement in the first 24 hours leads to a much poorer prognosis. Female sex and old age are two additional poor prognostic factors identified. Studies have shown that in less severe cases, favorable outcomes with improvement in neurologic function are possible and that a small number of patients regain their full walking ability. Functional improvements can slowly develop over several years post-injury.
