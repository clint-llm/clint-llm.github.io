Traditionally, simulation program directors have had training in many quality, safety assessment, and evaluation methods. On a large scale, proactive methods include crisis resource management strategies such as disaster management and emergency preparedness training. At the point of care, "just in time," training is a method that provides a quick skills refresher. When performance gaps are identified, other quality improvement methods can be employed, such as rapid cycle process improvement, healthcare failure mode and effect analysis (HFMEA) with latent safety threat tracking, and root-cause analysis (RCA).

More recently, human factors engineering principles have been incorporated into simulation training. When circumstances push a work system beyond its competence boundaries, adaptability is required for the system to be able to accomplish the original goal successfully. Safety and resilience engineering provide a platform to determine which behaviors should be modeled or generalized for other members of the work system. Simulation, thus, provides an opportunity to safely and reproducibly place individuals into situations designed to elicit adaptability and resilience behaviors. By identifying positive behaviors, simulation can create "accelerated expertise," which can be reported to hospital leadership, generalized if appropriate, and disseminated to staff in all applicable settings of the institution in a unified and expedited fashion.
