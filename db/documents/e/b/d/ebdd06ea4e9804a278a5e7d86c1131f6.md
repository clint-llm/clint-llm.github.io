Omphalocele is a rare congenital abdominal wall defect with a reported prevalence of 3.38 per 10,000 pregnancies. It is a protrusion of the abdominal contents covered with peritoneum through the base of the umbilical cord. Omphalocele can be isolated but is more frequently associated with other congenital anomalies and syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and trisomies 13, 18, and 21. This activity reviews the cause, presentation, and pathophysiology of omphalocele and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of omphalocele.
- Describe the presentation of omphalocele.
- Summarize the treatment of omphalocele.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by omphalocele.
