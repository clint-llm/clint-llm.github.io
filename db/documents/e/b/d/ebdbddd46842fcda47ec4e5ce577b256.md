Bone infection is called osteomyelitis. It is an acute or chronic inflammatory process involving the bone and its structures secondary to infection with pyogenic organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria. Interestingly, archeological finds showed animal fossils with evidence of bone infection, making this a relatively old disease.
