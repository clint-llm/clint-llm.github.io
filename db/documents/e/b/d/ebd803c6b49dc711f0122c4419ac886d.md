The external ear collects sound vibrations from the air and focuses these sounds onto the tympanic membrane. Vibrations are transmitted through the middle ear by the ossicular chain (malleus, incus, and stapes). The stapes transmits these vibrations to the cochlea through the oval window (fenestra ovalis). Sound can also be transmitted through the bones of the skull to the cochlea.

The hair cells in the cochlea convert the physical vibrations into action potentials transmitted via the nerves in the vestibulocochlear (auditory) nerve to the brainstem for further processing.

Deafness may occur due to interruption at any point along this pathway.

The Rinne test is conducted by placing a tuning fork on the mastoid bone and then adjacent to the outer ear.

- Air conduction uses the apparatus of the ear (pinna, ear canal, tympanic membrane, and ossicles) to amplify and direct the sound.

- Bone conduction allows the vibration sound to be transmitted to the inner ear. The ear bones transmit reduced volume audition via the bones of the skull to the other ear.
