When dosing drugs for significant periods, the dosage for the desired effect must be monitored to ensure that the patient does not approach the toxic dose.

In a recent study, researchers found that prescription medications have contributed to over 10% of hospital admission and over 15% of hospital mortality.

Research has found that lower dosages of medications such as aspirin and statins, when used at dosages near their ED50 are the most efficacious from a preventative standpoint. For example, an 81 mg dosage of aspirin after a first clinical heart event is just as effective as dosages of over 100 mg.

It is important to remember the different clinical endpoints in patients as well, and as patients change in weight, age, etc. their ED50 may also be altered. Clinicians are prone to work towards specific metrics, such as a hemoglobin A1C of 6% for a diabetic patient or a blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg. However, these are clinical guidelines and should act as a starting point towards which the clinician believes their patient should achieve. If clinicians are not mindful of these considerations, patients may receive doses of medications that are in a toxic dose range to them which may be a standard dosage for another patient.
