A comprehensive screening and assessment by a multidisciplinary treatment team, including primary care providers, neurology, and psychiatry, are needed for the diagnosis and treatment of FNSD/CD. Active collaboration and agreement regarding the diagnosis across specialties involved in the care of the patient are required to prevent unnecessary consultations, testing, multiple hospital visits, and health care utilization. Patients should be educated on their presenting symptoms, and efforts should be made to engage the patient in treatment. Treatment outcomes are generally worse if the patient does not have buy-in in their diagnosis of FNSD/CD, or do not engage in treatment.
