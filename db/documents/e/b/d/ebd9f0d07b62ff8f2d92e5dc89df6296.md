Balanoposthitis can present as penile pain, pruritus, discharge, erythema, rash, or inconsolable crying. By definition, this only presents in uncircumcised boys. It can be more common in patients with poor hygiene. Depending on the etiology and disease progression, it may also occur with or without phimosis, scarring of the prepuce, inability to void, ulcers, other lesions, and rashes.
