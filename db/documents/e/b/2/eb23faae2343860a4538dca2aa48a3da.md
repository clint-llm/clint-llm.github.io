Erb palsy most commonly presents with a history of birth injury. The signs of Erb's palsy include loss of sensation in the arm and paralysis and atrophy of the deltoid, biceps, and brachialis muscles. The muscular damage results in the classical sign of Erb’s palsy called the ‘waiter’s tip hand.’ The neonate presents with the arm hanging limply from the shoulder with adduction at the shoulder, internal rotation of the upper arm, pronation of the forearm, and an outward direction of the palm, giving the appearance of a "waiter's tip posture.". The arm cannot be raised from the side, and all power of flexion of the elbow is lost due to the paralysis of the biceps muscle. Moro reflex is absent on the affected side. Meanwhile, the grasp reflex is present, which differentiates it from another brachial nerve palsy, Klumpke palsy (C7, C8, and T1). The neonate may have impaired sensation on the outer side of the arm and/or phrenic nerve palsy (C3, C4, and C5a), resulting in hemidiaphragm paralysis.

In some cases, there may be sensory loss over the lateral aspect of the upper arm. When C3 and C4 are damaged, one may also note paralysis of the diaphragm. Horner syndrome may occur when the stellate ganglion is damaged.
