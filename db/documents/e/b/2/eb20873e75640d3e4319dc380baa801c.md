The oral lethal dose of cilostazol is over 5 g/kg in rats and mice and more than 2 g/kg in dogs. There is a lack of data on acute overdosage with cilostazol in humans. The signs and symptoms of an acute cilostazol overdose can present as a severe headache, diarrhea, hypotension, tachycardia, and possibly cardiac arrhythmia. In an overdose, patients require careful observation and provide supportive treatment. Cilostazol is highly protein-bound and unlikely to be efficiently removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Emptying the stomach by gastric lavage may be appropriate if needed.
