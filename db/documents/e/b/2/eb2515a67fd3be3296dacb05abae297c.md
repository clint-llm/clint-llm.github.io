Individuals that can breathe spontaneously throughout the complete respiratory cycle can use CPAP. The primary function of non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation is to improve pulmonary compliance, improve alveoli aeration by recruiting and stabilizing collapsed alveoli, and ultimately improve ventilation-perfusion mismatches. Continuous positive airway pressure increases intrathoracic pressure which in turn reduces venous return (preload), transmural pressure, and afterload.  This ultimately allows for enhancement in cardiac function and reduces pulmonary edema.

Common indications for CPAP include

- Congestive heart failure

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthma)

- Acute bronchitis and pneumonia secondary to bacterial, viral, or fungal causes

- Blunt chest wall trauma including flail chest

- Toxic inhalation(s) ( i.e. chlorine)

- Severely obese patients

- Near drownings( with signs of pulmonary edema)

- Neonatal patients with respiratory distress

- Patients with do not resuscitate status (advanced disease or terminal illnesses)
