There are no absolute contraindications to open inguinal hernia repair. As in all elective surgery, the patient must be optimized medically before surgery.

Some relative contraindications would be:

- Inability to tolerate general anesthesia; however, this procedure can be performed under local anesthetic

- Coagulopathy

- Obesity (body mass index greater than 35)

- Current tobacco use
