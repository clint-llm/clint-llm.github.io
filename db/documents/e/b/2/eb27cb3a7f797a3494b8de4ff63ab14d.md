Importantly, widespread adoption and uptake of standardized patients in summative and formative CSAs and OSCEs at the undergraduate medical education (UGME) and graduate medical education (GME) level behoove medical educators to adhere to standards of best practice in SP methodology in curriculum development. The Association of Standardized Patient Educators (ASPE) was created in 2001 to promote standards of best practice related to SP methodology in medical education and beyond. From 2013 to 2017, to ensure quality, safety, and accountability, standards were developed by SP educator experts in the field, and five domains were identified to guide the application of this methodology validly and reliably. The ASPE SOBP design was for application in collaboration with the International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning (INACSL) Standards of Best Practice: Simulation.
