Malassezia furfur is a member of a monophyletic genus of fungi normally found on human and animal skin. These lipid-dependent, commensal yeasts normally constitute greater than 80% of the total fungal population of human skin and are frequently isolated in both healthy and diseased hosts.Malassezia spp. have been implicated in several common dermatologic disorders, including seborrheic dermatitis (SD), pityriasis versicolor (PV), and Malassezia folliculitis. Recently, emerging evidence suggests Malassezia may contribute to other conditions such as atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis. However, their exact pathogenic role remains a subject of controversy.Malassezia with antifungal agents leads to the improvement of some skin conditions.Malassezia can act opportunistically, causing severe cutaneous and systemic infections.

Researchers discovered a yeast that correlated with PV as early as 1846, which was later named Malassezia furfur in 1853. First designated as a distinct genus in 1889, over the years, 17 species of Malassezia have since been isolated from both human and animal skin, which are classified by molecular biology, morphology, phenotype, and ultrastructure.M. globosa, M. restricta, and M. sympodialis are the most common types found on healthy and diseased human skin, but M. furfur is also prevalent, and reports exist specifically correlating it with multiple skin disorders, PV in particular.M. furfur – SD, PV, and Malassezia folliculitis.
