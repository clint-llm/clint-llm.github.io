UV rays cause the insufficiency of the limbal stem cells of the cornea. It causes activation of the tissue growth factors, which further lead to angiogenesis and cell proliferation. The limbal stem cells are damaged by the UV rays that cause conjunctivalization of the cornea, and the cornea is invaded by aggressive fibroblasts**.**UV radiation mayÂ cause mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene, resulting in the abnormal pterygial epithelium.

Recent studies have indicated that human papillomavirus could also be involved in the pathogenesis of the pterygium.

It was also hypothesized that a pterygium might represent a region with a localized limbal stem cell deficiency, resulting in a conjunctive invasion of the adjacent cornea.

**Recurrent Pterygium Pathophysiology**

Pathophysiology of recurrence is the reactivation of the inflammatory process, which is present in the primary form. Sometimes the surgical trauma serves as an enhancer of the inflammatory response. Proliferative cytokines and growth factors (including vascular endothelial growth factor or VEGF) can increase after surgery if the limbal stem cells remain activated, and fibroelastic tissue is also involved.
