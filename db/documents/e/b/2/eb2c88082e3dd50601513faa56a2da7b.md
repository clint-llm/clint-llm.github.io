The laboratory workup for the evaluation of MPNs includes the following:

- Complete blood count with differential

- Peripheral blood with microscopic examination

- Comprehensive metabolic panel

- Electrolytes

- Peripheral blood fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for BCR-ABL1

- Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score which helps to differentiate between reactive leukocytosis from CML. The LAP score is low in patients with CML and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, however, the score is high in leukemoid reaction.

- Serum uric acid

- Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

- Erythropoietin (EPO) level - normal or high in secondary polycythemia, but low or normal in PV.

- Von Willebrand factor - PV patients may develop acquired von Willebrand disease with platelet counts greater than 1 million/microL, and these patients are at increased risk of bleeding, particularly if they are on aspirin.

- Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy

- Cytogenetic analysis of the BM aspirate for Philadelphia Chromosome. FISH for bcr-abl.

- Peripheral blood molecular testing for JAK2, MPL, CALR, and CSF3R mutations.

Evaluation of MPNs involves comprehensive hematological/laboratory workup, BM biopsy, cytogenetic analysis, and clinical assessment. Owing to recent advances in molecular markers or driver mutations, 2008 WHO classification of myeloid neoplasm was updated in 2016 to incorporate new molecular biomarkers. Diagnostic criteria for MPNs based on revised and updated WHO classification are as follows

**WHO diagnostic criteria for CML (Accelerated and Blast Phase)**

The diagnosis of the CML requires any one or more of the following for the accelerated phase:

- Persistent or increasing WBC (greater than 10 X 10^9/L), Unresponsive to therapy

- Persistent thrombocytosis (greater than 1000 X 10^9/L), Unresponsive to therapy

- Persistent thrombocytopenia (greater than 100 X 10^9/L), Unrelated to therapy

- Persistent or increasing splenomegaly, Unresponsive to therapy

- Basophils greater than or equal to 20% in peripheral blood

- Blast cells 10% to 19% in peripheral blood or bone marrow

- Additional clonal chromosomal abnormality in Philadelphia positive cells at diagnosis

- Any new clonal chromosomal abnormality in Philadelphia positive cells during therapy

The diagnosis criteria for CML (blast phase) includes any one of the above criteria and blast cells greater than or equal to 20% in peripheral blood or BM or extramedullary involvement of lymph nodes, skin, lung, central nervous system, and bone.

**Revised WHO****Diagnostic Criteria for Polycythemia Vera**

Diagnosis of PV necessitates the presence of either all three major criteria or the first two major criteria and one minor criterion.

**Major criteria
**

- Hemoglobin greater than 16.5 g/dL in male and hemoglobin greater than 16.0 g/dL in female ORHematocrit greater than 49% in male and hematocrit greater than 48% in female ORIncreased red cell mass greater than 25% above mean normal predicted value

- Bone marrow biopsy with trilineage myeloproliferation (panmyelosis) and hypercellularity for age

- Presence of JAK2 V617F or JAK exon 12 mutation

**Minor criterion
**

- Serum erythropoietin below normal

Of note, patients with PV who fulfill the diagnostic criteria should also be evaluated for secondary causes of polycythemia.

**Revised WHO Diagnostic Criteria for****Essential Thrombocythemia**

Diagnosis of ET requires either the presence of all four major criteria or the first three major criteria and the minor criterion.

**Major criteria**

- Platelet count greater than or equal to 450 X 10^9/L

- Bone marrow biopsy with a proliferation of megakaryocyte lineage with increased numbers of large, mature megakaryocytes. No increase in neutrophil granulopoiesis or erythropoiesis.

- Not meeting WHO criteria for BCR-ABL1 positive CML, PMF, PV, MDS, or other myeloid neoplasms

- Detection of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation

**Minor criterion**

- Presence of clonal marker or absence of evidence for reactive thrombocytosis

**Revised WHO Diagnostic Criteria for Primary Myelofibrosis**

The diagnosis of PMF requires the presence of all three major criteria and at least one of the minor criteria.

**Major criteria**

- Bone marrow findings of megakaryocyte proliferation with atypia, usually accompanied by reticulin and/or collagen fibrosis

- Not meeting the WHO criteria for BCR-ABL1 positive CML, ET, PV, MDS, or other myeloid neoplasms

- Detection of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation or presence of clonal markers in the absence of these mutations

**Minor criteria**

- Anemia not attributed to another comorbid condition

- Leukocytosis greater than or equal to 11 X 10^9/L

- Palpable splenomegaly

- Elevated LDH

- Leukoerythroblastosis

**Revised WHO diagnostic criteria for Chronic Neutrophilic Leukemia**

- Peripheral blood with WBC greater than or equal to 25 X 10^9/L, segmented neutrophils plus band forms greater than or equal to 80% of WBCs, neutrophil precursors less than 10%, rare myeloblasts, monocyte count less than 1 X 10^9/L, and no dysgranulopoiesis

- Bone marrow hypercellularity with elevated neutrophil granulocytes, normal neutrophil maturation, and myeloblast less than 5% of nucleated cells

- Not meeting WHO criteria for BCR-ABL1 positive CML, ET, PV, or PMF

- No rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB, or FGFR1, or PCM1-JAK2

- Detection of CSF3R T618I or other activating CSF3R mutation or in the absence of a CSF3R mutation sustained neutrophilia for at least 3 months, splenomegaly and no identifiable cause of reactive neutrophilia including an absence of a plasma cell neoplasm
