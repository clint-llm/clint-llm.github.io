Patients with skin lesions often present to the emergency department, primary care physician, nurse practitioner or the internist. However, if there is suspicion about cancer the patient is best referred to a dermatologist. Without a biopsy, it is impossible to make the diagnosis of early skin cancer. While the dermatologist will undertake definitive workup, the primary care provider, nurse practitioner and pharmacist should emphasize the importance of prevention by limiting sun exposure.

The use of sunscreen, photoprotective clothing, and other means that could minimize exposure to sun rays are helpful prevention tips. Regular testing and screening are also important, especially in people at high risk for squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Early detection has a very good prognosis and prevents the development of squamous cell carcinoma.
