As muscles are found throughout the entire body, the pathologies associated with abnormal muscle contraction are extensive. Therefore, while this list delineates high-yield pathophysiological conditions related to muscle contraction, it is not exhaustive.

**Skeletal Muscle Contraction Pathology**

- Duchenne muscular dystrophy

- Becker muscular dystrophy

- Myotonic dystrophy

- Lambert-Eaton syndrome

- Myasthenia gravis

- Myositis

- Bell palsy

**Smooth Muscle Contraction Pathology**

- Asthma

- Gastroparesis

- Nephrolithiasis

- Chronic kidney disease

- Neurogenic bladder

- Infertility

- Pulmonary hypertension

**Cardiac Muscle Contraction Pathology**

- Congestive heart failure

- Cardiomyopathy (e.g., dilated, hypertrophic, restrictive)
