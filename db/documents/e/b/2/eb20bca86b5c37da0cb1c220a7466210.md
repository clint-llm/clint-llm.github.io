Although the mechanism by which HLAB-27 causes disease is unknown, several hypotheses have been postulated. According to the arthritogenic peptide hypothesis, when HLA-B27 forms a bond with a peptide from a microbial source, it triggers a CD8 T cell response to a self-peptide with a similar structure to the microbial peptide. Evidence for this mechanism has surfaced in patients who develop reactive arthritis after salmonella or chlamydia infections, which trigger a specific HLA-B27 CD8 T cell response. The misfolding hypothesis suggests that HLA-B27 may misfold in the endoplasmic reticulum, causing functional alterations in dendritic cell populations and function, increased formation of osteoclasts, and also increased IL-23 production, which has been shown to have pathogenic effect in spondyloarthropathy.
