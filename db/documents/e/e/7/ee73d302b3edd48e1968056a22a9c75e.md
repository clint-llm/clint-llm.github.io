With the recent advances in technology, physicians may overlook the importance of the physical examination (PE). PE is of considerable significance and can yield important data necessary for the diagnosis and treatment. Upon initial presentation, a comprehensive physical examination is warranted. However, subsequent evaluations may be focussed and problem-oriented. The cardiac examination is a component of physical examination and is an invaluable tool in assessing the hemodynamic status of the patient. The jugular venous examination is a vital component of the cardiovascular exam. When performed carefully and properly, the jugular venous waveform can provide an estimate of central venous pressure (CVP) and, when it is distended, can provide prognostic implications in patients with heart failure.
