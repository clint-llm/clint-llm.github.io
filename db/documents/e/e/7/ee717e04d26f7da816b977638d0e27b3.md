Malignant tumors arise from genetic changes involving oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Some of these changes have been characterized by specific lacrimal gland neoplasms. For adenoid cystic carcinoma, abnormalities in MYB or MYB-NFIB protein expression have been identified and may serve as a critical event in the oncogenic process.

Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma tumors likely have the same underlying genetic abnormalities as pleomorphic adenomas, such as PLAG1, and the genetic abnormalities were seen in the corresponding tumor's malignant component. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the salivary gland has been shown to harbor a translocation between chromosomes 11 and 19, resulting in a fusion of oncogenes CRTC1 and MAML2, and it has been found that lacrimal gland MEC tumors are similar.

Ductal carcinomas frequently exhibit HER2 and androgen receptor positivity and are always ER and PR negative. For lymphoma, EMZL exhibits a translocation between chromosomes 14 and 18 or between chromosomes 3 and 14, follicular lymphoma has translocations between chromosomes 14 and 18, and mantle cell lymphoma has translocations between chromosomes 11 and 14.
