**Laboratory Findings**

Laboratory evaluation usually includes hematologic work-up, routine biochemistry, inflammatory markers, and a comprehensive autoimmune panel. Hematologic work-up consists of a complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, electrolytes, thyroid function studies, sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, rheumatoid factor, angiotensin-converting enzyme level, and rapid plasma regain test.

**Ultrasound, Computed Tomography (CT), and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)**

Orbital ultrasound, CT, and MRI may aid in the diagnosis when combined with clinical findings and treatment response. Ultrasonography may help in evaluating the globe and ocular complications such as retinal and choroidal detachments.

Enhancement is variable depending on the stage. In the acute stage, there is pronounced enhancement, while in the chronic and sclerosing type of inflammation, there is hypointensity on T2-W images noted. Diffuse IOI CT and MRI findings are similar to anterior IOI. Orbital lymphoproliferative may be challenging to differentiate. Apical IOI may show signs of intracranial involvement such as abnormal soft tissue extending into the middle cranial fossa, cavernous sinus, and meninges.
