**Typical Symptoms**

The typical symptoms of reflux esophagitis may include heartburn and acid regurgitation. Heartburn is a burning sensation felt behind the sternum within 60 minutes of eating. It is usually precipitated by exercising and lying in a recumbent position. The pain usually starts in the epigastrium and radiates towards the neck. However, some patients with severe esophagitis or Barrett esophagus may be symptom-free and have no heartburn.

Acid regurgitation where the patient may notice a sour or burning fluid in the throat or mouth may be present. Maneuvers increasing intra-abdominal pressure and bending forward could provoke regurgitation of gastric acid.

Some dysphagia may be reported in 30% of patients with reflux esophagitis (usually present in the presence of peptic strictures, Schatzki rings, weak peristalsis, or mucosal inflammation).

Other symptoms include:

- Globus sensation (a sense of a lump in the throat)

- Water brash (increased salivary secretions in response to the acidity of the esophagus)

**Atypical Symptoms**

These include the following:

- Chest pain: The esophageal reflux may mimic cardiac pain, and patients should be evaluated to exclude cardiac causes.

- Chronic cough: Reflux esophagitis is one of the causes of chronic cough.

- Asthma: There is an association between asthma and reflux esophagitis.

- Dental erosions, dysphonia (voice disorder), sore throat, and laryngospasm may be present.
