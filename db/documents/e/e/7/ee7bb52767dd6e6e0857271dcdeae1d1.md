GHB is pharmaceutically manufactured as sodium oxybate for the treatment of narcolepsy. This formulation is considered a Schedule III drug in the United States. In Europe, GHB is also still therapeutically used as an anesthetic and for the treatment of alcohol and opiate dependence. The agent is often misused. After prolonged used and sudden cessation, withdrawal symptoms have been reported in chronic or dependent users after cessation of the drug. The management of GHB overdose is by an interprofessional team. Since there is no specific antidote to reverse the toxicity, aggressive supportive care including mechanical ventilation may be required.  Severe withdrawal symptoms are life threatening and can last up to 15 days. Patients should be treated with benzodiazepines and managed in the intensive care unit. Parents should be educated about safe storage of this agent to prevent accidental poisoning in children.
