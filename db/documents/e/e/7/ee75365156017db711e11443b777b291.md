Calcaneus fractures are rare but potentially debilitating injuries. The calcaneus is one of seven tarsal bones and is part of the hind-foot which includes the calcaneus and the talus. The hindfoot articulates with the tibia and fibula creating the ankle joint. The subtalar or calcaneotalar joint accounts for at least some foot and ankle dorsal/plantar flexion. Historically a burst fracture of the calcaneus was coined a "lovers' fracture" as the injury would occur as a suitor jumped off a lover's balcony to avoid detection. This activity reviews the causes, presentation, and diagnosis of calcaneus fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in their management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of calcaneus fractures.
- Review the evaluation of a patient with a calcaneus fracture.
- Summarize the treatment options for calcaneus fractures including surgical options and the risks and benefits associated with treatment. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by calcaneus fracture.
