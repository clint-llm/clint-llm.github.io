The prognosis of milk-alkali syndrome is good, as it can easily be reversed by stopping the ingestion of calcium supplements and absorbable alkalis. The morbidity associated with the disease is highly dependent on the severity and duration of hypercalcemia and alkalosis. If recognized early and treated appropriately, the chances of the development of complications can be significantly reduced, and the prognosis is favorable.
