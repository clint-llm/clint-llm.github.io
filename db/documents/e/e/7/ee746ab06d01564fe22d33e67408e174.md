A lack of natural killer (NK) cell and B-cell activity in pityriasis rosea lesions has been noted, suggesting a predominantly T-cell mediated immunity. Increased amounts of CD4 T-cells and Langerhans cells are present in the dermis, possibly reflecting viral antigen processing and presentation. Anti-immunoglobulin M (IgM) keratinocytes have been found in patients with pityriasis rosea. This may be associated with the exanthem phase of viral infection.
