**Low Serum Osmolality (Hypoosmolar Serum)**

Psychogenic polydipsia: A psychiatric condition characterized by self-induced water intoxication. The disease process has three phases. First, polyuria and polydipsia, followed by the second phase, as the kidney cannot excrete the excess water, resulting in hypoosmolar plasma that manifests as hyponatremia. The final phase is water intoxication, manifesting as delirium, ataxia, nausea, seizures, and vomiting, which may ultimately be fatal.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH): The condition occurs when the body produces an excessive amount of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) due to multiple causes, such as central nervous system tumors, medications, and lung cancers, resulting in the kidneys reabsorbing too much water, which manifests as a dilutional hypoosmolar plasma and hypertension. The treatment can involve medications that block the vasopressin receptor, such as tolvaptan, therapy with hypertonic saline, removing the medications inducing SIADH, or treating the primary cause.

Nephrotic syndrome: A general term that describes the disease processes which result in excessive loss of protein in the urine (proteinuria over 3 grams/day), accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia, hypoalbuminemia, and a hypercoagulable state. The proteinuria occurs when there is damage to the podocyte foot processes or the glomerular basement membrane, which results in decreased serum osmolality and oncotic pressure.

Liver cirrhosis: Albumin is produced by the liver and then secreted out of the hepatic cells into the extravascular space, then returned to the blood via the lymphatic system. When liver damage occurs, the body is unable to produce albumin, which results in a hypoosmolar serum.

**High Serum Osmolality (Hyperosmolar Serum)**

Diabetes insipidus (DI): This disease is manifested by the excretion of a large volume of urine; this will result in hyperosmolar plasma (greater than 300 mOsm/liter) and hypoosmolar urine (less than 300 mOsm/liter). It can result from a lack of ADH (central) due to damage to the neurons responsible for ADH production secondary to pituitary/hypothalamic infarcts, pituitary tumors, trauma, or sarcoidosis. Another cause for DI is the failure of response to circulating ADH (nephrogenic). In such cases, the patient has a genetic mutation in the vasopressin receptors, which renders the hormone ineffective.

Dehydration: This results when the loss of water from the body exceeds the intake. It may also be caused by failure to replace obligate water losses. It occurs in several forms. Isotonic dehydration occurs when sodium and water are lost together due to causes such as vomiting, diarrhea, burns, sweating, hyperglycemia, hypoaldosteronism, and intrinsic kidney disease. Hypertonic dehydration occurs when there is a water loss more than sodium loss, which will cause an elevation in serum sodium and osmolality. Excess pure water loss mainly occurs through the lungs, kidneys, and skin. Etiologies are fever, DI, and increased respiration. Hypotonic dehydration is most often caused by diuretics, which cause sodium loss more than water loss. Hypotonic dehydration is characterized by low osmolality and sodium.
