Assessing vestibular dysfunction with caloric testing can be a bedside test performed primarily by the practitioner; however, it may require additional assistance by nursing staff to properly and effectively execute. In addition, if electro-oculography or video-oculography will be utilized, exceptional skill and training with this equipment is necessary and may require input and consultation from a trained audiologist.

Caloric testing using warm air can be used when there are chronic suppurative otitis media and perforations of the tympanic membrane. These enhancements require less cumbersome preparation and fewer personnel and can reduce complications due to testing with water.
