Several factors may interfere with the scan and affect the examination findings. While injecting the tracer intravenously, blood drawn into the syringe may become coagulated and result in hot spots. This phenomenon was also reported after injection in an upper extremity affected by thrombophlebitis.

If a chest X-ray shows significant abnormalities such as dense consolidation, it can result in a matching ventilation defect and perfusion defect along with an X-ray abnormality referred to as a "triple match." A triple match can result in indeterminate or non-diagnostic test results.

Ventilation scintigraphy may be performed with the patient in an upright position while perfusion scintigraphy is performed with the patient in a supine position, and both are performed at different points in time which may affect the comparability of the two scans.Â A mismatch may also occur in decubitus or oblique positions by affecting the ventilation and perfusion distribution.
