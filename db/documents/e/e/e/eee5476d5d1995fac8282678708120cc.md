Mammals maintain physiologic homeostasis largely due to the nervous system responses that regulate heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure. However, when a mammal dives below the water, these physiologic checks and balances are effectively modified. During submersion the mammal holds its breath, the heart rate slows down, and their peripheral vascular system constricts. These unique but separate physiologic changes are prompted by triggering peripheral receptors, and they work together to preserve the mammal’s oxygen levels.

Through activation of the peripheral receptors involving the nervous system impact two distinct organ groups: the pulmonary and cardiovascular system.  Keeping in mind the cause and effect relationship of these systems at work the following list outlines the major contributors to this physiologic reflex:

- Nervous system

- Pulmonary system

- Cardiovascular system
