Due to a generalized and commonly non-acute clinical presentation, due to a limited understanding and testing for OIE, the data pertaining to its prevalence and pervasiveness remains unclear. The current evidence indicates that OIE is very common with significant clinical consequences. Patients suffering from chronic pain being treated with chronic opioid therapy are likely to be suffering from OIE. Increasing the awareness of this condition as well as more routinely testing for, diagnosing, and treating OIE is necessary as this will likely have a significant improvement in these patients' quality of life.

When considering the continuation of chronic opioid therapy, as part of the informed consent process, patients should be counseled on the common risks and side effects of long-term opioids to include OIE, and with its many clinical manifestations which may include low energy, decreased libido, impotence, amenorrhea, osteoporosis, anemia, depression, and decreased muscle mass.

Recognizing, testing for and diagnosing as well as treating OIE while ruling out as well as addressing and treating other possible contributing factors and conditions common in patients with chronic pain being treated with opioids require a multi-disciplinary approach to patient care and management.

The involvement of and routine follow-up and communication with chronic pain specialists, as well as endocrinologists, may be a promising approach to optimal patient care and outcomes. Unless clinically indicated, the majority of the disease course may be managed on an outpatient basis.
