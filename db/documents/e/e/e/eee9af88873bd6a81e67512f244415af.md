Urge incontinence is a type of urinary incontinence in adults, which involves sudden compelling urges to void and results in involuntary leakage of urine. This is a serious and debilitating condition and has a social stigma attached to it. To avoid the huge socioeconomic burden and high morbidity associated with this condition, early diagnosis, treatment, and referral concepts must be widely practiced among clinicians. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of urge incontinence and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.
