Mixed connective tissue disease, previously considered a mild and curable condition, can often be life-threatening. Almost one-third of patients with MCTD undergo complete resolution, while another third can develop life-threatening complications. Prognosis depends on which organ is affected, the degree of inflammation, and the rate of progression of the disease. The mortality rate varies between 8 and 36%.

Epitope spreading can occur during disease leading to change in clinical features. For example, a lower rate of skin sclerosis and a higher percentage of interstitial lung disease appeared in patients who had epitope spreading compared to those who did not during a follow-up of patients with MCTD.
