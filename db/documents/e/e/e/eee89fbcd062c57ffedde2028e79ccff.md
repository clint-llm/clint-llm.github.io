**Physical Exam**

- Skin turgor: An indicator of dehydration, skin turgor is assessed by pinching the skin between the thumb and forefinger and then releasing it. The time it takes for the skin to return to its normal contour can indicate dehydration and solute depletion.

- Blood pressure: In dehydration, the total volume of water becomes reduced, and therefore, low blood pressure can occur. There may also be a reflex tachycardia present.

- Examination of mucous membranes: Dehydration can manifest as dry mucous membranes.

**Laboratory Tests**

- CBC with Differentials: The hematocrit is a measure of blood concentration, and if it is increased or decreased, it indicates the fluid status is in the vasculature.

- Basic Metabolic Panel and Arterial Blood Gas: This will provide the clinician with information regarding the patient's acid-base status and the concentrations of the major ions that contribute to plasma osmolality.

- Urinalysis: The clinician will be able to see the number of electrolytes in the urine and the proteins, which can help identify nephrotic syndromes.

**Studies**

- Water deprivation test: The patient will undergo fluid deprivation, and the entire volume of urine will be collected, which is then analyzed for osmolality and electrolytes, and then there will be a challenge ADH. The effects of subsequent urine collection will also undergo analysis, which will determine the cause of diabetes insipidus in the patient.
