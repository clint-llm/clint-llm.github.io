The prognosis of the MEN1 patient is variable. Tumors associated with MEN1 are more aggressive and challenging to treat. Average life expectancy is shorter in patients with non-functioning pancreatic NET than in patients without pancreatic NET tumors due to tumor expansion complications. Additionally, neuroendocrine tumors can metastasize quickly and can cause premature death. Studies have shown an increased risk of premature death and decreased average life expectancy in MEN1 patients.
