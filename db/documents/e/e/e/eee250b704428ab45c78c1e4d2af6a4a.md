Dopamine receptors play an essential role in daily life functions. This hormone and its receptors affect movement, emotions and the reward system in the brain.

Dopamine receptors are expressed in the central nervous system, specifically in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and subventricular zone. Dopamine receptors are also expressed in the periphery, more prominently in kidney and vasculature,

There are five types of dopamine receptors, which include D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5. Each receptor has a different function.

The function of each dopamine receptor

- D1: memory, attention, impulse control, regulation of renal function, locomotion

- D2: locomotion, attention, sleep, memory, learning

- D3: cognition, impulse control, attention, sleep

- D4: cognition, impulse control, attention, sleep

- D5: decision making, cognition, attention, renin secretion
