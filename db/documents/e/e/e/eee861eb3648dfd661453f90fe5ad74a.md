Theophylline has a very narrow therapeutic window, and its interaction with various other drugs has led to the limitation of its use. The serum theophylline concentrations require monitoring directly to avoid toxicity as the adverse effects of theophylline are related to its plasma concentration and have been observed when plasma concentrations exceed 20 mg/L. Some patients have also experienced adverse effects at low plasma concentrations. The dose gradually increases until achieving therapeutic plasma concentrations. This approach reduces side effects.

The most common side effects are nausea and vomiting, headache, increased stomach acid secretion, and gastroesophageal reflux, which could be due to PDE inhibition. CNS symptoms (irritability, lightheadedness, and dizziness) can also occur in patients. In severe cases, seizures have also occurred. At high serum concentrations, adenosine A1-receptor antagonism could lead to convulsions and cardiac arrhythmias.
