A Wiltse-Newman classification describes different etiology of pars interarticularis failure

- Type I  Dysplastic – congenital defect in pars

- Type II (isthmic) is the most common 

- II A pars fatigue fracture
- II B pars elongation due to multiple healed stress fractures
- II C pars acute fracture

- Type III degenerative spondylolisthesis from degenerative facet instability without pars fracture

- Type IV Traumatic – due to acute posterior arch fracture other than pars

- Type V  Neoplastic – pathologic destruction of the pars

Depending on the degree of the forward slip, the severity of this process is graded as mild, severe, or complete slip (spondyloptosis) - described later in Myerding classification.

In the most common isthmic spondylolisthesis, which leads to an L5/S1 slip, the following stages have been identified.

- Pars stress reaction (sclerosis with incomplete bone disruption/fracture)

- Spondylolysis (anatomic defect in the pars, radiolucent gap with adjacent bone sclerosis, without any translation of the vertebra)

- Spondylolisthesis (due to bilateral pars defect, forward translation of the superior vertebra over the inferior one)

The second most common types of spondylolisthesis are type I (dysplastic) and III (degenerative). Degenerative spondylolisthesis is most prevalent in the adult population, and levels affected most frequently are L4/L5 followed by L3/L4. Due to the chronicity of the instability, often associated degenerative changes in the intervertebral disc and facet joints occur. They often lead to secondary hypertrophy of the ligamentum flavum and subsequent spinal canal stenosis. This condition usually presents with bilateral buttock pain and neurogenic claudication (back pain eased by sitting down/leaning forward).
