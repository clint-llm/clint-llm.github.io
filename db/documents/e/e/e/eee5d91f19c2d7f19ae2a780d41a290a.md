Many other viral exanthems can be included in the differential diagnosis of erythema infectiosum including measles, rubella, roseola, and scarlet fever. In adults, when arthralgias are more common, differential diagnosis can include influenza and mononucleosis. Non-infectious causes such as drug hypersensitivity, rheumatoid arthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis should also be considered. The arthritic diagnoses on differential can be excluded once joint pain/stiffness resolves after about 3 weeks of symptom onset.
