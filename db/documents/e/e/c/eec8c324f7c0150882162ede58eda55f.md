Megaloblastic anemia has several different causes. It generally has an excellent prognosis if diagnosed early and treated adequately. However, given multiple possible causes, medication interactions, and the need for long-term therapy in some cases, patients with megaloblastic anemia are best managed with an interprofessional team approach. A multifaceted treatment strategy is needed to prevent complications and treat patients with this disease.

The clinical nurse is essential in educating the patient about dietary recommendations and medication compliance to ensure patients follow the recommended treatment. Clinical pharmacists are crucial in preventing this disease, by ensuring adequate supplementation and monitoring of B12 and folic acid levels in patients taking medications known to cause megaloblastic anemia. The clinician needs to follow recommended treatment regimens and monitor serum levels for improvement to deter complications of this disease. A collaborative interprofessional team of clinicians, pharmacists, and nurses can help improve clinical outcomes in patients diagnosed with this disease.[Level 5]
