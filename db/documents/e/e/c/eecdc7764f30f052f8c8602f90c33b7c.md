A healthy endothelium is arranged at the posterior cornea in a single layer with a predictable hexagonal cellular configuration. In posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) the endothelial cells undergo an aberrant differentiation. There is a proliferation of metaplastic cells resulting in multiple layers of cells that manifest epithelium-like characteristics forming an anomalous collagenous layer. Scanning electron microscopy of corneal tissue demonstrates a transformation of the posterior corneal surface with degenerated endothelial cells, fibroblast-like cells, and stratified epithelial-like cells with numerous microvilli, keratin, and desmosomes. Like epithelium, these cells migrate across the Descemet membrane and, on occasion, across the trabecular meshwork and anterior iris surface. The thickened tissue has greater biomechanical resistance to outside force affecting corneal hysteresis
