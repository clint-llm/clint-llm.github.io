0.9% saline should be used with caution in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage or postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) as these conditions can themselves cause alterations in serum sodium concentration (hypo or hypernatremia).

Colloids such as hydroxyethyl starch (HES) should be avoided in septic shock because of their adverse effects on coagulation and renal function. A blinded, randomized, controlled trial of 800 severely septic intensive care unit (ICU) patients in Scandinavia found that 6% HES is associated with an increase in death at 90 days compared to Ringer’s acetate.

Intravenous albumin is contraindicated in patients with traumatic brain injury.
