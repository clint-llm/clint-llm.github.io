Migraine management requires the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists. When the clinician decides to implement migraine prophylaxis, the pharmacist should perform medication reconciliation and be available to recommend potential agents. The nurse can counsel the patient on administration and serve as a liaison between the prescriber and other healthcare team members. This interprofessional approach will yield optimal patient outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]

Around 18% of women and 6% of men in the United States suffer from migraine headaches, with an estimated total prevalence of around 16%. It is a common cause of emergency department and clinic visits and causes significant financial and health burdens. Less than 13% of migraine patients are believed to be on prophylactic therapy, whereas it is estimated that aroundÂ 38% of episodic migraine patients would actually benefit from prophylactic therapy. It is important to educate all headache patients about identifying their headache type and frequency. Simple strategies like maintaining a headache diary to help identify the frequency, severity, and triggers of headaches can help identify patients needing prophylactic treatment.
