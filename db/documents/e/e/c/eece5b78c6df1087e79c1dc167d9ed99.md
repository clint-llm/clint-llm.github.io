At the cellular level, the neuron is responsible for communication across the motor cortex. The neuron is composed of three main parts: dendrites, soma, and axon â€” other neurons signals which are received by the dendrites. The dendrite then transmits this signal to the cell body or soma. The soma contains the nucleus and axon hillock. The nucleus is responsible for creating all proteins and membranes that keep the neuron alive. The axon hillock is where the action protentional gets transmitted to the axon. The axon then delivers the action potential to the axon terminals, which synapse with the dendrites of other neurons. The motor cortex has somas that generate action potentials down to the spinal cord; this is called the upper motor neuron. The upper motor neuron communicates with the lower motor neuron via glutamate.
