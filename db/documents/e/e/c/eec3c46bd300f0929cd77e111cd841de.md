Depressive disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM–5) encompasses the diagnoses of major depressive disorder (MDD), disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), persistent depressive disorder--dysthymia--(PDD), and depression not otherwise specified. This article reviews major depressive disorder (MDD) in the pediatric population.

MDD is the first cause of disability among adolescents aged 10 to 19 years (WHO 2014). Suicide is the third cause of death in this age group, and adolescent depression is a major risk factor for suicide. Depressed adolescents experienced significantly more stressors during the year before onset when compared with a comparable 12-month period in normal controls.
