This activity describes indications and techniques of thyroidectomy and reviews the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo thyroidectomy. Partial or complete thyroidectomy is performed to relieve compressive symptoms of thyroid hypertrophy, prevent sequelae of thyroid carcinoma, and achieve hormonal control of hyperthyroidism. The main indications include symptomatic benign thyroid goiter, thyroid carcinoma, and hyperthyroidism refractory to medical therapy. Open approaches remain most common, although robotic approaches have been utilized successfully. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of thyroid nodules and highlights the role of the healthcare team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications of thyroidectomy.
- Review the management of benign and malignant thyroid disease.
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with thyroidectomy.
