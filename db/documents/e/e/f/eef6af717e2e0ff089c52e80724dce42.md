Histopathological evidence of vasculitis is the gold standard for confirmation of the diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis and other AAV. The most commonly sampled tissues are renal, skin, and lung tissue. Pulmonary findings in MPA are most commonly a form of diffuse capillaritis (distinguishing it from GPA, which characteristically shows granulomatous lesions). Skin biopsy yields acute or chronic leukocytoclastic vasculitis with neutrophilic infiltrate in the narrow caliber vessels of the superficial dermis. Renal biopsy most commonly varies from mild focal or segmental to diffuse necrotizing and sclerosing glomerulonephritis that shows minimal to no immune complex deposits on light and immunofluorescent microscopy ("pauci-immune").

The importance of renal biopsy lies in the fact that the severity of renal involvement on histopathological evaluation correlates clinically with disease activity.
