Kyrle disease is a rare skin condition classified as a subtype of acquired perforating dermatosis, along with reactive perforating collagenosis, elastosis perforans serpinginosa, and perforating folliculitis.

Kyrle disease most commonly manifests as multiple, discrete, eruptive papules with a central keratotic plug on the lower extremities. On histopathology, there is a characteristic transepidermal elimination of abnormal keratin.
