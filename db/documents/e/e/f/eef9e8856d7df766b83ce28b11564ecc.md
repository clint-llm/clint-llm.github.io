The muscle fibers of the popliteus originate from the lateral condyle of the femur and insert on the posterior surface of the tibia, superior to the soleal line. Cadaveric dissections have also revealed fibers originating from the styloid portion of the fibular head and running obliquely, blending with the main muscular structure. The popliteus is a capsular structure, although extra-articular, and separates the lateral meniscus from the lateral collateral ligament.

The popliteus also assists in knee flexion. Its function is dependent on whether the lower extremity is in a weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing state; it is considered the primary internal rotator of the tibia in the non-weight-bearing state.

There are attachments between the popliteus and the lateral meniscus. When the knee motions into flexion, the popliteus retracts the lateral meniscus posteriorly to avoid becoming entrapped between the femur and tibia.
