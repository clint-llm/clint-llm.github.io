Methohexital produces its effect by potentiating the inhibitory actions of GABA on the GABA (A) receptor. At higher concentrations, methohexital directly stimulates and activates the receptor. Barbiturates bind to the GABA A receptor and increase the open duration of the GABA A receptor without having any effect on channel opening frequency or conductance. Specifically, the downstream effect is on the chloride channel, causing it to stay open longer, causing influx. This action causes inhibitory pathways to activate in the brain and causes decreased neuronal excitability, thus inducing anesthesia/sedation.

Methohexital is a derivative from barbituric acid, which is a compound made of malonic acid and urea. The chemical formula for methohexital is 1-methyl-2-pentynyl barbituric acid. The acyclic side chain at the fifth Carbon of the benzene ring is responsible for the hypnotic activity attributed to this compound. Also, compared to barbituric acid, the nitrogen on methohexital is methylated, which does cause some excitatory effects but produces the rapid onset and short duration of action, making this drug so clinically useful.
