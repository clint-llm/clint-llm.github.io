Back pain is one of the most common causes for patients to seek emergency care. It has a broad range of potential etiologies for both adult and pediatric populations. The etiologies differ depending on the patient population, but most commonly, it is mechanical or non-specific. Back pain causes significant rates of disability and can be a problem that persists from childhood into adulthood. It is essential to be able to evaluate patients of all ages and recognize the unique differences in the presentation in these different populations. Knowing the typical red flags of back pain in both children and adults can guide the provider to appropriate evaluation and treatment. This activity describes the assessment, diagnosis, and management of low back pain and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.
