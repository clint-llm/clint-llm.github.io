- Do not actively engage pit vipers. A significant number of cases are preventable if people give pit vipers space to escape and are do not handle them.

- Maintain situational awareness in settings where pit vipers live and hunt. It is possible to encounter pit vipers in many parts of the US. However, they are less common in densely populated areas. If planning a trip into sparsely populated areas, it is prudent to review local dangerous flora and fauna.

- Medical attention should be sought immediately for any snakebite as their evaluation will be inadequate outside of a medical setting. Lack of immediate symptoms does not guarantee a dry bite, and serious sequelae may take several hours to develop.

- As stated before, no attempt to kill or capture the snake should occur. If it can be safely managed, a picture is usually sufficient for identification.

- Many contraindicated treatments persist as common practice among the lay-public despite convincing evidence that they, at best, do not work and are more likely to cause additional harm. Patients should be counseled not to perform any contraindicated treatments such as cutting, suction, electricity, ice, or tourniquets.
