Small variations in laryngeal musculature can affect voice quality and tone. The differences in voice quality are apparent between male and female larynxes. In males, testosterone thickens the vocal ligaments, causing deeper voice quality. The strength and fine control of the muscles is acquirable from use. Singers can gain improved fine motor control over their intrinsic muscles through years of practice to better modulate pitch. Though anatomic variations can exist in the musculature, cartilaginous variations are more frequent with the thyroid cartilage most commonly affected.

While the innervation of laryngeal muscles frequently appears as described above, variations in innervation are common in the larynx. Often, the superior laryngeal nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerve branches will form a plexus, and aberrant branches will provide motor innervation to nearby muscles.
