Acute cobalt toxicity is rare and will most likely occur via ingestion. As with most heavy metals, the presenting symptoms usually consist of GI distress, which possesses a significant differential. Without appropriate history, diagnosis of cobalt poisoning may be difficult.****Additionally, poisonings with other metals can also result in similar symptoms, which highlights the importance of a detailed history.

In the appropriate work setting, such as tungsten carbide manufacturing, a patient presenting for evaluation of respiratory complaints, pneumoconiosis should be high on the differential. On the list of potential causes, cobalt or hard metal disease should be included. The occupational history will help to quickly narrow the potential etiology. In a patient presenting with polycythemia or goiter, exposure to cobalt salts should be considered.

Cardiomyopathy has a broad differential, but a surgical history of hip arthroplasty should raise suspicion of potential cobalt toxicity. Further investigation into the type of implant the patient has should be performed to aid in diagnostics.
