According to the most recent American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines published in 2017, initial evaluation of any woman presenting for surgical correction of SUI should include a focused history and physical exam with thorough pelvic examination, urinalysis, and assessment of postvoid residual urine volume. The focused history includes an assessment of bother which can be done via validated questionnaires. During the pelvic examination, the patient must be able to demonstrate SUI with a comfortably full bladder via a Valsalva stress test or cough.

During informed consent, patients need to be counseled about the general risks of surgery and the specific complications of sling placement. Patient awareness of the potential dangers of synthetic mesh placement has increased due to increased media attention. Therefore, it is imperative to counsel women on the potentially serious complications, and the permanent nature of a synthetic mesh is being used for the procedure. After sling placement, the risks of voiding dysfunction must be discussed, including new-onset urgency, frequency, and urinary retention.

The AUA best practice policy statement on antimicrobial prophylaxis published in 2019 recommends a single preoperative dose of 1st or 2nd generation cephalosporins for all urethral sling procedures.
