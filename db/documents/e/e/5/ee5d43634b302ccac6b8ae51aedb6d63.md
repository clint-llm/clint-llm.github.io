Arterial catheterization is a procedure that carries the risk of serious complications. Prevention of adverse events is facilitated by understanding the contraindications to the procedure. These contraindications include but are not limited to:

- Peripheral or distal arterial insufficiency

- Peripheral arterial vascular diseases, including the small-to-medium vasculitides

- A lack of collateral circulation due to anatomical anomalies, such as the congenital absence of the ulnar artery

- Infection at the catheter insertion site

Clinical conditions that are not necessarily contraindications to arterial catheterization but require special consideration include hypercoagulable and anticoagulated states, burns, and surgical interventions at the insertion site.
