Distal clavicular osteolysis (DCO) is an atypical injury occurring most often in athletes and weight lifters, specifically those who perform repetitive overhead movements. The clavicle spans two of the four joints of the shoulder. The proximal clavicle interfaces with the sternum at the sternoclavicular (SC) joint, and the distal clavicle adjoins the acromion process to make the acromioclavicular (AC) joint. The AC joint receives its static stability from the AC joint capsule (AC ligaments) and the coracoclavicular ligaments; its dynamic stability from the deltoid and trapezius muscles.

Distal clavicular osteolysis results from repetitive excess load to the AC joint, typically through horizontal adduction, adduction, internal rotation, and forward/lateral flexion of the shoulder, such as bench pressing or overhead lifting. In theory, this repetitive loading causes micro-trauma to the subchondral bone of the distal clavicular head, resulting in subchondral cystic changes, disruption of the articular cartilage, and metaplastic bone formation with increased osteoclastic activity.

Cessation of weight lifting or other inciting activities may alleviate symptoms. Some therapies have shown promise to decrease pain and improve function.
