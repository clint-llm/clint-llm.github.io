Duodenal ulcers are part of a broader disease state categorized as peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcer disease refers to the clinical presentation and disease state that occurs when there is a disruption in the mucosal surface at the level of the stomach or first part of the small intestine, the duodenum. Anatomically, both the gastric and duodenal surfaces contain a defense system that includes pre-epithelial, epithelial, and subepithelial elements. Ulceration occurs from damage to the mucosal surface that extends beyond the superficial layer. While the majority of duodenal ulcers present with dyspepsia as the primary associated symptom, the presentation can range in levels of severity, including gastrointestinal bleeding, gastric outlet obstruction, perforation, or fistula development. The management, therefore, is highly dependent on the patient's presentation at the time of diagnosis or progression of the disease. Â The diagnosis of duodenal vs. gastric ulcer merits consideration in patients with symptoms of dyspepsia/upper abdominal pain who also report a history of NSAID use or previous Helicobacter pylori diagnosis. Any patient who has been diagnosed with peptic ulcer disease and, most specifically, duodenal ulcer should undergo testing for H. pylori as this has been found to be a common cause.
