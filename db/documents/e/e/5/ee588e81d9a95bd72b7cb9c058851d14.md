Most congenital hearing loss in children is potentially identifiable through newborn and infant hearing screening. Nonetheless, some congenital hearing loss may not be identified until late childhood.

According to the European Group on Genetics of Hearing Impairment, some degree of hearing loss is present in 1 to 6 per 1000 newborn infants, which are greater than another incidence of diseases seen at birth.

The American Academy of Pediatrics ratifies the universal goal of hearing loss detection in infants before three months of age, with prompt and appropriate intervention no longer than six months of age; this has been one part of a comprehensive Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) program of service.

Unfortunately, the newborn hearing screening test has not been implemented universally to all newborns, especially in rural parts of developing countries, which lacked the necessary equipment. Moreover, the lack of parents' awareness in a rural area regarding the importance of hearing tests probably contributes to these drawbacks. Thus, these have been significant challenges for the actualization of the set goals. Therefore, in regions where the newborn hearing screening has not been implemented, the hearing test equipment should be provided, and the parents' awareness and knowledge towards the consequences or sequels of the delayed diagnosis have to be enhanced.
