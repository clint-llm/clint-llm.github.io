Felodipine is an agent in the dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers. Felodipine is FDA approved and indicated in the treatment of essential hypertension. Reduction in blood pressure lowers the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The most significant benefit of the antihypertensive effect of felodipine is a decrease in the incidence of stroke. In patients presenting with mild to moderate hypertension, felodipine ER monotherapy is equivalent in efficacy to cardio-selective beta-blockers, thiazide diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and other calcium channel antagonists. In patients with severe hypertension uncontrolled by beta-blockers and diuretics, felodipine ER can be an add-on therapy.

Non-FDA approved uses of felodipine:

- Renovascular hypertension

- Pulmonary hypertension

- Chronic stable angina pectoris

- Congestive heart failure

- Prevention of the decline in renal function caused by calcineurin inhibitors in lung transplantation patients

- In preclinical studies,  felodipine shows promising results in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. However, research is needed before using felodipine to prevent bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in humans.
