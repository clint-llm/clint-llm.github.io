GHB is endogenously found in the brain and is a precursor of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It acts on both GABA-B and GHB receptors. GHB has a biphasic effect on dopamine. Lower doses stimulate dopamine release by binding GHB receptors. Higher doses initially inhibit dopamine release via agonist effects on GABA-B receptors, leading to neuro-inhibition and central nervous system (CNS) depression, but after that increase dopamine release via the GHB receptor. While this accounts for both the sedative and excitatory effects of GHB, the mainstay of GHB toxicity is central nervous system and respiratory depression.

Gamma-butyrolactone and 1,4-butanediol, previously sold as industrial solvents or dietary supplements, are GHB substitutes that rapidly convert to GHB following oral ingestion, thereby producing the same clinical effects of GHB toxicity.
