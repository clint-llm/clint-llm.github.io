Patients diagnosed with osteoporosis should be treated by primary care physicians (PCP), but also consider getting a consultation with specialists like endocrinologists or rheumatologists.

Depending on the cause of the secondary osteoporosis, all patients will benefit from being seen by a specialist who has expertise in the treatment of the primary cause of their problem. For example, cancer patients should be managed by oncologists, patients with HIV by infectious disease specialists, patients with malabsorption problems by a gastroenterologist, etc.

If complications of fractures are developed, orthopedic surgeons will need to be involved in the care of the patient until the fracture is healed, but PCPs and other specialists will need to follow up with the patient's care for treating the osteoporosis and also address all secondary causes of the bone loss to prevent further fractures from re-occurring.
