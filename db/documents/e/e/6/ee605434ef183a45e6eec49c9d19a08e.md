Thumb spica splints can extend from the thumb to mid-forearm or from thumb to above the elbow. In the setting of a scaphoid fracture, the use of a long-arm thumb spica splint may lead to shorter unions times in the first 4 to 6 weeks and diminish the shearing forces from the radius and ulna on the scaphoid.

It is vital that the splint allows for balanced function and maximal mobility of the unaffected areas such as the fingers, upper arm, and shoulder. The splint should also allow for maximal sensory perception, and the pressure of the splint should be distributed equally. The splint should not challenge the normal contours of the hand and forearm. If needed, the patient should have adequate analgesia before and alongside the splinting process.
