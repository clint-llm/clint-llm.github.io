**Factors Implicated in the Pathogenesis of Mycotic Aneurysms**

- **Bacteremia:**Pre-existing vessel injury predisposes to infection of intima due to bacterial seeding. This is common in older age due to pre-existing atherosclerosis or aneurysm, which predisposes to infection during severe infection or sepsis. Aorta is the most common location due to the high prevalence of atherosclerosis and aneurysm.

- **Local Injury and Bacterial Inoculation:**Vascular injury resulting from IV drug abuse, trauma, or iatrogenic causes like percutaneous intervention, can inoculate bacteria into the vascular wall. This is commonly seen in arteries of extremities like femoral, common iliac, or subclavian and carotid arteries.

- **Local Spread:**Extention of infection to local arteries can result in subsequent arterial inflammation, seen in vertebral osteomyelitis and intra-abdominal pathologies like appendicitis, pyelonephritis, and cholecystitis.

- **Septic Emboli:**Infective endocarditis is associated with emboli in vasa vasorum resulting in inflammation of vascular wall and subsequent mycotic aneurysm. These emboli tend to be multifocal and involve the intracranial arteries at branch points.
