The placenta is obtained after elective cesarean section from mothers who have been tested negative for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen), HCV (hepatitis C virus), syphilis, and during the COVID era, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). The placenta is taken under a laminar flow hood with all sterile precautions. Blood clots are removed by rinsing it with a balanced salt solution (BSS), which contains 100 µg/ml of neomycin, 50 µg/ml of streptomycin, 50 µg/ml of penicillin, and 2.5 µg/ml of amphotericin B.

Separation of the amniotic membrane from the chorion is performed by blunt dissection. It is then placed on nitrocellulose paper with the epithelial surface up.
