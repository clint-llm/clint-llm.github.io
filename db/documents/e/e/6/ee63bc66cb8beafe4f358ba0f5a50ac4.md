PHACE syndrome should be suspected in the presence of cervicofacial infantile hemangioma over 5cm in size, and a systemic evaluation is required. Thus, history taking and careful physical examination are necessary. Imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck should be ordered if PS is suspected. Moreover, an ophthalmic evaluation should be performed to look for eye abnormalities associated with PS. Also, an echocardiogram should be performed looking for heart and aortic abnormalities.

PS can be suspected during pregnancy. Antenatal ultrasound screening can detect abnormalities of the posterior fossa, and therefore an MRI is recommended to assess the diagnosis in the antenatal period.

an interprofessional group of specialists has established the 2009 diagnostic criteria, which had an update in 2016. The diagnostic basis of definite PS is the presence of a facial hemangioma more than 5 cm with one major criterion or two minor criteria. Possible PS requires the presence of cervicofacial hemangioma with one minor criterion.

Major criteria:

- Arterial: anomalies of major cerebral or cervical arteries, stenosis, occlusion, dysplasia, hypoplasia, persistent carotid-vertebrobasilar anastomosis

- Structural brain: posterior fossa anomalies: Danky-Walker complex, unilateral or bilateral cerebral dysplasia or hypoplasia

- Cardiovascular: aortic arch anomalies, aneurysm, an aberrant origin of the subclavian artery

- Ocular: posterior segment anomaly, retinal vascular anomalies

- Ventral or midline: sternal defect, sternal cleft

Minor criteria:

- Arterial: aneurysm of cerebral arteries

- Structural brain: midline anomaly, malformation of cortical development, neuronal migration disorder

- Cardiovascular: ventricular septal defect, right aortic arch

- Ocular: anterior segment anomalies, cataract, sclerocornea, microphthalmia

- Ventral or midline: hypopituitarism, ectopic thyroid, midline sternal papule
