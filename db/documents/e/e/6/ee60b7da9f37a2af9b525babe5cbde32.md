The recommended treatment for schistosomiasis is the anthelminthic praziquantel, dosing regimens vary:

- 40 mg/kg given as a single dose,

or

- 20 mg/kg every 4-6 hours for three doses

Praziquantel in these dosages effectively kills adult worms and prevents the release of eggs and the development of new urogenital lesions.  As it is primarily effective against adult worms, treatment is best initiated at least four to six weeks post-exposure.

While some resistance has been noted in other species of Schistosoma, it has been minimal in S. haematobium. Praziquantel is generally safe in pregnancy, rated category B.

If there is one documented case of urogenital schistosomiasis, there are likely many other individuals that use the same water source that are affected. Mass treatment regimens have been undertaken in multiple communities and countries with significant success. In 1997, Egypt launched a Praziquantel mass treatment program.  Before treatment, the studied villages had prevalence ranging from greater than 30% to 10% to 20%; following treatment prevalence had decreased to less than 3% in the vast majority.
