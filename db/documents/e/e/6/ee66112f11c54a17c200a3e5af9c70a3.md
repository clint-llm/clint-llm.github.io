Untreated cervical spondylotic myelopathy may manifest as a slow progression of worsening gait, upper and lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and pain.

Prompt identification of MSCC is crucial to attaining a favorable neurologic outcome. Multiple studies have shown that pretreatment neurologic deficits and duration of symptoms are important prognostic indicators for the preservation of ambulatory function. Accordingly, severe (1 to 2 out of 5 on motor strength testing) weakness and inability to ambulate for more than 48 hours before diagnosis are both associated with poor neurologic outcomes.

Approximately 5% of patients with SEA die from sepsis or other complications.
