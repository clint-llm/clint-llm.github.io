Many other diseases may present with a similar end-stage as atrophie blanche. The causes of atrophie blanche-like lesions include cutaneous small-vessel vasculitis, hydroxyurea-related ulcers, sickle cell disease, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. These other disorders can be distinguished from atrophie blanche as the history will lack preceding punched-out ulceration.
