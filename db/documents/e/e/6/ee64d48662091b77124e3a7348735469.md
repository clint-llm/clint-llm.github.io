**Nonopioid analgesic agents
**

- **Acetaminophen (paracetamol)**: This drug is a safe and effective medication when used correctly. Documented adverse effects depend on the route of administration. If administered orally or rectally, acetaminophen may cause any of the following:
- Rash or hypersensitivity reactions (toxic epidermal necrolysis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome)
- Hematological: anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, pancytopenia
- Nephrotoxicity
- Metabolic and electrolyte disorders

- Decreased serum bicarbonate
- Hyponatremia
- Hypocalcemia
- Hyperammonemia
- Hyperchloremia
- Hyperuricemia
- Hyperglycemia
- Hyperbilirubinemia
- Elevated alkaline phosphatase

If administered intravenously, adverse effects include nausea, vomiting, pruritus, constipation, and abdominal pain.

- **Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)**
- Gastrointestinal: Nausea, anorexia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, ulcers, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, perforation, constipation, diarrhea
- Cardiovascular: Hypertension, decreased effectiveness of anti-hypertensive medications, myocardial infarction, stroke, and thromboembolic events (last three with selective COX-2 inhibitors); inhibit platelet activation, propensity for bruising, and hemorrhage.
- Renal: Salt and water retention, deterioration of kidney function, edema, decreased effectiveness of diuretic medications, decreased urate excretion, hyperkalemia, analgesic nephropathy
- Central nervous system: Headache, dizziness, vertigo, confusion, depression, lowering of seizure threshold, hyperventilation (salicylates)
- Hypersensitivity: Vasomotor rhinitis, asthma, urticaria, flushing, hypotension, shock.
- Hepatotoxicity

For a complete list of adverse effects for a particular NSAID, please see the StatPearls article for the specific drug.

- **Antidepressant medications**
- Amitriptyline: Altered mental status, arrhythmias, constipation, decreased libido, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, headache, hyperhidrosis, increased risk of suicidal thoughts, micturition disorders (i.e., urinary retention), nausea, orthostatic hypotension, tremor, weight gain.
- Duloxetine: Nausea, headache, dry mouth, somnolence, dizziness, abdominal pain, constipation increased blood pressure, increased risk of suicidal thoughts.

- **Antiepileptic medications**
- Gabapentin: The most common side effects are dizziness, somnolence, ataxia, peripheral edema, and confusion. Among other, more serious adverse effects are anaphylaxis, suicidality, depression, fever, infection, steven-Johnson syndrome, angioedema, erythema multiforme, and rhabdomyolysis.
- Pregabalin: Dizziness, somnolence, headache, peripheral edema, nausea, weight gain, disorientation, blurred vision, increased risk of suicidal thoughts.

- **Local anesthetics**
- Lidocaine: Application-site pain, pruritus, erythema, and skin irritation.

**Opioid agents**

Opioids produce a variety of different systemic adverse effects, including:

- Dysphoria/euphoria

- Sedation,

- Constipation

- Nausea and vomiting

- Cough suppression

- Miosis

- Histamine release (urticaria, pruritus, hypotension, tachycardia)

- Endocrine systems suppression

- Cardiovascular disorders (i.e., bradycardia)

- Respiratory depression

- Skeletal muscle rigidity

- Tolerance (chronic application)

- Physical dependence (chronic application)

- Opioid-induced hyperalgesia and/or allodynia (chronic application)
