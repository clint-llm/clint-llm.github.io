Investigations should be directed towards establishing CAT in the patient and identifying the source of arsenic exposure.

- Estimation of arsenic concentration in drinking water/well water- An acid-washed plastic container is used to collect at least 50ml of water to be tested. WHO has set a provisional guideline value of 10 mcg/L for the maximum permissible concentration of arsenic in drinking water.

- Estimation of arsenic concentration in urine- It is an indicator of recent exposure to arsenic and should be ideally done in a 24-hour urine collection. An easier alternative is to test a spot urine sample or the first-morning urine sample. Both methods are comparable as the arsenic excreted remains stable throughout the day. Seafood containing the non-toxic organic form of arsenic should be avoided for at least four days prior to testing, as it can make the results unreliable. A concentration of more than 50 mcg/L proves recent exposure to arsenic.

- Estimation of arsenic concentration in hairs and nails- After using arsenic-free shampoo to wash hair and ensuring that the patient has not used any coloring agent, 30 hairs of 6 cm length from females and 60 hairs with the base from males are collected and tested. Nail clippings are taken from all fingernails and toenails. A concentration of arsenic more than 1 mg/kg of dry hair and more than 1.5 mg/kg of the nail indicates arsenic exposure in the preceding 9 months.

- Estimation of arsenic concentration in suspected sources like medications or pesticides by using atomic absorption spectrometry, calorimetric method, spectrophotometry, etc.

- Histopathological examination of the keratotic skin lesions is done to look for malignant transformation but has little role in the conformation of the diagnosis.

Estimation of arsenic concentration in drinking water is usually the first step in the evaluation of CAT. However, in clinical scenarios where drinking water data is unreliable, like in the case of a migratory population, the patient's biological sample analysis is crucial in establishing the diagnosis.
