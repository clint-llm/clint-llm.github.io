The term dissociated vertical deviation (DVD) was coined by Bielschowsky. DVD has also been referred to as “alternating hyperphoria,” “double hyperphoria,” “occlusion hyperphoria,” “occlusion hypertropia,” “periodic vertical deviation,” “alternating sursum-duction,” “double dissociated hyperphoria,” “dissociated hypertropia,” and “dissociated vertical divergence.” DVD is classically defined as vertical drifting of one eye when the patient fixates at a target with the other eye.

This usually manifests when there is a mechanical, optical, or sensory interruption of the binocular visual input. The DVD syndrome encompasses three components: hyper deviation, abduction, and excyclotorsion. The deviation may manifest spontaneously when the patient is fatigued or daydreaming or be latent, which manifests only on cover uncover or alternate cover tests. An interesting finding to note is that as the uncovered/deviated eye shifts downwards to take up the fixation, the eye fixing earlier does not show a corresponding downward shift, thus violating Herring’s law.
