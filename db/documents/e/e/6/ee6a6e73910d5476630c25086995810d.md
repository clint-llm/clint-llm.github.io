Clostridium tetani is the causative organism for the disease process known as tetanus. Clostridia are anaerobic organisms with at least 209 species and five subspecies. Clostridium tetani is one of the 4 most well-known exotoxin producing pathogens within this category. Although widespread vaccination efforts have reduced the public health threat, tetanus is a potentially fatal condition. Thus, it is important to recognize the typical clinical presentation, immediate management, and treatment of C. tetani infection.

Tetanus is a serious life-threatening disorder that presents with painful muscular spasms and hypertonia. Despite widespread vaccination in the US, the disorder still occurs. Tetanus is classified into four categories; localized, generalized, neonatal, and cephalic. The severity of the illness is dependent on the amount of toxin that reaches the central nervous system.
