There are a number of complications that can occur following the transfer of a rotational flap. Most complications can be avoided with cautious planning and sound technique. Excessive tension at the time of closure or wound contracture post-operatively can result in distortion of surrounding tissue. Rotation flaps that do not properly distribute tension vectors can distort sensitive structures such as the eyelids or the lips, producing ectropion or eclabium.

Transferring that flap can result in trapdoor deformity or pincushioning if a flap is not sized correctly compared to the defect. A trapdoor deformity makes the healed flap appear as a depressed area compared to the surrounding tissue. This occurs when there is a lack of supporting tissue under the flap or when the flap is thinned too aggressively. Pincushioning, on the other hand, presents with a noticeably raised flap compared to the surrounding tissue. This occurs when there is excess tissue due to too much thickness or if an oversized flap was not adequately trimmed to fit into the defect.

Flap necrosis results from ischemia of the distal end of the flap due to impaired blood flow. Blood flow within a flap can be compromised by making the pedicle too narrow to support the flap or by making the flap too thin and disrupting the blood supply. Flap necrosis can present as epidermal sloughing or a dark eschar. It is difficult to assess how much of the flap is viable when an eschar is present, but it is imperative to avoid debriding the area until the wound has healed. In some cases, only the epidermal portion of the flap necroses, and debriding the flap can disrupt underlying viable tissue. Even in cases of the flap has necrosis, the eschar over the wound will act as a biologic dressing that will allow the wound to heal by secondary intention.

As with any surgery, wound infection is a potential complication with rotational flap transfer. If a surgical site infection is suspected, the wound should be cultured, and the patient should be given an antibiotic with staphylococcal coverage until a culture and sensitivity are available. If there is a significant amount of purulent drainage, the wound may need to be opened, cleaned, and all foreign material, such as sutures, removed.

Dehiscence can occur as a result of excessive tension or from an infection. If a wound dehisces within 24 hours after surgery, another closure can be attempted; however, closures after this time may increase the risk of infection. Typically, dehisced wounds are allowed to heal by secondary intention, with revision considered after the wound has healed.

Bleeding is another potential complication. Fortunately, most cases can be controlled with firm, continuous pressure. In some instances, it may be necessary to reopen the wound to stop the bleeding. Bleeding can also result in hematoma formation. Stable hematomas can be drained or allowed to reabsorb over time. Hematomas may act as a nidus for infection, though, so antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered. Expanding hematomas should be treated by reopening the wound to evacuate the hematoma and stop any bleeding, putting pressure on the flap's pedicle and compromising its blood supply.
