Nocardia has low virulence, and so clinically significant disease occurs in patients with immunosuppression or weak immune systems. The virulence factors of Nocardia are the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase, which inactivates reactive oxygen species toxic to the bacteria produced by neutrophils.Nocardia infections. Nocardia also has “cord factor” similar to Mycobacterium tuberculosis preventing the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes.
