ECG is used to determine if a second-degree AV block is present. If ischemia is suspected based on the clinical picture and/or ECG findings, then cardiac biomarkers and chest radiography may be indicated. Serum electrolytes, calcium, and magnesium should be checked. If a patient is on digoxin, a level should be obtained to evaluate for toxicity. Routine imaging is not required for initial evaluation of second-degree atrioventricular block.

Electrophysiologic testing is sometimes done to determine the level of the block and the need for a pacemaker.
