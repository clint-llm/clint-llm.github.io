Evaluation for localized prostate cancer most commonly involves a serum PSA level, digital rectal examination (DRE), multiparametric MRI (mpMRI), and needle prostate biopsy. It is relatively rare nowadays for localized prostate cancer to be diagnosed incidentally during treatment for BPH (e.g., transurethral resection chippings) and during an investigation for other symptoms, e.g., as a hot spot in the prostate on PET scanning. Approximately 10% of prostates removed during the course of a cystoprostatectomy for high-grade bladder urothelial cancer will have foci of prostate cancer, that will precipitate further investigation. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing is widely carried out in the context of case-finding for prostate cancer, yet remains highly controversial as a screening modality.

There is strong evidence showing that PSA screening increases the detection of prostate cancer, in particular localized disease, by approximately 30%. Despite this, meta-analyses of the international data have demonstrated no apparent impact on overall survival.

Diagnosis of cases that are unlikely to progress in a man's lifetime to significant clinical illness has been termed 'over-diagnosis.' The rationale is that treatment of the condition will not benefit the man and therefore represents overtreatment of a screen-detected condition. The process of diagnosis (e.g., biopsy) has appreciable morbidity, and indeed mortality and all conventional treatments for prostate cancer have adverse events that have a negative impact on the quality of life.

Overall, these risk-benefit considerations have led to recommendations against routine PSA testing in the US and in Europe. The current American Cancer Society Guidelines for targeted prostate cancer screening are as follows:

PSA +/- DRE is offered to the following groups of patients, only after providing information on the risks, benefits, and uncertainties of prostate cancer screening and if they have a life expectancy > 10 years;

- Men aged ≥50

- Men aged ≥45 with a high risk of prostate cancer (African-American or father/brother diagnosed before age 65)

- Men aged ≥40 with significantly higher risk (multiple relatives diagnosed before age 65)

The PSA threshold for further investigation varies between 3.0 (Europe) and 4.0 (US). PSA levels are influenced by sexual activity, prostatic manipulation, UTI, BPH, and vigorous exercise in addition to PSA protein instability and assay characteristics. Men with a borderline PSA result are commonly offered a repeat PSA level a few weeks later with advice to avoid sexual activity and vigorous exercise for 48-72 hrs prior to the repeat test.

Patients are commonly offered DRE alongside PSA testing. A suspicious DRE alone, even in the context of a low PSA, should prompt further investigation as approximately 20% of localized cancers occur without an elevated PSA level.

Currently, following PSA and DRE, multiparametric MRI scanning (mpMRI) or biparametric MRI is offered.  MpMRI combines anatomical and functional information using T1 and T2-weighted sequences, dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). The subsequent images are scored by an experienced urological radiologist using, for example, the Likert or PI-RADS system.

Likert can be used in detection, active-surveillance, post-treatment, and reoccurrence. It utilizes non-pre-specified imaging features and relies on user experience to be interpreted well. PI-RADS can be used in detection only. It utilizes pre-specified imaging features and is less dependent on reader experience. Likert may be more accurate when used by experienced urological radiologists. Both systems produce a score between 1 and 5, with a higher score indicating a higher likelihood of cancer being detected on biopsy. In most centers, a score of ≥3 will prompt a biopsy. In men with more than one risk factor (e.g., strong family history and high PSA density), a systematic biopsy might be recommended with a 'normal' MRI scan.

Prior to mpMRI, many men underwent unnecessary biopsy as they had a clinically insignificant disease. The introduction of mpMRI as an initial investigation can potentially avoid biopsy in 25% of men with an elevated PSA at the risk of missing approximately 3% to 5% of cases.

For definitive prostate cancer diagnosis, a positive needle biopsy typically using an 18G needle is carried out, most commonly under local anesthetic. Different strategies to biopsy, as well as different targetting modalities, can be used. A targetted biopsy can be obtained using real-time in-bore biopsy during the MRI scan. More commonly, either cognitive or fusion targetting using the saved MRI image with the real-time transrectal ultrasound image is employed, with the needle deployed either transrectally or transperineally. Transrectal Ultrasound-Guided (TRUS) biopsy remains the most common technique, but Transperineal (TP) biopsy is growing in popularity, with usage varying across centers. The advantages of TP biopsy include a lower post-biopsy sepsis rate and the ability to sample tissue within the anterior of the prostate gland, which is often missed by TRUS biopsy. The disadvantages include increased discomfort and analgesic requirements, increased urinary retention rates, and a higher risk of post-biopsy erectile dysfunction. When compared with TRUS,  there is no difference in the incidence of hematuria, hemoejaculate, or 30-day mortality with TP biopsies, and currently a paucity of high-quality evidence for global adoption of TP sampling in Europe or America.

Systematic sampling taking a minimum of ten cores (usually 10-12) from representative areas of the peripheral zones of the prostate, in addition to targetted sampling, results in a higher yield of significant prostate cancer. There is, however, a higher risk of detecting incidental non-clinically significant disease. Patients undergoing biopsy should receive prophylactic antibiotics. It is important for patients to be warned about the risks above, including the most usual post-procedural hemoejaculate (>90%), hematuria (>80%), and rectal bleeding (>20%), usually lasting for 1-2 days, but can be prolonged for a week or two, particularly blood in the semen which can often take many weeks to clear.

Following the biopsy, prostate cancer is risk-stratified to determine the necessity for further investigations and decide on initial management. This includes PSA, grade group (table 2), and stage :

- Low risk - PSA < 10ng/ml and stage T1-T2a and grade group 1.

- High risk - PSA > 20 or grade group 4-5.

- Intermediate risk constitutes a variety of combinations falling between low and high risk.

All patients with high-risk cancer should complete staging examinations looking for metastatic disease with a bone scan and cross-sectional abdominopelvic imaging.
