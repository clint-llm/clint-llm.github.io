Factor V is a glycoprotein that contributes to both procoagulant and anticoagulant function. This function is determined by which enzymes are present that can modify factor V. Factor V gets modified by activated factor X, thrombin, and activated protein C (aPC). Factor V plays a part in the common pathway of the coagulation cascade. In the coagulation cascade, factor V forms a prothrombinase complex with factor X. This prothrombinase complex aids in developing a fibrin and platelet clot and helps to stop bleeding.
