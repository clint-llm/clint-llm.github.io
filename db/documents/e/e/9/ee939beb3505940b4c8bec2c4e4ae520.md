Issues of concern related to progesterone can lead to:

- Menstrual irregularities

- Miscarriage and early labor

- Decreased fertility

- Granulosa cell tumor

- Breast cancer

Progesterone plays a vital role in the maintenance of the uterus during pregnancy. As such, an important issue of concern regarding the loss of this steroid hormone correlates with miscarriage and pre-term labor. One of the primary responsibilities of progesterone throughout pregnancy is to maintain a decreased level of vascular tone in the myometrium. Progesterone also influences the production of inflammatory mediators, such as human T-cells within the uterine cavity. Thus, a loss of progesterone leads to an increase in myometrial contractility coupled with a decrease in fighting off immunologic threats, ultimately leading to a higher risk of miscarriage and early delivery of the fetus.

In contrast to deficiencies of progesterone, pathologies that pertain to excessive quantities of progesterone such as granulosa cell tumors and breast cancer are also areas of concern. The sex cord gives rise to granulosa cells, which regulate their effects through various signaling pathways. Granulosa cell tumors have shown to secrete high levels of estrogen and progesterone. These tumors also display high expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors.
