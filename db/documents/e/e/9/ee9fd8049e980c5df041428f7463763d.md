Dens evaginatus/talon cusps are likely incidental findings during routine dental examinations. In cases where the outgrowth is less severe, patients may not even be aware of their presence. If patients have issues with the extra tooth structure, a multidisciplinary approach should be utilized for treatment.

Dens invaginatus is likely an incidental finding during a routine dental examination. In less severe cases, patients may be unaware of the presence of an in-folding in the surface of their tooth, while in more severe cases, patients may complain of pain or discomfort in the area, as these teeth can be more prone to trauma or sensitivity. Radiographic evaluation, ideally with a CBCT, should be utilized to determine the extent of the invagination, as the severity of the condition will dictate treatment.

Amelogenesis imperfecta is commonly identified on clinical examination. With this being an inherited condition, family history, clinical observation, and recording of any developmental disturbances will aid in diagnosis.

Dentinogenesis imperfecta is identified on clinical examination. Teeth appear amber, brown/blue, or opalescent brown in color, depending on the extent of the dysplastic dentin.
