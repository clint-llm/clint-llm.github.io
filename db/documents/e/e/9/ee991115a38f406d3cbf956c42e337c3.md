Diphtheria is a potentially fatal infection with a fatality rate ranging from 5Â to 17%.

The involvement of multiple subspecialties, including cardiologists, nephrologists, neurologists, infectious disease specialists, surgeons, is necessary to improve the prognosis of the disease. Likewise, physiotherapists and rehabilitation therapists play a crucial role in the recovery of a patient with neurological complications. Ensuring adequate immunization status by a provider can serve as effective prevention from contracting the disease in the first place, which can significantly reduce the burden of disease in a population. Nontoxigenic strains of C. diphtheria, though previously considered as non-virulent, now emerges as an essential cause of endocarditis and pharyngitis. Hence the providers must diagnose and treat the condition at the earliest.
