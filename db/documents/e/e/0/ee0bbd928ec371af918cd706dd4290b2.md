While the goal of preventing preterm birth altogether continues to be investigated, RDS can be reduced by the administration of antenatal corticosteroids. Administration of antenatal corticosteroids significantly reduces the incidence of RDS and the need for mechanical ventilation. The use of antenatal corticosteroids decreased the incidence of RDS in a review of 21 studies and 4083 infants with a reduction in neonatal and fetal death in a review of 3627 infants in 13 studies.

The beneficial effect of antenatal corticosteroid use after 34 weeks of gestation is controversial due to the lack of information in long term developmental outcomes.
