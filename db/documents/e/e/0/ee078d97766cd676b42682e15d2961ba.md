There are no absolute contraindications to trephination; however, in some situations, patients may have better cosmetic outcomes with nail removal and nail bed repair. Subungal hematoma with associated avulsion of the nail, a displaced distal phalanx fracture, a proximal fracture involving the germinal matrix may require a surgical consult for removal of the nail and nail bed repair. In the event of the nontraumatic development of subungual hematoma, the patient may not benefit from trephination. Examples of nontraumatic subungual hematoma include a variety of tumors including a junctional nevus or melanoma or splinter hemorrhages.
