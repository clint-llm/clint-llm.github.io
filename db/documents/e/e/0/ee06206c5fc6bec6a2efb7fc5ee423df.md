Erythema ab igne should be a consideration in the differential diagnosis forÂ dyspigmented reticular dermatoses.

- Livedo reticularis

- Livedoid vasculitis

- Poikiloderma atrophicans vascular

- Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma

- Dermatomyositis

- Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita

- Genodermatoses

- Angiosarcoma

- Vasculitis

- Bullous disease

A key feature that can distinguish erythema ab igne from other reticular rashes is its presentation in the setting of chronic heat exposure, as livedo reticularis and cutis marmorata are often present with exposure to cold and other rashes present without a history of heat exposure altogether.
