Standard laparotomy surgical equipment is required.

Specific for HJ:

- Self-retaining laparotomy retractor

- Closed suction drain

- Biliary stents

- Magnifying loupes for visualization of the small bile ducts to ensure a good approximation of mucosa when performing anastomosis

- Fluoroscopy set upÂ for intraoperative cholangiogram

If expertise is available, consideration may be given to perform a minimally invasive repair (laparoscopic or robotic).
