- There are several scenarios where antidepressant use may be contraindicated. These scenarios vary between and within classes.

- Antidepressants should be used cautiously in patients with known hypersensitivities or taking other psychotropic medications.

- Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), for example, should not be taken with other SSRIs, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and other psychotropics; this is due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, which can lead to severe neuromuscular and autonomic symptoms.

- Tricyclic antidepressants can provide another good example of relative contraindications in antidepressant therapy. Clinicians should be mindful when prescribing tricyclic antidepressants to individuals with cardiovascular disease. Tricyclic antidepressants have been shown to cause orthostatic hypotension. Additionally, tricyclic antidepressants may lead to heart block in patients with preexisting bundle-branch disease.

- Buproprion, an atypical antidepressant, has seizure disorder listed as a major contraindication. This contraindication applies to patients with an active seizure diagnosis or prior seizure activity history. Like other antidepressants, bupropion should not be used in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors or drugs that can lower the seizure threshold.

- Liver injury due to previous treatment is a contraindication to nefazodone therapy.

- Esketamine is contraindicated in aneurysmal vascular disease(thoracic and abdominal aorta, intracranial, and peripheral arterial vessels) and arteriovenous malformations, according to the product labeling.

- Dextromethorphan/Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder, bulimia/anorexia nervosa, and concomitant Use withÂ MAO inhibitors or within 14 days of stopping treatment with dextromethorphan/bupropion.
