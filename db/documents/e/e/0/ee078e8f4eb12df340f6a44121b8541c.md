The frequency of allergic interstitial nephritis is likely underestimated, as the diagnosis can only be definitively confirmed with biopsy evaluation. Renal biopsies are often deferredÂ as a clinical suspicion that often guides therapy. Additionally, older adults subject to polypharmacy are more likely to develop AIN but may not be considered good candidates for a renal biopsy. Given the lack of strong evidence to pursue immunosuppressant therapy, it is often the case that a biopsy would not change the treatment plan beyond discontinuing the likely offending agent. When evaluating renal biopsies performed for acute kidney injury, interstitial nephritis was noted in 13% to 18% of cases.
