The primary cells that induce the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis are NK and CTL lymphocytes. NK cells are lymphocytes, yet are part of the innate immune system, whereas CTLs are T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system, and as such, undergo clonal selection in response to an antigen and can form memory lymphocytes.

NK cells mature in the bone marrow, and in response to viral infections or transformed cells, NK cells provide a first line of defense by inducing apoptosis in human cells that have altered cell surface properties. CTLs mature and emerge from the thymus as na√Øve CD8-positive T lymphocytes, which subsequently search for antigen presented by dendritic cells in secondary lymphoid tissues such as lymph nodes. Upon specific recognition of an antigen, CTLs undergo clonal expansion, producing thousands of CTL effector lymphocytes that can return to the tissue where the infected cells reside. This process takes approximately a week upon first exposure to the antigen, and the NK cells thus have an essential role in eradicating potentially dangerous cells while the CTL adaptive response is forming.
