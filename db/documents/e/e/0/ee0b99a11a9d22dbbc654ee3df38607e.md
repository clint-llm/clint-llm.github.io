There has been a significant reduction in the incidence of infective endocarditis in patients with a history of procedure, thanks to the recommendation of prophylactic treatment. However, not all procedures need prophylaxis.

In 2007, the AHA modified their infective endocarditis prophylaxis guidelines, and the indications for prophylaxis were reduced for dental procedures, genitourinary, and gastrointestinal tract procedures.

Indications for prophylaxis based on 2007 AHA:

- Prosthetic cardiac valve or prosthetic material used for cardiac valve repair

- Previous infective endocarditis

Cardiac Heart Disease (CHD) with:

- Unrepaired cyanotic CHD (including shunts and conduits)

- CHD entirely repaired with prosthetic material or device, during the first 6 months after the procedure

- Repaired CHD with residual defects to the site of a prosthetic patch or prosthetic device

- Cardiac transplantation recipients who develop cardiac valvulopathy

The particular individual condition of these recommendations makes reasonable direct consultation with pediatric cardiology to determine the ongoing need for prophylaxis.
