The optic nerve is the second cranial nerve (CN II) responsible for transmitting visual information. The optic nerve contains only afferent (sensory) fibers, and like all cranial nerves is paired. During embryogenesis, the optic nerve is formed in the retina, exits the orbit via the optic canal, and is relayed throughout the central nervous system (CNS). Synaptic targets of the optic nerve include, but are not limited to, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), pretectal nucleus, superior colliculus, and primary visual cortex. The stimulation of these different structures results in different functions. Furthermore, the optic nerve is the afferent limb for both the pupillary light reflex and the accommodation reflex.
