Typically, a patient with an abnormal finding noted on clinical exam and/or imaging will first undergo a core needle biopsy for diagnostic purposes.  At the time of biopsy, a clip will also get placed to guide future surgical management. This marker is particularly helpful in patients who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as these lesions may often become difficult to locate. After the biopsy, patients may or may not undergo additional testing, including axillary ultrasound, staging CT chest, abdomen, pelvis, breast MRI, CBC, CMP, and/or FDG PET/CT. This is generally a consideration with additional signs or symptoms. Additionally, based on the stage of cancer, the patient may or may not meet with radiation oncology, medical oncology, genetics, and/or plastic surgery. They also may require discussion at a tumor board.
