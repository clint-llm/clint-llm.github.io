Bacitracin is available in three different routes of administration in the USA: topical, ophthalmic, parenteral via IM injection.

Its most common use is as a topical agent administered directly onto the wound or infected area. It can also be administered as a topical ophthalmic ointment to treat superficial ocular infections involving the conjunctiva and cornea, using a formulation specifically manufactured for ocular use.

Before topical application, the skin should be cleansed gently with mild soap and water. Enough ointment should then be applied to cover the affected area(s), and a sterile dressing can be used to cover the wound. This helps to assist in wound healing and prevent further contamination of the wound site.
