"Intraepidermal" means that the cancerous cells are located in the epidermis from where they originally developed (in situ). Squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCCIS) is a vitiated, superficial growth of cancerous cells on the skinâ€™s outer layer. It is not a severe condition but could develop into a full form of invasive skin cancer if not detected early or well managed. It is also known as carcinoma in situ in the literature or as Bowen disease after John T. Bowen, an American dermatologist who first described the condition in 1912. Flat cells, known as squamous cells, are located in the epidermis. They are responsible for the production of the keratin protein and affected by this condition. This activity reviews the evaluation of intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma in situ and identifies the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of squamous cell carcinoma in situ.
- Describe the technique of diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in situ.
- Summarize the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma in situ.
- Outline the evaluation of intraepidermal squamous cell carcinoma in situ and identify the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.
