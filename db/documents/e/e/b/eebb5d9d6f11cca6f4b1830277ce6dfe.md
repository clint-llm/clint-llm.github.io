Diagnosing primary ciliary dyskinesia is challenging as it results from various defects in cilia, and no single diagnostic test can detect all these defects (Figure).

In patients older than five, nasal nitric oxide measurements can be used as a screening or diagnostic tool for diagnosing primary ciliary dyskinesia.

Per guidelines outlined in the European Respiratory Society, high-speed videomicroscopy analysis (HSVA) for the evaluation of ciliary motility is extremely sensitive (100% sensitivity) and specific (93% specificity) and should be conducted as well.

Advances in electron microscopy have enabled a deeper understanding of the structural consequences of genetic variations.

Additionally, in all the above testing methods, false positives can occur due to secondary loss of function of cilia. This can occur, for example, if the sample was taken during an acute viral illness that caused transient loss of function. To minimize the impact of this, cell culture can be used.
