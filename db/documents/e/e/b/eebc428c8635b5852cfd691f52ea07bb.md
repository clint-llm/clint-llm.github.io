During initial central venous catheter placement, using soap and water or alcohol-based scrubs should be standard practice before donning sterile gloves. Double gloving is encouraged with a colored indicator glove underneath to identify any glove perforations.

Skin preparation with both mechanical and chemical preparation using 0.5% chlorhexidine is preferable to povidone-iodine or 70% alcohol unless the patient has an allergy to chlorhexidine. Skin preparation decreases the skin flora and reduces catheter-based infections. After completion of the procedure, a sterile dressing should be applied over the insertion site before using the catheter.

After insertion, any manipulation or use of the catheter should occur only when clinically indicated. Routine daily inspection of the central line should be performed. A daily inspection should evaluate the proper position and functionality of the line and for signs of infection, including erythema and drainage. Dressing changes should occur every five to seven days with a transparent dressing or every two days if a gauze dressing is used. However, the dressing should be changed sooner if it is no longer adherent, its integrity is compromised, or it becomes visibly soiled. Studies revealed no difference in the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections when chlorhexidine-impregnated dressings were used compared to other dressings, such as adhesive Tegaderm HP Transparent Film Dressing 3M, sterile gauze, and micropore tape, among others.

Once the dressing is removed, the catheter insertion site should be cleaned to prevent bacterial transmigration. Sterile technique should be used at all times when handling central catheters. A chlorohexidine solution is recommended to sterilize the area surrounding the catheter site. Once the area is dry, a sterile dressing should be reapplied and remain in place per institutional protocol or until the catheter is removed.

Catheter connections also require sterile precautions. In addition to hand hygiene, the healthcare worker should diligently disinfect the injection ports, needleless connectors, and catheter hubs with either 70% alcohol or chlorhexidine swabs before use. Recommendations also include changing the intravenous administration set every 96 hours. If intravenous administration sets are used to infuse lipid-containing solutions and medications like total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or propofol, the sets should be exchanged every 24 hours. The intravenous set should also be changed every 24 hours if used to infuse blood products. When a catheter hub is not used, catheter locks should be applied.

As previously mentioned, proper insertion and maintenance technique prevents complications. Thus, many institutions implement central venous catheter bundles, highlighting five critical concepts: hand hygiene, maximal sterile barrier precautions during insertion, cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine preparation, avoidance of the femoral insertion site if possible, and removal of any unnecessary catheters.
