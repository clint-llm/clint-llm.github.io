Poliomyelitis is an infectious disease transmitted by fecal-oral contamination with lymphatic replication. Before global health efforts, polio caused widespread morbidity and mortality in children during multiple epidemics between 1900-1950. Due to worldwide vaccination efforts that began in the 1980s, poliomyelitis is now considered almost completely eradicated.
