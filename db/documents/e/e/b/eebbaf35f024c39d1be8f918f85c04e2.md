The treatment of epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is challenging, and many patients are recalcitrant to therapy. Supportive therapy, including proper wound care and good nutrition, is paramount for all EBA patients to minimize the risk of complications.

As with all rare conditions, pharmacologic treatment data for EBA is largely based on anecdotal reports.
