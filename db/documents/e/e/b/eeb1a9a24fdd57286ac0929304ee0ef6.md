Spontaneous coronary artery dissection can affect both sexes, but the incidence is overwhelmingly higher in women in their fifth and sixth decades of life (about 90%) than in men.

The known risk factors are pregnancy, postpartum state, concomitant FMD, arteriolopathies, and physical and emotional stressors. The majority of patients affected are white women. Mortality is low, about 1-2%, and the incidence of recurrent ACS is about 18%.
