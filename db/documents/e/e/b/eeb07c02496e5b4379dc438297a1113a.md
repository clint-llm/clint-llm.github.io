Interferons are currently used clinically to treat viral infections such as hepatitis C, cancers including non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Interferon lambda currently has no FDA-approved uses, but researchers use it in research models of autoimmune diseases, cancers, and viral infections. The various types of interferons include interferon-gamma 1b, interferon beta 1a, lyophilized, PEGylated interferon-alpha 2b, interferon 1b, interferon beta 1a, biogenic form, interferon-alpha 2b, PEGylated interferon-alpha 2a, PEGylated interferon-alpha 2b plus ribavirin, PEGylated interferon-alpha 2b, interferon beta 1a liquid form, PEGylated interferon-alpha 2a, and interferon-alpha 2a.

Interferon-alpha 2a is FDA-approved to treat chronic hepatitis C and hairy cell leukemia in adults, and chronic phase, Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It is also used to treat follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma, advanced renal cell carcinoma, and stage 2 malignant melanoma. Interferon-alpha 2-b (brand name: Intron A) is FDA approved for adults with chronic hepatitis C, hairy cell leukemia, AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, hepatitis B, and as an adjuvant for those with malignant melanoma.10 It also has approval for follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma in combination with anthracycline chemotherapy, as well as for intralesional treatment of condylomata acuminata.****Interferon-beta 1a and b are FDA approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.
