**Cardiac Arrest Caused by Drowning**

Drowning causes up to 31% of all pediatric OHCA, and survival rates range from 9% to 46%.

Longer duration of submersion and longer duration of CPR are associated with poor neurological outcomes. Therapeutic hypothermia has not been shown to provide any statistically significant neurologic benefit in drowning victims when compared to normothermia protocols. Several case series describe patients successfully decannulated from ECMO with favorable neurological outcomes. There is currently insufficient published data to identify management recommendations specific to drowning-associated cardiac arrest. In these cases, clinicians are encouraged to use the general approach to PCAC as described above.

**Patient and Caregiver Outcomes**

Survivors of cardiac arrest can have significant dysfunction, and parents of child survivors often report limitations in their daily activities. Long-term neurobehavioral and neuropsychiatric outcomes vary from patient to patient, and some may actually improve over time. Further assessment of these outcomes and the long-term burden on survivors and their families will allow us to determine whether improvements in CPR quality and PCAC are improving the long-term outcomes.

**Organ Donation**

Two situations that make for potential organ donation are donation after neurologic deathÂ and donation after circulatory death.

**COVID and Cardiac Arrest**

Strict adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) is paramount when caring for cardiac arrest patients presenting to emergency departments during the current COVID pandemic. The CDC has guidelines to assist practitioners in the proper means of donning and doffing PPE. Extra precautions should be taken when involved in aerosolizing procedures and intubation.

**Multi-disciplinary Approach and Debriefing**

The local medical examiner, organ donation services, and in some cases child protective services may be involved. The American Heart Association (AHA) also emphasizes the role and importance of debriefing with staff and members of the clinical team, post-resuscitation.
