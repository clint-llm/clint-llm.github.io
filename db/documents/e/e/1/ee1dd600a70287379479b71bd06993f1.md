Physicians, pharmacists, and nurses, operating as an interprofessional team need to be aware of the risks, benefits, and contraindications for testosterone replacement therapy. There are conflicting trials on the cardiovascular risks of testosterone therapy, most notable the TOM (Testosterone in Older Men) trial and the TEAAM (Testosterone's Effects on Atherosclerosis Progression in Aging Men) trials. Low testosterone levels have correlated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease.

Clinicians need to prescribe androgen replacement therapy by using risk-benefit assessment of individual patient's clinical needs and risk of adverse reactions. Pharmacists should verify dosing, check for potential interactions, and provide thorough counseling for administration, which will vary depending on the formulation. Nurses can also counsel patients on dosing and administration and assess treatment effectiveness. Both pharmacists and nurses need to inform the prescriber of any concerns they may encounter, so an open communication channel between team members is vital. Interprofessional monitoring of the patient will result in the best outcomes with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
