Amniotic fluid assessments are considered an integral part of the routine anatomic fetal evaluation, with derangements often found incidentally. The ACR guidelines state that amniotic fluid assessment should be performed at all sonographic fetal evaluations.

Specific high-risk factors in pregnancies have the potential to alter amniotic fluid dynamics and may warrant serial assessments. These high-risk factors include hypertension severe enough to require antihypertensives, pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders, fetal growth restriction, certain fetal anatomic anomalies, and late-term pregnancies. Additionally, when fundal size on a routine exam does not correlate with the gestational size, the amniotic fluid volume should be assessed.
