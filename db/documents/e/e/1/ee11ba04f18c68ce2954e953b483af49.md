A fundus camera equipped with an excitation and barrier filter is required for taking photographs. Cobalt blue excitation filter transmits blue light in the range of 465 to 490 nm, and this is in the range of absorption peak of fluorescein. The barrier filter transmits light in the range of 520 to 530 nm, which is the range of the emission peak of fluorescein. With the advent of digital angiography, a computer with software is required for processing the images captured.

The adult dose of sodium fluorescein is 500 mg intravenously. A vial of sodium Fluorescein dye (2 ml of 25%, 2.5 ml of 20%, 5 ml of 10 %, or 10 ml of 5 %) is required. A 23 gauge scalp vein needle set and a 5 ml syringe with a needle to draw the dye, armrest, tourniquet, and alcohol swab are also required. Standard emergency equipment to manage anaphylaxis should always be ready before starting the procedure.
