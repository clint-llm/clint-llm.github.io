The routine use of any specific imaging or laboratory test in the diagnosis of pediatric functional constipation is not recommended. However, when symptoms fail to improve with a conventional medical approach, the further diagnostic evaluation may clarify possible causes and help guide therapy. Such diagnostic tests include anorectal manometry, colonic manometry, colonic transit studies and imaging such as x-ray and ultrasound.

Anorectal manometry evaluates motor and sensory anorectal function to identify potential causes of constipation or fecal incontinence. Hirschsprung’s disease diagnosis is aid by this test, but gold standard diagnosis continues to be a rectal suction biopsy.

Colonic manometry consists of the colonoscopic insertion of a catheter throughout the length of the colon to measure segmental pressures. This diagnostic modality helps identify neurogenic and myogenic causes of constipation. There is no specific motility pattern is diagnostic of idiopathic constipation.

Colonic transit studies use radiopaque markers to assess the speed of intestinal transit. This can help identify anatomic sites of fecal retention and slow transit.

Overall, plain abdominal radiograph does not add to the history and physical exam. It may help to assess stool collection in the bowel when patients are obese, refuse a digital rectal exam, or when it is contraindicated. However, an abdominal radiograph is neither sensitive nor specific to diagnose constipation.
