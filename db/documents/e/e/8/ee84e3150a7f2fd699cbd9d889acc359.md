The diagnosis of tinea corporis is usually clinically based on a thorough history and physical examination.  However, testing can be done to confirm the diagnosis.  Skin scrapings examined under a microscope with a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation will reveal septate and branching long narrow hyphae.  However, up to 15% of cases may yield false negatives when only using KOH preparations for diagnosis.

Therefore another method for confirmation is a fungal culture.  Fungal cultures are possible but take time for definitive identification.  Cultures may begin to see growth in about five days but may take up to four weeks in certain species.  Therefore at least four weeks are needed to deem a sample as "no growth."  The most common isolation medium used for fungal cultures is a Sabourad dextrose agar (1% glucose, 4% mycological peptone agar, water).  Identification is by examining the morphology, pigmentation, and surface topography of the culture.
