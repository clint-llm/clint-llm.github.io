With the advent of transjugular intrahepatic shunting procedures and less invasive techniques as sclerotherapy, portacaval shunt procedures have decreased in popularity. Although not as commonly performed, portacaval shunting plays a critical role in patients who have recurrent variceal hemorrhage as well as portal hypertension. While shunt types vary, most commonly a side to side or end to side portacaval anastomosis is performed when indicated. This activity reviews the indications for portacaval shunt procedures, preoperative assessments, the overall steps by the interprofessional team to the procedure, and immediate postoperative care.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures involved in the formation of a portacaval shunt.
- Describe the technique of portacaval shunts.
- Identify major indications for performing a portacaval shunt procedure.
