The treatment for medullary carcinoma, either typical or atypical, is similar to invasive ductal carcinoma. The division into typical and atypical subtypes does not modify treatment options and has only prognostic significance. The treatment of medullary breast carcinoma includes modified or radical mastectomy along with radiation or chemotherapy, depending on the stage.

Medullary carcinomas are sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy. Breast-conserving surgery followed by adjuvant radiation may be appropriate for tumors that are 3 cm or smaller. Indications for chemotherapy include larger tumor size, nodal metastasis, and lymphovascular invasion.
