Arthritis simply means inflammation of a joint. Various possible causes can affect a joint. It can be an injury from trauma, age-related osteoarthritis, a bacterial infection in the case of septic arthritis, autoimmune-like rheumatoid arthritis, and others. The early sign and symptoms include joint pain, red and/or warm skin over the joint, stiffness, and decreased range of motion.Â  The patient should see a primary care physician who determines if a specialist consult (i.e., rheumatology, orthopedist) is required. A comprehensive history and physical exam, laboratory tests, and imaging studies are sufficient to determine the etiology of arthritis. The mainstay of treatment is by medications, but sometimes surgery is also required if a foreign body is involved, or there is internal damage to the joint.
