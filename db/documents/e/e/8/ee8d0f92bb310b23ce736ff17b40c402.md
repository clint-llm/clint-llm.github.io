The embryological development of the XI nerve has the same origin as the vagus nerve, from the same ganglionic crest (ectoderm). The structure includes both motor components and sensitive components. As development progresses, its cranial termination becomes more sensitive, while its caudal termination acquires more motor functions.

At around 20 days, the ganglion crest is lateralized and divided into two portions (right and left); the caudal portion of the crest gives rise to a band of fibers, which will become the future accessory nerve. This band of fibers is located at the level of the fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical segment.

During the fourth week, it frees itself from the link of the vagus nerve to throw itself into a mesodermal mass, which will be the sternocleidomastoid muscle. At the end of the fifth week of gestation, the nerve is located medial to the dorsal rootlets and is connected at irregular intervals to what will be the spinal cord. It connects with the first spinal ganglion.

The cranial portion is a row of ganglia, found in the nerve once formed. The ganglia during development will be larger, forming a connection with the jugular ganglion of the vagus nerve.

During the second and third month, the XI nerve stretches and takes what will be its shape.
