Whether it is skeletal, cardiac, or smooth, the muscles in the human body function to create force and movement. Skeletal musclesÂ support the bones to maintain posture as well as control voluntary movement. Skeletal muscle also contributes to energy metabolism and storage. Cardiac muscle propels blood and leads to proper oxygenation and maintenance of each cell that comprises the human body. Smooth muscle is located throughout the body and uses contractile force for shortening and propelling various contents across the lumen of the multiple organ systems in which it is involved.
