**History**

Hairy leukoplakia is often asymptomatic, due to which many patients are unaware of its presence. They may report a non-tender whitish plaque along the lateral border of the tongue. The lesion may appear and disappear spontaneously. Some patients may experience mild pain, dysesthesia, altered sensitivity to food temperature, alteration in the taste sensation due to alteration in taste buds, and the psychological impact of its unsightly cosmetic appearance.

**Physical Examination**

Intraorally, unilateral or bilateral non-painful white lesions are seen mostly on the lateral margin of the tongue.
