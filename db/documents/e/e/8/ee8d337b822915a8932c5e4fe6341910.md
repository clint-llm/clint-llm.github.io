Differential diagnosis of patients presenting with weakness in early infancy includes:

- Congenital myopathies – most common ones are central core, nemaline road, and centronuclear myopathy. These may also present secondary to metabolic disorders affecting the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and other molecules.

- Disorders of the myoneural junction – these are very infrequent in occurrence but should be part of differential diagnosis of infants presenting with weakness. These include congenital myasthenia gravis and infant botulism.

- Neuropathies – these are disorders primarily affecting nerve roots in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Common neuropathies presenting in early childhood include spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (HMSN).
