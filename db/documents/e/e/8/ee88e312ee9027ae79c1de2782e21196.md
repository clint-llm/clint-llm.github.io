Upon diagnosis of the condition, it is essential to refer the patient to a clinical geneticist/genetic counselor. Annual surveillance includes routine physical examination and diet checks. Counseling consists of avoiding certain exercises, e.g., sustained hand grips exercises, weight lifting unless under specialists supervision, competitive ball games, running, exercises involving excessive jumping, strenuous swimming, and cycling.

Limitation or adaptation of physical activity to avoid symptoms is necessary as rhabdomyolysis is a life-threatening condition.

There is a mild risk of acute muscle necrosis secondary to certain general anesthetics, such as muscle relaxants and inhaled anesthetic agents. This should be taken care of while treating patients with McArdle disease to avoid rhabdomyolysis.
