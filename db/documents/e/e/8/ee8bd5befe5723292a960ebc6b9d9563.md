Prognosis depends upon multiple factors like age of presentation, the severity of disease, and associated systemic abnormalities. Early surgical intervention like penetrating keratoplasty may prevent amblyopia, but it is associated with a high risk of graft failure. A study conducted by Rao et al. in 2005 suggested that only 22 % maintain clear grafts after two years of surgery.
