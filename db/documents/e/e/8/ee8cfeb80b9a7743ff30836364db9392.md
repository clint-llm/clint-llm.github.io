The complications of nonorganic hearing loss arise most often due to misdiagnosis or delay in diagnosis. Unnecessary investigations, medical treatments, and even surgeries may result.

Enrollment of patients with nonorganic functional hearing loss in cochlear implant programs has been reported. In these cases, the actual cause of the hearing loss remains undiagnosed and leads to the prolongation of the patient’s suffering. Nonorganic functional hearing loss may present similarly to sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Given that an important treatment for sudden sensorineural hearing loss is systemic or intratympanic corticosteroids, nonorganic functional hearing loss should be ruled out before administering medications.

Steroids are not indicated in nonorganic functional hearing loss, and they may produce harmful side effects, particularly in children. In some cases, if nonorganic hearing loss is diagnosed but the underlying conflict is not resolved, later presentations of other nonorganic conditions such as visual disturbances may occur.
