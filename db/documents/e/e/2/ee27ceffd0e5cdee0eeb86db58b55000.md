Narcolepsy is a disorder of rapid onset rapid eye movement (REM) sleep characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), frequent uncontrollable sleep attacks as well as sleep fragmentation and can be associated with cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. There are two types: narcolepsy type 1 (formerly narcolepsy with cataplexy) and narcolepsy type 2 (formerly narcolepsy without cataplexy). This activity describes the evaluation and management of narcolepsy and highlights the role of an interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of narcolepsy. 
- Identify the patient history associated with narcolepsy.
- Review the management considerations for patients with narcolepsy.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by narcolepsy.
