The nerve fibers that feed the pelvis are both parasympathetic and sympathetic. The preganglionic fibers are in the sacral parasympathetics (S2-S4) in the spinal cord. Their processes run into pelvic splanchnic nerves and relay inside the pelvic organs within the intramural plexus (the postganglionic neuron). The sensory fibers from S2-S4 dorsal root ganglia travel with parasympathetic fibers and carry pain sensations from the organs. Sympathetic fibers of preganglionic neurons (T12-L2) form the sacral splanchnic nerves. They contribute to the inferior hypogastric plexus, which is the location of the postganglionic neurons.Â The pudendal nerve provides sensory innervation to the lower vagina. A pudendal nerve block is an option during early labor to relieve pain for the mother.
