Since the performance of neuraxial procedures is under aseptic technique, the clinician is expected to maintain a sterile environment. Cap, masks, hand wash, sterile gloves are required. For a successful procedure, adequate preparation is requisite.

There should be adequate equipment count and ample space to accommodate patients and personnel. Monitors to assess the patient's circulation (blood pressure, continuous EKG), oxygenation (continuous pulse oximetry), and temperature should be set up and ready. The clinician performing process must be proficient in using and interpreting monitors. If planning sedation, means to assist patient ventilation, oxygenation, and circulatory support should be in place. Intravenous access should be established before starting. A certified anesthesiologist should be present in the event that the patient will require general anesthesia.

There are commercially available spinal anesthesia kits. Contents of kits usually include chlorhexidine with alcohol, drape, and local infiltrating anesthetic (usually 1% lidocaine). Other contents include the spinal needle (Quincke, Whitacre, Sprotte, or Greene), 3 ml and 5 ml syringes, and preservative-free spinal anesthetic solution. Solutions may range from lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine, procaine, or tetracaine.
