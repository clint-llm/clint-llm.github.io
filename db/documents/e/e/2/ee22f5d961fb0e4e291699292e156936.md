A uterine rupture is a complete division of all three layers of the uterus: the endometrium (inner epithelial layer), myometrium (smooth muscle layer), and perimetrium (serosal outer surface). Clinicians must remain vigilant for signs and symptoms of uterine rupture. Uterine ruptures can cause serious morbidity and mortality for both the woman and the neonate.

Uterine dehiscence is a similar condition characterized by incomplete division of the uterus that does not penetrate all layers. Uterine dehiscence can produce a uterine window—a thinning of the uterine wall that may allow the fetus to be seen through the myometrium. Often uterine dehiscence is an occult finding in an asymptomatic patient.

Interest in uterine rupture has increased in recent years due to a desire to offer more patients a trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC). A TOLAC refers to a plan to have a vaginal birth in any subsequent pregnancy after cesarean delivery. The risk of uterine rupture is one of the main considerations when counseling patients on TOLAC.
