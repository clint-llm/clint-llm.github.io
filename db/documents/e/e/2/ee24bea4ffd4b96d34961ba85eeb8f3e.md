The disease is usually confined to the subcutaneous tissue, but rare cases have disseminated to involve the lymph nodes, blood, and bone marrow.  Laboratory testing reveals an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein. Cytopenias, elevated liver function tests, and hepatosplenomegaly should prompt close monitoring for the development of HPS.  18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) may help assess the extent of disease upon presentation, response to treatment, and detection of relapses

A punch biopsy of the lesion should be submitted for pathologic evaluation, which will allow for assessment of the area of interest. No specific genetic profile has been identified, and the Epstein-Barr virus is usually not present. Clonality of the neoplastic T-cells can be demonstrated by the identification of T-cell receptor rearrangements using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or high throughput sequencing
