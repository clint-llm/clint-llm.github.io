The differential diagnosis can be broad, especially with respiratory involvement, but can include the following:

- Sarcoidosis: Mainly differentiated from tuberculosis by the presence of non-caseating granuloma.

- Fungal infections: Such as  Histoplasmosis, Aspergillosis, Actinomycosis, Blastomycosis, and Nocardiosis. Epidemiological history aid in determining the risk of developing these infections.

- Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections (NTM): such as Mycobacterium kansasii.

- Lung malignancy and lymphoma: Tissue biopsy is needed to role out this diagnosis if suspected

- Lung abscess
