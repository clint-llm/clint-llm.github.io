The carotid sheath contains four key structures, the common carotid artery, the internal carotid artery, the internal jugular vein, and the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve extends farther than any other cranial nerve. It exits the cranial cavity via the jugular foramen, where it initially travels alongside the internal jugular vein and descends through the carotid sheath. During its course through the neck, it gives off branches such as the superior laryngeal nerve and the pharyngeal branch. The pharyngeal branch provides motor fibers to the muscles of the pharynx, excluding the stylopharyngeus, a lesion here will result in uvula deviation to the contralateral side. The superior laryngeal nerve bifurcates into internal and external laryngeal nerves. These branches provide sensory fibers to the larynx above the vocal cords, the epiglottis, and the lower pharynx in addition to supplying taste fibers to the root of the tongue.

The internal carotid artery also gives off the ophthalmic artery, which gives off numerous collateral branches to supply the optic nerve. Also, the ophthalmic artery's first major branch, the central retinal artery, travels within the optic nerve to supply the retina.
