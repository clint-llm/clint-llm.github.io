Administration of excess epinephrine that leads to supra-therapeutic levels may cause predictable adverse effects that warrant supportive treatment. Overdose may cause elevated arterial pressures leading to cerebrovascular accidents. Pressor effects can be minimized by using an alpha-adrenergic blocker or by the usage of vasodilators such as nitrites. Pulmonary edema can also present due to the underlying mechanism of peripheral vasoconstriction along with myocardial stimulation.
