The medial epicondyle is the origin of the ulnar collateral ligament and flexor-pronator mass muscles. The flexor-pronator mass includes the pronator teres, flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor digitorum superficialis, and flexor carpi ulnaris. Its blood supply includes superior and inferior ulnar collateral artery branches. The ulnar collateral ligament originates at the medial epicondyle and has an important function of stabilizing the elbow during valgus stress.Â The ulnar nerve also runs posteriorly along the groove of the medial epicondyle. The medial epicondyle is the final ossification center to ossify in the elbow. Children can have an open apophysis until age 14 or 15, thus making the medial epicondyle more susceptible to injury.

Medial epicondyle fractures can be described based on the amount of fracture comminution and fracture displacement. Medial epicondyle fractures may occur in the setting of an elbow dislocation, and the medial epicondyle fracture fragment may become entrapped in the elbow joint.
