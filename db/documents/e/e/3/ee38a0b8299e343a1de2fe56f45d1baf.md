Interprofessional team coordination is crucial to identify and treat a person with a man in a barrel syndrome. This interprofessional team includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists (primarily neurologists), nurses, and physical or occupational therapists. A detailed history and physical examination by a provider can diagnose MIBS. Radiology technicians and radiologists are integral in identifying the etiology of the underlying causative lesion. Neurosurgery may be necessary for tumors or compressive cervical spine lesions, causing MIBS. Once the underlying lesion is treated, an interprofessional rehabilitation team can help the patient on the road to functional recovery. A coordinated effort from all interprofessional team members with open information sharing about the patient's case will drive the best possible outcomes. [Level 5]
