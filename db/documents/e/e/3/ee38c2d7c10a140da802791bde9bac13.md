The full workup includes a whole body CT scan which can rapidly identify injuries to the brain (intracranial hemorrhage), chest, abdomen, and presence of any fractures. This is usually done as part of the tertiary trauma survey which follows the secondary survey (a focused history and physical exam). As part of the tertiary survey, laboratory and radiological evaluations in the emergency setting have prognostic importance but be limiting. Examples include a lateral cervical spine radiograph missing clinically significant injuries; hemoglobin and hematocrit levels which have not yet equilibrated after a hemorrhage; and abnormal liver function tests which may be seen in abdominal trauma but these patients usually go for CT scan and surgery immediately. These labs are also not standard procedure for every patient which may slow down the triage process. Clinical prediction rules that combine the history and physical exam have been developed to identify those at low risk of injury and subsequent deterioration. In these patients, specific radiographic and laboratory studies may not be necessary.
