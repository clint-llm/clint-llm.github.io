The most common presenting symptoms are progressive nasal obstruction, intermittent nasal congestion, anosmia, facial swelling and pain, epistaxis, anosmia, periorbital numbness, intermittent blurry vision, and rhinorrhea.

In some patients, the presentation can be confused with sinusitis, as patients present with secondary mucopurulent sinonasal drainage.
