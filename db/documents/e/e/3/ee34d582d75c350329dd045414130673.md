Since patients with HIV-associated polyradiculopathy are at a high risk of opportunistic infections, the most important factor to be considered is the drug interaction between antivirals and HAART. Careful regimen selection and monitoring are essential parts of the treatment plan to prevent or minimize complications.

After beginning antiviral therapy, the worsening of the symptoms may be observed initially. This usually resolves spontaneously throughout treatment; however, when vital structures are involved, adjuvant corticosteroids, tapered over time, are suggested to reduce morbidity and mortality in these cases.

In many infectious etiologies, concomitant involvement of other neurological (myelitis, encephalitis, ventriculitis, etc.), and non-neurological (retinitis, esophagitis, pneumonitis, etc.) tissues, may be seen at presentation or during disease progression by the involved or other opportunistic pathogens. In neoplastic etiologies, expansion of primary lesion or metastasis or drug interaction with chemotherapeutic agents may accelerate the worsening of the disease.
