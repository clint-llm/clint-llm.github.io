Patients with an underlying vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus infection will present with a variety of history and physical exam findings dependent on the clinical manifestations as described below. Specifically, the focus should be placed on using the patient’s medical history and physical exam to elucidate the source of infection.

**Clinical Manifestations**

Enterococcus can cause a wide range of clinical diseases. The most common clinical presentation is bacteriuria, though it is becoming increasingly clear that many of these cases are due to colonization rather than infection. Other frequent causes of infection are bacteremia without endocarditis, followed by endocarditis.

**Urinary tract infection
**

Enterococcus is frequently cited as one of the three most likely etiologies of both uncomplicated and complicated UTI, especially healthcare-associated UTIs. Of these, the vast majority is E. faecalis, though the majority of vancomycin-resistant isolates are E. faecium. It is usually associated with indwelling urinary catheters and instrumentation. The severity of the disease can range from uncomplicated cystitis to complicated cystitis to pyelonephritis, perinephric abscess, or prostatitis. There is an increasing awareness that many reported “urinary tract infections” are, in fact, colonization. Asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria should not be treated unless the patient is exhibiting signs and/or symptoms of a UTI or sepsis.

**Intra-abdominal and pelvic infections**

As commensals, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus is commonly isolated from intra-abdominal and pelvic infections. The usual infections include abscesses, wounds, or peritonitis. Often they are part of a polymicrobial infection with other gram-negative or anaerobic organisms. Nonetheless, intra-abdominal and pelvic abscesses are commonly associated with enterococcal bacteremia prompting antibiotic coverage of Enterococcus.

**Bacteremia
**

Bacteremia is a common and life-threatening manifestation of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. Nosocomial bacteremic infections are regularly acquired due to intravascular catheters or urinary catheters. In the community, bacteremia is commonly due to translocation from the GI and genitourinary (GU) tract. E. faecium in the bloodstream is associated with increased mortality likely due to the higher levels of resistance.

**Infective endocarditis**

Enterococci are the second most common cause of infective endocarditis. Common sources are central lines, GI or GU tracts after manipulation, damaged mitral or aortic valve infections, or liver transplantation. Community-acquired endocarditis can occur, and it is usually due to E. faecalis in patients with no risk factors. Clinically, they present subacutely with fevers and constitutional symptoms. Typical signs of infection include fevers or a new murmur. Typical stigmata of endocarditis such as petechiae, Osler nodes, and Roth spots are rare and, as with other etiologies, typically occur with subacute infection rather than acute infection.

**Uncommon sites of infection
**

Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus is an uncommon cause of central nervous system (CNS) infections. However, when it does occur, the majority are caused by E. faecium over E. faecalis. Infection usually is associated with neurosurgical intervention such as shunts. Like most CNS infections, common presentations include altered mental status and fevers. Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus also is found in skin infections as a part of a microbial infection. They can be found in decubitis ulcers, osteomyelitis, and soft tissue abscesses. Finally, pneumonia secondary to enterococci is very rare. When it does occur, it is usually seen as VAP in severely debilitated and immunocompromised patients who have received broad-spectrum antibiotics in the past.
