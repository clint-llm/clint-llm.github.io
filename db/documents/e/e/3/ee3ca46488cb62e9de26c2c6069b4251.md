**Anovulatory Cycles**

In some cases, ovulation fails to occur during the menstrual cycle. Such cycles are called anovulatory cycles, and they are common for the first 12-18 months after menarche (The occurrence of the first menstrual period) and again before the onset of menopause. When ovulation does not occur, usually no corpus luteum is found, and the effect of progesterone on the endometrium is absent.
