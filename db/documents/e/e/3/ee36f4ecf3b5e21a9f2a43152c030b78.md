Muscles of the abdominal wall consist of the external oblique, internal oblique, transversus abdominis, and rectus abdominis. The external oblique is the outermost muscle of the anterior abdominal wall that arises from the eighth rib and attaches to the anterior iliac crest. The internal oblique muscle fibers find its origin from the thoracolumbar fascia, run cranially and anteriorly, attaching to the lower ribs and xiphoid process. Transversus abdominis fibers lie obliquely on the lateral aspect of the abdomen. It originates from lower costal cartilages, lumbar fascia, iliac crest, inguinal ligament, and attaches to the linea alba and pubic symphysis. Whereas, the rectus abdominis muscle fibers course along medially the entire length of the abdomen and attaches to the xiphoid process and lower costal cartilages cephalad and pubic bone and pubic symphysis caudad. Scarpa’s fascia lying directly above the external oblique serves as an essential structure that separates the underlying anterior abdominal wall muscles from the skin and subcutaneous tissue lying above.
