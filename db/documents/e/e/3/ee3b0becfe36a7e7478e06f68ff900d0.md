Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis is a sporadic form of hypokalemic periodic paralysis, which most commonly presents as sudden onset weakness in the proximal muscles. It is a reversible condition that can be treated with quick replacement of potassium and normalization of thyroid hormones. This activity reviews the pathogenesis, clinical features, laboratory findings of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.
- Explain the common physical examination findings in patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.
- Outline the management of patients with thyrotoxic periodic paralysis.
