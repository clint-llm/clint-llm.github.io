Posttraumatic syringomyelia (PTS) refers to the development of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filled cavity within the substance of the spinal cord. As the name suggests, this particular type of syringomyelia occurs after a previous trauma with or without clinical spinal cord injury. It is distinct from syringomyelia occurring due to congenital malformations, where obstruction of normal CSF flow can result in a syrinx occurring as a secondary phenomenon. Other terms that are found in literature in traumatic cases include cystic myelomalacia, or spinal cord cysts. As the name suggests, it is a cyst or cavity within the spinal cord. Management of PTS is complicated as it can result in slow, progressive, and potentially devastating loss of sensory and/or motor function in many cases. Most patients will have chronic pain which can affect their daily living function and emotional health.
