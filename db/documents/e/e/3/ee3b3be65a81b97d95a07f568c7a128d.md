The use of a TRAM flap for breast reconstruction is a major undertaking and demands technical expertise. The procedure is usually done by plastic surgeons but the patient monitoring in the immediate post-operative period is done by specialty-trained wound and plastic nurses. The key is to ensure that there is no flap necrosis and vital signs remain stable without the development of signs of infection such as a fever. The nurse should work with the surgeons to make sure the family and patient are aware of potential complecations and alert the surgical team if untoward consequences become apparent. Some patients may have moderate pain that may require prescription-strength analgesics. During the preoperative workup, a consult with an anesthesiologist and or pharmacist may help ease the patient fears about pain and provide patient and family education. The pharmacist can also assist with medication reconciliation. The overall outcome of patients undergoing the TRAM flap are good and outcomes are improved with an interprofessional approach.
