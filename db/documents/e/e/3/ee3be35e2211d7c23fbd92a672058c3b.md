Fenoldopam is used primarily for the lowering of blood pressure during episodes of severe hypertension. Fenoldopam has a unique mechanism of action compared to other antihypertensive medications: it is a dopamine (D1) receptor agonist that results in decreased peripheral vascular resistance primarily in renal capillary beds, thus promoting increased renal blood flow, natriuresis, and diuresis. Fenoldopam has minimal adrenergic effects. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of fenoldopam so that providers can direct patient therapy to optimal outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the mechanism of action of fenoldopam.
- Summarize the potential adverse events of fenoldopam.
- Review the monitoring parameters for fenoldopam.
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional communication, improving care coordination among the interprofessional team when initiating therapy.
