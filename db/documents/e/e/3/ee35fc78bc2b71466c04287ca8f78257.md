In a classic case of aortic valvular atresia, blood from the pulmonary circulation returns to the left side of the heart and is able to cross over to the right side via either an atrial or ventricular septal defect. The right ventricle pumps this mixed-oxygenated blood through the pulmonary trunk and the patent ductus arteriosus, which supplies the descending aorta and coronary arteries in a retrograde manner, and as a side effect, results in high pressures within the right side of the heart. Cyanosis results from this mixed venous blood in the systemic circulation, and pulmonary edema frequently develops due to increased pressures in the pulmonary arteries. Heart failure is thought to develop due to poor circulation in the coronary arteries, which are supplied in a retrograde fashion through the hypoplastic ascending aorta.
