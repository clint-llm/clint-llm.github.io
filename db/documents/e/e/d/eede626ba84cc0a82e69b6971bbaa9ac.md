The perineum is a diamond-shaped space below the pelvic diaphragm and refers to the lowest region of the trunk. An imaginary line between the anterior ends of the ischial tuberosity divides the perineum into two triangular divisions. The anterior smaller triangle is known as the urogenital triangle and the posterior larger division is called the anal triangle of the perineum. The urinogenital triangle is further divided by a quadrangular fascial layer called the perineal membrane, into a deep perineal pouch, present above the perineal membrane and a superficial perineal space present below the membrane.

The superficial perineal space contains the erectile tissues, skeletal muscles, and the terminal branches of the internal pudendal vessels and nerves. Knowledge of the anatomy of the perineum is necessary to provide the best surgical outcomes in cases related to trauma, cancer-related extirpation, and congenital abnormalities.
