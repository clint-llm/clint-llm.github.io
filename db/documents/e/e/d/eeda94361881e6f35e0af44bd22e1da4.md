Management of patients who have overdosed on sympathomimetics requires an interprofessional team that includes an emergency department physician, toxicologist, poison control team, internist, anesthesiologist, nurse practitioner, and a cardiologist. Once the patient is stable, the aim of treatment is to provide supportive care and prevent end-organ damage. Prior to discharge, patients who may have taken the drugs to commit self-harm must be seen by a mental health nurse or psychiatrist.

The prognosis for patients with sympathomimetic drug overdose depends on age, comorbidity, presence of neurological deficit at the time of presentation and use of other drugs.
