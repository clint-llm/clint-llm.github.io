Patients have to be educated all along the process, as membranous nephropathy is a chronic disease with a variable prognosis. Patient education and adherence are of utmost importance for a better outcome. Special attention is given to those patients who fall under high-risk groups. Patients on immunosuppressive therapy have to be warned against the increased risk of infections and complications of chronic immunosuppression.

Clinical and immunological prognosis and follow-up should be discussed in each visit. Frequent blood work and long-term follow-up are very crucial. Several patients with advanced and prolonged renal involvement might require renal replacement therapies (hemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis), due to therapy failure or delayed presentation. Thorough patient education regarding the procedure and its complications should be provided. Timely referral for subspecialty consultations, kidney transplantation, and an option for living kidney donor transplantation should be discussed when indicated. Patients undergoing renal transplant must be informed about the possibility of disease recurrence.
