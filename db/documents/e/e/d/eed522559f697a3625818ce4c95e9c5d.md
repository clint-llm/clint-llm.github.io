Injuries to the vertebral artery may either be traumatic or spontaneous. Traumatic injuries are most frequently due to blunt injury to the head and neck but may be due to penetrating trauma. Spontaneous injuries are caused by intrinsic weakness of the vessel wall, often due to underlying vascular or connective tissue disorder, leading to a dissection of the vessel. This activity describes the causes, pathophysiology, and diagnosis of vertebral artery injury and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of vertebral artery injury.
- Review the presentation of a patient with vertebral artery injury.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for vertebral artery injury.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care and outcomes in patients with vertebral artery injury.
