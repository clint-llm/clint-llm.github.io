The mean, which is also known as the average, is the total sum of values in a sample divided by the number of values in your sample.

Mathematically the mean is the sum of the values in a set divided by the number of values in the set.Â  For a given set of n values, one can add together all of the values in the set then divide by n to find the mean.
