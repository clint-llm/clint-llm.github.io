Vitamin E is absorbed in intestinal cells and is transported to the liver by chylomicrons.

In current literature, there have been described several different mechanisms of action of vitamin E on coagulation and platelet function. Vitamin K precursors need enzymes to convert into their active forms. It is thought that vitamin E may challenge these precursors for these enzymes. As a result, the circulation of vitamin-K induced coagulation factors is decreased.

Glutamate is needed for factor IX production, and vitamin E reduces the production of glutamate.****

“Toxic” vitamin E levels do not concentrate in the body in the same fashion as other fat-soluble vitamins like vitamins A and D.
