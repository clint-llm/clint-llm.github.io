The complications from Riedel thyroiditis are secondary to the involvement of the extra-thyroidal tissues by the fibrotic process. Tracheal compression can result in dyspnea, stridor, and respiratory failure. Occlusion of the neck vessels can result in venous thrombosis. Involvement of the sympathetic trunk can result in Horner syndrome. About 14% have involvement of the parathyroid glands, which results in hypoparathyroidism.

RiedelÂ thyroiditis has also been observed to occur in association with other fibrotic disorders. Mediastinal fibrosis can present as superior vena caval (SVC) syndrome due to occlusion of the SVC. Retroperitoneal fibrosis can present with back or flank pain secondary to hydroureteronephrosis. Abdominal pain due to sclerosing cholangitis or pancreatic fibrosis may also be present. Exophthalmos due to the involvement of retro-orbital soft tissues can also be a presenting feature.
