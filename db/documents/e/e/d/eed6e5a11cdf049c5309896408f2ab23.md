The most common dopaminergic adverse effects while taking tolcapone include nausea, postural hypotension, and dyskinesia. However, one study found a reduction of these adverse effects with a decrease in levodopa dosage. Other common adverse effects include diarrhea, urine discoloration, and drowsiness. Patients may also experience other central nervous system adverse effects such as insomnia, hallucinations, dizziness, headaches, depression, and fatigue.

A rare but serious adverse effect of tolcapone is hepatic dysfunction. Patients with liver toxicity may experience nausea, fatigue, anorexia, dark urine, or right upper quadrant pain. Studies have shown that tolcapone can increase liver enzyme levels, especially AST and ALT, 2Â to 3 times the upper limit of normal. In the same study, less than 2% of patients saw an increase greater than three times the upper limit of normal.

Most increases in liver enzymes were transient, even with the continuation of therapy.
