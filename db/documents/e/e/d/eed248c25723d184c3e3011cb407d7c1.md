Patients will typically present with a combination of back pain, radiculopathy, or myelopathy. The typical presentation of these lesions is back pain with a varying degree of neurological deficit related to compression of the neural elements.

Features distinguishing CES from CMS are described below:

- Onset: gradual and asymmetric in CES; sudden and bilateral in CMS

- Pain: severe and radicular in CES; rare and bilateral perineum/thighs

- Sensory: saddle anesthesia in both; asymmetric in CES; symmetric in CMS

- Motor: marked and asymmetric in CES, not marked and symmetric in CMS

- Reflex: only ankle jerk absent in CES; ankle jerk and knee jerk may be absent in CMS

- Autonomic: bladder dysfunction and impotency later in CES; bladder dysfunction and impotency early in CMS
