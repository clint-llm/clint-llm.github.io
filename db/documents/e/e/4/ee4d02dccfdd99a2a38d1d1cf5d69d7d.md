VP/KP is best performed using high-quality fluoroscopy to confirm the needle placement. This is best accomplished with the use of C-arm fluoroscopy. This procedure can be performed with one C-arm transitioning between anteroposterior AP and lateral images, or with two C-arms, one positioned for AP, and the other for lateral images. The two C-arm technique alleviates the need to constantly change the C-arm position. A list of types of equipment is given below

- Fluoroscopy****

- Spinal needle****

- Spinal needle stylets, with diamond-shaped multi-bevel and single-bevel****

- Polymethacrylate (PMMA) cement

- +/- Kyphoplasty balloon catheter (See Technique for details)
