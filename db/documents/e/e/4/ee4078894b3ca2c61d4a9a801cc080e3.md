Patients will most often present with a chief complaint of pain and swelling of the elbow. They will have a reduced range of motion (ROM) secondary to pain, and ROM should be avoided due to the risk of neurovascular injury. Because of this risk, a thorough neurovascular exam should be performed, including checking the following:

- Sensory and motor function distally, including median, radial, ulnar, anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) and posterior interosseous nerve (PIN)

- Distal pulses

- Forearm compartments

As is the case in any setting of trauma, a secondary exam should be performed to rule out any coexisting injuries that may possibly be masked by the primary injury. In the setting of the unresponsive or intoxicated patient in which a thorough secondary exam is not immediately attainable, inspection for any signs of skin ecchymosis, laceration, or edema should guide the physician to order appropriate imaging.
