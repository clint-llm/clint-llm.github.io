The major predisposing factor for sleep apnea is excess body weight. It has been estimated that 58% of moderate to severe OSA is attributable to obesity. The etiology of OSA involves both structural and nonstructural factors, including genetic factors.

Structural factors related to craniofacial bony anatomy that predisposes patients with OSA to pharyngeal collapse during sleep, e.g.:

- Retrognathia and micrognathia

- Maxillo-Mandibular hypoplasia

- Adenotonsillar hypertrophy, particularly in children and young adults

- High, arched palate (particularly in women)

Nonstructural risk factors for OSA include:

- Obesity

- Central fat distribution

- Male sex

- Age

- Postmenopausal state

- Alcohol use

- Sedative use

- Smoking

- Other conditions associated with the development of OSA are as follows: Hypothyroidism, Stroke, and Acromegaly.

Smoking and alcohol consumption are often considered as risk factors for sleep apnea despite the limited evidence, especially in females.

It is well-known that alcohol consumption before going to bed worsens sleep apnea in males and that smoking is related to snoring in males and females.

Drinking more than 23 g of alcohol per day was related to oxygen desaturations and snoring in a study of Japanese females.
