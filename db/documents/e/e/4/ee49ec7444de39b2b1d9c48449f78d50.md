Makeup should ideally be removed and the skin cleansed with an alcohol pad. An option for beginners is to mark injection sites with an erasable marker or pencil; however, injections should be performed just adjacent to the marking to avoid tattooing the skin. There is significant variability in injection technique, and injections should be tailored to the individual patient's needs. Male patients typically have larger and stronger facial muscles and require higher doses.

The glabellar complex is the most commonly injected facial area overall.

The procerus is also located in the glabellar region. If there is no horizontal rhytid when the patient draws the eyebrows medially, chemical denervation of the procerus may not be required.

The frontalis is injected either intramuscularly or superficially just under the subcutaneous tissues. In general, injection is performed at least 1.5 cm above the superior orbital rim to prevent ptosis.

Injection of the orbicularis oculi should be done superficially, approximately 1 to 2 mm deep, with small wheals of toxin, injected directly under the skin 1 cm lateral to the lateral orbital rim or 1 cm lateral to the lateral canthus.

A “chemical brow lift” may be performed to raise the height of the eyebrow and can be aimed at medial elevation, lateral elevation, or both. If the provider aims to perform a lateral brow lift, 8 to 10 units of toxin can be injected just inferiorly to the lateral eyebrow. Weakening the superolateral OO will cause unopposed elevation of the lateral brow by the frontalis in this region. Chen et al. describe 3 injection sites just inferior to the lateral eyebrow, starting at the superior most point of the brow and working laterally. A medial brow lift may be performed by injection of the CS, depressor supercilii (DS), and procerus via unopposed elevation by the frontalis. Injection of the DS should be performed superficially, at or within the level of the eyebrow. Along with slow injection, these methods will help to prevent accidental injection into the frontalis muscle superiorly.
