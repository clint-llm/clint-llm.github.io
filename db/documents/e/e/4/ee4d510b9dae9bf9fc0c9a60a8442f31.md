Haloperidol is a first-generation (typical) antipsychotic that is a commonly used drug worldwide. Haloperidol is used to manage positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions. It is FDA-approved for treating schizophrenia, Tourette syndrome, severe behavioral disorders in children (combative and explosive hyperexcitability), and hyperactivity in children (impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance). This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, administration, adverse event profile, toxicity, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent to the interprofessional team members for the use of haloperidol appropriately for management of various indications.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of haloperidol. 
- Describe the adverse effects of haloperidol. 
- Summarize the appropriate monitoring of haloperidol. 
- Review some interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance haloperidol and improve outcomes.
