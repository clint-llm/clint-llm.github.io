Lupus erythematosus is a multisystem disorder that predominately affects the skin. There are several types of cutaneous lupus. The most common types are acute cutaneous lupus (ACLE), subacute cutaneous lupus (SCLE), and discoid lupus (DLE). Dr. James Gilliam described the most commonly used classification of cutaneous lesions in lupus erythematosus. Gilliam segregated skin lesions into those that are specific and those that are not specifically based upon whether an interface dermatitis was seen on histopathologic examination. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of discoid lupus, its presentation, and management by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe how genetic and environmental factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of DLE.
- Review the categorization of the lesions associated with DLE.
- Summarize how topical and intralesional corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, oral antimalarials, and corticosteroid-sparing immunomodulatory agents are used for treating DLE lesions.
- Explain how monitoring adverse effects of the medications by all interprofessional team members is crucial for a patient's comprehensive recovery.
