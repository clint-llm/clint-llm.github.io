Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a rare systemic autoimmune disease with an overlapping feature of at least two connective tissue diseases (CTD), including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), systemic sclerosis (SSc), polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) along with the presence of a distinctive antibody, anti-U1-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) previously known as an antibody to extractable nuclear antigen (ENA).

A revised set of diagnostic criteria for MCTD, which divides the features of the disease into the following four categories, was proposed by a consensus panel in Japan in 2019.

- Raynaud phenomenon

- Immunologic manifestation such as anti–U1-RNP antibody

- Organ involvement includes pulmonary arterial hypertension, aseptic meningitis, trigeminal neuropathy

Overlapping manifestations of SLE-like, systemic sclerosis, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis may present.
