Clinically, squamous cell carcinoma arises in a background of sun-damaged skin often from precursor lesions called actinic keratoses. The most common areas for squamous cell carcinoma to occur are the face, neck, bald scalp, extensor forearms, dorsal hands, and shins. The color varies from flesh toned to erythematous with variable degrees of scale, crusting, ulceration, and hyperkeratosis. Occasionally, telangiectases with or without active bleeding may be present. Squamous cell carcinoma can be flat, nodular, and even plaque-like in some cases with significant induration and/or subcutaneous spread noticeable on palpation. Squamous cell carcinoma can occasionally be painful and tender, and these may be signs of perineural invasion.
