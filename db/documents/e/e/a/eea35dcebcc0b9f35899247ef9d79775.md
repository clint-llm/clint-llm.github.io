Chondroblastoma is a benign, chondroid-producing neoplasm composed of chondroblasts. It accounts for less than 1% of all bone tumors and usually arises in the epiphyses or apophysis of skeletally immature patients. The treatment of choice of chondroblastoma is surgical. In general, chondroblastoma has a good prognosis, and patients often experience full resolution after surgical treatment. This activity reviews the pathophysiology and presentation of chondroblastoma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of chondroblastoma.
- Describe the evaluation of a patient suspected of having chondroblastoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for chondroblastoma.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by chondroblastoma.
