An estimated 10% to 25% of the world’s population is infected by a dermatophyte. Of these infections, tinea pedis and manuum are the most common clinical presentations with tinea pedis occurring in up to 70% of adults.

There are many epidemiological studies on tinea pedis, but little research is available on the epidemiology of tinea manuum. The rate of tinea manuum can range from 0.3-13% with the variability based upon geographic location.

One study of collected cases of tinea manuum showed that “the two feet, one hand syndrome” is the most frequent (65%) clinical presentation, followed by bilateral tinea pedis with bilateral tinea manuum (19.3%), unilateral tinea manuum (11.8%), and bilateral tinea manuum (3.9%).

Adolescent and adult males are the more commonly affected populations.
