Ingestion of undercooked or raw meat from domestic or sylvatic animals containing encysted larvae of Trichinella species can lead to Trichinellosis. T. spiralis results from the consumption of inadequately cooked or raw pork from domestic pigs.

Enteric or gastrointestinal phase: After ingestion of infected meat by humans, the enzymes pepsin and hydrochloric acid act in the stomach and cause the release of the 1st stage of the larvae. These larvae invade the small intestine. Invasion can be asymptomatic or sometimes associated with abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Larvae then turn into adults and mate. Female trichinella worms produce larvae, which completes the gastrointestinal or enteric phase.

Systemic (parenteral) phase: Larvae enter the lymphatic circulation and then into the blood, reaching skeletal muscles, myocardium, and brain which are high in oxygen content. This phase leads to systemic symptoms like fevers, myositis, myalgias, periorbital edema and can even cause myocarditis and encephalitis.

The larvae provoke significant eosinophilia, especially in patients who develop cardiac and CNS dysfunction.

Life cycle:

- The life cycle of trichinellosis divides into two stages: 1) domestic cycle and 2) sylvatic cycle

- Domestic cycle: Affects domestic animals, particularly swine, rodents, and horses
- Sylvatic cycle: Affects wildlife like bear, wild boar, and moose
