The nerve innervation to the sternohyoid muscle derives from the first, second, and third cervical nerve roots (C1-C3). These nerve roots form a plexus called the ansa cervicalis. The ansa cervicalis provides motor innervation to the sternohyoid muscle. The ansa cervicalis nerve also innervates the omohyoid muscle, the sternohyoid muscle, and the thyrohyoid muscle.
