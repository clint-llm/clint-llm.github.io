The pentalogy of Cantrell constitutes a variety of congenital malformations and exhibits variable presentations. Although the cause is yet unknown, the condition can often be diagnosed prenatally. While some suggest early intervention, others believe a step-wise procedure should be followed to manage this condition. A plan should be developed in a staged approach tailored to each patient. While the physical exam may reveal the apparent defects in the ventral abdominal wall, imaging is necessary to assess the full extent of the pentalogy of Cantrell. While obstetricians are usually the first to note abnormalities in first-trimester ultrasound, pediatric and family providers, cardiologists, and plastic surgeons are relevant to the team approach for this patient. Immediate neonatal resuscitation should be performed. Resuscitation is followed by the temporary covering of the protruding organs (heart and omphalocele). Counseling regarding the prognosis should be provided accordingly.

An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to preoperative and postoperative care can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Before a surgical procedure, the role of the imaging cannot be underscored enough. If the patient is to be discharged home with a wound, consultation should be made with a social worker and community nurses who can monitor the patient and make referrals as needed. A nutritionist should help devise a tailored schedule for feeding and thriving.
