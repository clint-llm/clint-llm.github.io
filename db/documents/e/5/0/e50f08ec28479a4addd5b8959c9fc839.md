Large scale metanalyses have also shown the rising CVD and vascular disease risk with a rise in systolic and diastolic blood pressures, with almost doubling of risk of death from heart disease and stroke with rising SBP of as much as 20 and DBP of 10mmHg.

The prognosis depends on blood pressure control and is favorable only if the blood pressures attain adequate control; however, complications may develop in some patients as hypertension is a progressive disease.

Adequate control and lifestyle measures only serve to delay the development and progression of sequelae such as chronic kidney disease and renal failure.
