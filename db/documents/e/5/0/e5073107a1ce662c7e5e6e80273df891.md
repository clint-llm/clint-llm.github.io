Mammary duct ectasia is like many other benign diseases that have low morbidity, and without mortality, It is not adequately researched. The medical literature solely relies on sporadic case reports and case series studies regarding investigations and management.

There are no randomized controlled trials on treatment options; hence there is no consensus on therapeutic modalities. Treatment decisions are made similar to a known range of associated problems with the same or other diseases.

The main role when dealing with patients with MDE for the general or breast surgeon is not to miss breast malignancy.

Good communication and teamwork involving a general or breast surgeon, radiology department, and histopathology are essential for individual case discussions aiming to provide the best choice of therapeutic management.

The outcome of treatment is mainly related to the chronicity and severity of the disease. Generally, the prognosis remains good by the fact that MDE is a benign disease with no increased risk of malignancy.

More research is required to disclose the exact etiology and disease prevention or control in the future.
