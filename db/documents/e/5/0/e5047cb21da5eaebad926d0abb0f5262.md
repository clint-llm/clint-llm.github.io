Increased thickness of the stratum corneum can be due to several exogenous or endogenous processes and is related to increased production of keratin in the outer portion of the skin layer. In the majority of cases in clinical practice, it is mostly due to chronic physical or chemical damage such as friction or the use of aggressive soaps (especially those with a basic pH) but can also derive from chronic inflammation or a side-effect of different drugs, including chemotherapy.

Hyperkeratosis happening in the context of a reactive state of the skin is the prototypical result of dermatitis. Another cause of hyperkeratosis is a nutritional deficit, especially in vitamin A deficiency, causing phrynoderma, where the skin can exhibit keratin plugs and hyperkeratosis of the hair follicles, atrophy, and squamous metaplasia of the sebaceous glands.
