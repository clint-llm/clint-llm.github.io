In neonates and the pediatric population, PFO doesn't require treatment of followup. PFO is vital in some congenital heart conditions that are dependent on blood shunting at the atrial level.

In adults, treatment for PFO is mainly indicated in a patient with cryptogenic strokes. Different approaches have been suggested, including:

- Medical therapy mainly includes antithrombotic medications ( aspirin), especially in those with stroke due to embolism. Anticoagulant is indicated if the stroke is associated with vein thrombosis.

- Percutaneous device closure: Multiple studies and trials shown the percutaneous device close of PFO is superior to medical therapy in reducing the risk for recurrence in patients less than 60 years old.

- Surgical approach to close PFO is pursued in the following conditions:

- PFO that is larger than 25 mm
- Failure of the PFO to close by percutaneous method
- The inadequate rim at the edge-this can make it difficult for percutaneous closure

Surgical approach results in complete closure and avoiding the need for long term anticoagulant. However, surgery does require open-heart surgery and the usual risks of the procedure.
