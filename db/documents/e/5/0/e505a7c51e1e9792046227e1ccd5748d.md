Inert saprophytic colonization of preexisting cavitary spaces in pulmonary parenchyma, its presentation, as well as complications thereof, are referred to as aspergilloma. It falls within the broader class of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.

A cavitary space with well-defined walls sequesters the fungal spores from both mechanical clearance, as well as immune eradication.

Description of cavitary aspergillus disease dates back to John Hughes Bennett in 1842, whose description of the soft tuberculous matter in multiple varied sized cavities in the lung closely resembles aspergillus disease. Deve in 1938 first formally described an aspergilloma and named it “mega mycetoma.”

Belcher and Plummer first formulated the classification of aspergilloma in 1960.

If the surrounding lung parenchyma appeared normal and the cavity containing the aspergillus nidus was entirely lined by ciliated epithelium, it was termed as a **simple aspergilloma**.

On the other hand, **a complex aspergilloma**is one lined by extensively damaged surrounding lung parenchyma with epithelial distortion or destruction and fibrosis. Wall thickness of a complex aspergilloma is defined to be more than 0.3 cm.
