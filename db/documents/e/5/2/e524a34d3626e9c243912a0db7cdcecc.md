Prognosis is better in patients when the underlying disease state initially caused the pain can be cured, corrected, or managed, as in a shoulder replacement in osteoarthritis. Patients with osteoarthritis and centralized pain report pain reduction with pharmacological therapy aimed at osteoarthritis and an increase in adverse pain outcomes following joint replacement surgery.

When osteoarthritis is comorbid with central pain syndrome, the severity of the patient's pain does not correlate with the radiographic severity of osteoarthritis. Furthermore, these patients with radiological evidence of osteoarthritis in a single joint were at increased risk of having multiple painful joints.

Central sensitization also plays a role in inflammatory arthritis. It occurs in a significant subset of the patient population.
