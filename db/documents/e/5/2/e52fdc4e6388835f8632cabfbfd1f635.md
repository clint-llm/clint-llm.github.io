An injected form of oxytocin is administered intravenously using the drip method in the setting of delayed and potentially complicated labor. The same route of administration is indicated for both incomplete and inevitable abortions as well. Lastly, in the case of persistent uterine bleeding after giving birth, oxytocin may be given either intramuscularly or intravenously.

Dosing for labor induction/augmentation:

- 0.5 to 2 milliunits/minute IV, with increases of 1 to 2 milliunits every 15 to 40 minutes until there is an established contraction pattern.

Dosing for postpartum hemorrhage:

- Prophylactic dosing: 10 units IM once following placental delivery.

- Therapeutic dosing: 60 to 200 milliunits/minute IV.
