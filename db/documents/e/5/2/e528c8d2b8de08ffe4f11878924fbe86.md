The function of peristalsis within the small intestine is three-fold: (1) the mixing of contents with intestinal and exocrine secretions, (2) uniformly and evenly exposing contents to the mucosal surface of intestinal cells, and (3) propelling contents distally into the large intestine at a rate that allows for optimal absorption and digestion.

The function of peristalsis within the colon is to mix, store, and slow the transportation of intestinal contents and to aid in the rapid evacuation of feces. While peristaltic waves in the small intestine are frequent, peristaltic waves within the large intestine occur approximately 2 to 4 times daily and are most substantial in the hour following a meal.
