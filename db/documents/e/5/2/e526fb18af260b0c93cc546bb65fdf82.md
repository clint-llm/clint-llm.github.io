Penicillin is one of the most commonly used antibiotics globally; it has a wide range of clinical indications. Penicillin is effective against many different infections involving gram-positive cocci, gram-positive rods (e.g., Listeria), most anaerobes, and gram-negative cocci (e.g., Neisseria).Proteus mirabilis, Shigella, H. influenzae, Salmonella, and E. coli. Third-generation penicillin such as carbenicillin is also able to penetrate gram-negative bacterial porin channels. Fourth-generation penicillins such as piperacillin are effective against the same bacterial strains as third-generation penicillins and Klebsiella, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacteroides fragilis.
