**Sputum Culture**

If the pathogenicity organisms grow after 24 hours of incubation in the culture dish, the result is positive. Some sample dishes will keep incubating longer, depending on microbial flora present and the need to identify and semiquantitative isolates and perform antimicrobial susceptibility tests. Conversely, if no bacteria or fungi grow in 6 to 8 weeks for solid culture media or six weeks for liquid culture media, the result is negative.

**Sputum Staining Tests**

-  Gram stain test: The bacteria detected by the test will be Gram-positive or Gram-negative.

- Common Gram-positive bacteria include Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus, Listeria, Enterococcus, and Clostridium.
- Common Gram-negative bacteria include E. coli, Klebsiella species, Proteus species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

-  AFB stain test: The bacteria detected by the test will be positive or negative.

- AFB stain test positive result: the acid-fast bacilli, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, retain the red or pink color.
- AFB stain test negative result: no red or pink bacteria are found in the stained slide.

-  GMS stain test: The fungal organisms detected by the test will be positive or negative.

- GMS test positive result: black or brown wall from fungal organisms or worms such as Pneumocystis jirovecii are found.
- GMS test negative result: no black or brown stained fungal organisms or worms are found.

Sputum biochemical tests: The motility, McFarland standard, catalase, and oxidase tests are positive or negative.

-  Organisms motility test: the test is performed in Gram-negative enteric bacilli, and the result will be either motile or nonmotile.

- Motile (positive): organisms will spread out from the stab line and produce cloudiness or turbidity throughout the medium.
- Nonmotile (negative):  organisms will remain along the stab line of inoculation.

-  McFarland standard test: The test is used to standardize the number of bacteria in liquid suspensions by the turbidity of bacteria in the McFarland standard vial or tube.        The test result arises by comparing the turbidity of a bacterial suspension to different concentrations of McFarland standard solutions.

-  FTM test: the test is used to detect the aerotolerance of bacteria. 

- Obligate aerobes, such as Pseudomonas spp., requiring oxygen for growth, will only grow toward the oxygen-rich surface layer.
- Obligate anaerobes, which cannot grow with oxygen, will only grow on the bottom of the tube. 
- Microaerophiles frequently grow below the oxygen-rich layer.
- Gram-negative, facultative or aerotolerant anaerobes generally can grow throughout the broth but will mostly grow between the oxygen-rich and oxygen-free area.

- Catalase test: The test is used to differentiate staphylococci from streptococci by detecting the presence of catalase.

- Catalase-positive: the organisms can produce catalase, which will generate oxygen bubbles after adding 3% hydrogen peroxide.
- Catalase-negative: the organisms cannot produce catalase, and there is no reaction after adding 3% hydrogen peroxide.

- Oxidase test: The test is used to detect the presence of cytochrome c oxidases.

- Oxidase-positive: there is a deep purple-blue or blue color change within 10 to 30 seconds.
- Oxidase-negative: no purple-blue color or no color change.

**Sputum Nucleic Acid Amplification Test**

If the RT-PCR amplification is successful, the result is positive. However, if it is not successful, the result is negative.

**Sputum Cytology Examination**

If a few white blood cells and no abnormal cells have been found in the sputum sample, that means the sputum cytology examination is regular, and other reasons may cause the patient's symptoms.

**Sputum Antimicrobial Susceptibility Test**

If antibiotics inhibit the growth of an organism, that means the antibiotics are working to treat the patient infected by the organism, and the antibiotics are susceptible. Conversely, if the antibiotic does not inhibit the organism's growth, it means the antibiotics are not adequate for the patient's treatment, and the antibiotics are resistant.
