Compared to idiopathic PD, PPS conditions progress more rapidly and culminate in death earlier.

**Lewy Body Disease**

In LBD, symptoms progress rapidly, with an estimated survival of 1.8 to 9.5 years. Studies show that survival for LBD is shorter compared to AD. Cognitive decline is progressive, and the median time to severe dementia is approximately five years. Parkinsonism and non-motor symptoms, including autonomic dysfunction and neuropsychiatric deficits, worsen over time.

**Multiple System Atrophy**

Compared to idiopathic PD, the disease progression of MSA is much quicker. From symptom onset, autonomic dysfunction begins in 2.5 years, wheelchair confinement occurs in 3.5 to 5 years, and patients are bedridden for 5 to 8 years. Following diagnosis, death occurs after 6 to 10 years in most patients.

**Corticobasal Degeneration**

CBD progresses rapidly to death, with the most common cause of mortality being complications from immobility or dysphagia (pneumonia and sepsis).

**Progressive Supranuclear Palsy**

The progression of PSP is rapid, and patients usually become dependent on care within three to four years from symptom onset. Death occurs approximately six to nine years after the diagnosis.
