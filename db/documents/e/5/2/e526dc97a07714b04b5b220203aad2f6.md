Inotersen is prepared in an injection form, with a recommended dose of 284 milligrams once weekly. Initial doses should be given by a caregiver, and patients and/or additional caregivers may be trained under qualified health professionals if self-administration is desired for subsequent dosing. The medication is administered subcutaneously in the upper thigh, outer arm, or abdominal regions, rotating sites with each weekly dose. Additionally, the medication solution should be allowed to reach room temperature prior to dosing. As such, providers should allow cooling for up to 30 minutes if previously stored in a refrigerator.

Further, appropriate bloodwork parameters should be assessed before, during, and after inotersen therapy. Parameters measured prior to and during treatment include platelet counts, serum creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate, urine protein to creatinine ratio, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and total bilirubin levels. The previously mentioned parameters should be monitored for up to 8 weeks upon discontinuation with the addition of a complete urinalysis.
