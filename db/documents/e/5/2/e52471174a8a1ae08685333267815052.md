R. equi is a facultative intracellular pathogen that infects macrophage and survives inside lysosomes. The resulting defective intracellular processing leads to necrotizing granulomatous reaction dominated by macrophages filled with granular cytoplasm that is PAS stain-positive and may contain large numbers of gram-positive coccobacillary forms. The necrotizing granulomas may subsequently coalesce to form abscesses.
