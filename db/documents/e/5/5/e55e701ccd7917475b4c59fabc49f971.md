Although the majority of patients do recover from brachial neuritis, complications are not uncommon. Because of the atrophy and weakness that is associated, patients can have the positions of their joints shifted slightly such as in the shoulders, wrist, and hands. Because of this, the risk of subluxation or impingement is higher. Adhesive capsulitis of the shoulder could also result which will cause pain and a limited range of motion to the shoulders. Patients with persistent residual pain and weakness can also have trouble doing everyday tasks such as reaching or lifting objects or doing repetitive tasks with their shoulders and/or arms. Patients who have repeat episodes of brachial neuritis, such as those who have the hereditary form, are also at a higher risk of getting these complications.
