Most patients who contract the Saint Louis Encephalitis Virus (SLEV) are relatively asymptomatic or have mild flu-like symptoms from which they will fully recover. The overall case-fatality rate for Saint Louis encephalitis is 5% to 15%. The risk of fatal disease increases with age and is about 20% in patients over 60 versus 3% to 6% in children and young adults. During the first two weeks of infection, death is often due to the encephalitis, whereas deaths that occur after two weeks are more often attributable to complications of hospitalization, such as pneumonia.
