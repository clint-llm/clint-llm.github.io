Though the etiology of the disorder is unknown, certain psychosocial factors do seem apparent in those with the diagnosis, including a traumatic childhood, experiencing the death of a loved one at a young age, and abandonment. Through the fabrication of a medical illness, these patients are able to receive the attention and, sometimes, care within the healthcare community that they might not have had at home. Of the relatively few patients who have accepted their diagnosis, almost always report that their intention was to create a sense of importance and find a place of "belonging."
