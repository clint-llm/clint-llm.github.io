Parotid surgery is an emotionally intense experience for the patient and the family, with most fearing postoperative disfigurement. Fortunately, the results are frequently excellent for experienced surgeons. It is the physician’s duty to explain clearly to the patient what to expect, tailoring such discussions to the scenario of each individual patient. A small benign lesion may less likely result in permanent facial paralysis but is most dependent upon its location within the gland itself. An extensive malignant tumor poses a significant risk for facial nerve injury. An interdisciplinary approach is crucial to success. A free flap surgeon is consulted when significant resection is expected to discuss the pros and cons of vascularized tissue reconstruction versus local flap reconstruction. Nurses familiar with head and neck surgery are the keystone to an optimal postoperative outcome. They can recognize a hematoma that needs urgent drainage, a seroma, or a salivary fistula. The role of the radiologist and the pathologist cannot be overemphasized. Preoperative delineation of the tumor by an experienced radiologist can minimize surprises during surgery and help tremendously when counseling the patient since the surgeon had a clear idea of what type of parotidectomy he will be performing. A pathologist familiar with salivary glands is essential for accurate interpretation of FNAC, which allows appropriate patient counseling and might advise and wait a see approach in some cases like a Warthin tumor. When the diagnosis of malignancy is confirmed or in the event of spillage of pleomorphic adenoma during surgery, a radiation oncologist is consulted to discuss the need for adjuvant radiotherapy.
