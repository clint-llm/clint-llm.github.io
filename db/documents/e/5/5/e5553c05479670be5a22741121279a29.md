General and routine cleaning and maintenance of the probes should be done as per the manufacturer's recommended instructions for use. Images are best obtained with the patient in a supine position when using the curvilinear probe and in the lithotomy position when using the endovaginal approach with the endocavitary probe.Â  For a transabdominal exam, it is recommended that the patient have a full bladder or not have voided recently to use the urine-filled bladder as an echogenic window. A small amount of gel should be applied to the curvilinear probe, and the abdominopelvic region should be scanned in the longitudinal and short axes.

For a transvaginal exam, it is recommended that the patient empty her bladder just prior to the exam, as the cervix serves as an appropriate window with this approach, and a full bladder may displace uterine anatomy to the extent that detection and measurement of pregnancy may be difficult. The endocavitary probe is prepared by placing a small amount of ultrasound gel at the tip of the probe and placing a probe cover (which often has pre-placed ultrasound gel in place) over the endocavitary probe. Vaseline gel may then be placed over the cover before placement in the vaginal vault.
