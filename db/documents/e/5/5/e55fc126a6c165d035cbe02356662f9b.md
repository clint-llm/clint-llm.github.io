**Blood-Based Biomarkers**

**Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA)**

PSA, a member of the kallikrein gene family, was first identified and isolated in 1979. It is secreted by prostatic ductal and acinar epithelium and hence highly organ-specific. PSA circulated in free (free PSA-f PSA) and inbound forms (Complexed, cPSA) bound to proteins. Its expression is androgen dependent. It is a crucial tool for the early detection, staging, treatment planning, and prognosis of prostate cancer. The widespread use of PSA testing in the 1990s led to increased prostate cancer diagnoses and a subsequent decline in mortality rates for this disease. It is due in part to population-based PSA screening.

Even though PSA is an excellent biomarker, it is organ-specific but not disease-specific. The basal layer and basement membrane violation allow PSA to escape and enter the bloodstream, increasing serum PSA levels.

Treatment with 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors has been shown to reduce PSA levels by around 50% when treated for 12 months.

Still, multiple guidelines recommend PSA as the primary tool for initial prostate cancer screening. However, experts have yet to agree on the subset of patients to screen, when to start screening, and other factors to consider. All guidelines recommend that prostate cancer screening be an informed decision made after shared decision-making and a risk-benefit analysis.

The American Urological Association's (AUA) current recommendations are as follows:

- PSA screening in men under the age of 40 years is not recommended.

- Routine screening at average risk in men aged 40 to 54 is not recommended.

- For men aged 55 to 69, deciding to undergo PSA screening involves weighing the benefits of reducing the rate of metastatic prostate cancer and preventing prostate cancer death against the known potential harms associated with screening and treatment.

- Shared decision-making is recommended for men aged 55 to 69 years. PSA screening should be considered. Proceed based on the individual's values and preferences.

- Routine PSA screening in men aged 70+ years is not recommended, nor in men with less than a 10 to 15-year life expectancy.

A baseline PSA level that predicts the likelihood of prostate malignancy detection and the chance of developing high-grade prostate malignancy can customize the rescreening intervals. According to several studies, screening intervals of two to four years are unlikely to miss curable prostate cancer. Therefore, AUA discourages annual screening as a routine and recommends 2-year screening as a reasonable approach. The AUA suggests that men over 60 with PSA levels below 1.0 ng/mL may benefit from prolonged screening intervals (e.g., four years.)

Prostatic risk stratification biomarkers are primarily intended for use in lower-risk and selected borderline patients ( a subset with PIRADS 3 lesion on multiparametric MRI) with slightly elevated PSA levels (typically 4 ng/mL to 10 ng/mL), where a negative result would probably halt further testing, prostatic imaging, biopsies, and other diagnostic procedures.

However, this approach is less practical if the PSA is >10 or the patient is in the high-risk category. The high-risk group encompasses men of African descent, those with a family history of prostate malignancy, those with germline mutations that increase the risk for prostate cancer (BRCA1, ATM, CHEK2, BRAC2), men with a family history of multiple malignancies or Lynch syndrome, and those with known Agent Orange exposure.

**PSA Derivatives**

Clinical decision-making is enhanced by using PSA derivatives, like PSA density, velocity, doubling time, age-adjusted values, and, recently, different molecular derivatives. PSA velocity is the rate of change of PSA over a year, while PSA density is the PSA-derived computation of total PSA divided by prostatic volume. The PSA doubling time is needed for a rising trending PSA to double in value. It gauges the rate-dependent exponential rise in serum PSA over time. These PSA-derived metrics are used for decision-making regarding prostate biopsy in an early detection setting.

PSA density shows substantially better predictive information among the derivatives than PSA velocity. A higher PSA density has a more likelihood of clinically significant prostate cancer, particularly in smaller prostates, when a value of 0.15ng/ml/cc was taken.

According to research, a PSA density of 0.1 to 0.15 ng/mL/cc or higher is considered significant (higher risk). In contrast, a value lower than 0.09 ng/mL/cc is considered insignificant (less than a 4% chance).

Studies have shown a correlation between a low percentage of fPSA and aggressive pathological features.

The US FDA approved using fPSA as a biomarker to enhance screening in males with blood PSA levels of 4 ng to 10 ng/ml and a negative digital rectal examination. A percentage fPSA cutoff of 18% has improved the detection of prostate cancer in men when compared to total PSA alone. Such patients are recommended for prostate biopsy. The prostate malignancy detection was 56% in men with a percentage of fPSA <10 % compared to 8% when the percentage of fPSA was >25%.

National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends incorporating the percentage of fPSA for decision-making for prostate biopsy and recommends a cutoff of 10%.

**fPSA (Free PSA) Isoforms**

The serum isoforms of fPSA, namely pro-PSA, benign PSA (b PSA), and intact fPSA, exist in equal concentrations in serum and are promising biomarkers. Studies have shown significant levels of truncated forms of PSA in malignant prostatic tissue like (-2) pro-PSA. Applying (-2) pro-PSA has been validated as a screening biomarker before a biopsy.

It is also a strong predictor for histological aggressiveness (Gleason score of 7 or more.) Studies have shown (-2) pro-PSA is superior to PSA and percentage Free PSA as a biomarker in predicting prostate malignancy in men planned for biopsy with serum PSA of 4-10 ng/mL. In addition, it correlated with the pathological aggressiveness of the tumor.

**Prostate Health Index (PHI)**

Prostatic Health Index (PHI) is a blood-based biomarker that can predict the risk of aggressive prostate malignancy (Gleason's score is more than or equal to 7) at biopsy. This assay analyzes tPSA, fPSA, and (-2) pro-PSA levels. PHI was approved in 2012 by USFDA to diagnose prostate cancer in men aged 50 and above, with a clinically negative DRE and PSA of 4-10 ng/mL.

PHI has consistently shown superiority over total PSA (tPSA) and Free % PSA (fPSA) in the early detection of prostate cancer. As a result, it is added to various web-based risk assessment calculators like the PCPT calculator.

**Human Kallikerin 2(hK2) and 4K Score**

Human Kallikrein 2(hK2) shares many similarities with PSA. It is also regulated by androgens and has an identical specificity for the prostate. However, in contrast to PSA, it is selectively expressed in cancerous tissue, and its expression correlates with the aggressiveness of malignancy and biochemical recurrence. Combining fPSA with hK2 has increased the cancer detection rate at a PSA range of 4 to 10 ng/mL. In the 4K score assay, the four kallikrein proteins—tPSA, fPSA, intact PSA, and hK2—were integrated. The 4K score has been included in the NCCN prostate cancer early detection guidelines.

It predicts the likelihood of biopsy-positive prostate cancer when paired with clinical characteristics, including age and prior negative biopsies. It also accurately predicts the aggressiveness of cancer.

**Serum Protein Panel**

The three prostate cancer biomarkers, FilamenA, FilamenB, and Keratin19, have been combined into a novel serum protein panel for disease screening and prognosis due to recent studies. The panel of these biomarkers with PSA outperformed PSA alone in diagnosing, predicting aggressiveness, and differentiating cancer from benign prostatic hyperplasia.

**Urine Based Biomarkers**

**Prostate Cancer Antigen 3 (PCA3)**

The ease of collecting urine specimens and the knowledge regarding the exfoliation of prostate cells in the urine have made urine a source for potential biomarker research.

Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) evaluation revealed that PCA3 performed better than PSA in identifying prostate malignancy.

The commercial assay of PCA3 was FDA-approved in the US in 2012 to assist decision-making in men aged 50 and above and a previous negative biopsy. European Association of Urology (EAU) also recommends the same. After a prostate massage or DRE, urine is obtained to increase the sensitivity of the PCA3 assay. There has been substantial research on the diagnostic value of PCA3 in post-prostatic massage urine. All studies have shown that the PCA3 scores closely matched the likelihood of a positive biopsy.

Studies have reported a 14% positive biopsy rate if PCA3 levels are below 5, compared to 70% when PCA3 is above 100.

**TMPRSS2-ERG Gene Fusions and PCA3**

With the discovery of gene fusions in prostate malignancy, considerable research has been performed to harness its utility as prostate cancer biomarkers. The most common gene alteration involved with prostate cancer is the fusion of the androgen-regulated gene Trans Membrane Protease, Serine 2 (TMPRSS2), with the N-terminal deleted ERG coding region.

A multicentric study of 1,312 men comparing post-DRE urine levels of TMPRSS2:ERG and PCA3 with serum PSA showed clear superiority of the panel of TMPRSS2:ERG with PCA3 in the detection of clinically significant malignancy at biopsy.

**Select MDx (DLX1,HOXC6)**

The Select MDx is an RT-PCR assay analyzing urine specimens after DRE along with other risk factors for early detection of prostate malignancy and decision-making regarding biopsy. This three-gene panel assay has enhanced the identification of high-grade cancer by integrating HOXC6, TDRD1, and DLX1 mRNA levels in urine with other clinical indicators. In addition, Van Neste et al have validated it with other clinical decision-making tools like the PCA3 assay and PCPT risk calculator.

**Annexin A3**

It has been discovered that the presence of annexin, a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein, in urine is negatively associated with the detection of prostate malignancy. Researchers evaluated the utility of analyzing Annexin A3 levels in post-DRE urine as a stand-alone or in conjunction with serum PSA for clinical decision-making before a prostate needle biopsy.

Investigators showed that Annexin A3 enhanced the ability of PSA to predict malignancy in needle biopsy with an AUC of 0.81. Cao et al. studied a multiplex assay by combining urine annexin A3, PCA3, TMPRSS2: ERG, and sarcosine for prostate biopsy decision-making.

**ExoDx Prostate (IntelliSore)**

Exosomes are tiny extracellular vesicles (size: 40–150 nm) released by various cell types, including cancerous cells. They contain lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Prostate-derived exosomes may serve as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as they are a source of proteins and miRNA.

ExoDx prostate Intelliscore is a urine exosomal RNA-based assay to assess the expression of the prooncogenic genes ERG, PCA3, and SPDEF and generate a score. The test is recommended for males over 50 and PSA 2 to 10 ng/mL who are being evaluated for a preliminary biopsy. It is applied with other standards of care (SOC) criteria to assess the likelihood of benign conditions and Gleason 7 and above prostate cancer on an initial biopsy.

This assay will help safely reduce unnecessary biopsies. This score predicted high-grade cancer (Gleason 7 and above) with a negative predictive value of >90%.

A large cohort study on 774 patients in the US found that the ExoDx assay, in conjunction with SOC features, outperformed the ExoDx assay or SOC variables when used alone in predicting the presence of Gleason grade 7 or above and negative biopsies.

**Prostarix Risk score**

It is a urine-based assay to assist clinicians in decision-making regarding biopsy in a grey zone, i.e., negative DRE or a mildly elevated PSA level setting. The quantitative analysis of these amino acids helps to calculate the risk score and detect malignancy-related metabolic abnormalities. Studies have shown that the panel's performance in diagnosing prostate cancer (AUC=0.64) was superior to that of serum PSA (AUC=0.53) and the PCPT calculator alone (AUC=0.61.)

**Prostate Cancer Cell Lines in Urine**

Prostate cancer cells can be found in post-DRE urine with multiplex immunofluorescence cytology staining for AMACR, Nucleolin, DAPI, and Nkx3.1. A sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 100% were achieved in a study of a cohort of 50 patients.

The NCCN has recognized the Prostate Health Index (PHI), 4K score, ExoDx Intelliscore, My Prostate Score, Select MDx, and ConfirmMDx (a tissue-based confirmation test).

**How To Best Use Risk-Stratification Bioassays in Prostate Cancer Screening**

Although their precise role in prostate cancer screening is still being determined, it is suggested that risk-stratification bioassays are most helpful in patients with persistently elevated PSA levels who are llow-riskor borderline/equivocal cases where the result will be used, if negative, to help make a clinical decision not to pursue further prostate cancer diagnostic testing or screening procedures immediately.
