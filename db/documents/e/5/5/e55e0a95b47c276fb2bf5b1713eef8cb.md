Tissue processed from endoscopic duodenal biopsies is put on slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H and E). Other staining is guided by history and clinical suspicion and includes Giemsa (Giardia), Alcian Blue (gastric metaplasia, adenoma), Periodic-Acid Schiff (Whipple Disease) and Masson trichome (collagenous sprue).

Duodenal biopsies should only be performed when there is clinical suspicion and not performed on all patients with abdominal pain. One example was from a case series in which random duodenal biopsies were taken from patients with no or minimal symptoms, which revealed normal or near-normal histology, vs. a cohort with abdominal pain that only had a 1.3% yield on random duodenal biopsies.
