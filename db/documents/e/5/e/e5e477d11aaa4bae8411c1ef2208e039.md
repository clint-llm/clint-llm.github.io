Common sequelae may include:

- Aspiration pneumonia

- Aspiration bronchiolitis

- Obstructive bronchiolitis

- Lung abscess and empyema

Symptoms indicating disease progression include early signs of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and elevated lactate, in addition to the aforementioned aspiration symptoms. Chronic aspiration is also associated with interstitial lung disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, refractory asthma, and lung transplant rejection.
