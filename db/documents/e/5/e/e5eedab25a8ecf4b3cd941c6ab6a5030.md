Endocarditis is the inflammation of the endocardium, the innermost lining of the heart. Endocarditis may be due to infective or non-infective etiologies. Fungal endocarditis is an infrequent but debilitating condition with a poor prognosis. The disease can present as native valve endocarditis, prosthetic valve endocarditis, inflammation of the endocardial surface, or cardiac device-related infective endocarditis. Diagnosing fungal endocarditis is challenging; therefore, a high index of suspicion is required for the diagnosis to be made. This activity illustrates when this condition should be considered on differential diagnosis, how to evaluate for this condition properly, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical exam findings in a patient with endocarditis. 
- Explain how fungal endocarditis is diagnosed. 
- Review the management strategies for fungal endocarditis. 
- Examine the role of interprofessional team members in optimizing collaboration and communication to ensure patients with fungal endocarditis receive high-quality care, which will lead to enhanced outcomes.
