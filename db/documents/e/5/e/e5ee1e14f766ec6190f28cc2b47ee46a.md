Slit-lamp photographs or anterior segment photographs using a fundus camera help in documenting the disease, explaining the patient, and monitoring the effect of therapy.

Gonioscopy is important to document peripheral anterior synechiae, goniosynechiae, new vessels, lens matter, and retained nucleus fragments. However, in the acute stage, the corneal edema may not allow good visualization of the angle of the anterior chamber.

Ultrasound biomicroscopy is a useful modality to visualize the angles of the anterior chamber in hazy corneas.

Anterior segment optical coherence tomography and ultrasonic biomicroscopy can be used as diagnostic modalities in uveitis glaucoma hyphema syndrome to detect malposition of the intraocular lens, iris adherence to the peripheral cornea and can detect the cause for persistent inflammation after cataract surgery.

Lens-induced uveitis is often missed clinically.

Ultrasound B scan is important in cases of advanced cataracts to look for an intraocular foreign body in cases of perforating injury, vitreous echoes, dropped lens matter, traction bands, and optic nerve head cupping in cases of phacolytic glaucoma. Ultrasound also helps rule out endophthalmitis, panuveitis, retinal detachment, and intravitreal cysticercus.

Optical coherence tomography of the macula is especially useful in patients with uveitis after cataract surgery to rule out cystoid macular edema. It may also help in ruling out other differential diagnoses.
