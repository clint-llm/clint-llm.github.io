A healthy diet and weight-bearing exercise are important in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Medical management of osteoporosis includes prescribed medication for the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates are a major class of medications used to prevent or treat osteoporosis; alendronate and risedronate are examples. Monoclonal antibody medications are prescribed to increase bone mineral density.
