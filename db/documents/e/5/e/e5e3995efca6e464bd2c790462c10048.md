CHILD syndrome is a disorder with an X-linked dominant mode of inheritance. It involves a mutation in the NAD[P]H steroid, dehydrogenase-like protein gene, which is also known as the NSDHL gene. The NSDHL gene is located on the long arm of the X chromosome at position 28, Xq28. It encodes for the enzyme 3beta-hydroxy sterol dehydrogenase that is involved in cholesterol pathways. Several types of mutations have been reported in the NSDHL gene, such as nonsense mutations and missense mutations, and the net effect is a loss of function of the gene.EBP gene has also been reported as a cause of CHILD syndrome in some patients.
