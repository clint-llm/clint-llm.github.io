Treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on the underlying etiology and can be divided into symptomatic and definitive therapy. The symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as palpitations, anxiety, and tremor, can be controlled with a beta-adrenergic antagonist such as atenolol. Calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, can be used as second-line therapy for patients who are beta-blocker intolerant or have contraindications to beta-blocker treatment.

This review will only discuss the treatment for the most common causes of hyperthyroidism: Graves disease, toxic multinodular goiter, and toxic adenoma in non-pregnant patients.

Indications for treatment:

- Overt hyperthyroidism

- Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH <0.1 and age >65 years

- Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH <0.1 and age <65 years with comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, or symptomatic)

- Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH <0.1 and age <65 years, if TSH still elevated after 3 to 6 months

- Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH between 0.1-0.4 and age >65 years, if TSH still elevated after 3 to 6 months

- Subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH between 0.1-0.4 and age <65 years with comorbidities (cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, or symptomatic), if TSH still elevated after 3-6 months

There are three definitive treatments for hyperthyroidism: radioactive iodine therapy (RAI), thionamide therapy, and subtotal thyroidectomy. The choice of which definitive treatment modality depends on the etiology, comorbidities, and patient preferences. Historically, radioactive iodine (RAI) has been the preferred treatment for managing Graves disease in the United States. Still, the trend is changing towards increased use of anti-thyroidal drugs (ATD).

**Antithyroid Drugs (ATDs)**

Thionamide drugs include methimazole, carbimazole (precursor of methimazole), and propylthiouracil. These drugs are competitive inhibitors of the thyroid peroxidase (TPO) enzyme, resulting in their ability to block thyroid hormone synthesis. Additionally, these drugs may have additional immunosuppressive effects, as shown by their ability to induce remission in patients with Graves disease.

Attaining a euthyroid status typically requires several months after initiation of thionamide therapy. Although methimazole and PTU are equally effective, methimazole is preferred due to once-daily dosing and a relatively better safety profile. An exception to this recommendation is in pregnant patients, in which PTU is preferred. Methimazole is associated with an increased risk of congenital defects, and thus PTU is preferred in managing hyperthyroidism during pregnancy.

- Doses:

- 
              
- ATA (Americal Thyroid Association) guidelines provide a rough guide for the initial dose of methimazole based on free T4 levels 
              
              
- 
                  
- Free T4 1-1.5 times upper limit of normal: Start methimazole 5-10 mg daily
                  
                  
- Free T4 1.5-2.0 times the upper limit of normal: Start methimazole 10-20 mg daily
                  
                  
- Free T4 2.0-3.0 times the upper limit of normal: Start methimazole 30-40 mg daily
                  
                

              
              
- PTU is administered in 2-3 doses per day due to its shorter duration of action. The initial dose of 5-150 three times daily is chosen based on the severity of hyperthyroidism. Once the disease is controlled, the dose can be decreased to a maintenance dose of 50 mg 2 to 3 times daily.

- Monitoring: TSH levels remain suppressed for almost six months in patients with Graves disease, so evaluation of free T4 and/or total T3 levels should be done every 4 to 6 weeks.

- Pregnancy: Propylthiouracil is the preferred drug in the first trimester, associated with lower incidence and severity of embryopathy than methimazole.

- Drug conversions:

- 
              
- 10 mg of carbimazole is converted to approximately 6 mg of methimazole 
              
              
- An equivalent dosage ratio of propylthiouracil to methimazole is 20:1. This ratio is recommended for dose conversions when switching between these agents.

These drugs should be continued for at least 12-18 months. TRAb should be assessed at that time to evaluate for remission. If TRAb levels are normal, then thionamide therapy can be discontinued. If TRAb levels are still elevated, the patient remains at high risk for relapse if medication is stopped. Other factors associated with lower remission rates: male gender, smoking, large goiters, higher TRAb titers at the time of diagnosis, presence of orbitopathy, and the need for a high dose of thionamides to maintain euthyroidism.

An older study from the United States showed a 20-30% remission rate for Graves disease using thionamides.

**Radioactive Iodine (RAI)**

RAI (using I-131 isotope) can be the preferred therapy in most patients, especially the ones with high-risk comorbidities who are at high risk for surgery and need definitive management. Patients who have contraindications for the use of thionamides should also undergo RAI. This procedure should be avoided in patients planning a pregnancy in the six months due to the risk of inducing hypothyroidism in the fetus. RAI is also contraindicated in lactating women. Patients will a history of moderate to severe Graves orbitopathy should not undergo treatment with RAI due to the risk of worsening eye disease. Patients with underlying thyroid malignancies should not undergo RAI.

Radioactive iodine-131 leads to the destruction of thyroid follicular cells. In a female patient of reproductive age, it is highly recommended to obtain a beta-hCG to rule out pregnancy before initiation of RAI therapy. Patients on a thionamide (methimazole or propylthiouracil) should be instructed to discontinue this therapy approximately one week before RAI therapy since thionamide administration can interfere with the therapeutic benefit of RAI therapy. Several months are typically needed status post-RAI therapy to achieve euthyroid status.

- Graves disease

- 
              
- A single fixed dose of 10-15 mCi (370-555 MBq) is sufficient to render a patient with GD hypothyroid. Doses of RAI can be calculated using the size of the thyroid gland and the uptake of RAI. Cure rates are higher with higher doses, up to 85%.

- Toxic multinodular goiter

- 
              
- A single dose of 15 mCi is usually sufficient.

- Toxic adenoma

- 
              
- A single fixed of 10-20 mCi (370-740 MBq) is usually sufficient. The dose can also be calculated based on nodule size: 150-200 microCi (5.5-7.5 MBq).

Typically, patients with GD are evaluated in 4 to 6-week intervals with an assessment of TSH, free T4, and total T3 levels. The monitoring should continue for another six months or till the patient becomes hypothyroid and is on a stable dose of levothyroxine. Failure to achieve euthyroidism after RAI therapy may indicate the need for either repeat RAI therapy (for symptomatic hyperthyroidism) or the initiation of thyroxine therapy (for hypothyroidism).

RAI therapy involves the release of stored thyroid hormone due to the destruction of thyroid follicular cells, leading to transient hyperthyroidism. This is generally well tolerated, although this transient hyperthyroidism is of concern in patients with significant cardiac disease. For patients with cardiac disease, pretreatment with a thionamide to deplete the stored hormone is recommended to avoid the potential exacerbation of the cardiac disease. In addition, the use of beta-blocker therapy is also essential in these patients to minimize beta-adrenergic symptoms.

**Surgery**

Preferred in women planning a pregnancy in less than six months, presence of active Graves orbitopathy, patients who experience significant adverse effects with the use of thionamides, when thyroid malignancy is suspected, presence of large compressive goiters, and the presence of co-existing hyperparathyroidism needing surgery. The surgical option should be avoided in patients with significant comorbidities deemed high-risk for undergoing surgery.

Euthyroidism should be achieved before surgery with the use of thionamides. Preoperative SSKI (saturated solutions of potassium iodide), KI (potassium iodide), or Lugol's iodine should be used in patients with Graves disease and TMNG to decrease gland vascularity and decrease intraoperative blood loss.

- Graves disease: Near-total or total thyroidectomy is the surgical procedure of choice in patients with Graves disease, with excellent cure rates. The risk of remission or disease persistence with total thyroidectomy is almost 0% versus 8% with sub-total thyroidectomy after five years.

- Toxic multinodular goiter: Surgical option of choice is near-total or total thyroidectomy to avoid recurrences.

- Toxic adenoma: Preferred surgical option is ipsilateral thyroid lobectomy or isthmusectomy, with excellent cure rates and a risk of the treatment failure rate of less than 1%.

After patients undergo near-total or total thyroidectomy, they should be started on weight-based levothyroxine replacement therapy (0.8 mcg/lb or 1.6 mcg/kg). Lower doses should be used in the elderly, especially in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease or arrhythmia.
