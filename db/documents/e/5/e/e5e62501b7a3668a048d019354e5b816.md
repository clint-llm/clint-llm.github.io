The etiology of Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome is complex. About 80-90% of patients have a known molecular aberration that affects the regulation of a group of imprinted genes implicated in cell cycle progression and somatic growth control located in the chromosome 11p15.5. Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic-regulated process by which only one copy of a gene is expressed depending on the sex of the parent carrying the allele. Two imprinting control regions (IC1 and IC2) regulate the gene expression from the 11p15 region. Normally, methylation (silencing of gene expression) occurs in the paternal allele at IC1 and the maternal allele at IC2. In an individual with BWS, the molecular defects more commonly described are:

- Loss of methylation at IC2 on the maternal allele in 50 to 60% of cases

- Paternal uniparental isodisomy of 11p15 in 20 to 25% of cases

- The gain of methylation at IC1 on the maternal allele in 5 to 10% of cases

- Autosomal dominant maternal point mutations in CDKN1C (regulated by IC2) in 5% of sporadic cases and 40% of familial cases

- Chromosomal rearrangements (duplications, translocations, deletions or inversions) in less than 1% of cases

- The unknown molecular defect in 10 to 15% of cases
