Meralgia paresthetica is not a life-threatening disease, but it can result in morbidity if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. Interprofessional communication and patient education are key. The condition can be recognized and treated by multiple clinicians to include primary care, obstetricians/gynecologists, urologists, neurologists, and surgeons. A proper diagnosis can be challenging without a dedicated history taking, and physical exam and misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary referrals and procedures. With adequate interprofessional communication and patient education, meralgia paresthetica can be diagnosed and treated in a timely fashion to improve patient outcomes. [Level 5]
