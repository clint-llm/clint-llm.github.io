Decades of research have established that interprofessional teamwork is one of the most important fundamental drivers of the quality and safety of healthcare delivery, as well as patient, staff, healthcare team, and organizational outcomes.clinical KSAOs that learners need, needs assessment can illuminate learnersâ€™ gaps in essential teamwork KSAOs that can be trained in a simulation-based training curriculum. For instance, in the event of a multi-patient trauma, in addition to the clinical skills needed to care for this patient, first responders need teamwork skills to work together to respond to the emergency effectively and efficiently. Needs assessment can uncover the teamwork KSAOs required in such a situation (e.g., team briefing and communication), as well as who requires training to improve these teamwork KSAOs. The process of needs assessment also helps develop, deliver, and evaluate simulations based on the types of emergencies that these first responders are likely to encounter in the real world and how they can apply needed teamwork KSAOs in these emergencies. As such, needs assessment can lead to improved safety, quality, teamwork, and patient outcomes by allowing educators to close the gap learners may have in the KSAOs that have been evidenced to improve such outcomes.
