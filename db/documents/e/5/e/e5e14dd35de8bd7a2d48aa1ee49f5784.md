**Fetal Lung**

- The fetal pulmonary epithelium secretes alveolar fluid at around 6 weeks of gestation.

- Chloride ions in the interstitium enter the pulmonary epithelial cell through the active transport of sodium, potassium, and chloride into cells (Na-K-2Cl transporter) which, in turn, are secreted into the alveolus through various chloride channels.

- Sodium follows the chloride ions through para-cellular pathways, and water is transported across the cells via aquaporin.

- Volume of fetal lung is maintained by the larynx, which acts as a one-way valve, allowing only outflow of fluid.

**Neonatal Lung**

- Passive movement of sodium through epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) is believed to be the principle mechanism of reabsorption of fetal lung fluid with starling forces and thoracic squeeze playing a minor role in clearance.

- With the onset of labor, maternal epinephrine,

- Sodium in the alveolus is transported passively across the ENaC proteins which in turn is actively transported back to the interstitium by the Na+/K+-ATPase pump.

- An osmotic gradient is created which allows chloride and water to follow and be absorbed into pulmonary circulation and lymphatics.
