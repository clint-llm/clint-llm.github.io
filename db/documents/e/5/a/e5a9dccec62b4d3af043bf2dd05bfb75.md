The Duffy blood group system is complex, highly immunogenic glycoprotein antigens found on the surface of Red Blood Cells (RBC), vasculature endothelial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, collecting tubules of the kidney, and on the surface of Purkinje cells in the brain, but are absent on the adult liver. Duffy antigens are absent on platelets, lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes.

Duffy antigens act as receptors for chemokines and attract immune system cells. Duffy antigens also act as receptors for the Plasmodium species responsible for malaria. Antibodies against the Duffy blood group antigens are implicated in hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTR) and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN).

ISBT Number: 008

**History**

Duffy blood group antigen (Fy) was first discovered in 1950 in a patient named Duffy with multiple transfusions who presented with hemolytic transfusion reactions by Cutbush et al.

The Duffy antigens, FYa and FYb, are the gene products of DARC (Duffy antigen chemokine receptor; AKA ACKR1, atypical chemokine receptor 1).

**Genetics**

Atypical Chemokine Receptor 1 (ACKR1) gene encodes the glycoprotein expressing the Duffy blood group antigens, or CD234 protein (Cluster of Differentiation 234 protein) and is encoded by a gene located at 1q23.2 position on the long arm of chromosome 1.

Duffy antigens gene locus is syntenic to the gene locus for Rh antigen gene locus at chromosome 1.

ACKRs receptors do not couple with G-proteins as its structure Asp-Arg-Tyr-Leu-Ala-Ile-Val (DRYLAIV) motif is absent on the second intracellular loop, leading to no GPCR dependant signaling pathways and chemotaxis. However, they function as scavenge, transport, and regulator of the bioavailability of chemokines.

**Antigens**

A total of five antigens are present in the Duffy blood group system: Fya, Fyb, Fy3, Fy5, and Fy6.

**Fya Antigen**

- ISBT symbol: FY1

- ISBT number: 008.001

- Antithetical antigen: Fyb (FY2)

- The expression on the cord blood RBCs: Expressed

- The antigen can be demonstrated on the fetal RBCs as early as six weeks gestation. The adult level of Fya expression is attained approximately 12 weeks after birth.

- Fya antigens are sensitive to ficin, papain, and α-chymotrypsin and resistant to trypsin.

**Fyb Antigen**

- ISBT symbol: FY2

- ISBT number: 008.002

- Antithetical antigen: Fy(FY1)

- Expression on the cord blood RBCs: Expressed.

- Effect of enzymes: Fyb antigens are sensitive to ficin, papain, and α-chymotrypsin and resistant to trypsin.

**Fy3 Antigen**

- ISBT symbol: FY3

- ISBT number: 008003

- Expression on the cord blood RBCs: Expressed and increases with age.

- Effect of enzymes: Fy3 antigens are resistant to ficin, papain, trypsin, and α-chymotrypsin.

**Fy5 Antigen**

- ISBT symbol: FY5

- ISBT number: 008005

- The expression on the cord blood RBCs: Expressed

- Weak antigenic expression on D negative RBCs and absence in Rh null phenotype red cells show possible interaction between Duffy and Rh proteins.

- Effect of enzymes: Fy5 antigens are resistant to ficin and papain.

**Fy6 Antigen**

- ISBT symbol: FY6

- ISBT number: 008.006

- The expression on the cord blood RBCs

- Effect of enzymes: Fy6 antigens are sensitive to ficin, papain, and α-chymotrypsin and resistant to trypsin.

- Epitopes of Fy6 antigen are required for invasion of P. vivax.

- Only murine monoclonal antibodies have defined this antigen, not human antibodies.

Note: Fy4 antigen is obsolete in this system due to no evidence of antibodies against this antigen.

**Duffy Antibodies**

- Antibodies in the Duffy blood group system are mainly IgG type, and IgM type is rare. Duffy antibodies generally do not bind to complement, but some anti-Fyantibodies have been reported to bind with complement. These antibodies are not naturally occurring and are acquired by exposure to blood transfusion, pregnancy, and transplantation. Fya antibody is most common among other Duffy antibodies.

- The majority of Duffy antibodies show their reactivity at body temperature; hence they may cause red hemolysis and are clinically significant. These clinically significant antibodies can lead to both acute and delayed types of HTR and hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN).

- Dosage phenomena: Duffy blood group system shows dosage phenomena where Duffy antibodies react more strongly to homozygous cells {Fy(a−b+) or Fy(a+b−)} than heterozygous {Fy(a+b+)}.

**Duffy Phenotypes**

Four major Duffy phenotypes: - Fy(a+b-), Fy(a+b+), Fy(a-b+), Fy(a-b-): The Fya and Fyb antigens are found commonly in Europeans (Fya 66% and Fyb 83%) and Asians (Fya 99% and Fyb18.5%), while less common in Africans (Fya 10% and Fyb 23%). Further, Fy(a-b-) phenotype in African origins is found in two-thirds of populations and rare in Europeans.

Additionally, a minor Duffy phenotype is the Fyx or [Fy(b+x)]. In this phenotype, the antigen is weakly expressed as Fyb and is determined by serological adsorption and elution techniques and DNA sequencing. FYX allele encodes weakly expressed Fyb antigen, which sometimes may not be detected by anti-Fy. The Fy(a–b–) phenotype, most commonly found in Blacks, occurs primarily due to a GATA promoter region mutation upstream of the FY allele. This mutation prevents the expression of Duffy glycoprotein on erythrocytes only while permitting expression on nonerythroid cells.
