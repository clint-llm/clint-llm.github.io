Worsening nocturnal oxygen desaturations result in increased mortality and morbidity primarily from increased cardiovascular risk, including increased risk for the development of pulmonary hypertension and new-onset atrial fibrillation, and are associated with a high incidence of acute exacerbations of COPD.

Those with overlap syndrome have objectively decreased quality of life (assessed by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire) than those with COPD alone.

Complications resulting from improper treatment strategy can lead to decreased ventilation, worsening lung function, and poor adherence to therapy. For example, studies have shown that emphysema patients had decreased CPAP adherence rates compared to their phenotypic counterparts with obesity.
