The relevant anatomy of the innervation of the musculature of the back by the spinal nerves is centered around the lumbar spinal nerves, peripheral nerves of the lumbar plexus, spinal cord, and lumbar vertebral column.

In general, the spinal cord consists of gray and white matter. As in the brain, the gray matter of the spinal cord contains the cell bodies; the white matter of the spinal cord contains myelinated tracts. The gray matter of the spinal cord is found in the central aspect of the spinal cord. It is broadly in the shape of the capital letter H. Immediately surrounding the spinal cord is the pia mater, with the subarachnoid space overlying the pia mater, the arachnoid mater overlying the subarachnoid space, and dura mater at the outermost layer, adherent to the spinal column.
