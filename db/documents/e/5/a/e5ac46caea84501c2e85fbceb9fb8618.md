Myocardial perfusion scan plays a vital role in diagnosing ischemic heart disease and assessing the effectiveness of medical management in patients with known coronary artery disease. It is a useful non-invasive test to assess the blood supply of the myocardium. It also helps in preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment of patients with poor functional class and intermediate-risk surgery. The risk of perioperative cardiovascular risk is directly proportional to the severity of perfusion defect on myocardial perfusion scan.
