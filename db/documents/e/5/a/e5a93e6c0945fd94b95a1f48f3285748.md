The paramedical staff, the mid-level ophthalmic personnel, the optometrist, or the refractionist trained in CS assessment can help test the subjects. CS is measured by log contrast. The lesser the score, the poorer the CS.

- A score of 2 means normal CS

- A score less than 1.5 indicates visual impairment

- A score of less than 1 indicates a visual disability

**Types of Contrast Sensitivity**

**Spatial**

It refers to obtaining the striped pattern, which is detected at various levels of contrast and spatial frequencies. The spatial frequency is measured with the help of (Arden gratings) in which the patient is shown sine wave grating having parallel light and dark bands, and they are asked to tell the minimum level of contrast at which the bars are seen. The width of the bars is essential as it defines the spatial frequency, which denotes pairs of dark and light bars that subtend an angle of 1 degree at the eye. If the spatial frequency is high, it denotes narrow bars, and if it is low, it indicates wide bars.

**Temporal**

Here CS is a function of time rather than spatial position. It is a time-oriented (temporal) processing in the visual system by exhibiting a uniform target field modulation sinusoidal in time.
