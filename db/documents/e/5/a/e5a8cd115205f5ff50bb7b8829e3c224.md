The mean patient age at diagnosis of bronchial carcinoid tumors is 45 years. It affects both males and females equally. Patients who are diagnosed with typical carcinoids are approximately one decade younger than those diagnosed with atypical carcinoids. 15% of cases metastasize, usually to the liver, bone adrenal glands, or brain. There is evidence that the prevalence is gradually increasing, which may be at least in part due to advanced diagnostic techniques.

**Risk Factors**

BCTs are known to be sporadically occurring, although there are instances associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) syndrome. There are no environmental factors, such as smoking or inhaling carcinogens, that increase the risk of developing BCTs.
