The fever response is a systemic reaction to an infection that has evolved in warm-blooded animals for over 600 million years. An increase in core body temperature is known to improve survival and resolve infections. While an increased body temperature subsequently leads to an increased metabolic cost, it is known that the survival benefits outweigh the metabolic cost associated with a fever. An increase in core body temperature acts as an alert system to activate immune surveillance via different cell types, including natural killer cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, neutrophils, and vascular endothelial cells.
