Renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), which originate within the renal cortex, are responsible for 80% to 85% of all primary renal neoplasms. Transitional cell carcinomas, which originate in the renal pelvis, comprise approximately 8%. Other parenchymal epithelial tumors, such as oncocytomas, collecting duct tumors, angiomyolipomas, and renal sarcomas, occur infrequently. In children, nephroblastoma and Wilms tumor are common. Medullary renal carcinoma is a rare but aggressive form of renal cell cancer that seen in sickle cell disease. Other less common subtypes are clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe malignancies.
