Cryptococcal meningitis is a serious disorder with high mortality and thus best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, emergency department physician, internist, infectious disease specialist, infectious disease nurse, neurologist and a pharmacist. Patients are usually treated with two antifungal agents and the treatment duration can be as long as 6-24 months.

Patients who are immunocompromised as well as those with neurological symptoms tend to have poor outcomes despite optimal treatment.
