LASIK is an option in patients with low to high myopia, with or without astigmatism. It has been shown that LASIK can improve myopia from -2.00 to -20.00 D; however, it is generally indicated in patients with low to moderate myopia, from -0.5 D up to -9.00 D, as these patients have a higher probability of reaching emmetropia.

Currently, LASIK is the most common laser treatment for refractive error. In addition to its applications for a wide variety of refractive errors, patients suffer relatively little pain compared with techniques that do not create a flap, with recovery time to baseline being only a few days.
