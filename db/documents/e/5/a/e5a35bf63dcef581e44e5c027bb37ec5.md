Some contraindications to osteochondral autograft include:

- Global arthrosis

- Opposing “kissing” lesions

- Inflammatory arthropathies

- Infection (septic arthritis)

- Biomechanically altered joint line

- Diffuse degenerative changes

The absolute contraindication is global arthrosis. However, focal lesions in two or more areas of the knee may be amenable to this technique. But where secondary changes exist, e.g., osteophytes or joint space narrowing, the efficacy of the procedure is decreased.
