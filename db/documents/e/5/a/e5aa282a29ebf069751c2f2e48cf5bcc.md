External pacing is one of the fastest methods for treating multiple types of conduction abnormalities. It can be applied in the hospital setting or by emergency medical service providers when transporting critically ill patients. This activity reviews the utility of external pacing as well as the utility of other modalities that can be used in conjunction with external pacing to improve patient outcomes. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients who require external pacing.

**Objectives:**
- This articles summarizes the classical uses of external pacemaker in patients presented with different cardiac emergencies such as atrio-ventricular bradyarrythmias etc.
- This articles explains the procedure to perform external pacing in cardiac care units.
- This review article outlines the probable complications associated with external pacing.
- It has been explained in this article that how interprofessional team strategies and good communication can enhance care coordination to improve the management of life-threatening arrhythmias and subsequently the patient outcomes.
