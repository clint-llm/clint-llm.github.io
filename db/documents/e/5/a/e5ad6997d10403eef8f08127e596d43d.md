During prenatal consultations, a common parental concern is a risk of having a child with a cleft lip and/or cleft palate. For parents with no history of cleft lip and palate and who have had one child with a cleft lip and palate, the chances of having a second child with a cleft are approximately 4%. When parents have had two children with cleft lip and palate, the likelihood of having a third increase to about 9%. If one parent has had a cleft lip and palate and one sibling has a cleft, the risk rises to approximately 17%. Recurrence risk increases in cases of more severe clefts.

Approximately 50% of cleft palate patients present with nonsyndromic clefting, and the remaining 50% of cases occur in the setting of a genetic syndrome. Some syndromes are linked to single gene alterations (monogenic syndromes), and others can be caused by numerous gene abnormalities. Among the monogenic syndromes, velocardiofacial syndrome (Shprintzen syndrome) is an autosomal dominant condition linked to the deletion of chromosome 22q11.2, characterized by a prominent nose, notched nostrils, and a small chin. In patients with suspected velocardiofacial syndrome, it is imperative to perform imaging studies to verify the internal carotid artery's location before undertaking any surgical interventions in the pharynx or mouth because the internal carotid arteries may be displaced medially in these patients. Should a posterior pharyngeal flap be performed, injury to the internal carotid artery could occur and lead to potentially fatal consequences.

Preoperative counseling should include discussing multiple points, including the need to perform the surgical intervention under general anesthesia and the risks. Parents or guardians need to be informed about the potential risks and complications of the surgery itself as well, including bleeding (with the potential need for blood product administration), infection, wound dehiscence, need for reoperation, and the potential need to keep the patient intubated after surgery (with postoperative monitoring in the pediatric ICU), and death.

The patient needs to be healthy enough to undergo palate repair via general anesthesia without any active infections and have a hemoglobin level of ≥ 10 mg/ dL. Confirmation of a nil per os status before the intervention is mandatory. Cleft palate repair is performed with the patient under general endotracheal anesthesia in the supine position. If the patient has no contraindication to neck extension (e.g., atlantoaxial instability found in trisomy 21), placement of a shoulder roll can assist in extending the neck, which will help improve visualization of the oral cavity and oropharynx. A mouth retractor (e.g., Dingman mouth retractor) will be employed to maintain exposure of the oral cavity throughout the procedure (see figure). It is essential to ensure that the lips and tongue are appropriately protected and lubricated during the surgery to prevent unintentional injuries or substantial tongue swelling.

Cleft palate patients commonly develop otitis media with effusion in the first two years of life (with incidence rates of ≥90 %).
