The differential diagnosis of a patient with optic neuritis typically includes MS, NMOSD, and MOG. MS is the most common of these entities and should therefore be ruled out first. Still, the clinician should be especially aware of the other two as they typically portend a less favorable prognosis and different treatment.

Because NMOSD can also present without ocular symptoms, the presentation and differential of NMOSD broaden significantly when the patient does not have ocular involvement. Still, the primary clinical entity on the differential is MS, but theoretically, any lesion causing MS-like symptoms could be on the differential of NMOSD.
