**Visual Acuity**

- Visual acuity should be evaluated with the help of Snellen's chart or E- chart, and uncorrected, best-corrected, and pinhole visual acuity should be documented.

**Retinoscopy and Refraction**

- The retinoscopy evaluates the axis and magnitude of astigmatism, neutralization of refractive correction, and type of reflexes like a dull reflex, no reflex, or scissor reflex as in keratoconus. It also reveals different power on two different axes.

**Keratometry**

- Keratometry and computerized topography will reveal different corneal curvatures on two different axes.

**Pachymetry**

- This will help assess the cornea's thickness and help decide on refractive surgery.

**Astigmatic Fan Test and Jackson Cross Cylinder**

- These tests help confirm the axis and power of the cylinder.
