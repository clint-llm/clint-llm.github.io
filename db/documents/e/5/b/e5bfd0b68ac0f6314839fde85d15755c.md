The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) addresses a learner’s educational records privacy, including rules regarding access to, modification of, and disclosure for such data. While FERPA addresses the guidelines surrounding educational records of minors, it is also relevant to learners of any age and/or educational path, including those engaged in learning through the use of simulation (FERPA 34 CFR § 99.31.

There are exceptions to these guidelines, such as the allowance of providing “directory information” as well as providing information to parents of a “dependent student” without consent from the student (FERPA 34 CFR § 99.31 (a)(11)). One exception that may be more relevant to simulation center learners relates to the dismissal of a learner due to academic failure and/or legal ramifications of performance. Other issues/concerns that can be related to simulation centers and FERPA include but are not limited to, the potential liability of when simulation demonstrates a system concern, videotaping of educational activities, in-situ simulation encounters, and permission related to images and social media (FERPA 34 CFR § 99.31.).

In addition to creating data, it must also eventually be purged and/or destroyed. Sensitive data such as FERPA or HIPPA related data must be dealt with according to federal, state, or institutional guidelines.  With increased reliance on digital data sets, additional safeguards must be considered for the removal and disposal of computer systems and data containing devices.
