History should be taken to evaluate for inflammatory back and/or peripheral joint pain. Inflammatory joint pain is associated with morning stiffness lasting more than one hour, improving with activity, and worsening with rest or inactivity. NSAIDs may markedly improve symptoms. Patients with axial SpA typically have chronic low back pain for more than three months with insidious onset before the age of 45. In these patients, the Schober’s test (for assessment of lumbar flexion) and occiput to wall test (for assessment of upper thoracic/cervical spine mobility) should be a routine part of the physical exam
