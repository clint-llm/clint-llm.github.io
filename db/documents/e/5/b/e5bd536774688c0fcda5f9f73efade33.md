ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens. Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, function by maintaining blood glucose levels during fasting, preparing the body during physical and emotional stress, preventing inflammation, and suppressing the immune system. TSH stimulates receptors found in the follicular cells of the thyroid gland to produce thyroid hormones T4 and T3. In turn, the thyroid hormones regulate the bodyâ€™s basal metabolic rate, produce heat, and promote the development of the central nervous system. TSH is also necessary to maintain the size of the thyroid follicles and their continued ability to produce thyroid hormones. GH influences the normal rate of body growth during childhood and adolescence. It also regulates triglyceride lipolysis and controls the action of insulin on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Both LH and FSH are important for the menstrual cycle in females, including ovulation, and male gonadal function.
