Trauma is the most common cause of hemorrhagic shock, but causes can span multiple systems.

Tachycardia is typically the first abnormal vital sign of hemorrhagic shock. As the body attempts to preserve oxygen delivery to the brain and heart, blood is shunted away from extremities and nonvital organs. This causes cold and modeled extremities with delayed capillary refill. This shunting ultimately leads to worsening acidosis.

The “lethal triad” of trauma is acidosis, hypothermia, and coagulopathy.

Trauma-induced coagulopathy can occur in the absence of the hemodilution of resuscitation.

Damage control resuscitation is based on three principles: permissive hypotension, hemostatic resuscitation, and damage control surgery.  Permissive hypotension targets a systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg, accepting suboptimal perfusion to end organs for a limited time to achieve hemostasis.
