Physical therapy can be very helpful if the pain is due to hypermobility. Therapy can help to stabilize and strengthen lumbopelvic musculature. If the pain is due to immobility, then physical therapy can help increase mobilization of the SI joint. Â NSAIDs and muscle relaxants can be prescribed during the acute phase of presentations. These are less effective as cases become more chronic. Real-time image-guided intra-articular anesthetic/steroid injections can be performed for diagnostic and therapeutic effect. If the previous treatments do not provide adequate relief, then some providers will consider radiofrequency ablation. Usually, surgery is reserved as a last resort for patients with chronic pain. In such cases, one can consider SI joint fusion with SI screws.
