As already mentioned, PCOS is the most common endocrine pathology in reproductive-aged females worldwide, affecting between 5% and 15% of females depending on the diagnostic criteria. Rotterdam criteria include a broader prevalence than the National Institute of Health 1990 Criteria. Based on the NIH 2012 workshop report, it is estimated that PCOS affects about 5 million reproductive-aged females in the United States. The cost to the healthcare system for diagnosing and treating PCOS is approximately $4 billion annually, not including the cost of serious comorbidities associated with PCOS.

Multiple conditions have been associated with PCOS, including infertility, metabolic syndrome, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, DM-2, cardiovascular risk, depression, OSA, endometrial cancer, NAFLD/NASH. Higher prevalence has been associated in first-degree relatives with PCOS, prepubertal obesity, congenital virilizing disorders, above-average or low birth weight for gestational age, premature adrenarche, use of valproic acid as an antiepileptic drug. Studies have also suggested that there is a higher prevalence in Mexican-Americans than non-Hispanic whites and African Americans.
