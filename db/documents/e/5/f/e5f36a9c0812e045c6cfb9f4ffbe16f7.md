Hypoxic or anoxic brain injury often results in an impaired level of consciousness. Patients are often unable to follow verbal commands and may present with coma. Therefore, relevant history must typically be obtained from emergency personnel, family members, or other bystanders who may have witnessed the event. Information regarding the circumstances of brain injury is critical. For example, victims of strangulation may suffer from associated injuries to the cervical spine; the same may be true for patients suffering a near-drowning event after diving into shallow water. For cardiac arrest patients, in particular, information about the initial rhythm, whether or not the arrest was witnessed, and the duration of resuscitation efforts will be important to note. A focused medical history, including medication use, chronic medical conditions, and exposure to toxins or illicit substances, should be obtained if feasible.

Although obtaining a thorough neurological exam is important, the priority for patients presenting with hypoxic brain injury is adequate resuscitation. Specific therapeutic interventions should be targeted at the underlying cause of the injury, with the goal of returning normal cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery. Systemic hypotension, hypoxia, and hypovolemia should be corrected before attempting a neurological evaluation.

After appropriate resuscitation, factors that may confound an adequate assessment of neurological function must be excluded. The most prevalent confounder is drug exposure, including both illicit substances and medications that may have been administered during resuscitation efforts. Sedative agents and neuromuscular blockade are common, but toxic levels of certain antibiotics, anticholinergic medications, and antiepileptic drugs may also lead to a depressed level of consciousness. Significant metabolic derangements, such as severe acidosis, acute kidney failure, and acute liver injury, may also preclude an accurate assessment.

Once confounders have been excluded, the first step of the neurological assessment is an evaluation of the level of consciousness, which involves determining if the patient is arousable. Observe for eye-opening in response to voice, and determine whether the patient follows verbal commands. If not, gentle tactile stimuli may be employed. If this does not result in eye-opening, noxious stimulation is required. This may entail supraorbital pressure, pressure on the temporal-mandibular joint, or other methods of eliciting central pain. Sternal rub and nail-bed pressure are not recommended because these techniques may precipitate spinal reflexes. While applying noxious stimulation, the examiner observes the patient for eye-opening and motor response. Motor response in the setting of noxious stimulation can be described as localizing, i.e., the patient reaches for the source of pain, withdrawal, flexor posturing, extensor posturing, or no response.

Cranial nerve examination should be performed, including an assessment of pupillary reactivity, corneal reflexes, and oculocephalics. Importantly, testing of oculocephalic reflexes is contraindicated if there is a suspected injury to the cervical spine. The position of the eyes at rest should be evaluated, as a dysconjugate gaze or gaze deviation may indicate a focal brain injury. A full examination of the cranial nerves may not be possible for patients with an endotracheal tube, but the gag and cough reflexes should be assessed. Repeating the neurological assessment at intervals can be valuable for determining prognosis; this is discussed in detail below.
