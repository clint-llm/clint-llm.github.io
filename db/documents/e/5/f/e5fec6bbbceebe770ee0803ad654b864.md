A person must be directly infected with the measles virus to cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. It has been found that wild strains causing measles have a tri-residue motif, which infers an increased ability to spread, which is not present in lab-adapted strains used for vaccines. Thus, SSPE remains solely a complication of the wild-type measles infection. The latency period varies from 7-10 years, with shorter latency periods observed with children infected with the measles virus under the age of 2 or intrafamilial measles cases.

The measles virus has a tropism for lymphocytes in the lower respiratory tract and epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract.

With initial infection, the measles virus causes heavy immunosuppression that can continue for a considerable amount of months. This results in many secondary infections.

However, the actual mechanism of CNS infection by the measles virus is unknown. CD46 and protein F likely play a role in viral entry into neurons. Once inside, the measles virus undergoes mutations that allow for evasion of the host immune response and continuous viral production without damaging neuronal cells. The nucleocapsid and hemagglutinin genes appear to remain conserved, while the matrix gene is heavily mutated.

One of the proposed mechanisms of neuronal spread is via neurokinin-1, while substance P and fusion inhibitory peptide block viral transmission. The virus typically remains dormant for some time before triggering an inflammatory response resulting in neuronal destruction, which presents as SSPE.
