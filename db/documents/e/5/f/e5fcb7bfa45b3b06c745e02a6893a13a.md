The management of Japanese encephalitis is interprofessional. The infection has no cure and patients need support from a variety of specialists. The key role of the primary caregiver and nurse practitioner is patient education. Since there is no effective treatment prevention is critical. This is best accomplished by avoiding mosquito bites entirely. Even very short periods of outdoor exposure can result in bites, so proper protective clothing that includes long sleeves, long pants, socks, and closed-toe shoes should be worn.  Pant legs can be tucked into socks to prevent bites to the exposed ankles. Transmission is common during the warmer months and mosquitoes may bite through very thin clothing so treating clothing with repellents containing permethrin, DEET or other EPA-registered insect repellants will reduce this risk. Transmission is most frequent when mosquitoes feed, between dawn and dusk, so outdoor activities during this period should be avoided. Travelers should sleep in air-conditioned spaces or use mosquito nets or screens to prevent bites during sleep.

A safe, effective vaccine exists and may be administered in a short-course regimen. The vaccine is quite underutilized.

The outcomes for patients with Japanese encephalitis are guarded. Recovery does occur but is often marked by residual neuropsychiatric deficits which may persist for months or even years.
