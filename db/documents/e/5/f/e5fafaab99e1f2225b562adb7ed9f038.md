Infants with a low-risk brief resolved unexplained event do not require any testing. A brief period of observation (one to four hours) with continuous pulse oximetry is adequate. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not offer any guidance for infants with high-risk brief resolved unexplained events; the common sense approach is to perform relevant tests based on specific areas of concern identified in the history or physical exam. Performing a 12-lead EKG can be considered as the benefit of identifying channelopathies that lead to sudden death and outweigh any harm. Testing for pertussis may be useful in the at-risk populations (suggestive symptoms, unimmunized patients). Other tests such as complete blood count, electrolytes, blood glucose, lactic acid, bicarbonate levels, blood gas, blood cultures, urine analysis, imaging, electroencephalogram (EEG), pH probe, and polysomnography
