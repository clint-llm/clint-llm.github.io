Clinical evaluation of suspected optic neuritis should include the following:

- Best-corrected visual acuity.

- Automated visual field testing.

- Color vision testing with particular attention to red desaturation.

- Pupillary examination with measurement of a relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD).

- Note: A RAPD may not be present with bilateral, symmetric optic nerve involvement.

- Optic nerve examination.

- Optical coherence tomography (OCT) evaluation of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL).

If clinical findings are consistent with ON, additional testing should include:

- Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast to look for demyelinating disease.

- In the active phase, the affected optic nerve will enhance.
- Demyelinating lesions within the brain confirm the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS).

- Optic neuritis with two or more typical lesions (one of which is contrast enhancing) is sufficient to diagnose MS (McDonald criteria)

- Clinical findings suggestive of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) should prompt serum NMO-IgG testing.
