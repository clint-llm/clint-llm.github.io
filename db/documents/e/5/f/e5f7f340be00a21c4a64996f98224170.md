Parents and caregivers should be appropriately counseled regarding the diagnosis, progression, and anticipated complications of Tay Sach disease. Families should be informed about the expected outcome, such as progressive neurological deterioration, the refractory nature of the seizures, and the risk of aspiration and recurrent infections. Late-onset Tay Sach's disease (Juvenile and adult-onset) patients should be informed about the risk of falls due to ataxia, and appropriate measures such as assistive devices should be advised. In addition, it is also difficult to treat psychiatric symptoms.

Appropriate genetic counseling should be offered to those who are carriers and at risk of being carriers. Autosomal recessive disorders result when one copy of the abnormal gene for the same trait is inherited from each parent. Thus, parents of an affected child with Tay-Sach disease are obligate heterozygote carriers. Thus, two carriers (father and mother) have a 25% chance that the offspring is affected and a 25% chance that their offspring is healthy, while half of their offspring (50%) may be carriers exactly like the parents. Heterozygotes or carriers are usually asymptomatic.
