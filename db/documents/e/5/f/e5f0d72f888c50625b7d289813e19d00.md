After birth, infants often present with failure to thrive, short stature, and supra-vascular aortic stenosis.

Children with WS commonly have various endocrine abnormalities.

Connective tissue abnormalities often result in hyperextensible joints or hypotonia, resulting in delayed motor milestones or toilet training.

Patients with WS born with blue or green eyes often display a "starburst" or stellate pattern on their iris.

The patient may have comorbid psychiatric disorders, including intellectual disability (ID), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).

A definitive diagnosis of WS requires FISH genetic testing demonstrating the gene deletion in the WBSCR.
