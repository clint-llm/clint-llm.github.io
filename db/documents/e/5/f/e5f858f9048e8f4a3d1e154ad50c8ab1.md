As patients with cirrhotic cardiomyopathy are generally asymptomatic with near-normal cardiac function, except during periods of stress, the exact prevalence of this disease is difficult to determine. It is estimated that myocardial compromise is present in up to 50% of patients with cirrhosis. Most patients with moderate to advanced cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class B or C) will present with at least one feature of CCM, such as QT prolongation or diastolic dysfunction. Among patients with cirrhosis undergoing liver transplantation, almost 50% have been observed to develop signs of cardiac dysfunction within the peri-operative period, with 7% to 21% mortality from heart failure in the months following transplant. Limited studies have indicated that CCM is more common in males, people over 50-years-old, and in patients with cirrhosis secondary to alcohol abuse.
