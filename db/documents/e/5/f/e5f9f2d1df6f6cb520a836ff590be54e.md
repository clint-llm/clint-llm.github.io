Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography is the primary scintigraphic imaging technique. It is useful in the detection, localization, assessment of treatment response, and surveillance of amyloid plaques, as seen in the FDG PET/CT images for patient 2. Some common areas of uptake include the shoulder and pelvic girdles, the elbow, and the wrist. Myofibrillar amyloid deposition within the shoulder musculature will demonstrate avid uptake, complementing the "shoulder pad" sign, which may also be seen on other cross-sectional modalities. Soft tissue amyloid plaques will also demonstrate uptake.

Although less frequently used, radionuclide bone scintigraphy using technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate may demonstrate uptake into affected osseous structures.
