Clinically, microcystic adnexal carcinoma presents as a slow-growing, indurated white or pink nodule, plaque, or tumor located on the head and neck of a middle-aged to elderly Caucasian patient. In one retrospective analysis of MAC cases, 42 out of the 48 cases were reported to occur on the head and neck.

Clinically, MAC is somewhat indolent, often appears benign, and is often present for many years by the time of diagnosis. The morphology on inspection is often of an ill-defined, skin-colored, or yellow lesion with overlying telangiectasia.

The average size MAC at presentation is about 2cm based on existing literature, though larger lesions have also been reported.
