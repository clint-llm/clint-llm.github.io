**Evaluation of Respiratory Drive**

Assessment of a patient with hypercapnia, hypoxia, or abnormal ventilation should always begin with a thorough history and clinical examination to ascertain a root cause. A variety of tests, including pulmonary function testing, arterial blood gas values, and chest X-rays, may be indicated to determine the primary pathology.

Other tests of respiratory control are primarily used for research purposes or under exceptional circumstances when routine tests have failed to explain the abnormal levels of arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. These tests include measuring hypoxic and hypercapnic ventilatory response, mouth occlusion pressure, elastic and resistive load testing, and analyzing the patient's breathing pattern. However, the harm or discomfort imposed by such tests limits their routine use unless proven to be significantly beneficial.
