The healthcare team involved in transcatheter management of coarctation of the aorta is multidisciplinary in approach. It involves personnel, including those involved with appropriate diagnosis and detailed imaging of the coarcted segment with interpretation by imaging specialties. Echocardiographers provide detailed anatomy allowing parameters such as mean doppler gradients to be recorded so indications for intervention may be fulfilled.

The interventional cardiologist planning intervention must collaborate with cardiothoracic surgery to determine if the best outcomes for specific patients are achieved with a surgical or transcatheter approach. Cardiac anesthesiologists provide intraprocedural close hemodynamic monitoring and can provide imaging such as transesophageal echocardiography if required. Registered Cardiovascular Invasive Specialists (RCIS) provide additional intraoperative monitoring of hemodynamics and electrocardiographic data in the control area.
