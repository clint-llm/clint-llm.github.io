Chickenpox or varicella is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a herpesvirusÂ with worldwide distribution. It establishes latency after primary infection, a feature unique to most herpes viruses.

It is acquired by inhalation of infected aerosolized droplets. This virus is highly contagious and can spread rapidly. The initial infection is in the mucosa of the upper airways. After 2-6 days, the virus enters the circulation and another bout of viremia occurs in 10-12 days. At this time the characteristic vesicle appears. IgA, IgM, and IgG antibodies are produced but it is the IgG antibodies that confer life long immunity. After the primary infection, varicella localized to sensory nerves and may reactivate later to produce shingles.
