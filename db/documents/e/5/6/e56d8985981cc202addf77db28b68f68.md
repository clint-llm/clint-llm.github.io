The clinical presentation is helpful. Lichen striatus should be differentially diagnosed from lichen planus or lichen planus-like keratosis in which the apoptotic keratinocytes are limited to the basal epidermis rather than extending throughout all levels of the epidermis. The infiltrate does not usually involve eccrine glands.

The following should be properly ruled out:

- Nevus unius lateris

- Annular lichenoid dermatitis

- Unilateral laterothoracic exanthema

- Tinea corporis

- Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus

- Linear Darier disease

- Lichen Nitidus

- Lichen Planus

- Lichen Simplex Chronicus

- Nongenital Warts

- Plaque Psoriasis

- Porokeratosis
