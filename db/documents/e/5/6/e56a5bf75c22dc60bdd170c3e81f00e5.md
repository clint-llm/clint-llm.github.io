The internal carotid and vertebral arteries form the network of blood vessels that supply blood to the brainstem, including the midbrain. Anteriorly, the midbrain receives supply from branches of the basilar artery, laterally by branches of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA), including the posterior choroidal arteries and quadrigeminal artery, and posteriorly by quadrigeminal arteries and superior cerebellar arteries (SCA).

There is no classical lymphatic drainage system within the central nervous system (CNS). When trying to identify exit routes for immune cells after immunohistochemistry staining, they travel within the meninges near the dural sinuses. These sinuses are what drain blood from the brain into the internal jugular veins.
