Torsemide is a loop diuretic extensively used in the management of heart failure, renal disease, and cirrhosis. Torsemide acts on electrolyte channels in the renal tubules. Significant adverse events include electrolyte abnormalities, photosensitive reactions, and hypotension. Contraindications to use are sulfa allergy, anuria, and hepatic coma. This activity reviews the clinical use, monitoring, and toxicity of torsemide, in addition to a brief overview of clinical trials and the need for further research.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the clinical indications of torsemide. 
- Describe in detail the mechanism of action of torsemide.
- Summarize the dosage adjustment of torsemide in patients with different degrees of chronic kidney disease. 
- Review how interprofessional care coordination can improve therapy in patients receiving torsemide.
