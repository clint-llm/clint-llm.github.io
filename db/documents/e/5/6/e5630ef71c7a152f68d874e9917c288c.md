Secondary carnitine deficiency (SCD) could result from multiple causes, either from a decrease in carnitine intake or more commonly from an increase in renal excretion. SCD may result from severe malnutrition, ketogenic diet, severe malabsorptive states, extremely preterm infants, and prolonged parenteral nutrition without adequate L-carnitine supplementation.**.****.**

Similarly to PCD, hypoketotic hypoglycemia is highly suggestive for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (FAO) disorders (e.g., very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase or VLCAD, medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase or MCAD, etc.), or disorders of a defective mitochondrial carnitine-acylcarnitine cycle or simply referred to as disorders of carnitine shuttle (due to defects in enzymes, CPT-I, or CPT-II or CACT).

The clinical manifestations of FAO defects and carnitine shuttle disorders are heterogeneous and can be vague.

Carnitine is also important in binding acyl residues derived from the intermediary metabolism of amino acids.
