Bioartificial liver systems: Various devices have been created to replace or support liver function. They function as a bridge to transplant. However, theseÂ are still in the clinical trial phase.

The use of transplanted hepatocytes infused in the peritoneal cavity or the splenic or hepatic portal system is also under investigation.

High-volume plasma exchange (exchange of 8 to 15% of ideal body weight with fresh frozen plasma), is also treatment under study as a liver support system.
