Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) is an extracellular enzyme on the vascular endothelial surface that degrades circulating triglycerides in the bloodstream. These triglycerides are embedded in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and in chylomicrons that travel through the bloodstream. The role of lipoprotein lipase is significant in understanding the pathophysiology of type one familial dyslipidemias, or hyperchylomicronemia, and its clinical manifestations. LPL also plays a significant role in understanding the cardiac pharmacology of fibrates as a class of medications and in the management of patients with high levels of serum triglycerides. In this review, we will explore the function, pathophysiology, and clinical relevance of lipoprotein lipase.
