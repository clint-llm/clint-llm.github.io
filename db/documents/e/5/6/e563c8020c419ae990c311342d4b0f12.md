The normal range of CrCl is 110 to 150mL/min in males and 100 to 130mL/min in females.

- Creatinine 1 mg/dL is the baseline for a given patient with normal GFR

- Creatinine 2 mg/dL is a 50% reduction in GFR

- Creatinine 4 mg/dL is a 70 to 85% reduction in GFR

- Creatine 8 mg/dL is a 90 to 95% reduction in GFR

Alteration of serum creatinine values can occur as its generation is subject to influence by muscle function, activity, diet, and health status of the patient.
