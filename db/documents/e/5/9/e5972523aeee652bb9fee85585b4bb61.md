The mainstay treatment of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty is aromatase inhibitors and more recently tamoxifen in females. In the case of the development of central precocious puberty, steady-state gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs are used to downregulate hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.

Treatment of hyperthyroidism is initially managed medically with antithyroid medications and radioablation.  Growth hormone excess treatment is by somatostatin or direct GH receptor antagonists. Hyperprolactinemia management is with bromocriptine.  In patients with demonstrated pituitary adenomas, surgical resection of the adenoma is an option.  Treatment of hypophosphatemia with oral supplementation is under debate, but supplementation should be used in the setting of rickets.

No definitive guidelines for surgical intervention of fibrous dysplastic lesions exist. However, common indications for surgical stabilization include progression of pain, stress fracture, deformity, or loss of function. The data for prophylactic surgery are lacking. Studies investigating the use of high dose bisphosphonates show mixed results, and currently, the only indication for bisphosphonate therapy is pain relief. Surgical intervention due to cranial-facial lesions may be necessary when there is a potential for loss or sight or hearing.
