Feeding disability in children is termed as a pediatric inadequacy to take food and includes disorders resulting in delayed development of milestones, inappropriate weight gain, and/or failure to thrive. Feeding disorder may present as a child refusing to eat a certain group of foods or a specific food element class. The child can manifest with crying, vomiting, choking, or spitting up during feeds. It requires a comprehensive assessment of medical, psychosocial, feeding skill-based systems and associated nutritional based complications.

Gastrointestinal disturbance in children with neurodisability (e.g., cerebral palsy) reflects the interplay between the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), resulting in a mandatory comprehensive review of child pathology. Feeding disability is acute when the duration is less than three months and chronic when greater than three months have elapsed.
