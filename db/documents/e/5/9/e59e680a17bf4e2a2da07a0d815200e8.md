The complement system is a crucial part of the innate humoral immune system. The purpose of the complement system is to orchestrate opsonization, facilitate cytotoxic destruction and formulate membrane attack complexes (MAC), and the liberation of peptides that promote the inflammatory response.

Complement activity is regulated by an intricate system. The important components of this system include:

- Complement receptor 1 (CR1)

- Complement receptor 2 (CR2)

- Decay accelerating factor (DAF)

A North African study looking into the basis of complement factor I deficiency in cases of atypical hemolytic and uremic syndrome observed that the Ile357Met mutation could be a founding effect.

There are cell surface-associated proteins and plasma proteins that regulate different steps of the complement pathways; for instance, factor H and factor I stop the formation of C3 convertase in the alternative pathway. The enzyme C1q esterase inhibits serine proteases C1r and C1s of the classic pathway. The deficiency of these regulatory proteins leads to the overactivation of the complement system and an abundance of damaging inflammatory effects.
