When performing transthoracic echocardiography, the patient should be in a left decubitus position. This allows the heart to fall closer to the anterior thoracic wall, making sonography easier. The probe is placed on the skin at multiple positions, including parasternal long axis, parasternal short axis, apical four-chamber, and subxiphoid. The probe is positioned in the intercostal spaces to avoid the scattering effects of bone.

While performing a TEE, the patient is in the supine position, with the head of the bed in a slight angle while and the probe is inserted into the mouth and advanced into the esophagus. A TEE bite block is inserted into the mouth, to allow easier transit of the probe. While performing any invasive imaging techniques, access is obtained at the femoral or radial vessels.
