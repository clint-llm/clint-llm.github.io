**Infraorbital Nerve**

The infraorbital nerve originates from the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve as it enters the inferior orbital fissure after passing through the pterygopalatine fossa. The nerve travels along the infraorbital groove and infraorbital canal in the orbital floor before entering the face via the infraorbital foramen. The infraorbital nerve delivers sensation to the maxillary teeth via the superior alveolar nerve branches prior to entering the infraorbital foramen. It divides into palpebral, nasal, and superior labial terminal branches on the face. These terminal branches provide sensation to the skin of the lower eyelid, nose, cheek, and upper lip.

**Superior Alveolar Nerves**

The posterior superior alveolar (PSA) nerve emerges before the maxillary nerve enters the infraorbital groove, and it descends along the maxillary tuberosity, where it innervates the gingiva and buccal mucosa of this region. It then enters the posterior alveolar canal and provides sensory fibers to the maxillary sinus mucosa, the maxilla, maxillary molar teeth, and periodontium.

The middle superior alveolar (MSA) nerve branches off within the infraorbital canal and runs down along the maxillary sinus lateral wall. This nerve innervates the maxillary premolar teeth and periodontium. In some individuals, the MSA nerve is absent, and the premolar teeth are supplied by the PSA nerve instead.

The anterior superior alveolar (ASA) nerve also originates within the infraorbital canal and descends along the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus. This nerve innervates the canine and incisor teeth and their periodontium.

**Palatine Nerves**

The palatine nerves originate from the pterygopalatine ganglion, which is supplied by the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve

The greater palatine nerve runs through the greater palatine canal and enters the greater palatine foramen, usually located medial to the third maxillary molars, to innervate the hard palate and palatal gingiva.

The lesser palatine nerve descends through the lesser palatine foramen, which is posteromedial to the greater palatine foramen, to innervate the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils.

The nasopalatine nerve enters the sphenopalatine foramen, running along the nasal cavity and innervating the nasal septum. The nerve then emerges through the incisive foramen of the hard palate to innervate the anterior hard palate and anterior palatal gingiva. The nasopalatine nerve also provides sensory fibers to the maxillary incisors in some patients.

**Buccal Nerve**

The buccal nerve, also known as the long buccal nerve, stems from the anterior trunk of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve.

The nerve runs across the buccinator and provides sensory innervation to the skin over the anterior buccinator and the buccal mucosa. The buccal mucosa innervation extends superiorly up to the region opposite the maxillary molars and anteriorly to the lateral aspect of the lips.

**Lingual Nerve**

The lingual nerve stems from the posterior trunk of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve. It descends between the tensor veli palatini, lateral pterygoid, and medial pterygoid muscles to enter the pterygomandibular space.

It runs along the lingual body of the mandible, passing medial to the third molar and above the mylohyoid line, generally 2 or 3 mm below the alveolar crest, where it is only covered by gingival mucoperiosteum. The nerve then runs across the extrinsic tongue muscles, mylohyoid muscle, sublingual gland, and submandibular gland—the nerve curves around the submandibular duct before dividing into terminal branches.

The lingual nerve provides somatic sensation to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, the floor of the mouth, and the lingual gingiva. The lingual nerve also carries fibers from the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve to provide secretomotor supply to the submandibular and sublingual glands and to carry taste sensation from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue.

**Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN)**

The IAN stems from the posterior trunk of the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve.

At the mental foramen, located below the premolar apices, the IAN divides into incisive and mental nerves. The incisive nerve continues within the bone via the incisive canal to supply the teeth and buccal gingiva of the first premolar, canine, and incisors. The incisive nerve sometimes extends beyond the midline to provide additional sensation to the contralateral anterior teeth. The mental nerve exits via the mental foramen to supply the lower labial mucosa and the skin of the lower lip and chin.

The mylohyoid nerve originates from the IAN approximately 13.4 to 14.7 mm above the mandibular foramen.

Despite its primarily motor nature, in some cases, the mylohyoid nerve can provide accessory sensory innervation to the mandibular teeth, associated soft tissues, and submental skin. This can be due to anastomosis with the lingual nerve or anatomical variations. Anatomical variations in the origin, course, communications, and innervations of the mylohyoid nerve can account for the failure to fully anesthetize mandibular teeth and soft tissues.

**Pterygomandibular Space**

The pterygomandibular space contains the inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle, the lingual nerve, and the sphenomandibular ligament.

The pterygomandibular space is mainly made up of loose areolar connective tissue.

The inferior alveolar neurovascular bundle is located in the sulcus colli, a bony depression on the medial aspect of the ramus. The mandibular foramen is positioned at the inferior aspect of the sulcus colli, posterior to the midline of the ramus, and the level of the mandibular occlusal plane.

A crest of thick bone, known as the crista endocoronoidea, forms the anterior border of the sulcus colli, and it should be contacted during IANB administration. Contacting this bony protrusion helps ensure that the anesthetic solution is delivered adjacent to the IAN, without mechanical injury to the nerve and superior to the lingula.

The lingula is a bony projection anterior to the mandibular foramen. It is important to deliver the IANB above the lingula because the sphenomandibular ligament attaches to the lingula, and this fibrous ligament can prevent the effective diffusion of the anesthetic solution.
