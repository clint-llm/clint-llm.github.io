Mortality increases as the GCS reduces. The patient's age and mechanism of injury are the most critical factors in the outcome.

The number of non-reacting pupils (0-2) has recently been used for prognostic information in TBI.

Increasing age is a significant factor for mortality and unfavorable recovery six months after TBI.

The Glasgow outcome scale is used for outcome assessment using a five-point scale.

- Score 5- Good recovery: Minor disabilities, but able to resume normal life

- Score 4- Moderate disability: More significant disabilities, but still able to live independently. Can use public transportation, work in an assisted situation, etc.

- Score 3- Severe disability: Conscious, but dependent upon others for daily care, often institutionalized

- Score 2- Persistent vegetative state: Not conscious, though eyes may be open and may "track" movement

- Score 1- Death

Classifications to predict outcomes on TBI have been developed and published. The Marshall CT classification evaluates midline shift, cistern patency, hematoma size, and if surgery was performed.
