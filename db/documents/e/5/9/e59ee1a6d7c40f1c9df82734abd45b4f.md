Cyanide poisoning may result from a variety of exposures, including structural fires, industrial exposures, medical exposures such as sodium nitroprusside, and certain foods. In domestic countries, the most common cause of cyanide poisoning is domestic fires. Cyanide also is used in a number of industrial applications such as electroplating injury production, photography, plastics and rubber manufacturing, and pesticides. Sodium nitroprusside, a medication used to treat a hypertensive emergency, contains five cyanide groups per molecule. Toxic levels of cyanide may be present in patients who receive prolonged infusions of sodium nitroprusside.
