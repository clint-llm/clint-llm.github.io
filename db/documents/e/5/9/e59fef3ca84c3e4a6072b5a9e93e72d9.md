Even with treatment, the prognosis of PAD is generally guarded. If the patient does not change his/her lifestyle, the disease is progressive. In addition, most patients with PAD also have coexistence of cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease, which also increases the mortality rate. The outcomes in women tend to be worse than in men, chiefly because of the small diameter of the arteries. In addition, females are more likely to develop complications and embolic events.
