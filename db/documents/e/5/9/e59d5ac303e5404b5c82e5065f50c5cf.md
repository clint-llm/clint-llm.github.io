Given that the most common cause of gastric perforations is peptic ulcer disease ensuring patients with this pathology are on an effective proton pump inhibitor regimen can significantly reduce their risk of perforation. Patients should be educated to take their proton pump inhibitor regularly and not only when they have symptoms. Eradication of H pylori infection, if it is present, is also imperative and patients should be educated about the need for this if they test positive for H Pylori.

Physicians should also attempt to minimize the risk of gastric perforations during endoscopy by:

- Avoid excessive endoscope looping in the stomach, consider left upper quadrant pressure or use of an overtube

- Submucosal injection of fluid before resecting large sessile lesions

- Perform EUS before resecting subepithelial lesions

- Proper training and use of cap-assisted EMR kit

- Consider the use of fluoroscopy for dilating surgical gastric outlet strictures

- Consider the use of carbon dioxide insufflation for therapeutic cases.
