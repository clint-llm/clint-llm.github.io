A team approach is an ideal means to evaluate and manage hematuria. In most cases, initial management will involve a primary care physician or emergency medicine physician. After getting initial workup, referral to a nephrologist or urologist may be indicated. Inpatient or outpatient referral decision depends on the severity of presentation, abnormal lab findings, and the presence of risk factors for serious etiology.
