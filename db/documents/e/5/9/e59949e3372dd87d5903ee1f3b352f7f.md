As AEN is a multifactorial condition and primarily a prognostic marker rather than an isolated pathology, prevention should center on reducing comorbidities such as vascular disease, liver disease, and renal disease. Lifestyle factors would include the moderation of alcohol consumption, smoking cessation, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. Medical prevention for AEN has not been documented in the literature.
