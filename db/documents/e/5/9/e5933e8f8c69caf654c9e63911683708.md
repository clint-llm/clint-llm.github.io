Prognosis is dependent on numerous factors such as the size, location, early manifestations of gelastic seizures, behavioral, cognitive impairment, and central precocious puberty. Large sessile hypothalamic hamartomas are likely to present with all of the above features.

The success rate for gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy is high in treating central precocious puberty.

Gelastic seizures are quite distressing for the patient and the family. As they tend to be refractory to antiepileptic drugs, surgery is the predominant treatment choice. Neurosurgical techniques tend to resolve the symptoms rapidly in these patients. Early intervention is quite critical as this condition is progressive with worsening cognitive and behavioral issues over time. Often the lesion is inaccessible through an open approach; therefore, minimally invasive surgical or radiosurgical therapies are options, but with variable result outcomes.Â Only 50% of the patients achieved cure by endoscopic disconnection of hypothalamic hamartomas.
