Artery enter from the hilum, a depression on the concave side of the lymph node, on the concave side of the kidney-shaped structure. The artery passes through the medulla and into the cortex. Once in the cortex, the artery branches into arterioles and capillaries. The vein exits the lymph node from the hilum as well. The afferent lymphatic vessel enters the lymph node on the convex side of the node. The afferent vessels carry lymph through one-way valves and into the node where it is circulated through the sinuses. After the lymph fluid is filtered, it exits through the efferent lymphatic vessels from the hilum. The efferent vessels also have one-way valves to prevent the backflow of lymph fluids.
