Inhaled antigens may elicit inflammation in the small airways and interstitial spaces, leading to fever, myalgias, and diffusion limitation leading to hypoxia. This inflammation is mediated by two processes, type III and type IV hypersensitivity reactions. The inhaled antigen initially causes an immune complex-mediated (type III) hypersensitivity reaction, which is responsible for granuloma formation. During ongoing acute exposure, IgG antibodies specific to the inhaled antigen can be detected in the serum in relatively high titers. As exposure to the offending antigen continues and becomes chronic, a T-cell mediated (type IV) hypersensitivity reaction is elicited, which is responsible for fibrosis.
