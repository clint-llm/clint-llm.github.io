The patient should receive counseling that complications after rhinoplasty are generally mild and self-limited, though rare but serious complications certainly exist, some of which may not be reversible (e.g., blindness, stroke). Complications associated with non-surgical rhinoplasty are outlined below and categorized as either early or late-appearing.

**Early-onset**(hours to days)

- Asymmetry – can be avoided with proper injection techniques, including staying as midline as possible

- Injection site reaction – pain, edema, erythema, ecchymosis, itching

- Hypersensitivity reaction – pain, fever, itching, and fever; treated with corticosteroids and warm compresses

- Infection – abscess/cellulitis; mycobacterial infection; herpes simplex virus infection (can be mitigated with prophylactic antivirals in high-risk patients)

- Tyndall effect – occurs when the filler is injected too superficially and creates a blue hue underneath the skin

- Surface irregularities and nodules – secondary to improper placement of fillers (e.g., too superficial)

- Vascular occlusion – a rare but devastating complication that can present as A) local tissue ischemia (pain and pallor with subsequent edema, mottling, ulceration, and necrosis), and/or B) vascular occlusion with retrograde embolization leading to blindness and/or stroke. Vascular occlusion can occur either with HA or CaHa and with needle or cannula technique as well. Clinicians performing nonsurgical rhinoplasty with fillers should have a readily available emergency kit (See above EQUIPMENT) and emergency access to an ophthalmologist as well as a center with stroke expertise. NOTE: over injecting may cause tissue ischemia secondary to pressure occlusion of the adjacent nasal vasculature.

**Delayed onset**(weeks to years)

- Scarring

- Dyschromia

- Foreign body granuloma – an immune response typically associated with permanent (e.g., silicone) injections; treatment is with corticosteroid injection and/or surgical removal

- Biofilms – may require excision and/or long-term antibiotics

Despite these complications, the staff should reassure the patient that there exists a well-described body of literature supporting the overall effectiveness and safety of injectable fillers in nonsurgical rhinoplasty.
