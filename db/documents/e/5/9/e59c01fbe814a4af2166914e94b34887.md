Simulation curriculum development has, what seems like, infinite possibilities, but answering basic questions can assist in the creation of a successful curriculum. The first step is to identify the goal of the simulation, which will then dictate the simulation design. Two prevalent designs are skill-based (e.g., improvements in medical knowledge, communication, the time associated with skill completion, self-efficacy, etc.) and scenario-based (e.g., prioritizes reflection and the debriefing process as a learning approach).

As ATLS has expanded and cycled through nine different editions, the newest is the tenth edition, trauma simulation as a field has evolved. An exploratory PubMed search with the keywords ‘medical simulation AND trauma’ included publication dates in five-year increments beginning in 1990 and ending in 2019, resulted in 55, 102, 205, 422, 721, and 847 articles, respectively. Clearly, there were more medical simulation articles published as time proceeded. Simulations related to clinical care for trauma patients (i.e., trauma resuscitation,

In situ simulation, training taking place in the natural environment has served as an educational approach to practice in the working or clinical environment.
