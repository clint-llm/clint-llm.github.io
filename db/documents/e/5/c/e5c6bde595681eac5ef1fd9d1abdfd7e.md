Pott disease, or tuberculosis of the spine, has recently shown a significant resurgence in developed nations secondary to global migration. Concurrent with this phenomenon, multidrug-resistant bacterial strains of tuberculosis have been increasing in developing nations over the past decades. Improving interprofessional team knowledge of this major, global public health threat is critical for current and future generations. This activity examines the etiology, epidemiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of Pott disease. This activity highlights the importance of the interprofessional team in recognizing and managing the disease to improve outcomes for patients.
