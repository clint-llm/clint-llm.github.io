Upadacitinib is a new FDA-approved second-line agent for treating moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients who have not shown an adequateÂ response or intolerance to the first-line agent methotrexate.

Upadacitinib use with other JAK inhibitors (jakinibs) or robust immunosuppressants like azathioprine and cyclosporine is not advised. Although its use in combination with nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate is supported, its use with biological DMARDS is not recommended.

Clinical advancements for the agents used in other autoimmune diseases such as psoriatic arthritis (PA), atopic dermatitis (AD), ankylosing spondylitis(AS), giant cell arteritis (GCA), systemic lupus arthritis (SLE), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is currently ongoing.
