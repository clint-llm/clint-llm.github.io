Abdominoperineal resection is a major operation that requires significant work-up, operative planning, and post-operative care. This procedure involves multiple team members ranging from surgeons and anesthesiologists to specialists, nurses, nutritionists, physical therapists, and social services. Recovery from this procedure takes resilience, time, and effort. Understanding operative steps and potential complications allows clinicians to prepare for the operation and recognize issues earlier on, leading to better patient outcomes. Similarly, an appreciation of the general process involved in the care of these patients will help Nurses, and other healthcare members troubleshoot problems and support patients in the pre- and post-operative setting.
