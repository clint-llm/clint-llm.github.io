The pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) is a cone-shaped depression deep to the infratemporal fossa and posterior to the maxilla on both sides of the skull. The fossa is located between the pterygoid process and the maxillary tuberosity, close to the orbital apex. This space communicates with both the nasal and oral cavities, the infratemporal fossa, the orbit, the pharynx, and the middle cranial fossa through eight foramina. Three-dimensional understanding of this space is crucial for the rhinologist and skull-base surgeon for both the control of epistaxis and the removal of skull base lesions. The pterygopalatine space approach is used to treat lesions in the spaces posterior to the maxillary sinus, including the pterygopalatine space and lateral sphenoid recess. Pathologic processes in this space are rare, with the most common entities being juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, neurogenic tumors, a perineural extension of sinonasal malignancy, and meningoencephaloceles.
