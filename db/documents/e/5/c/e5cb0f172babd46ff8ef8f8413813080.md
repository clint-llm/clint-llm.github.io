Mechanical hyperkeratosis: This is characterized by increased keratinocyte activity mainly due to chronic pressure or friction on the skin. Lesions are benign demarcated hyperkeratotic lesions, mainly corn and callus. The presence of a central conical core distinguishes a corn from a callus. Corns are subtyped into hard corn (heloma durum) and soft corn (heloma molle). Both show dense hyperkeratotic stratum corneum with mild acanthosis, variable hypergranulosis, and collagenization of the superficial dermis with variable mucin deposition. There is usually no inflammatory infiltrate accompanying the lesion.

Psoriasis and psoriasiform dermatitis: It shows perivascular aggregates of lymphocytes in the dermal-epidermal junction with focal migration of leukocytes (neutrophils, lymphocytes) into the epidermis. There is increased epidermal proliferation and elongation of rete ridges giving an undulating appearance to the epidermis (papillomatosis) with or without spongiosis. The altered differentiation of keratinocytes results in hyperkeratosis with parakeratosis. Psoriasis also shows the formation of microabscesses by small aggregates of neutrophils in the upper epidermis (pustules) or in the stratum corneum (Munro microabscesses).

Interface and lichenoid dermatitis: Dense aggregates of lymphocytes along the dermal-epidermal junction associated with vacuolation of basal keratinocytes.

Verrucae vulgaris and plana are characterized by marked hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, and acanthosis. A typical feature is the presence of koilocytes, cells infected with papillomavirus which have structural changes like perinuclear halos and keratohyalin granules. Koilocytes can be absent in older lesions, but when present, are located in the upper stratum spinosum or granulosum. Parakeratosis may be present.

Seborrheic keratosis features marked hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, and acanthosis. Pseudo-cysts and horn cysts are frequently present. There may be lymphocytic infiltrate and pigmentation as secondary features when irritated or inflamed.

The ichthyoses are a group of diseases caused by altered keratinization. The most common forms are ichthyosis vulgaris, X-linked, congenital, and epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a neoplastic proliferation of atypical keratinocytes, restricted only to the epidermis (SCC in situ or Bowen's disease) or infiltrating the dermis (infiltrative SCC). Classic features are hyper-parakeratosis and loss of the granular layer.
