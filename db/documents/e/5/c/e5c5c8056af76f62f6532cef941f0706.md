Berylliosis, also known as chronic beryllium disease (CBD), is a granulomatous disease caused by exposure to beryllium. CBD has a variable clinical course with cough, fever, night sweats, and fatigue being the most common symptoms. A definitive diagnosis of berylliosis is based on occupational history, positive blood or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT), and granulomatous inflammation on lung biopsy

CBD is more likely to develop in individuals who work in industries that manufacture and process beryllium. Overall, there is nothing unique about berylliosis; it is similar to many other granulomatous lung disorders.
