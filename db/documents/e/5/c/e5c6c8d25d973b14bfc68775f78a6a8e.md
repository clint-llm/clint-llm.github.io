Diagnostic criteria for Wellens syndrome are as follows:

- Deeply inverted T waves in leads V2 and V3 (may also be seen in leads V1, V4, V5, and V6) OR biphasic T waves (with initial positivity and terminal negativity) in V2 and V3

PLUS

- Isoelectric or minimally elevated ST segment, less than 1 mm (in other words, no signs of an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction)

- Preservation of precordial R-wave progression AND no precordial Q waves (in other words, no signs of old anterior wall infarct)

- Recent history of angina

- ECG pattern present in a pain-free state

- Normal or slightly elevated cardiac markers

Two patterns of T waves can be seen in Wellens syndrome. Type-A T waves are biphasic, with initial positivity and terminal negativity. These T wave findings are present in approximately 25% of cases. Type-B T waves are deeply and symmetrically inverted. These findings are present in approximately 75% of cases. The 2 types of T waves found in Wellens syndrome exist on a spectrum of disease with type-A T waves evolving into type-B T waves. The T-wave abnormalities may be persistent, remaining in place for hours to weeks, even when the patient is pain-free.

Wellens syndrome is not always an acute process. It can develop over days to weeks. The ECG pattern often develops when the patient is not experiencing chest pain. When the patient does experience chest pain, the ST segment and T-wave pattern can appear to normalize into hyperacute upright T waves (so-called “pseudo-normalization”) or even develop into ST-segment elevations.

Cardiac biomarkers including troponin may be falsely reassuring in patients with Wellens syndrome as they frequently result within normal limits. In one prospective study, only 12% of patients with Wellens’ pattern on ECG had elevated cardiac enzymes, and these elevations were less than twice the upper limit of normal.
