More often than not, the anterior right atrial branch of the RCA supplies the SA node via the sinoatrial nodal artery. In these patients, substantial occlusion of the RCA due to coronary artery disease (CAD) may induce arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, caused by the reduced blood flow to the SA node. Myocardial Ischemia is another common complication of reduced blood flow to the myocardium caused by CAD. Atherosclerotic plaques clogging the RCA or ARAA could potentially result in angina or myocardial infarction. This lack of blood flow to the atrium could cause cessation or severe impairment of cardiac function and send the patient into a cardiogenic shock.
