While working behind an operative microscope is primarily a single surgeon endeavor, the operating room scrub technician is an essential piece in creating a seamless working environment. The trained scrub technician affords the surgeon the luxury of never removing their eyes away from the microscope and, thus, the operative field. Depending on where a graft is obtained from, an assistant may be required to harvest a venous graft from the dorsum of the hand opposite the ear concurrently undergoing surgery. Alternatively, the single otologic surgeon may utilize a temporalis fascia graft, harvested before beginning the operation. In both cases, the scrub technician is capable of drying and caring for the graft until it is needed later in the procedure.
