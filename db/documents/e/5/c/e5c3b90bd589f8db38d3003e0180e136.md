There are no clear contraindications in prescribing Fresnel prisms. But there are a few precautions that should be kept in mind before prescribing Fresnel prisms.

- Prism Adaptation – This determines the deviation before planning surgical correction. In a few patients, prism adaptation can be harmful. For example, if prism adaptation occurs with the Fresnel prism and is not diagnosed by the clinician, this may increase underlying deviation.

- Incomitant strabismus – In incomitant strabismus, the deviation varies in different gazes; thus, prescribing Fresnel prisms helps correct deviation only in one gaze. Fresnel prisms might not help correct diplopia in other directions of gaze or even worsen the underlying diplopia.

- Dragged fovea – In this, the fovea of the patient is displaced secondary to an epiretinal membrane or an underlying maculopathy. Fresnel prisms can help in temporarily reducing central double vision. But, as the peripheral fusion overcomes the central fusion, the diplopia is again appreciated in a few seconds. If the orthoptists or ophthalmologists keep adding prism, this may lead to an actual ocular deviation because of prism and muscle length adaptation.
