Isotretinoin is an oral prescription medication that affects sebaceous glands and is used to treat severe acne. The drug was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1982 to treat severe, resistant, nodular acne that is unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics. Non-FDA-approved indications include moderate acne, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, neuroblastoma, and prevention of squamous cell carcinoma in high-risk patients. Isotretinoin has also been used in the treatment of rosacea, folliculitis, and pyoderma faciale. This activity covers isotretinoin, including mechanism of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, contraindications, monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of isotretinoin therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the therapeutic mechanism of action of isotretinoin.
- Identify the indications, both approved and off-label, for isotretinoin.
- Review the adverse event and accompanying monitoring for isotretinoin.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy, and follow-up coordination for patients receiving isotretinoin.
