A detailed history is essential in making a diagnosis of Vitamin D toxicity. A thorough review of the medication list, including the use of over-the-counter supplements, is pertinent. History should also focus on acquiring details of chronic medical ailments that require high doses of vitamin D supplementation, such as osteoporosis, renal osteodystrophy, psoriasis, gastric bypass surgery, and celiac or inflammatory bowel disease. A dietary history is essential, especially the excessive use of vitamin D-fortified milk and supplementary vitamin D.

The clinical signs and symptoms of vitamin D toxicity manifest from hypercalcemia's effects. Often, symptoms can be nonspecific and subtle, such as weakness, fatigue, anorexia, and bone pains.

Physical exams of patients with signs of toxicity can show loss of skin turgor and dry mucous membranes (due to dehydration); changes in mental status; and abdominal tenderness without rebound, rigidity, or guarding. Physical exam findings can be unremarkable, but high clinical suspicion should be maintained based on historical information.
