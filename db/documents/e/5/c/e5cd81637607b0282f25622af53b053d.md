Both the bell, as well as tentacles, of C. barnesi, contain nematocysts that allow the species to sting, unlike most jellyfish species. It is not clear, however, whether the bell, tentacles or both, contain the toxic fraction that causes the Irukandji syndrome.

Regardless of the organ that delivers it, the venom of C. barnesi is proteinaceous and contains a neural sodium channel activator, which acts on the same sodium channels that are sensitive to tetrodotoxin, causing the release of catecholamines, particularly norepinephrine and epinephrine, and also direct vasoconstrictor effects. It is this effect that is believed to be responsible for the sympathomimetic-like manifestations of Irukandji syndrome, characterized by hypertension and tachycardia.

Acute cardiac failure can also occur and is thought to be mediated by two possible mechanisms:

- Stress-induced cardiomyopathy secondary to either hypertension or the toxic effects of catecholamines on cardiomyocytes.

- Pore formation on myocardial cellular membranes, which disrupts cell function, and allows for the influx of toxins and outflow of cardiac enzymes.

Human cases of severe envenomation were associated with systemic hypertension, myocardial dysfunction, and elevated serum troponin levels.

Cnidarian venoms, in general, cause pain by activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), a non-selective cation channel expressed in nociceptive neurons.
