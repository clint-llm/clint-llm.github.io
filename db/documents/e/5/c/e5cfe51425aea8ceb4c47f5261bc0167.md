Osteogenic sarcoma (osteosarcoma) is the most common primary tumor of the bone, found most commonly in the extremities, with a bimodal age distribution.

High-grade conventional intramedullaryÂ osteosarcoma is the most common subtype.

Complete surgical extirpation is usually the treatment of choice if localized.
