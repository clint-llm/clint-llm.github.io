It is imperative to read the manufacturer's instruction booklet, as each unit might have slight variances in recommendations. TENS units are now small and lightweight. Patients can place them in their pocket, on a desk, or hold them. Treatment sessions can take place at the convenience of the patient except while operating heavy machinery, driving, bathing, showering, or swimming. The unit should be powered off before placing the pads. Electrode pad placement is at least 1 inch apart in the appropriate dermatomal region of the targeted pain. The skin underlying pad placement must have intact sensation. After powering on the unit, the setting titration is to manufacturer recommendations. Red and black lead placement have little impact on clinical outcomes.
