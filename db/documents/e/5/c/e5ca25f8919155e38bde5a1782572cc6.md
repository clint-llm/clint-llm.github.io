The previous hypersensitivity reactions to the same class of drugs are contraindications for fosphenytoin. As fosphenytoin affects ventricular automaticity, there is a risk of exacerbating preexisting cardiac conditions.

**Contraindications to Fosphenytoin Use**

- Adams-Stokes syndrome

- History of hepatotoxicity associated with fosphenytoin or phenytoin sodium

- Concomitant use with delavirdine due to decreased effectiveness of the virologic response of delavirdine

- Cardiac conditions, particularly second and third-degree atrioventricular block, sino-atrial block, and sinus bradycardia

- Hypersensitivity to phenytoin, hydantoin drugs, or fosphenytoin itself as hypersensitivity reactions may cause angioedema.
