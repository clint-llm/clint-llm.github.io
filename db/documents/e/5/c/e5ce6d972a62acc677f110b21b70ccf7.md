Incidence or prevalence of Prinzmetal angina is still unknown. The reason for this is the possibleÂ misdiagnosis or confusion with other conditions that might present with the same symptoms, and further evaluation is not sought. Some studies show that the Japanese population has an increased risk of developing vasospastic angina when compared with Caucasian populations. The difference between the Japanese population and the Caucasian population is that the former has a three times higher risk. The average age of presentation of vasospastic angina is around the fifth decade of life. Females are more likely within the Japanese population to experience vasospastic angina.
