Subglottic stenosis can be defined as the narrowing of the upper airway, which lies between the vocal folds and the lower border of the cricoid cartilage. Normally, the subglottic lumen is 4.5 mm to 5.5 mm in a full-term neonate, while a 3.5 mm lumen is normal in a premature neonate. A subglottic diameter of 4 mm or less in a full-term neonate is considered as narrow. Causes of subglottic stenosis can be either congenital, acquired, or idiopathic**.**In congenital subglottic stenosis, there is no history of endotracheal intubation or any other acquired cause of the stenosis. A rare genetic disorder called Pallister Killian syndrome is caused by tetrasomy 12p mosaicism and presents phenotypically with multisystem morphologic defects involving the respiratory system and progressive subglottic stenosis.

Acquired subglottic stenosis is more common than congenital due to the introduction of prolonged intubation in the 1960s, and it does not improve with time.

Symptoms of idiopathic subglottic stenosis can be misinterpreted as asthma. When asthma medication fails to treat symptoms, the patient is diagnosed with an endoscopic evaluation. Depending on the severity of the stenosis, the treatment can involve Grilloâ€™s technique, cricoplasty, or a combination of resection and enlargement techniques using rib cartilage grafts.
