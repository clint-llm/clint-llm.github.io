Medical training requires a high level of cognitive function and confidence in the decision-making process. These abilities are fundamental to being a leader; thus, there is an essential need to provide opportunities for clinicians to develop leadership abilities. Additionally, influencing how services are delivered leads to greater confidence that patient care is central to function and not directed by external agendas.

Leadership training as part of the resident curriculum can significantly increase confidence in leadership skills in terms of alignment, communication, and integrity, which are tools that have been previously shown in business models to be essential for effective and efficient teams.

Another assessment tool in ethical decision making (EDM) stems from using a modified Delphi method, where a theoretical framework and a self-assessment tool consisting of 35 statements called Ethical Decision-Making Climate Questionnaire (EDMCQ) was developed. The EDMCQ is meant to capture three EDM domains in healthcare, such as interdisciplinary collaboration and communication, leadership, and ethical environment. This assessment tool has been subsequently validated in 13 European countries and the USA and has been useful in EDM by clinicians and contributes to the EDM climate of healthcare organizations.
