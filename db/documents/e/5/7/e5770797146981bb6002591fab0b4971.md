Niacin deficiencyÂ is preventable with an adequate diet rich in protein; therefore, nutritional education and food access are crucial to prevention. In individuals with malabsorptive conditions or those taking medications that reduce the availability of niacin, supplementation may be desirable.

Adding milk, meats, peanuts, whole or enriched grains, green leafy vegetables, and brewers' dry yeast leads to better niacin intake. A semisolid or liquid diet may be needed for patients with oral dysphagia due to glossitis. Long-term inclusion of meat, milk, and eggs in the diet leads to dietary adequacy of proteins critical for recovery.
