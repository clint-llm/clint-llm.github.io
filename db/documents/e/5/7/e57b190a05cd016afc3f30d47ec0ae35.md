On histopathologic examination, lesions of superficial lymphangioma consist of a collection of large lymphatic cisterns lying deep in the subcutaneous plane that communicate via dilated dermal lymphatic channels lined with endothelial cells. The overlying epidermis is usually acanthotic or hyperkeratotic and has an irregular elongation of rete pegs. No atypical vascular features, nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, or koilocytic changes typically exist. A mild to the moderate inflammatory infiltrate may be present.
