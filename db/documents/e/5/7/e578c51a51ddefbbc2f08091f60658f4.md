The atlantoaxial joint is a unique joint with multiple distinct structural aspects contributing to its crucial function for cervical stability and mobilization. It consists of three distinct, synovial joints: one medial joint and two lateral atlantoaxial joints. The median atlantoaxial joint's structure is formed by the dens of C1 vertebrae and two ligamentous structures anteriorly and posteriorly.

The multipurpose function of the atlantoaxial joint is crucial in practical application, allowing the head to rotate and turn to the left or right. Without the atlantoaxial joint, the kinematic capability of the head and neck would not allow for the nearly 600 movements per hour that we make as humans.

**Atlas (C1)**

The atlas is a circular shape that articulates with the cranium above it with the zygapophyseal joints, or lateral masses. Below, the atlas articulates with the axis through its bilateral condyles.

**Axis (C2)**

This vertebra is known as the C2 vertebra and possesses a characteristic feature called the dens or odontoid process. This structure is on the vertebrae's anterior portion and extends superiorly, articulating with the axis above. Other features of the axis are the superior articular facets, bifid spinous process, and bilateral transverse foramina.
