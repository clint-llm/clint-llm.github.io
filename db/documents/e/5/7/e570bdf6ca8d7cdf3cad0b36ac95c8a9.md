The diagnostic criteria for aplastic anemia are the following: the presence of bone marrow hypocellularity and  2 or more cytopenias (reticulopodia less than 1% or less than 40,000/microliter, neutropenia less than 500/microliter, or thrombocytopenia less than 20,000/microliter). The moderate disease has less than 30% bone marrow cellularity; the severe disease has less than 25% cellularity or less than 50% cellularity containing fewer than 30% hematopoietic cells, and very severe meets severe criteria plus neutropenia less than 200/µL. Aspirate of bone marrow has little yield (“dry tap”). Bone marrow biopsy is essential: it will be markedly hypocellular and devoid of marrow progenitors. Genetic testing with flow cytometry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is useful to exclude hematologic malignancies responsible for pancytopenia. Additional testing depends on the underlying condition responsible for bone marrow failure, for example, telomerase mutation testing for dyskeratosis congenital.
