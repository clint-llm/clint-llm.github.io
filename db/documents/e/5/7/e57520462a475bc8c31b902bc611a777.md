Erythema multiforme minor (EMm) essentially touches the skin with typical lesions and symmetrical acralÂ disposition. The mucosal involvement is rare, and when it is present, it is light and affects a single mucosa, often the mouth.

In Erythema multiforme major (EMM), the skin lesions are more extensive but do not exceed 10% of the body surface area. Typical target lesions are present. The mucosal involvement is severe and affects at least two different mucosal sites; the oral mucosa is typically affected.
