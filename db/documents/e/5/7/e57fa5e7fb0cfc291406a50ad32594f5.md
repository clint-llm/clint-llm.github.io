Symptoms of ricin ingestion include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hematemesis, and melena. Necrosis of the spleen, liver, and kidneys may occur. Inhalation exposure symptoms include a cough, wheezing, dyspnea, sore throat, and congestion. Exposed patients may go on to develop pulmonary edema and pneumonia. Symptoms of injection exposure include erythema, induration, blisters, capillary leak syndrome, and localized necrosis surrounding the injection site. These symptoms may progress to seizures, shock, organ failure, pulmonary edema, and respiratory failure. Symptoms may begin within a few hours if ingested; however, symptoms may start almost immediately or may not be apparent for several hours in cases of ingestion or inhalation.
