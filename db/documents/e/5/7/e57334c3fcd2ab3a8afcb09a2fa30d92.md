Propofol infusion syndrome usually presents in patients who have been administered propofol for an extended time at high doses.Â  Based on published case reports, the odds of developing PRIS increase when propofol is administered for over 48 hours or at a rate of around 4mg/kg/hr (67mcg/kg/minute).

Risk factors include severe illnesses such as sepsis, cerebral injury, airway infection, and poor oxygen perfusion. Other possible considerations that may play a role in PRIS are low carbohydrate levels, use of glucocorticoids, subclinical mitochondrial disease, and carnitine deficiency.
