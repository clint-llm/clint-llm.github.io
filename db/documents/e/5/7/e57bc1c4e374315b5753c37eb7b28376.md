Immunohistopathology of type II hypersensitive reactions illustrates antibody-mediated cytotoxicity (IgG and IgM) together with other disease-specific features. In Graves disease, there is diffuse hyperplasia of the follicular cells of the thyroid with an increased follicle/stroma ratio.

In Goodpasture syndrome, renal biopsy under a light microscope shows crescentic glomerulonephritis. Immunofluorescence shows the linear deposition of IgG with a complement along the basement membrane.
