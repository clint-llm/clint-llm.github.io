Echocardiography can detect HLHS in utero or after birth. The pathophysiology of HLHS is evolutionary during fetal life. The left ventricle will decrease in size as gestation progresses, and the defect may not be detected by echocardiography until the third trimester.

The chest x-ray will usually reveal an enlarged cardiac silhouette and signs of pulmonary venous hypertension.

Blood work consisting of arterial blood gas, complete blood count, electrolytes, and lactate should be obtained to evaluate acid-base status, oxygenation and ventilation, kidney function, and hematocrit. Genetic testing should also be obtained as HLHS has been associated with multiple chromosomal abnormalities, including Turner, DiGeorge, and Down syndrome. Neonates with a chromosomal abnormality have a higher morbidity and mortality rate as well as a longer hospital stay after surgery.

Neonates with severe congenital heart disease have an increased incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage and will often require a head ultrasound before surgical repair.
