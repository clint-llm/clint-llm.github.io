Important differential diagnosis of BRVO includes diabetic retinopathy and hypertensive retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy can be discerned from BRVO based on a few key features. Diabetic retinopathy is usually bilateral whereas BRVO is usually unilateral. Although both BRVO and diabetic retinopathy may present with dot blot hemorrhages and microaneurysms, only in diabetic retinopathy will extend across the horizontal raphe. Hypertensive retinopathy is the same; hemorrhages are not confined to a single sector, and the findings are usually bilateral.
