Lomitapide binds instantly to and suppresses microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inside the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. Suppressing MTP hinders producing lipoproteins that contain apo-B in the hepatocytes and the enterocytes and leads to a decrease in generating very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons and hence decreases the levels of LDL-C in plasma.
