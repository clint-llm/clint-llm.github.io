The incidence can be difficult to estimate given the numerous underlying etiologies. Further, not all patients with an underlying disease have the clinical manifestation of digital clubbing. In general, clubbing is seen in roughly 1% of all internal medicine admissions and is associated with serious underlying disease in 40% of those patients.

Of the etiologies in adults, the most common pulmonary cause of clubbing is lung malignancy.

Patients with clubbing may also have hypertrophic osteo­arthropathy, a condition that characteristically presents with the subperiosteal formation of new cancellous bone at the distal ends of long bones, in particular, the radius and ulna and the tibia and fibula. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is almost always associated with clubbing, particularly in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, other intrathoracic malignancies, and cystic fibrosis.
