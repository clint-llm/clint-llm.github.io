**Trauma- Ulnar Artery Transection**

The superficial location of the flexor tendons, median and ulnar nerves, and arteries at the volar wrist, make these structures particularly vulnerable to any sharp injury in this region. The ulnar artery often suffers injury in conjunction with the ulnar nerve and the flexor carpi ulnaris tendon because of their close anatomic relationship as detailed earlier.

**Ulnar Artery Thrombosis/Aneurysm (Hypothenar Hammer Syndrome)**

With the ulnar artery at a relatively unprotected superficial location as it travels through the Guyon canal, it is particularly susceptible to injury when subjected to repetitive blunt trauma, such as when a manual worker uses the hypothenar aspect of the hand as a hammer.

**Flaps for Soft Tissue Defects**

Thorough familiarity with the vascular anatomy of the ulnar artery and its perforating branches allows plastic surgeons to plan different flaps to satisfy the reconstructive needs of a patient.

Based on proximal muscular perforators of the ulnar artery, the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle flap can be rotated proximally for coverage of soft tissue defects of the proximal forearm and elbow. More recently, the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle flap has been described as a distally based muscle flap (based on a more distal ulnar artery muscular perforator) for wrist and hand soft tissue coverage.

Ulnar artery perforator-based fasciocutaneous propeller flaps have utility for soft tissue coverage of defects involving the dorsal-ulnar hand and palmar-ulnar wrist.

The ulnar forearm free flap is a fasciocutaneous free flap based on the ulnar artery and its perforating branches to the overlying skin component. It is a thin, pliable relatively hairless flap commonly used for oncologic reconstruction of small- to medium-size soft tissue defects of the head and neck.
