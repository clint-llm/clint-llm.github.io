Complications surrounding bedpan use may include constipation, embarrassment, discomfort, and loss of dignity due to inadequate patient privacy.

**Privacy and Dignity**

An audit conducted in 2010 addressed "Toilet Privacy in the Hospital"

Areas of interest amongst patients while toileting consisted of specific vital points, for example, call light out of reach or cord too short, slow response to call light, lack of hand hygiene after toilet use for the patient, curtains that would not close properly and lack of privacy while toileting. Suggestions were made to improve patient privacy while defecating or urinating such as better signage

**Constipation**

Another complication of bedpan use can be constipation. An environment that lacks appropriate privacy may force a patient to feel that it is inconvenient to use the toilet, thus resisting the urge to defecate. If defecation is discommoding, the desire to defecate prompts voluntary contraction of the external sphincter and puborectalis muscle. This urge dissipates, and the rectum accommodates to hold more stool (as cited in Sun, Read & Miner, 1990)

A study conducted between 2003 and 2004 on stroke patients found that (55.2%) developed new-onset constipation within a month after the first stroke

A study sponsored by the Italian Space Agency analyzed ten healthy men for the effects extended bedrest had on the body as it related to new onset constipation. The men were studied for 35 days in a controlled environment on strict bedrest with bedpan use for defecation in a lying, head down position. At the end of the study, 60% had new onset functional constipation
