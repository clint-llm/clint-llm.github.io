Complications of PSV include hypoventilation, hypoxemia, and the resultant changes in mental status and vital signs associated with these. It is imperative that a patient on PSV has adequate monitoring as described above to quickly identify these complications and change PSV settings or to a control mode of ventilation. Hypoventilation and hypoxemia can develop due to changes in mental status, airway resistance, and lung compliance. Conditions such as sedation effect, acute bronchospasm, and pulmonary edema are examples of physiologic changes in the patient that can result in decreased respiratory rate, decreased delivery of flow from the ventilator, or both.
