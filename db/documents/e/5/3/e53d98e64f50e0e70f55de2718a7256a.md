The anterior cerebral artery supplies the majority of the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere, including the cingulate gyrus. As a direct continuation of the anterior cerebral artery, the pericallosal artery travels within the callosal sulcus and gives off many small cortical branches that supply the rostrum of the cingulate gyrus. The callomarginal artery, the largest branch of the anterior cerebral artery, runs within the cingulate sulcus and supplies the portion of the cingulate gyrus underlying the paracentral lobule. Posteriorly, the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus receive vascular supply from the precuneal artery, a branch of the pericallosal artery.
