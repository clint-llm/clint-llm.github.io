Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are among the world's most significant public health problems due to their high resistance to antibiotics. These microorganisms have significant clinical importance in hospitals because they often require patients to be in the intensive care unit (ICU), and patients are at high risk of morbidity and mortality. Two large groups, Enterobacteriaceae and the non-fermenters, are responsible for most clinical isolates; nevertheless, other clinically pertinent gram-negative organisms exist, including Neisseria, Haemophilus spp., Helicobacter pylori, and Chlamydia trachomatis. This activity reviews the evaluation of gram-negative bacteria and the interprofessional team's role in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the types of gram-negative organisms that are clinically significant.
- Identify the treatment options for gram-negative infections based on the location and type of infection.
- Describe the mechanisms by which gram-negative bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics. 
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by gram-negative bacteria.
