The etiology of intracranial hypotension can be separated into two categories: spontaneous and iatrogenic. Iatrogenic ICH typically relates to continuous CSF leak into the epidural space following dural disruption secondary to LP. It has been observed that the removal of around 10% of CSF via LP induces orthostatic or postural headache in the average adult. This is clinically referred to as Lumbar Puncture Headache. Physicians theorize that a decrease in spinal CSF induces an increase in caudal CSF space compliance, which in turn leads to an abnormal distribution of craniospatial elasticity. This, in turn, causes further ICH and venous dilation in the upright position.

Several causes of spontaneous ICH have been hypothesized. The most widely accepted idea amongst the scientific community is the mechanism of a CSF leak. This primary theory describes CSF leak by disruption of the meninges in the spine. Minor trauma, such as twist or stretch of the meninges, has been found in many cases to cause rupture of underlying spinal epidural cysts or tear in the dural nerve sheath. Dural tear has been identified as the second most common cause of CSF leak, while leaks from meningeal diverticula represent the leading cause. Notably, several studies have found the latter to be the case in patients with underlying connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan's syndrome, due to predisposition for dural diverticula.

Spinal CSF-venous fistulas have been found to induce CSF hypovolemia by a mechanism of CSF leaking from the subarachnoid space into the venous system. CSF-venous fistulas are the third leading cause of CSF leak, although only making up about 2.5% of cases.

The majority of CSF leaks occur within the spine, specifically the thoracic or cervicothoracic junction. Rarely, CSF leaks can occur at the skull base, although it is controversial whether this anatomical region of CSF leak relates to cases of spontaneous ICH and orthostatic headache. One study suggested that patients presenting with an orthostatic headache should be presumed to have a spinal source for CSF leak even if there is already evidence of skull base CSF leak.

Although controversial, it is thought that low venous pressure could induce spontaneous ICH via low venous pressure within the inferior venous cava system, typically when blood is displaced to the lower extremities during activity. This induces venous hypotension within the epidural venous system, which in turn causes a decrease in the outflow of CSF along the spinal cavity. In this scenario, CSF leaks are precipitated from existing dural diverticula or cysts and thought to be a resulting factor of low epidural venous pressure.
