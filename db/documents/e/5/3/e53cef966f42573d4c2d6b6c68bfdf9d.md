Therapy with varenicline requires an interprofessional healthcare team approach to optimize the chance of success and minimize the adverse effect profile. This interprofessional team includes clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating their efforts and exercising open communication so that every team member operates from the same information. Since smoking cessation will improve almost all aspects of health, the team needs to create an environment for the greatest patient success.

Smoking remains a significant public health problem, and despite decades of research, there is no definitive solution to help people quit this social habit. Many drugs are on the market to help people quit smoking, but none works consistently, and relapse rates are high. Because smokers can presentÂ with various medical disorders, the onus is on healthcare workers to educate them on the dangers of smoking. Varenicline is a relatively new drug on the market, and data indicates that it can help people quit smoking in the short term; however, the patient also has to be provided with psychosocial support at the same time.
