In those with a history of prior infection, theÂ VZV normally lies dormant within a dorsal root ganglion. In a healthy individual, immunity acquired from the initial infection allows suppression of the virus. However, often in the setting of weakened immunity, the virus may reactivate in the form of herpes zoster, also known as shingles. HZO specifically refers to a reactivated VZV infection involving the V1 nerve division after having lied dormant within the trigeminal nerve ganglion (also known as the Gasserian ganglion). V1 is subdivided into three branches: the frontal nerve branch, the nasociliary nerve branch, and the lacrimal nerve branch. Any or all of these nerve branches may be affected in the case of HZO. The disease typically results in ocular and facial lesions with potential progression to more serious complications. The main risk factors for HZO include age over 50 years old and immunocompromised status (e.g., history of HIV, autoimmune diseases requiring corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants, organ or bone marrow transplant, or chemotherapy treatment). Other chronic diseases, acute illnesses, and physical and emotional stressors can also precipitate HZO.
