Nasal bone fractures represent the most common facial bone fractures, accounting for 40 to 50 percent of cases. Nasal fractures are generally associated with physical assault, falls, sports injuries, and traffic accidents. Bony nasal trauma may occur as an isolated injury or in combination with other soft tissue and bony facial injuries. This activity describes the pathophysiology of nasal fractures and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of those injuries.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of nasal fractures.
- Summarize the causes of nasal fractures.
- Review the treatment options for nasal fractures.
- Review the roles that interprofessional team members play to improve outcomes for patients with nasal fractures.
