Due to similar clinical presentation, some authors combine pronator teres syndrome with the following proximal median nerve entrapment syndromes

- Ligament of Struthers entrapment - MN compression by a ligament running from medial epicondyle to a bony spur on a distal medial humerus, which is present only in 1-2 % of the population. The pain in the forearm and paresthesias in the median-innervated digits is exacerbated by supination of the forearm and extension of the elbow (versus pronation in PTS). The radial pulse may also be decreased as the brachial artery runs next to the median nerve.

- MN entrapment by hypertrophied lacertus fibrosis  (bicipital aponeurosis) - This is fascia attaching the biceps to the ulna and overlies the MN in the proximal forearm. The pain in the forearm and paresthesias in the median-innervated digits is exacerbated by resisted flexion of the elbow with the forearm in supination.

- MN compression by the sublimus bridge of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle - The pain in a forearm and paresthesias in the median-innervated digits is exacerbated by resisted flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint of the middle finger while other fingers are held in extension.

Pronator teres syndrome should also be distinguished from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), MN entrapment at the wrist, which is the most common MN entrapment syndrome, as well as from AIN syndrome, brachial plexus injury, or cervical radiculopathy.

Pronator teres syndrome has a sensory loss in the entire median nerve distribution versus CTS, where sensation is spared over the thenar eminence because palmar cutaneous branch leaves the median nerve proximal to carpal tunnel but distal to PT muscle. In addition, pronation is spared in CTS, and nocturnal paresthesia symptoms are usually absent in pronator teres syndrome.

Because of overlapping symptoms, CTS is sometimes diagnosed, and more proximal pronator teres syndrome is missed when both are present in the same limb.

To distinguish AIN from pronator teres syndrome, the pronation should be demonstrated with the elbow flexed (PQ function) to avoid the contribution of the PT, which is the primary muscle to pronate with the arm extension.

In the case of brachial plexus injury or cervical radiculopathy, the examination may reveal a weakness in other muscles outside the median nerve territory. Neck pain that radiates to the arm is a common complaint, suggesting cervical radiculopathy.

One group of authors describe a neuralgic amyotrophy as a potential competing condition with pronator teres syndrome due to similar symptoms, but it usually involves multiple nerves, and pain is more commonly localized in the shoulder rather than in the forearm. Neuralgic amyotrophy is an idiopathic condition that usually improves spontaneously in 6 to 12 months.
