# Continuing Education Activity

In the second half of the 20th century, bisphosphonates have emerged as a novel treatment for bone metabolism disorders. Currently, bisphosphonates are widely used in the management of cancer-related bone disease and osteoporosis. This activity reviews some of the most significant complications related to bisphosphonate toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of bisphosphonate toxicity.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of bisphosphonate toxicity.
- Outline the management options for bisphosphonate toxicity.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to enhance the delivery of care for patients with bisphosphonate toxicity.

# Introduction

Bisphosphonates are the cornerstone in the management of metabolic and cancer-related bone disease. The use of bisphosphonates in patients with multiple myeloma and metastatic bone disease has led to a reduced incidence of pathological fractures.

Bisphosphonates first appeared on the industrial scene in the 19th century when their unique structural properties were used to ‘soften water’ to prevent scaling and corrosion of pipes.

Despite their benefits, bisphosphonates have both short-term and long-term side effects. A good understanding of these is essential when prescribing this class of drugs.

# Etiology

In healthy bone, the bony tissues undergo constant remodeling. Two processes occur simultaneously: resorption of the bone executed by osteoclasts and production of new bone mediated by osteoblasts. Maintaining a healthy balance between these two processes is key in maintaining bone homeostasis.

Bisphosphonates and calcium pyrophosphates are similar in structure. In healthy bone, calcium pyrophosphates bind to calcium, forming a strong bond.

Bisphosphonate toxicity can be seen at both therapeutic dosing and overdoses. It is also independent of the renal or hepatic function of the patient. Ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake before, during, and after bisphosphonate therapy limits some of the adverse effects, especially hypocalcemia.

# Epidemiology

A recent meta-analysis of 47 studies of breast cancer patients who were given intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates included 23 randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) with the total number of patients included being 20,607. Influenza-like illness was shown to be the most common side effect of bisphosphonate use, with no observable difference between the sexes.

Other side effects were fatigue, fever, dyspepsia, and anorexia. The overall incidence of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) was 2% compared to that for patients taking oral bisphosphonates for osteoporosis, where it ranges from about 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000 patient-years

# History and Physical

The findings from the clinical history and examination of patients with bisphosphonate toxicity depend on the complications that arise. A thorough history of exposure, along with the physical examination, will assist in decision-making for further evaluation and treatment. Given the diversity of the complications, a detailed review of systems helps identify the organs involved.

**Systemic Adverse Effects**

Flu-like symptoms have been observed with intravenous bisphosphonate use.

**Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Effects**

There are several commonly encountered adverse effects from the oral use of bisphosphonates. Erosive esophagitis can be seen and is thought to be related to suboptimal oral administration of bisphosphonates. Patients should be advised to ingest the drug with a full glass of water and then maintain an upright position for 30-60 minutes. The association between bisphosphonate use and nausea, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain appears to be weaker, and the occurrence of any of these symptoms should prompt further evaluation for underlying GI conditions before discontinuation of the bisphosphonates. Proton pump inhibitors can be used to reduce these adverse effects.

**Hypocalcemia**

Several conditions increase the risk of hypocalcemia during bisphosphonates use. Vitamin D deficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and hypomagnesemia are all predisposing factors.

**Ocular Complications**

Even at the recommended dosing, pamidronate can cause scleritis, uveitis, and conjunctivitis.

**Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (ONJ)**

Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a condition characterized by the destruction of bone tissue in the jaw due to a lack of blood supply associated with infection from oral flora.

There are 2 main factors that influence the likelihood of developing ONJ. The first one is the type and total dose of bisphosphonates. The more potent the drug and longer the drug is used, the higher the risk of ONJ. Also, the risk is 15-fold higher, with intravenous bisphosphonates compared to oral bisphosphonates.

Pain and exposed bone are the most common presenting features.

**Subtrochanteric Femoral Fractures**

Although not clearly shown in clinical trials, several case reports describe the association between bisphosphonates and subtrochanteric femoral fractures. These typically occur either spontaneously or following low-impact trauma. They are located in the proximal or mid-femoral diaphysis, and they are seen in patients who are on long term treatment with bisphosphonates. They should be suspected in patients who report vague femoral pain or weakness. Recent reports, however, refute the association with bisphosphonate use. Rather they propose that subtrochanteric femoral fractures are an uncommon type of osteoporotic fracture or a manifestation of rare metabolic bone disorders, such as adult hypophosphatasia. Imaging helps diagnose this condition and referral to a metabolic bone disease specialist may be useful.

# Evaluation

Laboratory studies provide further information when diagnosing complications of bisphosphonate use. For instance, a low hemoglobin can be seen with erosive esophagitis. Calcium and vitamin D levels can help identify hypocalcemia, and a rising creatinine is a key feature in diagnosing nephrotoxicity.

Plain X-rays can show atypical femoral fractures appearing transversely, sometimes obliquely, and with a "beaked" appearance on the cortex. Increased uptake in the affected area can be seen on the technetium (Tc)-99m bone scan. In cases with a negative X-ray and a high clinical suspicion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful. A low signal fracture line in T1, T2, and short TI inversion recovery (STIR) images can be seen, while the marrow signal appears low in T1 and high in T2 and STIR.

# Treatment / Management

**Management of Acute-phase Reactions**

These systemic reactions are typically self-limiting. The mainstay of management is the supportive use of acetaminophen with or without nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Acute-phase reactions normally resolve within 48 hours. Premedication with acetaminophen is advised with recurrent doses. It is important to rule out other causes of fever, such as infection.

**Management of Upper GI Adverse Effects**

As mentioned earlier, the occurrence of these complications can be prevented by proper administration of the drug. The use of bisphosphonates, however, should be avoided in patients who have chronic esophageal conditions, such as Barret's esophagus.

**Management of Hypocalcemia**

Managing hypocalcemia in the context of bisphosphonate use involves identifying leading causes such as previous radiotherapy to the head and neck, prior thyroidectomy, and hypomagnesemia.

**Management of Ocular Complications**

Ocular complications are rare and usually not vision-threatening. However, a referral to an ophthalmologist is recommended for the management of ocular complications.

**Management of Osteonecrosis of the Jaw**

Prevention and early identification of high-risk patients are key strategies in the management of ONJ.

Once ONJ occurs, management becomes challenging.

**Management of Subtrochanteric Femoral Fractures**

Upon confirmation of the fracture, bisphosphonates should be discontinued, and calcium and vitamin D supplementation considered. Orthopedic referral shall be sought depending on the imaging findings.

# Differential Diagnosis

It is important to be mindful of other conditions that have a similar radiographic appearance as osteonecrosis of the jaw, such as radiation-induced osteonecrosis and infections.

# Prognosis

Prognosis varies depending on the complications seen. While flu-like symptoms are benign and self-limiting, erosive esophagitis, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and nephrotoxicity are serious complications and can cause significant morbidity and mortality.

# Complications

**Nephrotoxicity**

Particular caution should be considered while giving bisphosphonates to patients with pre-existing renal impairment.

Amongst the available bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid carries the highest risk of causing renal failure.

Nephrotoxicity from pamidronate, however, presents clinically as nephrotic syndrome.

Prevention and early detection of renal failure are key in the management of bisphosphonate-related nephrotoxicity. Preventative measures include pre-infusion serum creatinine checks, adequate hydration, avoidance of simultaneous use of nephrotoxic medications, and dose adjustments in patients with mild renal insufficiency.

Once nephrotoxicity occurs, the first step in management is the discontinuation of the bisphosphonate. Management is mostly supportive, as no specific treatment has shown benefit.

**Atrial Fibrillation**

An association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and bisphosphonate use has been proposed. Large clinical trials, such as the Fracture Intervention Trial and the HORIZON Pivotal Fracture Trial, have reported an increased risk of developing AF (1.3% risk in the zoledronic group versus 0.5% in the placebo group). This was followed, however, by several observational studies that found no association. In conclusion, the retrospective trials investigating the link found the evidence to be neither positive nor completely ruled out. It should be noted that bisphosphonates are usually given to elderly patients with pre-existing comorbidities, including AF. Further trials could clarify this association.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Before starting a bisphosphonate, a discussion of the possible adverse effects and toxicities needs to be held with patients. Risk assessment is key in managing patients who are candidates for bisphosphonates. A discussion within and amongst the healthcare and dental professional teams will further help to select appropriate patients in whom the benefits of bisphosphonates outweigh the associated risks.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Bisphosphonate use is becoming a cornerstone in the management of metastatic bone disease and osteoporosis. As with any medication, bisphosphonate use can cause toxicity. Clinicians need to be mindful of these toxic side effects. Regular check-ups and routine physical examinations, as well as frequent blood tests, are key in the ongoing management of patients receiving bisphosphonates. This is best achieved with an interprofessional team approach. Prompt recognition of toxicities is important in improving outcomes. Providing education to patients and families before and during treatment with bisphosphonates can also improve patient outcomes by early detection of toxicities. Interprofessional team input is essential in managing toxicities once they occur.
