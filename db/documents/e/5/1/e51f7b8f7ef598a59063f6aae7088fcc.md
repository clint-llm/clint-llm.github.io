**Skin Prick Testing**

Concentrations of 1 to 10 or 1 to 20 g/L of each allergen and both a positive and negative control is placed on the skin at least 2 cm apart from each other. A special device is then used to scratch the skin and introduce the allergen below the skin's outer layer. The positive control is typically histamine dichloride 10g/L concentration, and the negative control is typically glycerinated saline histamine at the same concentration. The test is then read at 10 minutes for the controls and 15 to 20 minutes for the allergens.

**Intradermal Testing**

Each allergen is injected intradermally to make a wheel, similar to conducting a tuberculin test. The concentration of allergens is much higher at 1 to 500 to 1 to 1000.

**Patch Testing**

A patch with the allergen is placed on the skin, usually the back, for 48 hours. The test is then read 15 to 60 minutes after the patch is removed.
