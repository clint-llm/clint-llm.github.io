CCl4 toxicity may cause abnormal liver function tests (LFT) such as increased aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH); these depend on the route and duration of toxin uptake. The toxin is absorbed rapidly in a great amount through inhalation than ingestion. So, AST, ALT, and GDH may increase within a very short period if inhalation is the route of toxin absorption.

Serum electrolytes and arterial blood gases (ABGs) require monitoring if the patient develops acute renal failure. In the early phase of acute renal failure, the patient may have hyperkalemia and hyperphosphatemia, whereas hypokalemia develops in the late phase. An ABG test reveals metabolic acidosis, which is due to the retention of acid.

Intraluminal CCl4 on the intestinal tract may present on the X-ray abdomen.
