Pneumonia is acquired when a sufficient volume of a pathogenic organism bypasses the body’s cough and laryngeal reflexes and makes its way into the parenchyma. This can occur from being exposed to large volumes of pathogens in inspired air, increasingly virulent pathogen exposure, aspiration or impaired host defenses. Given the different environments in which one may acquire pneumonia, the diagnosis is often broadly classified into community-acquired or hospital-acquired.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is responsible for the vast majority of atypical respiratory infections. However, only about 10% of patients who acquire mycoplasma will develop pneumonia. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection tends to be more common with advancing age, especially the elderly. The infection can occur all year round and outbreaks in small communities is common (Eg schools, homes). The organism is transmitted from person to person and the infection usually spreads slowly. Once the organism is acquired, the symptoms may take 4-20 days to appear and include malaise, cough, myalgia and sore throat. The cough is often dry and worse at night. Most cases of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection are mild and resolve on their own. Mycoplasma can also cause a variety of extrapulmonary symptoms like erythema nodosum, urticaria, erythema multiforme, aseptic meningitis, Guillain Barre syndrome, and cerebral ataxia. Individuals with preexisting lung disease may develop empyema, pneumothorax or even respiratory distress syndrome.

Chlamydia pneumoniae is also a common cause of infection of the lung. The organism is acquired after inhalation of contaminated aerosolized droplets. However, the incubation period is long and symptoms are usually mild. chlamydia pneumoniae infection is most common in elderly people. The infection presents with a sore throat, cough and a headache that can last for many weeks or months. The chest x-ray may show a mild infiltrative process. Death is rare but can occur in patients with comorbidities.

Legionella pneumoniae is the most pathogenic of the atypical bacteria that cause lung infection. Several serotypes exist and infection tends to occur in close quarters. Spread from other humans is rare; most cases are due to inhalation of the pathogen from water systems like humidors, whirlpools, respiratory therapy equipment, water faucets, and air conditioners. Places for water stagnates allows for the organism to proliferate. Individuals at risk for legionella may have diabetes, malignancy, renal or liver failure and may have had recent plumbing done in the home. Once acquired, the patient may present with altered mental status, cough, fever, and respiratory distress. At least 20-40% of patients develop diarrhea. Blood work may reveal leukocytosis and the sputum gram stain may show accumulation of inflammatory cells without any organism. Of the atypical organisms, legionella has a severe course and the illness can quickly become severe if not treated promptly. While extra pulmonary symtoms are rare, many patients develop severe respiratory distress often requiring mechanical ventilation.
