As mentioned early, the majority of thoracic disc herniation is asymptomatic and is discovered incidentally with an MRI. Unlike the lumbar and cervical disc herniations, thoracic disc herniations have atypical symptoms and often a diagnosis of exclusion. To accurately diagnose thoracic discogenic pain syndrome, a thorough history and physical examination should be done. As part of the patient's pain evaluation, assessment of the quality, intensity, distribution, alleviating, and aggravating factors is essential.

Patients with thoracic disc herniations may either present with radicular and/or myelopathic pain depending on if the herniated disc compresses the nerve roots or the spinal cord itself, respectively. With radicular pain, the patients will have pain that follows the dermatomal distribution. Essential landmarks for thoracic disc herniations to help with assessment include T-1 pain that radiates to the medial forearm, T-2 pain that radiates to the axilla, T-4 pain that radiates to the nipple area, T-10 pain that radiates to the umbilicus, and T-12 pain that is just above the inguinal ligaments. The most common initial pain is usually thoracic pain occurring in the midline area. The pain may be unilateral or bilateral depending on the location and how significant the herniation is. The pain may be intermittent and aggravated by coughing and straining. There have been reported cases of pain radiation to the groin, flank, and even the lower extremities.

It is always important to assess other conditions that may be causing the radicular pain. For example, patients with diseases like diabetes and shingles may have similar thoracic dermatomal pain, but in these cases, there will be metabolic abnormalities to prove diabetes and skin rash to point to shingles. It is also essential to rule out other mechanical causes that may lead to similar pain syndromes, for example, oblique muscle pain, rib fracture, fracture of the facet joints, and clavicle. Detailed patient history is needed to elicit the origin of the pain and to correlate pain with the patient lifestyle. For example, while athletes like baseball and golf players are most likely to have thoracic discogenic pain syndrome, they are also more prone to having pain from the oblique muscle, clavicle, or facet joint pain. Other conditions like patients with malignancies like neurofibroma may also present with thoracic pain syndromes. Assessing skin for cafe au lait spots and other neurofibromas that are associated with this condition is vital for diagnosis.

On the other hand, a patient with myelopathic pain may present with pain corresponding to the spinal cord region compressed and lower. The patient may present with lower extremity numbness and weakness, pain, gait abnormalities, hyperreflexia, and in rare cases paraplegia. Intracranial and postural hypotension and headache are exceptional, and emergency presentation with thoracic pain may be secondary to calcified disc tearing the dura leading to cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak.

Physical examination should include assessment of sensation with pinprick and touch in the upper extremity, thorax, and abdomen in the dermatomal regions mentioned above to check for radiculopathy and also in the lower extremity to check for myelopathy. Also, for the lower extremity, proprioception and reflexes and toned should be evaluated.
