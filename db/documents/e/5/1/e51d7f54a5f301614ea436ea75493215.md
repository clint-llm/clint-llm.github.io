Hypertriglyceridemia is usually multifactorial. A combination of genetic factors, increased production, and or impaired clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLP) are known to play a role in hypertriglyceridemia.

Genetic causes include syndromes that present primarily with HTG (common) or chylomicronemia (rare). Familial hypertriglyceridemia (excess Very Low-Density Lipoprotein but normal cholesterol) and Familial combined hyperlipidemia (polymorphisms of apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II), apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III), etc.) present predominantly with HTG.

Secondary causes of HTG include certain medical conditions, drugs, and dietary causes. Obesity, metabolic syndrome, Diabetes mellitus type 2, hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, chronic kidney disease, Human Immunodeficiency virus, pregnancy, and some autoimmune conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus have been associated with HTG.Â ****Dietary causes of HTG include excessive alcohol intake and foods rich in saturated fat or with a high glycemic index.
