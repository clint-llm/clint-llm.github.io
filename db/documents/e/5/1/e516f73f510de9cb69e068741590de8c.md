The basic equipment for radial forearm free flap harvest must include: individualized to surgeon loupes magnification, bipolar forceps tray, various dissecting tool options that mayÂ include Mayo, Stevens, and Metzenbaum scissors, small and medium hemoclip appliers, and a microsurgery instrument tray. Additionally, a dermatome setup must be available for harvesting a split-thickness skin graft. A six-inch latex-free rubber bandage, 18-inch pneumatic tourniquet cuff, and sterile soft roll must all be available for a blood-less dissection and harvest. Two 10 mm suction drains are also necessary at the time of closure. Heparin sodium (5,000 units) in 0.9% 500 ml should be available to irrigate vessels. Papaverine 60 mg in 500 ml 0.9% sodium chloride should be used topically to irrigate and address for vasospasm of the radial artery.

Intraoperatively, a warming blanket should be placed on the patient throughout operative time to keep the body temperature at 37.6 degrees Celcius (99.6 F).
