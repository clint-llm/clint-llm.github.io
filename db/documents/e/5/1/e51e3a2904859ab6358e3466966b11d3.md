The common differential diagnosis of the Morel-Lavallee lesion includes post-operative seroma, coagulopathy-related hematoma, post-traumatic injuries like fat necrosis, and rarely, post-traumatic early-stage myositis ossificans with diffuse subcutaneous edema.Â Postoperative seroma holds various pathological similarities with it. As the Morel-Lavallee lesion can clinically, pathologically, and radiographically simulate multiple possible conditions, a prior history of trauma can play a pivotal role in reaching the diagnosis.
