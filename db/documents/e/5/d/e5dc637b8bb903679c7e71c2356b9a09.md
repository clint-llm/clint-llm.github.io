**Imaging**

Orthogonal radiographs of the entire femur should be obtained. It is also important to obtain orthogonal radiographs of the hip and knee joints. There may be an associated femoral shaft or distal femur fracture. If there is an intertrochanteric extension of the fracture, it is important to assess the integrity of the potential start site if intramedullary nailing is selected for fixation. A traction view or CT scan may be helpful for fragment assessment. Additionally, an anteroposterior (AP) traction view can help determine whether closed reduction may be feasible or if open reduction techniques are needed.

**Classifications**

**AO/OTA
**

- 32-A3.1 Simple (A) Transverse (3), Subtrochanteric fracture (0.1)

- 32-B3.1 Wedge (B) Fragmented (3), Subtrochanteric fracture (0.1)

- 32-C1.1 Complex (C) Spiral (1), Subtrochanteric fracture (0.1)

**Russel-Taylor
**

- Type I: No extension into piriformis fossa

- Type II: Extension into greater trochanter with the involvement of piriformis fossa
