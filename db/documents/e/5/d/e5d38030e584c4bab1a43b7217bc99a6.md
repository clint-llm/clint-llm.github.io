Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is a benign, self-limiting neutrophilic dermatosis of unknown etiology. However, neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis has been observed with the following medications: acetaminophen, minocycline, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, carbamazepine, cetuximab, BRAF inhibitors, bleomycin, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil, and antiretroviral medications. Before neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is diagnosed, practitioners usually rule-out infectious causes; nevertheless, biopsy results from several cases of active bacterial and viral infections were reported to show histological changes consistent with neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis. Of note, heat damage of eccrine glands may elicit neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis in the pediatric population.
