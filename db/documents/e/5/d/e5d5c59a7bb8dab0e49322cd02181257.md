Mosquito is the insect that causes the most insect bites worldwide. Belonging to the Culicidae family, they are naturally occurring everywhere except for Antarctica. Although the bites themselves are relevantly benign, mosquitoes are vectors for an increasing number of diseases and pose a very real burden on public health.
