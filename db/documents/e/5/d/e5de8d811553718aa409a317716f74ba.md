Approximately 25% of people worldwide have anemia. Iron deficiency, the most common cause, is responsible for 50% of all anemias. The rate of iron deficiency is higher in developing countries compared to the United States, where the prevalence of iron-deficiency anemia in men under 50 is 1%. In women of childbearing age in the United States, the rate is 10% due to losses from menstruation, while 9% of children ages 12 to 36 months are iron-deficient, and one-third of these children develop anemia. While the rate of iron-deficiency anemia is low in the United States, low-income familiesÂ are particularly at risk.
