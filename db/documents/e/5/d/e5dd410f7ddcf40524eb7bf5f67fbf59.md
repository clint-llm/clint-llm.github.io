Preventative measures to counsel patients who dive or are involved in aviation include emphasizing the importance of proper training and conditioning, remaining adequately hydrated, avoiding flights less than 24 hours after diving, ascend slowly without breath holding during diving, and being knowledgeable about individual medical conditions such as a history of a patent foramen ovale, pneumothorax or other pulmonary conditions that make activities such as diving higher risk.
