The pharynx is a conductive structure located in the midline of the neck. It is the main structure, in addition to the oral cavity, shared by two organ systems, i.e., the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the respiratory system. It is funnel-shaped with its upper end being wider and located just below the lower surface of the skull, and its lower end is narrower and located at the level of the sixth cervical vertebra (C6) where the commencement of the esophagus posteriorly and the larynx anteriorly takes place. Its muscular-membranous integrity allows it to mediate several vital functions related to either organ system, e.g., food swallowing, air conduction, and voice production. Knowing its structure and function, embryology, neurovascular supply, musculature, surgical implications, and clinical significance will permitÂ us to comprehend its importance.
