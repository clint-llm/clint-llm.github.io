The prognosis of aspiration is highly variable and dependent on a number of factors. Patients in good health before the event, small-volume aspiration, and better pulmonary reserve tend toÂ have a more favorable outcome. Patients with poor host defenses, recurrent aspiration events, large-volume acid aspiration, and underlying pulmonary disease may poorly tolerate the insult. The majority of inpatient management should be focused on prevention when possible. The mortality rate for aspiration pneumonia varies from 10-50%. Any delay in diagnosis or treatment usually leads to high mortality.
