In most cases, the treatment of adenovirus infection is supportive. Hydration, NSAIDs, and bed rest for a few days may be beneficial. Antiviral drugs are rarely used to treat adenovirus infections in immunocompetent patients but may be used in immunosuppressed people. Unfortunately, many antivirals, including ganciclovir and vidarabine, also have potential adverse effects. Adenovirus can further be prevented by vaccination (oral, live, enteric-coated), particularly in military recruits between 17 to 50 years old.

Adenoviruses are outstanding antigens, with vaccination success. Though viral vaccines typically have not been used for adenoviruses, they are noted to play a role in tumorigenesis in cell culture and animals. Furthermore, adenovirus infections rarely cause serious complications. Nevertheless, vaccines can be produced by recombinant DNA technology. Purified fiber or hexon preparations encourage high levels of neutralizing antibodies, and vaccines created by these proteins have been tested efficaciously.
