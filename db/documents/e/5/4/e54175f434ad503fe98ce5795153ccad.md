Calcitriol is a widely prescribed agent by the primary care provider, nurse practitioner, endocrinologist, and internist. However, therapy with the drug requires the efforts of an entire interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, and pharmacists. While calcitriol is relatively safe, it has to be monitored for adverse effects, of which the most common is hypercalcemia. Patients may present with hypertension, renal stones, behavior alterations, and severe constipation. At each clinic visit, the healthcare provider should ask for symptoms of hypercalcemia. In some patients, regular monitoring of calcium levels may be required.
