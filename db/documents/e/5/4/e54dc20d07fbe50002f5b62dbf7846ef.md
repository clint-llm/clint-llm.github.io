Given the protective effect of hemoglobin C in malaria infection, it is almost understandable that this mutation has a high prevalence in Atlantic West Africa and South East Asia. Hemoglobin C is also found in a diverse population in Africa, South and Central America, Southern Europe.

A retrospective study performed in 111 cases of hemoglobin C disease over 12 years in Morocco showed the mean age at the time of diagnosis of 38 years (ranging between 4 and years). Also, the biochemical tests contributed to the diagnosis and revealed varied etiological groups in the study population: heterozygous A/C (75%), homozygous C/C (8%), double heterozygous S/C (9%), C/beta +/- Thal (6%), C/ O - Arab (2%).
