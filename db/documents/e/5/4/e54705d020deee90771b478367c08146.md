PLP is often described as tingling, throbbing, sharp, pins/needles in the limb that is no longer there. It occurs more commonly in upper extremity amputations than lower extremities and tends to be intermittent in frequency. Pain severity varies, and onset can be immediate or years afterward. It is important to try and distinguish PLP from RLP. The goal of the physical exam is to rule out the causes of RLP. First, the skin should be carefully inspected for evidence of wounds or infection. Sensation needs to be tested, along with looking for allodynia and hyperalgesia. The joint above the amputated limb should be examined for any signs of dysfunction. in terms of pain intensity, RLP usually is not severe, and features pressing, throbbing, burning, squeezing, and stabbing sensations.
