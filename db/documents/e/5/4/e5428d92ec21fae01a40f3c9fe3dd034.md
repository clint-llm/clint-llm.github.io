# Introduction

Biosafety guidelines are a set of policies, rules, and procedures necessary to observe by personnel working in various facilities handling microbiological agents such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungi, prions, and other related agents and microbiological products. Institutions requiring strict adherence to these biosafety guidelines include clinical and microbiological laboratories, biomedical research facilities, teaching and training laboratories, and other healthcare institutions (e.g., clinics, health centers, hospital facilities). These guidelines are intended to provide proper management and regulation of biosafety programs and practices implemented at all levels of the organization.

Essential components of the biosafety guidelines contain some or all the following, depending on the facility: bio-risk assessment and identification; specific biosafety measures, which cover the code of practice, physical plant such as laboratory design and facilities, equipment acquisition and maintenance, medical surveillance, staff training, safe handling of chemicals, with fire, radiation and electricity safety, among others. Additional components may be included, such as commissioning and certification guidelines for the facilities.

Biosafety guidelines must be made clear, practical, and suitable for each facility and must be available for easy reference by all staff, must be reviewed, and updated regularly. While it provides guidance in the application of biosafety practices, this technical guide cannot solely ensure a safe working environment without the commitment of each person to adhere adequately to the biosafety guidelines at all times. Continuous research on biosafety can improve the development of future guidelines.

# Etiology and Epidemiology

**History of Biosafety**

A significant milestone on biosafety initially referred to as “microbiological safety” dates back to 1908 where Winslow described a new method of examination to count bacteria present in the air.

The principle and profession of biosafety have developed concurrently through the American Biological Safety Association (ABSA). As briefly described by the Federation of American Scientists, the first meeting was held in 1955 with the members of the military, as the focus addressed “The Role of Safety in the Biological Warfare Effort.” Succeeding meetings attendees included the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), universities, laboratories, hospitals, and representatives from the industries. From then, written regulations covered the shipment of biological agents, safety training and programs, and developing biological safety level classification.

**Epidemiology of Laboratory-Acquired Infections (LAIs)**

Laboratory-acquired infections (LAIs) were considered significant because of the high risk in the laboratory workforce relative to the public, although the exposure to infectious agents can be higher in other groups of healthcare workers. Sulkin and Pike in 1949 studied several works of literature and mail surveys to evaluate the risk of infection associated with employment in a clinical or research laboratory. Follow-up studies and reviews led to the identification and description of hazards unique to these laboratories, which later formed a basis for developing approaches to prevent the emergence of LAIs.

The incidence of laboratory-acquired infections varies among institutions conducting surveys to a specific or group of laboratories and facilities. The monitoring and evaluation of LAIs are still absent for many institutions, which could be caused by the difficulties in the reporting schemes and lack of accurate data interpretation. For instance, reporting of LAI is not similar to the reporting of notifiable diseases, which is highly regulated for each healthcare institution across countries as implemented by their ministries of health. Laboratory-acquired infections may not always manifest as a disease entity. An example would be a person infected with tuberculosis, who could have an infection with TB bacilli but with no signs and symptoms; thus, it cannot be considered TB disease. No national and global recording and reporting of LAI is in place. Though LAI incidence is reported in several publications recently, the variables and the levels of measurement under study differ; hence, combination and comparison of such studies is not a simple task. However, the need for data collection for current LAIs should highlight the importance of improving biosafety, which outweighs the above issues. LAI databases were then created to contain all recently published studies and to verify their relevant findings. While these address the need for acquiring new information, they will not replace the reporting schemes implemented by individual institutions.

In 2018, Siengsanan-Lamont and Blacksell presented the results of a rapid review of LAI studies within the Asia-Pacific. Studies from 1982 to 2016 included several agents, some of these include: Shigella flexneri (Australia), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Japan), Rickettsia typhi (South Korea), SARS-CoV (Singapore, China, Taiwan), Dengue (South Korea, Australia), and Ralstonia picketti (Taiwan) to name a few. Regarding potential bio-risks for zoonotic diseases, viruses predominate, followed by bacteria and parasites. The importance of bio-risk assessment and management was also emphasized, including preventive practices. Strict biosafety measures are a must for these working environments to protect themselves and the community

# Specimen Requirements and Procedure

All specimens collected from patients require the application of biosafety measures. It starts with the instructions provided by the healthcare worker to the patient. Clear statements with explanations and step-by-step procedures are necessary, especially for patients who will collect the specimen. Healthcare workers, including laboratory staff, should be well-oriented, especially when they are to collect specimens directly from patients. Personal protective equipment (PPE) must be worn at all times during the specimen collection.

Several procedures exist for collecting sterile and non-sterile sample specimens. Better strategies were developed recently to minimize hazards either during and after sending the specimens into the laboratory. For example, the use of the evacuated tube system (ETS) prevented the contact of the patient’s blood from the site of extraction to the phlebotomist and the external environment during venipuncture.

# Diagnostic Tests

Clinical laboratory scientists (medical technologists) must perform laboratory procedures both accurately and safely.

Pathogen-specific and risk-specific biosafety measures are shown to be more practical and cost-effective.

Proper disposal of wastes is necessary to prevent disease transmission.

Recording and reporting procedures must be free from possible contamination and clean and dedicated space.

Because of the complexity of the laboratory work, one must be well-trained and supervised to perform biosafety measures at work, while non-authorized personnel must have restricted access to the laboratory, especially when a diagnostic test is in process.

# Testing Procedures

The development of biosafety guidelines is part of the overall quality management systems implementation. For newly established facilities, ensure biosafety before the start of operations. Workflow inside the laboratory must facilitate an efficient means for carrying out processes by the laboratorian. Activities involving dirty areas (e.g., a specimen receipt, sample preparation, etc.) should be kept separate from the clean areas (e.g., microscopy, automated instrumentation, recording of results, etc.). Procedures for laboratory workflow can be tested through observation and evaluation by a designated biosafety officer, laboratory supervisor, or an independent consultant who can conduct monitoring activities and provide technical assistance.

For labs using BSC, a smoke pattern test using in-house or commercial testers may be regularly performed to assess for good airflow before use. Anemometers may be used to check for air velocity. BSC certification provided by a service professional must be secured before use and continually re-certified once a year.

Before performing any laboratory test, the provision of required training on biosafety to the laboratory workforce is vital, either as a focused training program or as part of the training curriculum for certain laboratory procedures. Laboratory managers, section heads, and supervisors should also receive biosafety training, including topics covering bio-risk management and biosafety program implementation. Effective supportive supervision of laboratory staff working in any facility is a key factor for the sustained implementation of quality laboratory services.

# Interfering Factors

Several factors impede the application of laboratory-related biosafety measures within the facility. These may include, but not limited to:

- The absence of a technical document containing specific biosafety guidelines

- Poor biosafety skills (for example, on spills management) because of lack of training

- The continuous presence of laboratory hazards and increased vulnerability due to poor execution of bio-risk assessment, reduction, and management activities

- Use of substandard laboratory supplies

- Poor equipment maintenance

Biosafety guidelines are more likely to be poorly implemented in facilities because of:

- Poorly written guidelines, including the adoption of generic, nonspecific procedures

- Unclear roles and responsibilities for each staff involved

- Lack of review and updating process of existing guide

- Poor dissemination and access to such guidelines

# Results, Reporting, and Critical Findings

Results of testing procedures done for biosafety checks must be recorded, consolidated, and interpreted regularly (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or as applicable). The results may show a trend that may signal a need either for equipment maintenance or replacement. Frequent incidents associated with a particular process may demonstrate a need to perform reviews and modify the procedure. Involved staff should willingly report accidents inside the laboratory. Laboratorians should not be reluctant to report such events as these may become a future source of infection.

# Clinical Significance

Ensuring a quality and biologically safe work environment fosters good and effective delivery of laboratory and clinical services for patients. While performing complex laboratory procedures, staff can work with a certain level of confidence that they won’t contract any infection or disease. The spread of infectious agents from facilities to other healthcare workers, patients, and the community is preventable by applying biosafety practices.

# Quality Control and Lab Safety

Biosafety monitoring can be part of quality control measures and quality assurance programs in the laboratory or any healthcare institution. It must be an important component of competency tests for staff and must be an essential element of organizational plans and goals.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

As implemented in laboratories and related facilities, biosafety supports infection control aims and principles, as implemented in hospitals and clinics.
