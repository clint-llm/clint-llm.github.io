Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), also referred to as postinfectious encephalomyelitis, is an acute, rapidly progressive, autoimmune process that occurs in the central nervous system. ADEM is characterized by demyelination in the brain and spinal cord (and occasionally the optic nerve) as a result of inflammation that occurs in response to a preceding infection or immunization.
