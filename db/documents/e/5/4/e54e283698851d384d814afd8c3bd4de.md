An overlap of clinical and histopathological features are common among smoking-related interstitial pneumonia. A clinical, radiological, and pathological consensus during the period of longitudinal follow up, therefore, becomes necessary to characterize a specific form of SR-ILD and pursue appropriateÂ treatment.

Individuals with a history of relevant exposure to cigarettes, inhalational drugs of abuse, and occupational risk factors commonly present with a dry cough and exercise-induced shortness of breath. Although childhood disease has been rarely reported as mentioned above, the most common age of presentation is 40 to 60 years.

Less than 10% of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Symptoms are however nonspecific including dyspnea on exertion (90%), persistent cough (70%), with or without sputum production (about 40%). Hemoptysis is very rare.

Clinical examination reveals clubbing in 50% of patients, along with coarse rales in bilateral bases.
