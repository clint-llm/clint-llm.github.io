The afterload is the amount of pressure that the heart needs to exert to eject the blood during ventricular contraction. This is recorded as the systolic pressure of the heart. The changes in the afterload affect the stroke volume, end-systolic volume, end-diastolic volume, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Afterload is increased due to an increase in systemic vascular resistance and aortic pressure increase. An increase in the afterload leads to a decrease in the heart's stroke volume and an increase in the end-systolic volume. This also indirectly affects the heart's cardiac output due to a reduction in the stroke volume of the heart. A Frank-Starling curve gives a relationship between stroke volume and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The pressure-volume loops explain the effects of afterload on the end-systolic volume and the end-diastolic volume.
