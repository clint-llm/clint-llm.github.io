The suboccipital nerve is formed from ventral and dorsal rootlets that emerge from the spinal cord and unite within the subarachnoid space.

The dorsal ramus of the C1 spinal nerve is the suboccipital nerve, so-called because it innervates the suboccipital muscles exclusively; the nerve has no cutaneous, meningeal, or articular branches.

The anatomical course of the suboccipital nerve is intimately related to the C1 (atlas) vertebra and the vertebral artery. The vertebral artery is divided anatomically into four parts, 3 of which are extradural and the final segment, which is intradural, before it becomes the basilar artery. The third segment of the vertebral artery (V3) is often termed the ‘atlantic’ segment because it travels within a groove over the posterior arch of the atlas (C1 vertebra).****

Both the suboccipital nerve and the V3 segment of the vertebral artery lie within the area known as the suboccipital triangle, which is bounded by some of the muscles innervated by the suboccipital nerve. The borders of the suboccipital triangle are the rectus capitis posterior major medially, the obliquus capitis superior superolaterally, and the obliquus capitis inferior inferolaterally. Thus, the suboccipital triangle has its apex facing inferomedially at the bifid spinous process of the C2 vertebra.

The muscles innervated by the suboccipital nerve are the three that make up the borders of the suboccipital triangle, plus the rectus capitis posterior minor. Collectively, the suboccipital muscles function as postural muscles of the head, assisting with head extension and rotation. The suboccipital muscles act by rotating the head by rotating the C1 vertebrae, the atlas, on the C2 vertebrae, the axis.

The suboccipital nerve also may anastomose with the dorsal rami of the C2 and C3 spinal nerves as part of the Cruveilhier plexus.
