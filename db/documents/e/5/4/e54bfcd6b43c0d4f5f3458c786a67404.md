ToxicitiesÂ that may accompany therapy with ruxolitinib include hematological toxicities, which encompass cytopenia and anemia. In one study looking at the efficacy of ruxolitinib in patients with corticosteroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease when cytopenia occurred, it required a dose reduction, interruption in treatment, or permanent cessation of ruxolitinib.

Also, during the COMFORT trials, hemoglobin levels in patients decreased in the first eight to twelve weeks; however, levels improved after twelve weeks. Moreover, patients with renal impairment should reduce their ruxolitinib dose, as should patients with hepatic impairment.
