As mentioned above, hemorrhoids are naturally occurring and are present in all individuals. They aid in fecal continence because even complete closure of the sphincter complex does not result in complete closure of the anal canal. Straining, sneezing, or exertion causes engorgement of these vascular cushions leading to complete closure of the anus thus preventing fecal leakage. The vascular cushions return to normal size after straining is complete.
