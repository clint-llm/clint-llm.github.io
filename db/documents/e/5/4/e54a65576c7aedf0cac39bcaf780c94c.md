The branchial arches that develop in humans include arches 1 through 6. Branchial arch 5 involutes during development and does not contribute to the formation of adult structures. Branchial arches 1 and 2 are referred to as the mandibular and hyoid arches, respectively. Each of the arches is lined internally by endoderm and externally by ectoderm tissue. Between the endoderm and ectoderm lies the mesenchyme, composed of both mesoderm and neural crest tissue. The adult structures that derive from the individual germ cell layers will be covered in the following section.

The approximation of ectoderm and endoderm between consecutive arches results in the formation of pharyngeal clefts and pharyngeal pouches. The pharyngeal clefts are produced from the approximation of ectodermal tissue between consecutive arches, while the pharyngeal pouches form from the approximation of endodermal tissue between consecutive arches. Derivatives of each are described below and in further detail in the following sections.

**Pharyngeal Clefts**

The anatomic space formed by the first pharyngeal cleft between the first and second branchial arches gives rise to the adult external auditory meatus. The space created by the second, third, and fourth pharyngeal clefts gives rise to the adult cervical sinus.

**Pharyngeal Pouches**

The first pharyngeal pouch between the first and second branchial arches gives rise to the primitive tympanic cavity and auditory tube. The second pharyngeal pouch gives rise to the adult palatine tonsil. The third pharyngeal pouch paradoxically forms the inferior parathyroid glands and thymus, while the fourth pharyngeal pouch forms the superior parathyroid glands and the ultimobranchial body.
