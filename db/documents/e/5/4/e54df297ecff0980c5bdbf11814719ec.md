Literature has shown associations between BMI and cancer growth at a cellular level and association with other disease states.Influence of BMI on Level of Circulating Progenitor Cells. The study evaluated mesenchymal stromal progenitor cells and circulating progenitor cells in healthy participants with a BMI less than 30 and healthy participants with a BMI greater than 30. They found a 5-fold increase in the circulating progenitor cells in the group with the larger BMI. This study was done to elaborate on prior studies that showed an increase in white blood cells and associations with neoplasms in obese populations. Progenitor cells are needed for a favorable tumor environment, and tumors require angiogenesis and vasculogenesis to progress. When white adipose tissue mobilizes progenitor cells, they are recruited by the tumor to support cancer growth. Colorectal cancer has been commonly used to study this phenomenon.

Many studies have also shown a link between increased BMI and insulin resistance. One such study was performed by Preethi et al.of healthy men aged 18-25, titled Body Mass Index a Better Predictor of Insulin Resistance than Waist Circumference in Normoglycemics. The participant's BMIs and waist-hip circumference ratios were calculated, after which they underwent a 2-hour glucose test. As the study title indicates, BMI had a statistically significant higher correlation with insulin resistance.
