Secondary infections may develop; therefore, topical bacitracin should not be used for more than seven days unless directed by a physician. The area of application should undergo monitoring for improvement. If symptoms worsen, bacitracin use should be stopped immediately, and a clinician should be contacted regarding further management.

Allergy patch testing may be warranted if an adverse reaction occurs after using bacitracin as a single-agent ointment or part of a triple therapy ointment. There have been multiple reports of anaphylactoid reactions and anaphylaxis due to bacitracin use.
