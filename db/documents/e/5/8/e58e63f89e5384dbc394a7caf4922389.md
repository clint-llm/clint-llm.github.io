If a patient continues to have symptoms of hoarseness, dyspnea, and chronic sore throat despite lifestyle changes, an otolaryngologic referral is a good option. The otolaryngologist will be able to perform fiberoptic laryngoscopy with or without stroboscopy. A gastroenterologist may need toÂ be consulted for possible esophagoscopy to rule out malignancy, if the laryngoscopy is suggestive of additional pathology.
