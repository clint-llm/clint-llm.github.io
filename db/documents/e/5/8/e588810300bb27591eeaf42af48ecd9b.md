The treatment of dysplastic nevi is controversial and varies from provider to provider. A survey of physicians in the American Academy of Dermatology organization reported that approximately two-thirds of the respondents prefer to re-excise dysplastic nevi if margins are reported to be positive in the initial biopsy. The reasoning for this could be if the incompletely excised nevus grew back in the biopsy scar, it may clinically and histologically be indistinguishable from melanoma. This is referred to as the “pseudo-melanoma” phenomenon.

Many authors agree that most dysplastic nevi do not need to be re-excised after the initial biopsy. In fact, an extensive review concluded that dysplastic nevi are “fundamentally variants of common nevi.” However, if a provider is worried about how a lesion appears clinically, this should trump what is reported histopathologically, and the lesion should be completely excised. It is also agreed upon that a dysplastic nevus with severe atypia or one that cannot be distinguished histologically from melanoma should be re-excised with appropriate margins (typically at least 5 mm margins).

It is recommended that patients with a history of dysplastic nevi wear sun protection.
