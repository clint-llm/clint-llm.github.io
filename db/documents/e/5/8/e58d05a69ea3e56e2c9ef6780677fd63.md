Imaging is a vital part of evaluating young athletes with risk factors and an exam concerning medial epicondyle apophysitis. Initial studies should include bilateral anterior, posterior, and lateral plain radiographs of the elbows in addition to a lateral image of the elbows flexed at 90 degrees with the application of valgus stress.

Accurate diagnosis of medial epicondyle apophysitis requires bilateral radiographs to compare the patient’s anatomy and better evaluate for an avulsion fracture. The ossification centers (physes) close at inconsistent ages during adolescence, and bilateral comparison allows the radiologist to evaluate whether the patient’s physes are still open. Bilateral imaging is also helpful in identifying a missing ossification center. Avulsion fractures should be suspected if an ossification center is missing unilaterally or if the medial epicondyle apophysis is missing, but the trochlear, olecranon, or lateral epicondyle ossification centers are present. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are only indicated for medial epicondyle avulsion fractures or apophysitis not responding to therapy. They are helpful in more accurately determining the degree of epicondylar displacement and the need for operative versus non-operative management.
