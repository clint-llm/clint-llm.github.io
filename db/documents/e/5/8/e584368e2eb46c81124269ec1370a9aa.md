Cases of chronic cholecystitis present with progressing right upper abdominal pain with bloating, food intolerances (especially greasy and spicy foods), increased gas, nausea, and vomiting. Pain in the midback or shoulder may also occur. This pain could be present for years until diagnosis. Cases of acute cholecystitis have similar but more severe symptoms. Often these symptoms are mistaken for cardiac issues. The finding of right upper abdominal pain with deep palpation, or Murphy sign, is classic for this disease. The gallbladder can often be palpated at the right costal margin, especially in the thin patient. It can sometimes be felt as low as the umbilicus due to extreme distension. Often, a specific dietary event such as, "I ate pork chops and gravy last night," leads to the acute attack. Patients usually present with a history, including several days of progressive symptoms.
