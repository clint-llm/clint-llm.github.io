A patient presenting with typical phenotypic characteristics of ectodermal dysplasia (ED) is first evaluated clinically with special emphasis on the presence/absence of sweating, hair/nail, and teeth abnormalities. Although primarily diagnosed clinically, further diagnosis of specific syndrome/subtype requires a series of investigations as, for example, a trichogram in a patient of hypohydrotic ED shows barcode hair, which is absent in the hydrotic variant. Even though usually unnecessary, a skin biopsy shows the absence of eccrine structures in cases of hypohydrotic ED or eccrine syringofibroadenomatosis in the case of hydrotic ED. Other investigations, such as X- rays of the limbs, may aid in diagnosing variants of ED.
