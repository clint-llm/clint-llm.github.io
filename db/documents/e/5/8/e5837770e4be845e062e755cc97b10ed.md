The evaluation of insulinoma includes biochemical testing and localization with imaging studies. An interprofessional healthcare team, including primary care clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), specialists (endocrinologistsÂ and oncologists), radiologists, surgeons, specialty-trained nurses, pharmacists, and sometimes genetic specialists, could facilitate better management of insulinomas.

Patient education is paramount; therefore, every interprofessional team member must educate the patient whenever possible and is also responsible for tracking patient progress or lack thereof. Any changes in status should be recorded in the patient's health record and immediately reported to other team members so therapeutic changes can be implemented, if necessary. The length of follow-up required post-resection varies, and a timely treatment plan adjustment is more accessible if patients follow up as instructed. This kind of interprofessional teamwork and case management will improve outcomes for patients with insulinomas. [Level 5]
