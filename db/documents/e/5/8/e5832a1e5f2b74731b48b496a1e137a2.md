FDA approval limits iNO for persistent hypoxic respiratory distress in preterm infants. Its use requires experienced staff in tertiary level neonatal intensive care units (NICU) with advanced modes of ventilatory support. Ideally, diagnostic findings such as an echocardiogram performed by a radiologist should rule out cyanotic heart disease before initiating iNO therapy, as the drug can exacerbate heart failure in these patients.

Clinical and diagnostic findings should confirm PPHN in preterm infants before administration, and SaO2 and pulse oximetry readings should be followed closely by the dedicated nurse to ensure adequate administration and alleviation of symptomatic findings. In addition, clinicians need to counsel pregnant women to need counseling regarding the use of NSAIDs like ibuprofen, aspirin, and naproxen that increase the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension.****Close collaboration between healthcare providers and interprofessional teamwork is crucial for patients receiving iNO therapy to optimize patient outcomes and prevent adverse events.

Sedation may often be necessary with the administration to prevent agitation in the infant. Therefore the anesthesiologist must be alert and attentive to any rapid change resulting from drug-drug interactions. Once initiated, iNO requires gradual weaning to prevent pulmonary vasospasm, and blood levels of methemoglobin should be kept under 2.5% and closely followed.
