Granulation tissue is an important component in the wound healing process. Wounds can heal by primary intention (wound edges approximate easily) and secondary intention (wounds edges do not approximate). Granulation tissue matrix will fill wounds that heal by second intention. This tissue type is also present in chronic wounds that have many different causes. This article will discuss the mechanism of wound healing and repair, the role that granulation tissue plays in that process, the pathophysiology resulting in chronic wounds and persistent granulation tissue, and the clinical significance of granulation tissue.
