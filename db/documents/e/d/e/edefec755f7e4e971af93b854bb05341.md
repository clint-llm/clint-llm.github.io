Immediate complications of myocarditis include cardiogenic shock, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Unresolved myocarditis can progress to dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, areas of focal hypokinesis, and ventricular aneurysms that may also lead to intracardiac thrombi, which may further result in a stroke or MI. Dilated cardiomyopathy is perhaps the most common sequelae of myocarditis that develops in up to 30% of biopsy-proven cases of myocarditis.
