Pegloticase is a pegylated, recombinant uricase (urate-oxidase) FDA-approved in 2010 for its use in the management of chronic gout refractory to standard therapy in adult patients. This activity reviews the indications, action, and contraindications for pegloticase as a valuable agent in treating and managing chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors of pegloticase use in a clinical setting, pertinent to members of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with chronic gout and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of pegloticase.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of pegloticase.
- Review the contraindications of pegloticase.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance pegloticase use in the care of chronic gout refractory to conventional therapy in adult patients and improve outcomes.
