Since the inferior alveolar artery arises from the maxillary artery and the maxillary artery is one of the terminal arteries formed by the external carotid artery. Any damage or compromise to the arteries proximal to the inferior alveolar artery will manifest as possible ischemia. The ischemiaÂ may manifest in the regions perfused by the inferior alveolar artery if coupled with poor collateral blood supply. The injury may present as weakness in the mandible. This weakness may be due to nerve, tissue, or muscle ischemia from lack of perfusion.
