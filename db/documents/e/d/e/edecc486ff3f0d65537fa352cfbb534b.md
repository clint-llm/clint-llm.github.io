The presentation of the gray-baby syndrome will vary depending on the level of toxicity from chloramphenicol. Ideally, chloramphenicol exposure will be provided in the history from the caregiver. Poor feeding, fussiness, and vomiting are often elicited in the history. Exposure from maternal use has also been observed. Chloramphenicol has been assigned Pregnancy Category C (risk not ruled out) and is contraindicated during lactation (as it passes readily into breast milk). A physical exam may reveal altered mental status from lethargy to obtundation, ashen-gray cyanosis, pallor, and abdominal distention/tenderness.
