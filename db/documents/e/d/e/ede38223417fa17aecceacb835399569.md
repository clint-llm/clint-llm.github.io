Desipramine has a broad toxic profile, including an increased risk for suicide, orthostatic hypotension, cardiac abnormalities, seizures, ocular crisis, and fractures. A short-term study showed a significantly increased risk of suicide in children, adolescents, and young adults ages 24 and younger; this is one of the most significant adverse effects to consider when prescribing desipramine. Orthostatic hypotension, likely due to blockade of alpha one receptors, is a common reason for discontinuation of this drug. There are reports of cardiovascular side effects such as heart block, arrhythmias, and sudden death with this drug. Screening for conduction disease with particular attention to QT interval and the history of cardiac disease within the family is a strong recommendation before the prescription.

Anticholinergic properties lead to side effects such as blurred visions, constipation, tachycardia, confusion, dry mouth, urinary retention, delirium, and the ocular crisis in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma. A recent study shows an increased risk for dementia due to the anticholinergic properties of this drug and that this risk is additive with other drugs that have anticholinergic properties. There is an increased risk of osteoporotic fracture with desipramine and all other antidepressants. Osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts all have serotonin receptors, indicating a relationship between the neuroendocrine system and bone. The seizure threshold seems to decrease.

Other side effects include acute hepatitis, bone marrow toxicity, sexual dysfunction, seizures, sedation, tremors, and diaphoresis. Diaphoresis may be the result of noradrenergic receptor manipulation. With sexual dysfunction, there have been reports of impaired arousal and orgasms likely due to serotonergic effects. Although less sedating compared to other tricyclics, desipramineâ€™s antihistaminic properties lead to sedation. Relative to the drug class of tricyclic antidepressants, desipramine is the least likely to cause the side effects listed.
