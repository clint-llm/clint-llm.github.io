Man in a barrel syndrome is a rare neurologic syndrome involving bilateral upper extremity weakness with preserved neck and lower extremity strength that is important to identify quickly as localization of the lesion(s) causing weakness may be reversible. Bilateral cerebral or cervical spinal lesions are the most common causes of MIBS, although various peripheral neuropathic processes have also been described.
