Myopia is the most common condition observed in clinical practice. Corneal topography is the most important investigation for all patients with myopia, as it provides extensive information about the cornea and anterior segment. A detailed evaluation of corneal biomechanics helps customize treatment strategies for individual patients.

Refractive surgeries have revolutionized the management of myopia, providing spectacle-free vision and improving the field of vision. However, all patients with myopia should be optimally screened for posterior-segment pathology. Laser vision correction and phakic IOLs provide safe and effective visual outcomes; however, phacoemulsification using an IOL can cause many complications.
