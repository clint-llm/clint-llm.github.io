Ciguatoxin decreases the threshold for opening voltage-gated sodium channels in synapses of the nervous system. Opening a sodium channel causes depolarization, which may cause muscle paralysis, cardiac dysfunction, and altered sensation of heat and cold. Cold allodynia is a unique symptom of ciguatera. Cooking or freezing the fish does not prevent ciguatera toxicity as these methods do not kill the ciguatoxin. It has no odor. Researchers are looking at the possibility of maitotoxins playing a larger role in ciguatera fish poisoning. When introduced to mice by intraperitoneal injection and oral consumption, it caused toxicity in the research trials. Further research is being done on ciguatoxins by introducing the toxin to human brain-derived cell lines to evaluate its toxicity.
