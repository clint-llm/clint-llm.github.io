The etiology of cephalohematoma is the rupture of blood vessels crossing the periosteum due to the pressure on the fetal head during birth. During the birthing process, pressure on the skull from the rigid birth canal or the use of ancillary external forces such as forceps or a vacuum extractor can result in the rupture of these small and delicate blood vessels resulting in the collection of sanguineous fluid.

- A prolonged second stage of labor

- Macrosomia, or increased size of the infant relative to the birth canal

- Weak or ineffective uterine contractions

- Abnormal fetal presentation

- Instrument-assisted delivery with forceps or vacuum extractor

- Multiple gestations

- Presentation of occiput in transverse or posterior position during delivery

- Cesarean section was initiated following the first stage of labor

The above-listed factors contribute to the traumatic impact of the birthing process on the fetal head. Aside from the birthing process, cephalohematoma may rarely occur in adults or juveniles following trauma or surgery.
