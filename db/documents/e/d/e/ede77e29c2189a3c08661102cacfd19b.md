Ubiquitination ultimately breaks down into three essential steps that are catalyzed by the enzymes ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2), and ubiquitin ligases (E3). The three steps are:

- Activation: Ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 uses an ATP-dependent process to establish a thioester bond between the C-terminal carboxyl group of ubiquitin and the cysteine group of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme.

- Conjugation: The E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme then binds to both the activated ubiquitin and E1 enzyme complex. E2 catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from the E1 site to the active site on E2 by way of a transesterification reaction.

- Ligation: In the final step of the ubiquitination pathway, E3 ubiquitination ligase creates an isopeptide bond with the lysine of the target protein and the C-terminal glycine of ubiquitin.

The result is the formation of a ubiquitin-substrate complex.

Like other PTMs, such as phosphorylation, the ubiquitination reaction is reversible. This is accomplished through the action of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs).
