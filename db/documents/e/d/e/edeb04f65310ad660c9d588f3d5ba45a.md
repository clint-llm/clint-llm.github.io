Regenerative therapy is generally well tolerated. The most common side effects are injection site swelling, pain or soreness, or stiffness.

Complications of PRP injections are extremely rare. Since PRP is an autologous product, the chance of having an allergic or immune reaction is non-existent. The most common side effect includes local site infection and pain at the injection site. Historically, bovine thrombin serves as an activator in some commercially available PRP kits. It carries a potential risk of coagulopathy. When bovine thrombin is used as an activator, patients develop antibodies to bovine factor V and bovine thrombin itself. When factor V level decreases below 30%, the risk of hemorrhage increases in patients; for this reason, autologous thrombin or recombinant human thrombin is available as an activator.

Rare adverse effects of prolotherapy reported include sleep disturbance, radicular pain, irregular menstruation, lumbar puncture headache. Other even rarer effects reported include meningitis, adhesive arachnoiditis, and encephalomyelitis.
