A tubo-ovarian abscess can be found on imaging with sonography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ha, et al. (1995) demonstrated that MRI has a superior ability to evaluate the extent of disease, the characteristics of the lesion, and to make the diagnosis of a TOA.

Typically, either a transvaginal ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is used to evaluate the concern for a TOA. CT with oral and IV contrast has been shown to have improved sensitivity (78% to 100%) over ultrasound (75% to 82%), but due to its low cost and lack of exposure to ionizing radiation, ultrasonography is an ideal imaging method for women of reproductive age. Landers and Sweet found that ultrasound correctly diagnosed TOA in 90% of surgically confirmed cases.

In 2005, Hiller stated that CT imaging of a TOA would demonstrate a thick, uniform, enhancing abscess wall (95%) that is often multilocular (89%) with an increased fluid density (95%).
