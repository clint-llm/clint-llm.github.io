Eclampsia is a pregnancy-related disorder that manifests as new-onset generalized tonic colonic seizures. Typically eclampsia occurs after gestational week 20, although it may occur sooner with multi-gestational or molar pregnancies and may occur in the 6-week postpartum window. In developed countries, resultant maternal mortality may be as high as 1.8%, and in developing countries, it may be as high as 14%. This activity reviews the presentation, evaluation, and management of patients with eclampsia and highlights the interprofessional team's role in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify risk factors associated with eclampsia and preeclampsia.
- Explain how a patient with eclampsia might present.
- Explain how to treat a patient with eclampsia.
- Outline the role of a collaborative interprofessional team in coordinating care for patients with eclampsia.
