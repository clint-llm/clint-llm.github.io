Accessory tendinous slips of the extensor carpi ulnaris are present in some individuals, potentially predisposing them to injury. It can potentially prolong the symptoms of extensor carpi ulnaris syndrome, increase the risk of tendinopathy and dislocation of the muscle, and functionally limit the wrist and fifth digit.

There are three variants of the accessory slip, types A, B, and C. Type A has been the most commonly identified and inserts into the base of the fifth metacarpal. Type B inserts onto the midshaft of the fifth metacarpal, and Type C inserts onto the fifth metacarpal head.
