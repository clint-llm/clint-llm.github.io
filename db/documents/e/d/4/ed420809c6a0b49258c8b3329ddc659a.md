Perforation of the stomach is a full-thickness injury of the wall of the organ. Since the peritoneum completely covers the stomach, perforation of the wall creates a communication between the gastric lumen and the peritoneal cavity. If the perforation occurs acutely, there is no time for an inflammatory reaction to wall off the perforation, and the gastric content is free to enter the general peritoneal cavity, causing chemical peritonitis. Perforations occurring over a prolonged period may be contained locally by the inflammatory reaction. Perforation may be suspected based upon the patient's clinical presentation, or the diagnosis becomes obvious through a report of extraluminal free air on diagnostic imaging performed to evaluate for abdominal pain or another symptom. Treatment is a surgical repair. This activity reviews the evaluation of a suspected gastric perforation and the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the pathophysiology of gastric perforation.
- Describe when to suspect a gastric perforation.
- Identify the most likely locations of gastric perforation.
- Outline the evaluation of a suspected gastric perforation and the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.
