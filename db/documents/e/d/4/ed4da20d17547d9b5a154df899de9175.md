The evaluation of an ileus needs to exclude other more concerning diagnoses such as small bowel obstruction, intra-abdominal abscess, or perforation. Some of these may require some type of intervention, and it is important to distinguish them. The most important diagnosis to distinguish from an ileus is an obstruction. Patients with a postoperative obstruction often have an initial return of bowel function and oral intake with subsequent nausea, vomiting, abdominal distention, and pain, whereas an ileus patient usually has no return of bowel function or oral intake. Intense pain, feculent emesis, or rapid onset/progression of pain/distension are usually a sign of obstruction and not of an ileus. The use of small bowel follow-through with gastrografin or water-soluble contrast is becoming increasingly useful for small bowel obstructions and can help to further distinguish obstruction from an ileus. Gastrografin has been noted to therapeutically treat adhesive small bowel obstructions.
