Nosebleeds are rarely fatal, accounting for only four of the 2.4 million deaths in the United States. About 60% of people have experienced a nosebleed during their life, and only 10% of nosebleeds are severe enough to warrant treatment/medical intervention. They occur most commonly in children ranging from 2 to 10 years old and the elderly ranging from 50 to 80 years old.
