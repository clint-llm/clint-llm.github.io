The Rinne test is a complement to the Weber test. They are screening tests and do not replace formal audiometry. It is important to note that further examinations and investigations such as otoscopy, audiometry, tympanometry, and imaging may be required to correctly diagnose the cause of the hearing loss and allow appropriate management. Generally, this procedure has no complications as it is a relatively non-invasive method of screening patients for hearing loss.
