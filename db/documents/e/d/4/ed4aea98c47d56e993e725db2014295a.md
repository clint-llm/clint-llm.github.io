It remains imperative to identify the risk factors and perform a thorough assessment of the patient before performing a chemical peel. A team approach is an ideal way to limit the complications of this procedure. Before the procedure, the patient should have the following done:

- Evaluation by a physician experienced in selecting the appropriate patient for a chemical peel.

- Evaluation by a primary care physician and/or anesthesiologist to ensure that the patient is fit for anesthesia (not necessary if performed under local anesthesia). NOTE: liver and kidney function testing are encouraged before phenol peeling to reduce the chance of toxicity.

an interprofessional team of aestheticians, dermatology specialty-trained nurses, and physicians should be available before, during, and after the chemical peel to maximize the best outcomes. Close follow-up during the initial post-operative period, either by a nurse and/or clinician experienced in the post-procedural care of chemical peels, should monitor the patient for possible complications ranging from local skin issues to cardiotoxicity (with deep phenol peels). It is vital for the nurse and clinician to provide coordinated education to the patient on proper maintenance of the skin after a chemical peel, and avoiding excess sun exposure for the first several weeks afterward to maximize results and prevent complications; this is where a specialized dermatology nurse can be a tremendous asset.

Close communication between the team members is essential for improving outcomes following the use of chemical peels. [Level V]
