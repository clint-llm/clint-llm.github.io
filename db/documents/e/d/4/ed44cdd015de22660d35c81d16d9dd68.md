Mechanical overload and genetic susceptibility are risk factors. Mechanical overload leads to osteochondrosis of the medial proximal tibial physis and epiphysis, later progresses to a physeal bar. Overweight children, in particular in specific demographic populations such as Hispanics and blacks, are reported as more likely to develop this condition. Langenskiold classified the progression of the disease in four stages according to the medial metaphyseal slope, the angulation, and the aspect of a metaphyseal bar.
