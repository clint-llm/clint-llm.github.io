Balanced, healthier nutrition reduces the severity of dysmenorrhea.

More regular physical activity is effective in reducing dysmenorrhea complications. Exercise acts as non-specific analgesia by improving pelvic blood circulation and stimulating the release of beta-endorphins. The primary goal of treatment is to reduce the pain and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from dysmenorrhea. Hence analgesics should be given appropriately to allow women to perform there day to day chores. For those patients having dysmenorrhea along with heavy menstrual bleeding, endometrial ablation may be an option. Patients should be asked to follow up with their clinicians when dysmenorrheic symptoms are uncontrollable and bothersome.
