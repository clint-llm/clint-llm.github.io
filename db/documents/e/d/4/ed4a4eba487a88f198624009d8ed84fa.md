In addition to causing symptoms, CTOs have correlations with a worse overall prognosis, with higher rates of death and non-fatal adverse cardiovascular events in several populations. Patients with CTOs tend to be older and have more comorbidities and more significant impairment of left ventricular function. Furthermore, patients with non-revascularized CTOs have higher mortality and a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in comparison to patients with multivessel coronary artery disease who are completely revascularized.
