Despite the largely based clinical diagnosis of herpetic gingivostomatitis, it is important first to rule out other diseases that present similarly, keeping in mind the age group and past medical history of the patient. Table 1 explains the differences in causation and clinical presentation of several childhood disorders that may be confused with herpes gingivostomatitis. Some of the differential diagnoses to keep in mind when considering herpetic gingivostomatitis include:

- Herpes zoster

- Primary chickenpox

- Behcet disease

- Herpetiform aphthae

- Erythema multiforme

- Acute necrotizing gingivostomatitis

- Reactive arthritis

- Cytomegalovirus ulceration

- Traumatic ulcers

- Burns, chemical and thermal

- Factitial injuries

- Vesiculobullous disease
