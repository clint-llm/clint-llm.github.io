A comprehensive history and focused physical examination are sufficient to appropriately diagnose xeroderma.

When obtaining a history, it is important to discuss:

- History of atopy (allergies, atopic dermatitis, asthma)

- External factors (occupational exposure, environment, diet, skincare regimen)

- Age (higher likelihood with older age)

- Pregnancy/menopause (hormonal influence)

- Comorbidities (renal failure, chronic kidney disease, thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease)

- Medications (diuretics, lipid-lowering agents, etc.)

- Prior history of xeroderma and any previous treatmentsÂ tried.

- Symptoms (itching, burning sensation, pain, skin tightness)

- Duration (acute or chronic)

- Timing (intermittent, constant, coinciding with any triggers)

When examining the skin, close attention should be paid to:

- Cutaneous scaling, fissuring, erythema

- Distribution (hands/feet, extremities, etc.)
