Without treatment, the prognosis for uremic patients is poor. With dialysis or transplantation, the prognosis is improved, but close monitoring is essential as many patients develop complications. The mortality rates have dropped over the past three decades, but renal failure patients still have a higher risk of death compared to the general population. The most common cause of death is cardiovascular disease which is progressive.

The prognosis for AKI and kidney failure due to a reversible cause, such as lupus nephritis, anti-glomerular basement membrane disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, multiple myeloma, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome, is better if an early diagnosis is made and prompt treatment is started.

The risk of developing cardiovascular disease is five to ten times greater in patients with CKD and ESRD as opposed to age-matched controls.
