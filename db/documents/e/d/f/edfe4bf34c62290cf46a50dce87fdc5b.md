The exact etiology of cerebral amyloid angiopathy is not fully understood. CAA is characterized by congophilic material (amyloid-beta peptide) being deposited into the leptomeninges and small to medium-sized cerebral blood vessels. This deposition weakens vessel walls, making them prone to bleeding. CAA can occur in certain familial syndromes or can occur sporadically.

**Familial CAA**

Cases of “presenile” CAA are caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene.

**Sporadic CAA**

In the older patient population, the factors that result in amyloid beta-peptide deposition are not well understood. Some evidence has demonstrated a relationship with apolipoprotein E (APOE). Researchers found that patients with APOE epsilon 2 or epsilon 4 alleles seem to be at a greater risk for cranial hemorrhages than the general population.
