Trench fever can present as non-specific symptoms but should be considered in patients known to live in clustered areas with inadequate hygiene. To avoid further treatment delay, it is essential to find all Bartonella species, including B.Â quintana, in blood culture-negative endocarditis. Consider utilizing polymerase chain reaction in addition to blood culture for diagnosis. Consider adding an aminoglycoside, especially in severely ill patients with endocarditis who are at risk for Bartonella quintana infection.
