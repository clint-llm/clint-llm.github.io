The difference between kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty is as follows; in kyphoplasty, there is an inflatable balloon inserted into the fracture of the vertebral body. This balloon creates a low-pressure space for the injection of bone cement. This process helps reduce underlying vertebral fractures. In comparison, vertebroplasty is the injection of the bony cement without inflatable balloon placement, directing into the vertebral body.

When compared, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have different criteria for patients to undergo augmentation. Vertebroplasty is indicated if an MRI shows bone marrow edema in a case of suspected back pain secondary to an osteoporotic compression fracture. Bone marrow edema is typically consistent with an underlying fracture of the vertebra. Furthermore, in vertebroplasty, there only needs to be minimal underlying compression of the vertebral body to undergo the procedure.

Kyphoplasty is a technique that requires a bilateral percutaneous balloon tamp inserted into the vertebral body. Given kyphoplasty is a more technically challenging procedure, it is also more expensive when compared to vertebroplasty. Kyphoplasty is also performed much more frequently than vertebroplasty. When comparing outcomes of kyphoplasty to vertebroplasty, there are limited results. Evidence for both long and short-term pain and disability scores is largely inconclusive in comparison studies.

When comparing kyphoplasty to vertebroplasty, multiple observational studies of patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures have shown kyphoplasty improving patients' pain as well as decreasing disability.
