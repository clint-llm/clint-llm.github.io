PRRT is associated with improved clinical outcomes, including overall survival and progression-free survival. It is also related to improving clinical symptoms and quality of life. PRRT enhances the quality of life parameters such as global health status, physical functioning, and other symptoms such as fatigue, diarrhea, and body image. The median time for quality of life deterioration is significantly higher with PRRT, with a difference of over 22 months.

A long-term retrospective study on  468 advanced NET patients who underwent at least two cycles of Lu-177 PRRT showed improved quality of life and biochemical markers substantially in most patients. With a median follow-up of 46 months, most of these patients achieved excellent disease control. The overall survival at seven years was close to 80%.

Lu-177-PRRT was reported as a safe therapeutic option in heavily pre-treated somatostatin receptor-positive bronchial NET patients with comparable efficacy and safety profile to other systemic treatment options. A retrospective analysis of 25 bronchial NET patients showed a median PFS  of 17 months and an OS of 42 months.
