As the central origin of sensory and motor innervation to the larynx, the vagus nerve (CN X) divides into two primary branches, the superior and inferior (recurrent) laryngeal nerves. The superior laryngeal nerve then splits into two branches; the external branch provides motor innervation to the cricothyroid muscle. While, the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve provides sensory afferent signals to the supraglottis and glottis, influencing the cough reflex.
