Patients with severe phenol poisoning will require an interprofessional healthcare team approach. This team includes clinicians (including PAs and NPs), nurses, and pharmacists. This type of collaboration can lead to improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]

Depending on presentation and complications, this may include team members from nursing, critical care medicine, burn surgery, gastroenterology, hepatology, nephrology, medical toxicology, or cardiology. Triage nurses should be vigilant for exposures and expedite decontamination. These patients may require extensive nursing support for a prolonged period in the hospital and will likely require additional rehabilitation periods following hospitalization. Toxicology pharmacists often are instrumental in selecting appropriate materials for decontamination and post-exposure medications. Wound care physicians and nurses may be needed. A close interprofessional dialogue will be necessary to ensure all team members understand treatment goals. With this team approach, most patients should be expected to make a near-full recovery.
