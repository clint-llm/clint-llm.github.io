The activation of the pattern recognition receptors (PRR) like extracellular, toll-like receptors (TLRs), and intracellular NOD-like receptors (NLR) and RIG-like receptors (RLR) helps in recognition of a pathogen by the local immunity.  Gram-positive, gram-negative sepsis activates TLR2 and TLR4, respectively; whereas, the double-stranded virus activates TLR3. They start an immune response by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines which cause endothelial activation and damage-causing SIRS, sepsis, and death. Premature neonates show dysregulation complement system making them susceptible to severe sepsis.
