Genital warts are typically diagnosed visually, with confirmatory biopsy generally unnecessary. These exophytic lesions form due to enlargement of the dermal papillae and are lined by hyperplastic squamous epithelium that shows koilocytes, which are squamous epithelial cells characterized by an acentric, hyperchromatic nucleus displaced by a large perinuclear vacuole.
