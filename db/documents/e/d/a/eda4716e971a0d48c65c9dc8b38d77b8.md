Hydatidiform mole, or molar pregnancy, is the most common of the pathologies that come under gestational trophoblastic disease. It categorizes by a non-viable fertilized egg implanting into the uterine wall, causing abnormal and excessive proliferation of placental tissue. The moles can be either complete or partial. A complete mole forms when an oocyte with no female chromosomes is fertilized by single sperm, which then duplicates its chromosomes via endoreplication to form a diploid embryo composed only of paternal chromosomes. This mechanism occurs in approximately 80% of complete molar pregnancies, with the remaining 20% formed when the empty oocyte becomes fertilized by two sperm

Neural tube defects are the second commonest group of birth abnormalities worldwide following congenital heart diseases and exist on a vast clinical severity spectrum. Open lesions, such as anencephaly and craniorachischisis, are generally incompatible with life and are caused by a failure of the neural tube to close properly, thereby exposing the neural folds to amniotic fluid, while the least severe stem from secondary neuralation abnormalities, and have the name of spinal dysraphism. In these instances, there is no evidence of failed neural tube closure; instead, such pathologies are attributable to abnormal development of the cranial mesoderm.
