Dento-alveolar trauma includes injuries caused by an external impact on the dentition and its surrounding structures. These injuries range from a simple contusion of the tooth to its total dislocation from the alveolar bone, termed tooth avulsion, a rare type of dental trauma. A significant amount of force is usually necessary for the avulsion of a tooth. Other injuries to the surrounding structures, such as alveolar bone fractures and gingival contusions, should be suspected.

Replantation is the treatment of choice, and time management and appropriate storage of the avulsed tooth are crucial factors that will guarantee a good prognosis. Anti-resorption therapy is a newer technique that prevents the common inflammation that avulsed teeth experience after replantation, using a combination of antibiotics and corticosteroids. Splinting and systemic antibiotics are also included in the treatment regime of a patient with an avulsed tooth. Finally, follow-up appointments are of utmost importance, where the tooth will be assessed clinically and radiographically to confirm tooth vitality and rule out root resorption or ankylosis.
