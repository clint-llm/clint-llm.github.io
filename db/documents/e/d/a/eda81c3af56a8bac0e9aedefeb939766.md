Each office visit should entail a history and physical examination focusing on lifestyle-related health status and well-being. Lifestyle "vital signs" that should be explored thoroughly in each individual include diet, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, tobacco and alcohol use, stress levels, sleep hygiene, and emotional well-being. Pertinent laboratory tests should be obtained to further investigate each individual's assessment to screen, diagnose, monitor, and better understand each patient's health and lifestyle-associated ailments.

There are measures available that incorporate tools that are validated in the medical literature. Physical activity can be assessed by asking about the duration and intensity of exercise the patients conduct each week.

Diet is also an important factor to evaluate during the lifestyle wellness assessment. While a variety of tools exist to evaluate diet, currently, there is a need for a tool to assess diet that is not focused on a particular diet subset. General requirements are available from the US Department of Agriculture.

Sleep is another important "vital sign" to address during a clinic visit focusing on lifestyle prevention. Assessment tools exist, including the National Sleep Foundation's Sleep Health Index, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index

Established guidelines for managing chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, obesity, and tobacco and alcohol dependence should be utilized to support patients in the self-management of their lifestyle and health routines and behaviors. Patient rapport is vital in gaining trust between the care provider and the patient and their families to adapt and maintain behavioral changes. Evidence-based treatment plans and counseling methods on behavioral changes, disease prevention, and management through routine patient follow-ups and lifestyle prescriptions demonstrate effective relationships and improved patient outcomes.

Lifestyle prescriptions entail a precise written evidence-based action plan that is feasible and attainable by the patient. Healthy lifestyle routines and practices should be regularly encouraged, and patients should be further referred to health care specialists promptly for their lifestyle-related conditions if needed. Concise and efficient encounters focusing on coaching straightforward, easy-to-follow concepts during the office visit are fundamental. Patients can then readily build on the concepts acquired during the encounters with educational practices at home. Suitable community referrals to health coaches and external programs can also be beneficial additions to supporting behavior change and lifestyle.
