Prognosis remains grim in patients with LC. The time from diagnosis to death is about 4 to 6 weeks if left untreated. With treatment, overall survival is approximately 2 to 4 months. Patients with breast cancer have shown better prognosis and response to therapy with a median survival of 5 to 7 monthsÂ compared to other solid tumors like melanoma and lung cancer with a median survival of approximately 4 months. Favorable prognostic factors include KPS greater than 70, normal CSF flow, absence of major neurologic deficits, active treatment, chemosensitivity of primary cancer, and CSF protein less than 50 mg/dL at the time of diagnosis. According to the US National Comprehensive Cancer Network, KPS less than 60, high CNS disease burden, extensive systemic disease with few treatment options, severe neurologic impairment, and encephalopathy are markers of poor prognosis.
