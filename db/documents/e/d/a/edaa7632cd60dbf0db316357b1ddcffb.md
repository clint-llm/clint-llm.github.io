Gross pathology reveals boggy mucosa with excessive mucinous secretion, pus, and prominence of bronchial pits overlying the orifice of bronchial mucous glands.

Early changes in chronic bronchitis on microscopic histology show hypersecretion of mucus in large airways with hypertrophy of submucosal glands in the trachea and bronchus. Later an increase in goblet cells in small airways contributes to airway obstruction due to excessive mucous. Submucosal mucous glands occupy an increasing proportion of the bronchial wall. This is measured by Reid's index, which is the ratio of the thickness of the mucous gland layer to the thickness of the wall between epithelium and cartilage. The standard Reid's index is 0.4. In chronic bronchitis, Reid's index is increased. Chronic bronchitis is also associated with varying degrees of dysplasia and squamous metaplasia.
