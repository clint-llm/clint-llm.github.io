Ovarian cystadenomas are common benign epithelial neoplasms that carry an excellent prognosis. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology of ovarian cystadenoma and the role of the interprofessional team in management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the types of ovarian cystadenomas.
- Describe the presentation of ovarian cystadenoma.
- Summarize the treatment options for ovarian cystadenoma.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by ovarian cystadenomas.
