The exact number of patients with hypocitraturia varies greatly depending on the precise definition used. However, what is clear is that the incidence of hypocitraturia is increasing, particularly among more obese patients and with the increasing use of topiramate.

There does not appear to be any significant difference in the rate of hypocitraturia between Whites, Blacks, or Asians despite the significantly higher reported rate of nephrolithiasis in Caucasians.

Older stone-forming patients are more likely to have hypocitraturia than younger nephrolithiasis patients.

While women generally have higher citrate levels than men, hypocitraturia is more common in female stone formers than in their male stone-forming counterparts. Among female stone formers, hypocitraturia is more common in pre-menopausal women than in those who are post-menopausal.

The incidence of stones among women is increasing. The reasons for this are unclear but are thought to be due to more women in the workplace, which introduces changes in activity level, diet, and stress that are similar to men. Additionally, women tend to have more obesity, diet more often, and have more bariatric surgeries than men, all activities that increase kidney stone risk.
