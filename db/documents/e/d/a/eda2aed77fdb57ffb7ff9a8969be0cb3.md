It is presumed that juvenile xanthogranulomas develop after unknown stimuli (infectious or physical) and provoke a granulomatous histiocytic reaction.

Juvenile xanthogranulomas have been associated with juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia (JMML).

Other diseases associated with juvenile xanthogranuloma include the following: urticaria pigmentosa, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, aquagenic pruritis, and even cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection.
