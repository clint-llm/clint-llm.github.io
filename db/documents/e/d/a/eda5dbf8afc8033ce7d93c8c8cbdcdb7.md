Treatment regimens differ from antibiotics (in H. pylori gastritis) to vitamin supplementation (in autoimmune metaplastic atrophic gastritis) to immunomodulatory therapy (in autoimmune enteropathy) to dietary modifications (in eosinophilic gastritis).

H. pylori-associated gastritis: A triple-therapy of clarithromycin/proton-pump inhibitor/amoxicillin for 14 to 21 days is considered the first line of treatment. Clarithromycin is preferred over metronidazole because the recurrence rates with clarithromycin are far less compared to a triple therapy using metronidazole. However, metronidazole is the option of choice in areas where clarithromycin resistance is known. Quadruple bismuth-containing therapy would be of benefit, particularly if using metronidazole.

After two eradication failures, H. pylori culture and antibiotic resistance tests should be considered.

Autoimmune gastritis: Substitution of deficient iron and vitamin B12 (parenteral 1000 micrograms or oral 1000 to 2000 micrograms) is needed. Monitor Iron and folate levels, and eradicate any co-infection with H. pylori. Endoscopic surveillance for cancer risk and gastric neuroendocrine tumors (NET) is required.

Other forms of treatment for gastritis include cessation of alcohol, smoking, anti-inflammatory drugs, and spicy food, as well as managing stress, immunomodulatory therapy in autoimmune enteropathy, and dietary modification in eosinophilic gastritis.
