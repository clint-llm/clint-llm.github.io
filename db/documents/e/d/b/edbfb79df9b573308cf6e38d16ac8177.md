Anticholinergic medications (shorthand: "anticholinergics") are drugs that block and inhibit the activity of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at both central and peripheral nervous system synapses.

Generally speaking, anticholinergic agents can be subdivided into two categories based on their specific central and peripheral nervous system targets, as well as at the neuromuscular junction. These two categories are antimuscarinic blockers and antinicotinic blockers.

Anticholinergic medications have a wide range of physiologic effects, including effects on circulation, respiration, alertness, and vision.

Ipratropium and tiotropium: Function to dilate the bronchi and relieve shortness of breath and FDA approved for the use in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

- Benztropine and trihexyphenidyl: Used to counter reduced dopamine levels and relieve symptoms of ParkinsonÂ disease

- Oxybutynin and tolterodine: FDA approved for the treatment of urge incontinence and detrusor hyperactivity

- Oxybutynin has an off-label use for the treatment of hyperhidrosis.

- Diphenhydramine and other anti-histamines: FDA approved as a sleeping aid

- Scopolamine: Used as a prophylactic anti-emetic

- Atropine: Used to dilate pupil during retina visualization and in the treatment of cholinergic toxicity

- Vecuronium and Succinylcholine: Antinicotinic medications used as a neuromuscular blockade in surgeries

- Mecamylamine: Used strictly in research settings as a ganglionic blocker

- Glycopyrrolate: A type of quaternary amine used in anesthesia to decrease salivary and tracheal secretions

Medications like antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and diphenhydramine (when used to treat allergies) possess anticholinergic properties despite not being responsible for their therapeutic qualities.
