Partial filling of a prescription for a schedule II medication is allowed if, and only if, the pharmacist is unable to provide the patient with the full quantity prescribed; the pharmacist must make a note on the written prescription or the electronic record of how many tablets or capsules were dispensed. According to the Controlled Substance Act, the completion of a partial dispensing of schedule II medications must take place within 72 hours of the initial allocation, after which the prescription is no longer valid for the remaining undispensed quantity. If this task cannot be completed, the pharmacist should contact the practitioner about obtaining a new prescription.

Partial filling for a schedule II may also occur for patients in long-term care facilities or a patient with a terminal illness, so that the partial filling may be an individual dose; the pharmacist must document that the patient is terminally ill or in a long-term care placement before partially filling the medication. The remaining portion of the medication should be filled within 60 days from the prescription date unless the prescription is terminated because the medication is no longer necessary.

Partial filling of schedule III-V medications can be completed within six months of the original prescription.

A 2017 study found that there was a significant reduction in prescription errors for patients discharged from emergency departments when medications were prescribed electronically versus handwritten. The specific findings were that electronic prescriptions demonstrated decreased incidence of missed dosages, inaccurate frequency of medication, incorrect dosage strength, and the overall ability to read to the document (e.g., some clinician handwriting was illegible).
