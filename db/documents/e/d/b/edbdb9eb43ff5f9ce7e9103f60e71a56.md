In the general population over age 60, intermittent claudication is present in 5% of men and 2.5% of women. Of all patients with peripheral arterial disease, between 10% to 35% will have a presentation of “classic” intermittent claudication. Certain patient groups have a higher incidence of peripheral arterial disease; these include age greater than 70, people who smoke, patients with diabetes between ages 50-69, and those with other atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.
