Most of the issues of concern regarding hospice-appropriate diagnoses revolve around gaining and maintaining approval and billing and coding concerns. Specifically, frequently noted areas of concern involve successful utilization of symptom codes, combination codes, and successfully coding diagnoses that are not obviously listed in the manuals. Other areas of more recent concern involve specific diagnoses such as ambiguities involving dementia, establishing a fracture as the primary diagnosis, appropriately sequencing primary versus secondary neoplasms, and accurately documenting cerebrovascular diagnoses, which are acute versus late effect codes.
