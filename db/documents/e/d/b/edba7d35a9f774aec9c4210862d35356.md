Barbiturates are a group of sedative-hypnotic medications used for treating seizure disorder, neonatal withdrawal, insomnia, preoperative anxiety, and induction of coma for increased intracranial pressure. They are also useful for inducing anesthesia. Thiopental was introduced in 1934 for induction of anesthesia for general anesthesia.

- **Phenobarbital:**Phenobarbitone has extensive use as an antiepileptic drug in the neonatal and pediatric population. It is the most cost-effective drug treatment for epilepsy in adults in low-resource countries.

- **Methohexital:**Methohexital has demonstrated safety and efficacy for procedural sedation of short duration for cardioversion and pediatric outpatient surgery.

- **Butalbital:**Butalbital is used primarily for the treatment of headache disorders.
