A low residue diet is advocated for various clinical situations and illnesses. Until recently, a diet consisting of only liquids was recommended with bowel preparation before colonoscopies and colorectal surgeries. Numerous studies have shown either improved or equivalent bowel cleanliness in patients who consumed a low residue diet rather than a liquid diet with their bowel preparation. These same studies revealed enhanced overall patient satisfaction with a low residue diet and they were less likely to cancel their procedure.

Clinicians often advise a low residue diet for patients during a flare-up of their inflammatory bowel disease; however, a recent systemic review did not find support for a therapeutic benefit in such patients.
