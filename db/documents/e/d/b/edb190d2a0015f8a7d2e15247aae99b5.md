Complications of malignant tumors are mostly related to the treatment involved in eradicating the tumor and preventing recurrences. The tumors may compress orbital structures like the globe or optic nerve if the tumors are large. Malignant lesions may erode through the orbital roof to gain access to the intracranial vault, or in the case of adenoid cystic carcinoma, may spread via the perineural route to access the CNS where severe neurologic changes may manifest.

Surgical biopsy or excision carries risks, and complications are related to the surgery performed and the techniques utilized. For anterior or lateral orbitotomies, the main complications of note include orbital hemorrhage, postoperative orbital cellulitis, damage to the extraocular muscles, globe, or optic nerve, dryness from decreased lacrimal gland function, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak, or recurrence of the tumor.

Radiation therapy can also have adverse effects, including surrounding tissue damage, dermatitis of the skin, atrophy of the bone and soft tissues, and ocular effects, including retinopathy and dry eye disease. Chemotherapy can lead to many side effects, the most concerning being immunosuppression and the risk of infection. Vigilant short- and long-term monitoring after treatment is crucial to managingÂ these complications and monitoring for tumor recurrences.
