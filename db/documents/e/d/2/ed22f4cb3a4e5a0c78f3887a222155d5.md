- Obesity is associated with multiple medical complications. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is one of the significant respiratory consequences related to obesity.

- The presence of hypoventilation during wakefulness with PaCO2 more significant than 45 mm Hg in the presence of obesity (BMI greater than 30 kg/m^2) confirms the diagnosis, given that hypoventilation is not due to lung parenchymal or airway disease, pulmonary vascular pathology, or chest wall disorder.

- Therefore, serum bicarbonate levels can be a sensitive test to screen for chronic hypercapnia.

- The percent of total sleep time with SpO2 spent below 90% can be a useful polysomnographic variable for evaluating OHS patients.

- Positive airway pressure therapy is the first-line treatment for OHS and OSA, which significantly reduces the nocturnal build-up of PaCO2 and improves sleepiness during the daytime.
