Irukandji syndrome is a painful, potentially lethal condition caused by certain jellyfish from the Cubozoa class (box jellyfish) species. Although the sting is usually mild, systemic symptoms resembling a catecholamine surge can result in approximately half an hour, including tachycardia, hypertension, severe pain, muscle cramping, and is often followed by hypotension, pulmonary edema, and potentially life-threatening cardiac complications.

The syndrome was named in 1952 by Hugo Flecker, after an Aboriginal tribe located near Cairns, North Queensland, Australia.Carukia barnesi, named after the scientist Jack Barnes, who discovered the species as the causative organism of the condition. Interestingly, he established the causative relationship after envenoming himself, his son, and a local lifeguard, which subsequently required treatment for the ensuing condition in a hospital.
