The clinical presentation of schizencephaly is a wide range. The patients might have normal cognition with seizure onset in adulthood. Motor deficits are more common than any other types of neurological deficits, and the patients can have hemiparesis with mild developmental delay or severe cognitive impairment with quadriparesis.

Clinical presentation depends on the type.

- Type I (closed-lip) has a milder course which can be asymptomatic or diagnosed only in adult patients and presents with epileptic seizures and mild motor deficits.

- Type II (open lip) has a severe course, manifested by epilepsy (often refractory), intellectual disability, varying degrees of paralysis, hemiparesis in unilateral schizencephaly, and quadriparesis in bilateral schizencephaly.

The clinical features of patients with schizencephaly can be classified according to whether the finding is unilateral or bilateral.

Rarely, schizencephaly can present in adulthood with psychiatric manifestations such as paranoia, irritability, and impulsive spending.
