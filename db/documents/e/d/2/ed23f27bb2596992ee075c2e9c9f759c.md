As antipsychotics, phenothiazines fall into three different groups: aliphatic compounds, piperidines, and piperazines. Examples of specific agents in each class follow:

Aliphatic compounds:

- Chlorpromazine - available in 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg tablets. Injectable formulation 25 mg/mL.

Piperidines:

- Thioridazine - The branded version was discontinued because of cardiac adverse events. Generic versions are still available in the USA, but it is seldom used.

Piperazines:

- Fluphenazine - available in 1 mg, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg tablets, as a solution as 2.5 mg mL or 5 mg/5 mL, and a 2.5 mg/5 mL injection.

- Prochlorperazine - available as 5 mg and 10 mg tablets, as an injection 5 mg/mL, and in 25 mg suppositories. It is more commonly used for migraines and as an antiemetic.
