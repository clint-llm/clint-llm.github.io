Although anatomic variations of the hepatoduodenal ligament are rare, the content of the ligament may differ in the general population. Variation of the hepatic artery is common and is clinically important to identify before any surgery in this region is performed. If a specific significant variation exists, devastating hemorrhagic complications may occur. The most common variants include the right hepatic artery arising from the superior mesenteric artery that runs behind the pancreatic head along the right posterolateral flank of the portal vein, and the left hepatic artery as it arises from the left gastric artery that runs in the lesser omentum.
