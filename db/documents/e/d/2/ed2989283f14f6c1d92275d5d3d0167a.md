Usually, physicians can diagnose acne keloidalis nuchae during the clinical presentation. It is easier to diagnose this condition by inspection and palpation, given its appearance and texture. History should also include trauma, hair-cutting routine, infection, and medications.

Acne keloidalis nuchae presents as a firm, dome-shaped, inflammatory papules and pustules over the nape of the neck. Over time, fibrosis ensues with coalescence of firm papules into keloidal scarring plaques. Scarring is typically present in the time patients present for medical evaluation. Scarring is manifested by variable sized keloidal papules, plaques, or nodules at the site of previously involved hair follicles.
