It is essential to distinguish a hypersensitivity reaction from common coexisting postoperative complications, such as scarring, bleeding, hematoma, infection, abscess, and wound dehiscence. In some cases, they may be secondary complications of a hypersensitivity reaction.

Suture hypersensitivity can mimic primary granulomatous disorders. It is crucial to be able to distinguish between this foreign-body reaction and the recurrence of malignancy or wound infection. Differentiation from a malignant lesion or an infection can be achieved with a wound fine-needle aspiration and wound culture with staining, respectively.
