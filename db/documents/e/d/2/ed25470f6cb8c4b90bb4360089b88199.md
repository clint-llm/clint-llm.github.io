The narrow therapeutic window of dimercaprol appears to be time and dose-dependent. Case reports have shown that doses above 3 mg/kg dimercaprol given every 4 hours or less will cause adverse effects in up to two-thirds of patients. Thus, toxicity in most patients can be avoided by a dose of less than 3 mg/kg and allowing at least 4 hours between each dose.

While the precise mechanism of toxicity is unknown, some have speculated that it may result from removing metal from enzymes disrupting their normal function, while others have postulated toxicity occurs when there is excess dimercaprol that remains unbound to the metal in the body.
