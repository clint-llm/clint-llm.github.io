Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a very rare congenital cardiomyopathy. It is a disease of endomyocardial trabeculations that increase in number and prominence. This cardiomyopathy carries a high risk of malignant arrhythmias, thromboembolic phenomenon and left ventricular dysfunction. This disease also has other names like spongy myocardium, spongiform cardiomyopathy, hypertrabeculation, persisting myocardial sinusoids or zaspopathy. It can carries associations with complex congenital heart defects or skeletal myopathy. It represents the arrest of the normal maturation process of the myocardium. This disease can present throughout life with progressive left ventricular systolic dysfunction.

This type of congenital cardiomyopathy has not been fully understood so far and remained unclassified by WHO. In 2006, the American Heart Association classified this entity as primary cardiomyopathy of genetic origin. MOGE(S) classification of cardiomyopathies has also described it as a distinct entity.
