Endometriosis is a common, estrogen-dependent, inflammatory, gynecologic disease process in which normal endometrial tissue is abnormally present outside the uterine cavity.Â Endometriomas are cystic lesions that stem from endometriosis. Endometriomas are most commonly found in the ovaries. Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of reproductive-aged women and is a common cause of chronic pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, and infertility. Most commonly, endometriosis is found within the pelvis, specifically on the ovaries.

Endometriomas are the most common manifestation of endometriosis on the ovary. However, implants can also be found throughout the abdomen, such as on the bowel, within prior surgical incisions, and even in rare cases in distant locations of the body, such as the cerebellum.
