Pathological fractures, particularly in the hip or spinal column, are the most serious complications of osteoporosis. Hip fractures often result from falls and can lead to disability and even increased mortality risk in the first following the injury. There are also spinal fractures absent patient falls, with compression fractures leading to back pain and a kyphotic posture.
