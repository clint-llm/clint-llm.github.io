NMOSD is an inflammatory disease that primarily affects the optic nerve and spinal cord. In the past, NMO/NMOSD was regarded by some as a variant of MS, but the discovery of IgG antibodies against aquaporin-4 has caused NMOSD to be recognized more broadly as a distinct entity with a unique mechanism and pathogenesis.

Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is a membrane-bound protein with a high concentration in certain parts of the central nervous system, such as the optic nerve, the spinal cord, and the area postrema.
