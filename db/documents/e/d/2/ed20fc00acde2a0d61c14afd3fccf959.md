# Introduction

Physiologic parameters at high altitudes vary from those at sea level. An understanding of flight and altitude physiology is essential to prevent pre-hospital fight-induced barotrauma. Boyle’s law explains that “the volume of a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure to which it is subjected.” Based on this law, pressure decreases with increased altitude, thereby causing an increase in the volume of gas.  These changes are demonstrated by the fact that atmospheric pressure at 10000 feet is 10.1 pounds per square inch (psi) (68 kPa), compared to 14.7 psi (101 kPa) at ground level.

These physiological factors affect both helicopter pre-hospital transport and aeromedical airplane transport. Federal regulations, such as those promulgated by the FAA, require cabin pressure to be below atmospheric pressure equal to the pressure at 8000 feet above sea level.

Another physiological factor that changes with altitude is the decrease in the partial pressure of oxygen as height above sea level increases; this leads to a reduction in FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) at a higher altitude compared to sea level.  One report demonstrated a decrease of 32 mm Hg, from 159 at sea level to 127 at the height of 6200 feet.

A typical helicopter pre-hospital transport reaches altitudes of 1000 to 3500 feet above ground level, while airplane transport typically transports at altitudes of 10000 to 40000 ft above sea level. An understanding of flight physiology is essential, as even an increase of 1000 to 1500 feet above sea level can cause gas expansion leading to clinical significance in the critically ill.

# Issues of Concern

The increase in the volume occupied by gas at higher altitudes can have adverse effects on various body sites sensitive to changes in air volume and pressure. Such areas include the inner ear, lungs (specifically relative to pneumothoraces), and potentially any air-filled instruments like a balloon cuff on an endotracheal tube (ET).

The middle and inner ear are air-filled spaces that are essential for both hearing and spatial orientation.  The middle ear begins behind the tympanic membrane (TM) and communicates via the eustachian tube with the nasopharynx

The Eustachian tube helps equilibrate the pressure in the middle ear with the external atmosphere via the levator and tensor veli palati muscles. These open during yawning or swallowing, or during Valsalva maneuvers (forcing positive pressure to open the eustachian tube by blowing against a closed nasopharynx).  When gas expansion builds up in the middle ear via decreased atmospheric pressure (as seen with altitude increases), or by direct compression from increased pressure externally compressing the TM (as in landing), barotrauma to the TM may result. This risk increases in patients with underlying eustachian tube dysfunction, either via structural disease or inflammatory process.

Flying is the most cited cause of ear barotrauma. In commercial flying, ways to prevent barotrauma include the Valsalva maneuver, chewing mints or gum, or swallowing to equalize the inner ear pressure with the outer ear. Flyers should also avoid air travel when they have signs or symptoms or an upper respiratory tract infection.

Another issue of concern regarding flight barotrauma can present in the pulmonary system. In patients with a pneumothorax, the air volume trapped in any pulmonary space that does not communicate with the outside atmosphere will increase as atmospheric pressure decreases, consistent with Boyle’s law.

In patients who do not have a pneumothorax at the beginning of air travel, the risk of spontaneously developing a pneumothorax secondary to changes in atmospheric pressure is low yet does occur.

Another area of concern regarding flight barotrauma comes in the form of endotracheal cuffs and changes in cuff pressures.  On flight ascent, due to the decreased barometric pressure, there is a concern for expanded gas volume within the cuff that may lead to tracheal injury and necrosis secondary to decreased perfusion if the balloon overcomes the critical perfusion pressure to the corresponding tracheal tissue, often cited at 30 cm H20.

# Clinical Significance

While air transport of patients is necessary in many cases, such transport is not without risks due to decreased pressure at higher altitudes. In particular, common concerns are barotrauma to the inner ear, pulmonary effects including worsening of pneumothorax, and tracheal necrosis, and further respiratory injury due to effects on ET tube cuffs. Air transport personnel are advised to be aware of flight physiological effects, risk factors, and to manage and monitor patients carefully to avoid adverse medical consequences.
