Osteonecrosis frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma to orthopedic surgeons. Several risk factors are outlined in the literature, yet the exact pathophysiology is not fully understood. Diagnostic difficulty frequently results in delayed presentation of advanced cases of the disease, which often prevents the joint from being salvaged and increases patient morbidity. While an orthopedic surgeon is almost always involved in caring for patients with osteonecrosis, educating healthcare professionals who encounter these patients at the hospital front door, such as general practitioners, emergency department physicians, nurses, and physiotherapists, is essential. This way, a well-functioning interprofessional healthcare team approach to patient care in these cases is possible, with each member contributing from their area of expertise, exercising open communication with the rest of the team, and documenting all interactions with the patient, so that the appropriate caregiver can be contacted if changes in the patient's regimen or rehabilitation are necessary. This interprofessional approach will yield the best patient results. [Level 5]
