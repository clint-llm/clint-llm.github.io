Because there are many causes of SVCS, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team of health care workers that include a vascular surgeon, interventional radiologist, radiation therapist, oncologist, pain specialist, and cardiac surgeon. The nurse plays a vital role in the monitoring of these patients. Many of them have cerebral and laryngeal edema and need close monitoring. The pharmacist should be fully aware of the drugs used to manage SVCS, which include corticosteroids and diuretics. Because many of these patients have an unpredictable course, radiation is often administered as a palliative measure to shrink the tumor and relieve the symptoms. Patients with Hodgkin's cancer are managed with chemotherapy.

**Outcomes**

The prognosis of patients with SVCS depends on the cause. For patients with a benign cause of SVCS, the life expectancy is not changed, but for malignant cases, there is a significant drop in survival. Individuals who have features of cerebral and laryngeal edema can develop life-threatening symptoms and suddenly die. Patients with SVCS as a result of lung cancer usually live less than 24 months. For those who do not respond to radiation treatment, the survival is less than a year.
