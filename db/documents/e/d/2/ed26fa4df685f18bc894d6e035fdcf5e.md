Adrenal hypoplasia patients should wear an alert bracelet or similar identification. Patient education is central to the management of adrenal hypoplasia to prevent adrenal crisis. A regular visit to an endocrinologist is required after diagnosis and especially after an episode of adrenal crisis. Follow-up at 6 to 12 months is the recommendation. Adult patients need to be more independent and be able to take care of the dose adjustments according to their needs. An additional dose of hydrocortisone is necessary during periods of stress, such as psychological stress or prolonged physical exercise.
