Patients with a delusional disorder may first have their first encounter with a nurse practitioner or primary care physician. It is important to refer these patients to a mental health counselor or a psychiatrist because the management is complex. Many of these patients lack insight into their disorder and consequently refuse treatment. Therefore, education of the community andÂ family counseling of those who are related to the patient are crucial steps in a holistic approach toward managing a patient suffering from delusional disorder.
