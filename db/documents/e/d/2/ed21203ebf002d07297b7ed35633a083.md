In general, mild soft tissue injuries are manageable with rest, ice, NSAIDs, and early range of motion.  The pitfall in managing elbow injuries lies in the fact that the joint gets stiff quickly and depending on patient characteristics, formal physical therapy may be recommended to ensure an overall functional outcome.

The management of elbow trauma and fractures is beyond the scope of this review.  However, most fracture patterns with displacement require surgical management with open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) performed, followed by formal physical therapy postoperatively.  Simple elbow dislocations (i.e., no associated fracture) almost all can be managed with closed reduction and sling immobilization for 10 to 14 days followed by early ROM.  The examiner should take advantage of the initial post-reduction examination, including documented ROM and neurovascular status upon successful reduction of the joint.  Performing this examination in the acute setting can help guide not only the duration of joint immobilization in a sling, but the possibility of developing posterolateral rotatory instability (PLRI) that can present chronically with painful clicking, weakness, and feelings of instability with various activity.  These patients require operative intervention to mitigate the risk of a poor outcome.

Nondisplaced fractures can be treated with a splint initially, and in general, greater than 2mm of displacement in most fracture patterns require referral for operative consideration.

Uncomplicated posterolateral dislocation usually treated with closed reduction. If there is evidence of entrapped medial epicondylar fragment, open reduction may be needed.

**Emergency department treatment and procedures**

- Orthopedic consultation is the standard for all but nondisplaced, stable fractures, which as a rule, can be splinted 24 to 48 hours orthopedic follow-up

- Fractures generally requiring orthopedic consultation:

- Transcondylar, intercondylar, condylar, epicondylar fractures
- Fractures involving articular surfaces such as capitellum or trochlea

- Supracondylar fractures:

- ED physician can handle type 1 with 24 to 48 hours orthopedic follow-up
- The elbow may be flexed and splinted with a posterior splint
- Types 2 and 3 require an immediate orthopedic consult
- Reduce these in ED when the fracture is associated with vascular compromise

- Anterior dislocation:

- Reduce immediately if vascular structures compromised
- Then flexed to 90º and place the posterior splint

- Posterior dislocation:

- Reduce immediately if vascular structures compromised
- Then flexed 90º and place posterior splint.

- Radial head fracture:

- Minimally displaced fractures may need aspiration to remove hemarthrosis: instill bupivacaine and immobilize.
- Other types should have an orthopedic consult.

- Radial head subluxation

- In one continuous motion, supinate and flex elbow while placing slight pressure on the radial head.
- Hyperpronation technique is possibly more effective - while grasping the patient’s elbow, the wrist is hyper-pronated until feeling a palpable click.
- A palpable click will often accompany the reduction
- If the exam suggests fracture, but radiograph is negative, splint and have the patient follow up in 24 to 48 hours for re-evaluation

**Medication**

- Conscious sedation is often necessary to achieve reductions

- Ibuprofen: 600 to 800 mg (pediatric: 5 to 10 mg/kg) PO TID

- Naprosyn: 250 to 500 mg (pediatric: 10 to 20 mg/kg) PO BID

- Tylenol with codeine: 1 or 2 tabs (pediatric 0.5 to 1 mg/kg codeine) PO: do not exceed acetaminophen 4g/24 hours

- Morphine sulfate: 0.1 mg/kg IV

- Hydromorphone 5 mg/acetaminophen 300mg

- Hydrocodone/acetaminophen: 1 to 2 tabs PO

**Attritional injuries management modalities**

Treatment for repetitive trauma such as lateral epicondylitis or tendinitis, demonstrate successful outcomes with nonoperative management modalities alone.  These include but are not limited to

- Rest, ice, and NSAIDs

- Physical therapy when appropriate

- Eccentric exercises for lateral epicondylitis

- Corticosteroid injection when applicable

- Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) considerations

- 2016 study noted efficacy in managing UCL insufficiency

**Disposition**

- Admission Criteria

- Vascular injuries, open fracture
- Fractures requiring operative reduction or internal fixation.
- Admit all patients with extensive swelling or ecchymosis for overnight observation and elevation to monitor for and decrease the risk for compartment syndrome.

- Discharge Criteria

- Stable fractures or reduced dislocations with none of the above features. 
- Splint and arrange orthopedic follow-up in 24 to 48 hours
- Uncomplicated soft tissue injuries.

It is crucial to recall that prolong elbow immobilization can cause stiffness to the patient, so the main goal is to get the elbow's range of movement back as soon as possible.
