Generally, toxicity to megestrol is very mild, rated on a scale of Grade 0 or 1. No serious adverse drug reactions have resulted from megestrol acetate administered in dosages as high as 1200 mg/day. Clinicians should properly adjust the dosage of megestrol to prevent toxicity for patients with comorbidities involving hepatic and cardiovascular disease. Secondary adrenal insufficiency also serves as an indicator of toxicity after the withdrawal of long-term treatment. No antidote currently exists for an overdose of megestrol. Supportive treatment should be provided to patients experiencing overdose symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, and shortness of breath. According to product labeling, it is unknown whether megestrol can be removed by dialysis or not, but due to low solubility, it is hypothesized that it is potentially dialyzable.
