Any contraindication to vaginal delivery would also be a contraindication to ECV. These include but are not limited to placenta previa, vasa previa, active genital herpes outbreak, and prior classical cesarean delivery. Prior low transverse cesarean delivery is not a contraindication to external cephalic version, although not much data is available on uterine rupture rates.

Antepartum ECV is contraindicated in multiple gestations, although it can be utilized for delivery of the second twin.

Consideration should be used in patients with severe oligohydramnios, nonreassuring fetal monitoring, hyperextended fetal head, significant fetal or uterine anomaly, fetal growth restriction, and maternal hypertension due to these situations being associated with a low likelihood of success of ECV and possible increased risk to the fetus from the procedure.

If a woman presents in labor with malpresentation, ECV could be a reasonable option if she is in early labor, the presenting part is unengaged, there isÂ a normal amniotic fluid index, and no contraindications to vaginal delivery or ECV.
