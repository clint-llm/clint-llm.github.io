Many important muscles attach to the fibula which molds the fibular shaft into its unique shape.

- The biceps femoris tendon attaches to the fibular head.

- The fibularis longus and fibularis brevis tendons attach to the lateral fibula.

- The extensor digitorum longus and extensor hallucis longus tendons attach to the medial fibula.

- The fibularis tertius (FT) is a small muscle in the anterior compartment of the leg that inserts on the anterior surface of the distal fibula. FT functions to extend the ankle and evert subtalar joints.

Fibular muscle accessory tendon variations are quite common. The FT muscle can vary in size or be absent 20% of the time. The fibularis quartus muscle is seen in the lateral compartment approximately 12% to 22% of the time.
