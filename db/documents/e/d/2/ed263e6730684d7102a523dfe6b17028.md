Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that has an array of clinical manifestations ranging from cutaneous to multi-organ systemic involvement. Bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (BSLE) is a rare blistering eruption seen in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) described mainly in case reports, series, and a few multicenter retrospective studies. These cutaneous lesions appear as tense, vesiculobullous eruptions with a predilection for the extremities, trunk, face, and neck, usually healing without scar or milia.
