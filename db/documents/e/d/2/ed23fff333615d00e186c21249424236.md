In 1940, Sir Rudolph Albert Peters’ group at the University of Oxford, UK, developed dimercaprol (2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol), also known as British anti-Lewisite (BAL), as an antidote to lewisite, the arsenical chemical weapon used during World War II.

Prior to the development of penicillamine and trientine, dimercaprol was the only therapy for copper excretion in Wilson disease. However, some have suggested that there may still be a need for short-term therapy with dimercaprol in patients with a severe neurological disability because it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier.

Currently, dimercaprol is FDA-approved in the treatment of the following:

**Arsenic**

- Toxic exposure to arsenic and markedly elevated urine arsenic concentrations

- Arsenic-related skin injuries (e.g., lewisite)

**Mercury**

- Acute or chronic elemental mercury exposure with a whole blood mercury concentration or 24-hour urine concentration of ≥ 100 mcg/L

- Acute inorganic mercury poisoning when whole blood mercury concentration or 24-hour urine concentration is greater than or equal to 100 mcg/L

**Gold**

- Gold-induced thrombocytopenia: Injections with gold salts have been used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

**Lead**

- Severe symptomatic lead poisoning, lead encephalopathy, or a whole blood lead concentration above 100 mcg/dL in adults and above 70 mcg/dL in children

- To prevent redistribution of lead to the brain, Dimercaprol is given before calcium disodium edetate, another chelating agent.

- The water-soluble derivative of dimercaprol, 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), is FDA-approved for treating toxic exposure to lead in children when whole blood concentrations are above 45 mcg/dL, although there have been case reports of its use in adult patients.

The more modern chelating agent DMSA has replaced dimercaprol due to its broader therapeutic index and fewer adverse effects. However, outside the United States, another water-soluble derivative of dimercaprol, 2,3-dimercapto-1-propane sulfonic acid (DMPS), is often used instead.
