Certain fracture types tend to be more common in adolescents, and tend to be associated with sports-related injuries.

Adults avulsion fractures, on the other hand, tend to have a higher association with traumatic injuries.

The true prevalence or incidence of many avulsion fractures is not known. Accurate incidence is difficult to know because most of the literature regarding avulsion fractures is comprised of case reports and case series.

Epidemiologic information varies entirely based on anatomic location and age. Avulsion fractures in certain anatomic areas can be quite common.

It is generally agreed that the prevalence may be increasing due to earlier and more frequent participation in sporting and other athletic activities in young people, with higher demands on growing body parts.

In pediatric and adolescent age groups, males are 3 to 5 times more likely than girls to sustain an avulsion fracture.

While the prevalence of avulsion fractures is difficult to know, avulsion fractures overall do have a very high prevalence of associated soft tissue injuries that occur in conjunction with them.
