Consultation may be considered based on the suspected etiology. Dental or oral surgery care may be enlisted for odontogenic causes, while an otolaryngologist is, at times, consulted for drainage of a peritonsillar abscess. Physiatrists may also be involved in a patient's care when directed therapeutic interventions are necessary to treat refractory trismus.
