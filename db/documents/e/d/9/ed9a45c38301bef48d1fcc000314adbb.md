Toxic dermal reactions are commonly due to physical contact with caterpillar's setae (hair or spines).  These are hollow structures with a single basal poison gland.  These spines fracture and inject venom under pressure.  Some species release these toxic setae into the environment where they can be inhaled and affect both the upper and lower respiratory tract.  Another source of exposure, direct or aerosolized, is from the caterpillar's hemolymph (invertebrate's blood equivalent).

Eye exposure of either hemolymph and/or setae results in acute scleritis or ophthalmia nodosa; this manifests as simple conjunctivitis and progresses into a more severe panophthalmitis when setae penetrate the cornea.

Reactions are either from the direct toxic effects of the setae/hemolymph or immunoglobulin E (IgE) production which results in a hypersensitive state and manifests as a type IV (T-cell-mediated) hypersensitivity reaction.

Most reactions result from direct contact.  Other vectors include airborne transmission spread by wind or carried on pets and other natural objects.
