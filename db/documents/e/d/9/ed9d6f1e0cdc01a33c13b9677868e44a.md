The exact incidence of internal degloving injuries is impossible to determine because small injuries resulting in insignificant or minor fluid collections may not be clinically significant. Furthermore, even large internal degloving injuries are frequently missed due to either delayed presentation or the presence of distracting injuries. Internal degloving injuries do not typically occur in isolation. Morel-Lavallee lesions are frequently associated with and complicate the treatment of fractures of the pelvis, acetabulum, or proximal femur. There is a very wide range of associated rates between pelvic or acetabular fractures and Morel-Lavallee lesions.
