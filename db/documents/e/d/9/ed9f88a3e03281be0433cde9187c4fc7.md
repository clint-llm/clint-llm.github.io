Management of postoperative ileus revolves around supportive care. After excluding serious or treatable conditions, supportive treatment and optimizing care almost always resolve the ileus. These measures include intravenous fluid replacement, electrolyte replacement, early ambulation, and often nasogastric tube placement. Some of these interventions are aimed at reducing symptoms, such as nasogastric suction, but have little evidence supporting their overall usefulness otherwise.

A careful balance between postoperative pain control and analgesics, especially opiates use, is crucial to prevent or treat the ileus. Non-opiate analgesics are encouraged. Optimizing electrolytes and other metabolites are important. Encouraging ambulation very early in the postoperative period is a simple but very important prevention and treatment measure. Regular and serial clinical assessments should be exerted with open eyes and mind for worsening complications or a missed diagnosis. Multiple studies have assessed a few treatment measures to overcome ileus but with no clinically significant outcomes. Studies on gum-chewing showed some improvement in the ileus. Therefore, this is occasionally but not widely used in clinical practice.
