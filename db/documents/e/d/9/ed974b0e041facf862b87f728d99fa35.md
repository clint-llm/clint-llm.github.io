Since the underlying defect is anatomic, there is no cure or treatment for the enlarged corneas seen in megalocornea. Complications as a result of the underlying defect can also be challenging to treat due to abnormal anatomy. For example, a large ciliary ring and capsular bag with normal-sized lens and weak zonular fibers can complicate cataract surgery, the most common intervention in these patients.

Determining the appropriate power of the lens can be difficult since the normal anatomy that is assumed when using third-generation intraocular lens formulas is not present. In deciding on a formula, one that incorporates the anterior chamber depth and corneal curvature should be used as the anterior chamber is generally excessively deep, and the corneal curvature tends to be more divergent in patients with megalocornea (>2 standard deviations). The Holladay II formula has been shown to be superior to SRK-T, though neither remained at the ideal power, and further follow up is needed since lens power may not differ between the two.

Due to the increased size of the structures, standard intraocular lenses may decenter, and iris suturing, scleral fixation, or an iris-claw intraocular lens may be required.
