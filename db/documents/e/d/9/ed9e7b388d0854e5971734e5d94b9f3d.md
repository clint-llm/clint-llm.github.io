Factors which may interfere with the successful and accurate evaluation of bone conduction are numerous and complex. Some evidence suggests that air-bone gaps obtained by manual (also known as traditional) PTA methods are more susceptible to tester bias effects when compared to those obtained via automated PTA methods. This evidence is based on large datasets showing lower air-bone gap variability in manual versus automated PTA. It is hypothesized to be associated with prior knowledge of hearing loss characteristics.

Other studies suggest that manual and automated PTA methods produce sufficiently similar results, indicating that either method is acceptable provided their calculated threshold differences fall within approximately 5 dB of each other.

It has been hypothesized that frequencies above 4,000 Hz are prone to error from false air-bone gaps during PTA.
