The supraorbital nerve block procedure utilizes the following steps:

- Identify appropriate landmarks

- Using an aseptic technique clean the injection area using a skin cleansing agent

- Place the patient in a supine position

- From a position lateral to the patient’s head, insert a 25-30-gauge needle in a medial and cephalad direction into the inferior edge of the supraorbital ridge approximately 0.5 cm below the supraorbital notch

- Advance the needle slightly being careful not to penetrate the supraorbital foramen

- Perform a test aspirate

- Inject 0.5-1 mL of the local anesthetic solution to form a subcutaneous wheal and then continue to inject 1-3 mL of local anesthetic

- Firmly place a small roll of gauze above the orbital rim to prevent ballooning of anesthetic at the superior aspect of the eyelid

Due to the various branching of the ophthalmic nerve, the nerve block may not be successful after the first attempt. Injection of additional local anesthetic medial and laterally along the orbital rim will adequately reach all nerve branches.
