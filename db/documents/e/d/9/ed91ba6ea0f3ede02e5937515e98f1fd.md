The lingual artery is an important component in various head and neck procedures. Otolaryngologists utilize the base of the tongue for treating sleep apnea, neoplasms, and dysphagia.

There is both a transoral and transcervical approach to accessing the tongue in surgery. With the transoral approach, caution regarding the HLNVB to avoid functional deficits is necessary, while the transcervical approach allows for greater tongue-based resections with the preservation of both HLNVB.
