APNs are part of the interprofessional team providing health care to patients and families, depending on the area of their training. The majority of APNs in the US are in primary care as nurse practitioners.

All APNs are privileged with a license to practice, and most have the autonomy and the authority to furnish medications and therapies in direct patient care. All interprofessional healthcare providers should work closely to ensure safe, quality patient care and provide cost-effective treatments. Barriers should be eliminated to allow APNs to practice to the extent of their education and training to benefit the patient's care and health cost.
