The evaluation should consist of:

- A urine sample obtained by having the patient void on their own and checking pre and post-void residuals with a bladder scanner, or placement of a Foley catheter

- Chemistries: sodium, potassium, bicarbonate, chloride, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine

- A complete blood count

- If neurologic signs and symptoms are present on examination and there is suspicion of stroke, CT of the head

- If spinal cord processes are suspected, MRI

- Evaluation by urology and other appropriate specialists to aid in the diagnosis of the etiology will proceed based on the findings of the history and physical

Diagnosis:

The diagnosis of acute urinary retention is aided by bladder ultrasound, but catheterization is reasonable as it is both diagnostic and therapeutic.  The bladder ultrasound that suggests a volume greater than or equal to 300 mL in a patient unable to void suggests urinary retention.  Bladder ultrasound can be inaccurate because of body habitus, tissue edema, prior surgery, and scarring. The placement of a catheter might be needed. The volume of urine obtained from drainage in the first 10 to 15 minutes should be recorded. If the volume exceeds 400 mL, the catheter will typically remain in place. For volumes of 200 to 400 mL, the decision to leave the catheter in place is guided by the clinical scenario as volumes less than 200 mL likely do not have acute urinary retention and should undergo evaluation for other causes of abdominal or suprapubic discomfort.
