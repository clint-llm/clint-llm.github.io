The vascular system consists of multiple diverse blood vessels that extend throughout the body and circulate blood from the heart. The blood circulates in arteries to arterioles to capillaries, where the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and other substances occurs. Blood is then returned to the heart from post-capillary venules to veins which successively enlarge and empty into the heart.
