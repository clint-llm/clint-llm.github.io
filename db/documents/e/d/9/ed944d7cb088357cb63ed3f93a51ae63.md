Somatostatin binds to six different receptors in various systems and cells throughout the body to produce its regulatory effect. These receptors are specific to somatostatin and classify as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR). When activated, somatostatin receptors decrease intracellular cyclic AMP and calcium while simultaneously increasing outward potassium currents. The overall effect observed is a decrease in hormone secretion of the target tissue.

The other noteworthy effect to mention is the anti-proliferative and cytostatic forces that somatostatin can produce. It achieves these results from both direct and indirect mechanisms. Somatostatin activates phosphotyrosine phosphatase which directly inhibits the cell cycle progression in target cells. It provides indirect inhibition to cell growth by suppressing insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1) and growth hormone which limits cells ability to thrive and survive.
