**Plain Radiograph**

On x-ray, the tumor is typically well-circumscribed, cortical, multilobulated, and osteolytic. Intralesional opacities, septation, and peripheral sclerosis may also be seen. Multifocality within the same bone is regularly observed. The multifocal radiolucencies, which are surrounded by ring-shaped densities, produce the characteristic ''soap-bubble'' appearance.

**Computed Tomography Scan**

A computed tomography scan demonstrates the soft tissue extension and cortical involvement when they exist. However, it does not depict the intraosseous extension of adamantinomas. CT scan plays a role in the routine work-up of adamantinomas and is useful in detecting pulmonary metastases.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

MRI plays a crucial role in locoregional staging since it depicts distant cortical foci, intramedullary and soft tissue extension. MRI is also a useful tool for the determination of tumor-free margins as well as the strategy for reconstructive surgery.

Two morphological patterns of adamantinoma are described on MRI:

- Multiple small nodules in one or more foci

- A solitary lobulated focus

Adamantinomas usually show a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a high signal on T2-weighted images. However, these findings are nonspecific.
