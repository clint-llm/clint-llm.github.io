Corneal topography and tomography maps display the size, shape, and power of the cornea's anterior and posterior surface and the cornea's thickness in various locations. Topography maps are essential for the following:

**Screening for refractive surgery:**Normative data have been established for various topographers. Placido-based topographers give data only for the anterior corneal surface.

An example is a TMS-4N topographer (Tomey) which has 25 rings with 256  measurement points on a ring, and it can measure a maximum of 6400 measurement points. The  Sim K values reflect the values derived by keratometric devices.

Color maps make it easier to identify steeper and flatter areas of the cornea. Warmer colors indicate steeper and cooler colors indicate flatter keratometry.

Topographic indices have been established in Placido-based topographers and Slit scanning and Schiempflug-based tomography machines to identify candidates who are fit for laser refractive procedures. Artificial intelligence-based systems have recently been used to detect the early onset of keratoconus.

**Detection of corneal ectasia:**Pentacam-based systems provide the indices, including the following:

- Index of surface variance  (ISV)

- Keratoconus index (KI)

- Central keratoconus index (CKI)

- Index of height decentration (IHD)

- The minimum radius of curvature (R min)

- Index of vertical asymmetry (IVA)

- Index of height asymmetry (IHA)

These indices have high sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing keratoconus from normal corneas.

Concept of **"enhanced reference surface":**A reference is devised which resembles a normal portion of the patient's own cornea, and the enhanced reference surface is generated using the diameter of the best fit sphere but excluding the area of ectatic protrusion. A 3.5 mm zone centered on the ectatic area is the exclusion zone.

**Contact lens fitting:**The role of corneal topography in contact lens fitting in normal and keratoconic corneas has been studied in the last two decades. Corneal topography maps may guide the initial diagnostic lens used for the contact lens trial. In keratoconic corneas, the role of corneal topography for rigid gas permeable lens or Rose K lens fitting is more than in normal corneas.

**Progression of ectatic disorders:**Amongst the ectatic disorders, keratoconus is the most common. The Amsler-Krumeich classification is most commonly used to grade its severity.

**Planning placement of intracorneal ring segments:**Intracorneal ring segments are essentially made of polymethyl methacrylate and are placed in the corneal stroma to flatten the cornea and ensure lesser aberrations and decrease corneal irregularity.

Placement of these ring segments can be done after making a channel in the corneal stroma either manually or with a femtosecond laser. The location and depth of the channels are mainly guided by corneal tomography and by the manufacturer's nomograms. Postoperatively, the effect of the ring segments is analyzed by changes in the corneal topography.

**Planning arcuate incisions:**In a study by Koffler, 21 eyes with high post-operative astigmatism after penetrating keratoplasty were treated with arcuate incisions, which were guided by the topography maps.

**Diagnosis of subclinical corneal edema in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy:**Fourier analysis of cases of Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy by anterior segment optical coherence tomography in 75 eyes of 43 patients showed anterior and posterior flattening in the inferior cornea up to grade 5 and irregularity of the anterior and posterior surfaces in grade 6.

Schiempflug tomography posterior elevation and pachymetry maps can detect subclinical corneal edema in early Fuchs endothelial dystrophy and can be an important diagnostic tool.

**Change in corneal curvature after pterygium excision and excision of limbal dermoid:**Changes in corneal curvature after excision of pterygium with or without conjunctival autograft and after excision of limbal dermoid can be accurately assessed by corneal topography.

**Other Indications of Corneal Tomography**

Pachymetry maps, anterior and posterior elevation maps, white-to-white diameter measurements, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and ectasia progression indices are additional information given by the slit scanning and Schiempflug technologies.

**Pachymetry maps**give an indication of corneal thickness across the cornea. Location of the thinnest area, if paracentral, may be an early indication of ectasia. The thinnest and steepest areas, if they coincide, are another indicator of ectasia.

**Elevation maps**in Schiempflug tomography are calculated based on a best-fit sphere (BFS) or a best-fit toric ellipsoid (BFTE).

**The Belin-Ambrosio ectasia (BAD)**display shows several parameters which may be indicators of ectasia.
