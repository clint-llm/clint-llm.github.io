The first stage of alcoholic liver disease is hepatic steatosis, which involves the accumulation of small fat droplets under liver cells approaching the portal tracts. More advanced disease is characterized by marked steatosis, hepatocellular necrosis, and acute inflammation, known as alcoholic hepatitis. There is a need for more effective treatment of alcoholic liver disease as the severe form of the disease is life-threatening. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of alcoholic liver disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the conditions and factors that aggravate alcoholic liver disease.
- Outline strategies for decreasing alcohol dependency and/or abuse in patients with alcoholic liver disease.
- Review the treatment options available for alcoholic liver disease.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to ameliorate outcomes in patients with alcoholic liver disease.
