The management of a prosthetic joint infection is best done with an interprofessional team consisting of an orthopedic surgeon, infectious disease expert, rehabilitation specialist, nurse and pharmacist. These patients are often left bedridden for long periods, and hence a physical therapy consult is recommended for joint movement and muscle training. A dietary consult may help prevent muscle wasting, and the nurse should ensure that the patient has prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis and pressure ulcers. The pharmacist should check up on cultures and make sure that the patient is on the right antibiotics. After discharge, most patients need active physical therapy for months to regain joint motion and muscle strength.

**Outcomes**

There are no large randomized clinical trials on prosthetic joint infections and outcomes are based on small retrospective case series and case reports. The success of the different procedures varies from 0-100%, depending on the severity of the infection, time of treatment, patient co-morbidity and duration of infection. The difficulty in dealing with prosthetic joint infections is whether to remove all the hardware but this also leaves the patient with a disability. Use of spacers has been useful, but it is not the answer to all type of prosthetic joint infections. Overall, good results have been obtained with delayed exchange arthroplasty with success rates ranging from 40-80%. Unfortunately, the majority of patients do have some degree of pain, joint instability and limited use of the joint after an infection.
