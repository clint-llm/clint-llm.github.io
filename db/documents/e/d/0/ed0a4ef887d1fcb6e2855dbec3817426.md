A routine collaboration between health professionals who are directing the exercise stress tests and those who are responsible for directing the dipyridamole stress tests has the potential to reduce the burden on health resources and the patient. In circumstances where a patient begins an exercise stress test and cannot achieve the intensity to ensure the diagnostic sensitivity of the cardiac assessment (i.e., greater than 85% of the patientâ€™s age-predicted maximum heart rate), the data is often lost; and the patient will be required to return for a second stress test, most likely pharmacologically-based.

In summary, stress test administration, whether routine exercise or drug-induced, requires an interprofessional team approach, including physicians, specialists, specialty-trained nurses, and pharmacists, all collaborating across disciplines to achieve optimal patient results. [Level 5]
