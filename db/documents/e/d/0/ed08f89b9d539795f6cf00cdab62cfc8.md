Whenever a child is suspected of having a congenital vertical talus, a detailed history must be taken from the guardian, including prepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum.

Due to the vertical positioning of the talus and weakening of the spring ligament, a convexity over the plantar aspect of the foot develops, which ultimately results in a rocker-bottom appearance.

If this condition is left untreated, it may increase the rigidity and development of the adaptive changes in the tarsal bones. When a child starts weight-bearing, callosities develop around the talar head along the medial border of the foot.
