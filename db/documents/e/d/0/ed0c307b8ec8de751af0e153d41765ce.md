**Laboratory Evaluation**

- Complete blood count (CBC): Leukocytosis with left shift, leukopenia may also be present.

- Stool examination: Stool analysis shows fecal leukocytes and blood. Microscopic evidence of stool examination may show evidence of leukocytes in stool smear. Stool culture gives a better yield than a rectal swab culture.

- Liver function test: Mild elevation of bilirubin may be possible in severe disease.

- Renal function: Elevated BUN and creatinine may be present in dehydrated or very young and elderly patients.

- Hyponatremia: Usually due to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.

- Inflammatory markers: May be elevated such as ESR and CRP

- Blood culture: May be positive in complicated cases and more common in children than adults. Bacteremia is usually associated with an increased mortality rate.

- Stool alpha-1 antitrypsin: high during the acute phase of shigellosis and remains high in patients that failed medical therapy.

- ELISA and Polymerase chain reaction: May be required in a minority of patients. ELISA usually detects S. dysenteriae type-1 toxin in stool, and PCR may be used to identify the virulent genes of Shigella such as ipaH gene, virF gene, and virA gene.
