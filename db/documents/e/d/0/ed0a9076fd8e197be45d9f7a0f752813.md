As arteries that conduct blood flow from the pelvis to the lower extremities, the external iliac arteries do not terminate in capillary beds. Two branches of the external iliac artery are the inferior epigastric and deep circumflex iliac arteries. The inferior epigastric artery supplies the rectus abdominis muscle, whereas the deep circumflex artery supplies the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles. The deep circumflex iliac artery also supplies blood to the iliac fossa and internal oblique muscles.
