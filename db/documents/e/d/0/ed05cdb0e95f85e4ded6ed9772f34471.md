Young syndrome, also known as sinusitis-infertility syndrome, is a rare inherited syndrome similar to Kartagener syndrome. Individuals born with this disorder have normally functioning lungs but tend to produce thick, viscous mucus, which increases their risk of developing pulmonary infections. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Young syndrome and highlights the interprofessional team's role in the recognition and management of this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiology of Young syndrome.

- Outline the typical presentation for a patient with Young syndrome.
- Describe the recommended management of Young syndrome.

- Explain collaborative interprofessional team strategies to improve detection of Young syndrome and prevent complications in affected patients.
