Patients present with rapid and progressive symptoms over the course of a day to a week often reaching a peak in severity on 72 hours. Weakness will be partial or complete to one-half of the face, resulting in weakness of the eyebrows, forehead, and angle of the mouth. Patients may present with an inability to close the affected eyelid or lip on the affected side.

The key physical exam finding is a partial or complete weakness of the forehead. If forehead strength is preserved, a central cause should be investigated. Patients may also complain of a difference in taste, sensitivity to sound, and changes to tearing and salivation.
