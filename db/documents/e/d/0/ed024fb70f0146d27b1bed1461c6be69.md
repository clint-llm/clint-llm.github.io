Most patients who are at low-risk for the conventional atherosclerotic disease are underdiagnosed and possibly have lower rates of presentation; therefore, the true incidence of spontaneous coronary artery dissection is unknown. In the general population, spontaneous coronary artery dissection is the cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in 0.1% to 0.4% cases. It mainly affects young females, and it has been reported to account for nearly a quarter of ACS cases in women younger than 50 years old. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection is also increasingly reported to occur in older and postmenopausal women. Less than 10% to 15% cases occur in men.
