The 2019 FDA approval of esketamine for adults with treatment-resistant MDD means some people with coexisting SI may qualify for this treatment. Meanwhile, investigators are turning their focus towardsÂ determining whether ketamine will provide a measurable and clinically important reduction in SI. Alternative doses and routes of administration are also being examined. Most completed studies included a ketamine IV dose of 0.5 mg/kg administered over 40 minutes. Samples were drawn from individuals with treatment-resistant MDD who had varying SI severity. Fewer studies have examined the efficacy of ketamine administered by oral, IM, or intranasal inhalation.
