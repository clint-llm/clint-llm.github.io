There is an increased risk of low academic performance in children with learning disabilities that can affect their social and career trajectory. Negative self-concept, stemming from continued academic failure, can precipitate awkward interpersonal relationships and depression. Behavioral problems can manifest as well, as children with LDs demonstrate resistance to authoritative figures or demands. These complications can result in an aversive disposition towards school, leading to more frequent absenteeismÂ or truancy.
