Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) presents with postural headache and low cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The underlying cause is usually a CSF leak. In the majority of the cases, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will show diffuse meningeal enhancement. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of spontaneous intracranial hypotension and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.
- Describe the evaluation of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.
- Outline the treatment options available for spontaneous intracranial hypotension.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance spontaneous intracranial hypotension and improve outcomes.
