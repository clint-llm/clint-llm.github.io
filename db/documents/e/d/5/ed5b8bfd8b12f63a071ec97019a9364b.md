Because of the similar presentation to multiple other infections, diagnosis is often delayed or difficult. Patients with neurologic symptoms are evaluated with neuroimaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Inflammatory changes may be seen in the thalamus or basal ganglia but are nonspecific and may be found with encephalitis due to many causes. A lumbar puncture may show elevated opening pressure, protein, and cell count with a lymphocytic predominance. These findings are also non-specific and common in many other forms of viral or inflammatory meningitis and encephalitis.

Isolation of the virus from serum or CSF is difficult. In infected patients, IgG antibody is generally detectable within 1 to 3 weeks after infection and peaks at 1 to 2 months. IgG indicates exposure to the virus and, depending on the titer, suggests recent infection. The presence of IgM antibody correlates with acute infection and can be detected within 1 to 3 weeks from the onset of symptoms. The test for Western equine encephalitis cross-reacts with St. Louis encephalitis virus, making distinguishing between the two infections difficult.
