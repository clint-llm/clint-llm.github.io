Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) is far more common than posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION).

Anterior ischemic is further divided into arteritic and non-arteritic.

Arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AAION): It occurs in patients age more than 70 years. It is caused by inflammatory and thrombotic occlusion of short posterior ciliary arteries. It is associated with systemic vasculitis, giant cell arteritis (GCA) being the most common cause.

Nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION): The cause of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is uncertain. The variance in the anatomical structure i.e., structural crowding of the optic disc, is a major causative factor so far discussed. This type of disc is commonly mentioned as "disc at risk." It is believed that the blood supply of such nerves is tenuous, and there is impaired autoregulation in the presence of any stress factor leading to capillary filling pressure falling below a critical level leading to damage. The associated risk factors include the following:

- Systemic hypertension

- Diabetes mellitus

- Hyperlipidemia

- Hypercoagulable disorders

- Sleep apnea

- Nocturnal hypotension

- Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (sildenafil)

- Anemia

- Smoking

- Migraine

- Optic nerve head drusen

Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION): It is far much less common than anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. It mainly occurs under three circumstances:

- Perioperative mostly in spinal, cardiac, head, and neck procedures. In the perioperative period, substantial blood loss, prolonged anesthesia time, and hypotension are major reasons leading to compromise in the blood supply of the optic nerve.

- Arteritic, most commonly in giant cell arteritis.

- Nonarteritic in which risk factors are similar to NAION.
