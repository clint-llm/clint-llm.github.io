Peripheral blood smear findings can be different based on the stage of the disease. In pre-polycythemia and overt polycythemia, normochromic and normocytic red blood cells are seen. A hypochromic and microcytic pattern can accompany concomitant iron deficiency. Platelets and white blood cells can also be elevated. Leukocytosis, predominantly with neutrophils, can be seen without blast activity. Myelofibrosis develops with teardrop red blood cells, poikilocytosis, and circulating nucleated red cells in the post-polycythemic stage.

Bone marrow sampling typically shows hypercellularity with panproliferation. Again, histopathology is dependent on the stage of the disease. Erythrocytosis is seen with pre-polycythemia, increased red cell mass in overt polycythemia, and increased reticulin deposition in post-polycythemia with fibrosis, ineffective production, and extramedullary hematopoiesis.
