Closure of the optic fissure is paramount to proper morphogenesis of many structures of the eye, and extensive cellular remodeling and patterning are required for the edges of this double-wall of neural tissue to fuse effectively. Key transcription factors, including Pax2, Pax5, Vax2, Tbx2, Tbx3, Tbx5, Vsx2, and Mitf, are essential for proper closure of the fissure. Their specific mechanisms in the development and closure of the optic fissure appear below.

**Differentiation**

The transcription factor Pax6 is the key gene involved in eye development. Preceding morphogenesis of the eye, Pax6 is expressed at the anterior neural ridge of the neural plate before neurulation begins and is the primary eye field at this stage. Sonic hedgehog causes division of the central eye field into two optic primordia, upregulating Pax2 in the distal optic vesicle at its juncture with the surface ectoderm. Sonic Hedgehog promotes organized growth and involution of the optic cup by restricting the expression of Pax6 to the optic cup and upregulating Pax2 in the optic stalk and optic fissure margins. In this way, the morphogenic pathways of the optic cup and the optic nerve are distinctive.Â **Heterozygous mutations in Pax2, Pax6, and SHH are known to cause coloboma.**

As the optic cup develops from the bi-layer outpouching of neuroectoderm, it has several unique interactions with the adjacent tissues that cause specialized differentiation. The fibroblast growth factor of the surface ectoderm at the lens placode promotes inward differentiation of the neural retina. This is accomplished via FGF-induced downregulation of Mitf, allowing Vsx2 expression and creating a separation between the neural retina and the retinal pigmented epithelium at the optic fissure margin. Transforming growth factor B of the surrounding mesenchyme promotes outward differentiation of the pigmented layer of the retina, a process requiring WNT-B-Catenin signaling. The search clear delineation in retinal layers at this margin is key to the full fusion of the optic fissure. Failure of signaling processes, particularly mutation of WNT receptor gene FZD5, has been implicated in coloboma.

**Invagination**

As the layers of the optic vesicle differentiate into the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium, invagination occurs via another important signaling mechanism. To involute in the formation of the optic cup and fissure, the neuroectodermal cells of the inner layer of the optic vesicle need to undergo a conformational shape change. This change is brought about by the contraction of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton, which is regulated by the cytoplasmic actin genes ACTG1 and ACTB. Mutations of these genes are implicated in the development of coloboma, as seen in Baraitser-Winter syndrome.

**Closure**

Once the invagination of the optic cup and fissure is complete, the next step is the closure of the optic fissure. This process begins at the mid-point of the fissure and proceeds distally and proximally. Studies suggest that as the margins of the fissure come into apposition, the outer layer fuses first, followed by the inner layer. The basement membranes from opposing sides of the fissure margins undergo breakdown, possibly via phagosome-mediated destruction. Studies suggest that the margins of both layers extend cytoplasmic protrusions that play a role in closure. Cadherin-mediated adherens junctions additionally contribute to the successful fusion of retinal layers. Research has shown that dysregulated breakdown at the fissure margins is involved in the pathogenesis of coloboma. CHARGE syndrome, in particular, is caused by mutations in the CHD7 gene, resulting in inappropriate expression of the pro-apoptotic gene p53, resulting in exaggerated apoptosis at the optic fissure and inadequate closure.
