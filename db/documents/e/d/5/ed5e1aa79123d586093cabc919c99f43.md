A diagnosis of polyradiculopathy can be made on purely clinical grounds in most cases; however, further testing should be conducted to exclude other neurologic conditions and identify the etiologic cause of the radiculopathy.

**Lumbar Puncture**

Cytomegalovirus is the third most common cause of all neurologic complications associated with HIV but the most common cause of polyradiculopathy.

- Pleocytosis with polymorphonuclear leucocyte predominance (usually > 60% of normal CSF count)

- Hypoglycorrhachia with CSF glucose < 40 mg/dl or CSF to serum glucose ratio of less than or equal to 0.5

- Increased protein levels

- Absent neoplastic cells

CSF testing for CMV will be positive in 50% of the cases, and quantitative PCR assay is the preferred method for viral detection.

**Electrodiagnostic Testing**

Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies are the most useful test for these patients. A needle EMG can detect physiologic abnormalities consistent with radiculopathy and determine the severity of the injury in these patients. It can help exclude other neurologic complications of HIV and may be able to determine the duration of the disease.

In patients with predominant dorsal root involvement, however, the needle EMG has limited sensitivity. EMG may reveal multifocality, asymmetry, radicular involvement, chronicity, neuromuscular junction, and muscle disease.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and CT Myelography**

MRI readily detects structural pathology responsible for polyradiculopathy. Abnormal contrast enhancement of the nerve roots is frequently seen.

**Other Testing**

Depending on the patient history and local endemicity, CSF testing for Z-N staining/ADA activity/CSF culture for mycobacteria, CSF VDRL, HIV RNA in CSF, visualization of Cryptococcus in CSF or IgG in blood for Toxoplasma or BM biopsy for lymphoma could be done to rule out other etiologies.

Unlike GBS in HIV-negative patients, CSF in HIV-positive patients shows WBC pleocytosis, but no albumin-cytological dissociation is seen.
