Risk factors for bone loss and secondary osteoporosis need to be discussed with each individual patient diagnosed with any of the diseases that are included in the list of secondary causes of osteoporosis. Awareness is the first step in the right direction of prevention, timely diagnosis, and ultimately efficient treatment of osteoporosis. Primary care physicians should encourage patients on better education about any underline disease and its complications, including the possibility of secondary osteoporosis.

When osteoporosis is diagnosed, extra effort must be applied in explaining how the patients can help themselves eliminate risk factors for further bone loss as well as the potential treatment choices and medications.
