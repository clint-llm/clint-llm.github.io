Radiation therapy of the pelvis is used to treat a variety of cancers, for example, ovarian, uterine, cervical, prostate, bladder, and rectal cancers. Radiation damage to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can occur, yet the treatment is beneficial in fightingÂ cancer. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy combats this otherwise difficult-to-treat complication of radiation therapy.
