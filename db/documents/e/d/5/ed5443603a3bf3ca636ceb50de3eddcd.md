The elbow is a hinge joint comprised of bony and ligamentous stabilizers. Specifically, the elbow contains two collateral ligaments: the medial collateral ligament (MCL, also known as ulnar collateral ligament, or UCL) and the lateral collateral ligament (LCL). Each of these two ligaments is made up of smaller ligamentous portions. These structures provide stability for the elbow joint and constant tension through elbow motion. The constant tension and torque experienced by these ligaments leave them prone to injury, especially the MCL.
