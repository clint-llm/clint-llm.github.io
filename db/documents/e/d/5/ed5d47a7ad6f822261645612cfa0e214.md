The most common complication following appendectomy is surgical site infection, including wound infections and intraabdominal abscesses. Surgical site infections are relatively rare in cases of uncomplicated appendicitis but may occur in up to 10% of patients with a perforated appendix.

**Wound Infection**

Superficial wound infections occur within the 30 days following an appendectomy and involve the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Diagnosis is based primarily on history and physical examination. Examination findings consistent with superficial wound infection include peri-incisional pain, swelling, and erythema. The diagnosis is supported by purulent drainage from the incision, a positive wound culture, or the need to open a surgical incision.

Deep wound infections occur in the 30 to 90 days following an appendectomy and include the muscles and fascia deep to the subcutaneous tissue. Again, a thorough medical history and physical examination should be performed. Examination findings consistent with a deep wound infection include per-incisional pain, tenderness, and systemic findings such as fever. The diagnosis is supported by purulent drainage from the incision site, a positive wound culture, or wound dehiscence.

Preoperative antibiotics, appropriate wound scrubbing, specific intraoperative retractors, and intraoperative irrigation may be used to minimize the risk of postoperative wound infections. There is no difference in the rate of wound infection between primary and delayed primary incision closure.

Compared to open appendectomy, laparoscopic appendectomy is associated with a lower risk of incision site infection but a higher risk of intra-abdominal and pelvic infection.

**Pelvic Abscess**

Approximately 9.4% of patients who undergo appendectomy for complicated appendicitis will develop a postoperative pelvic abscess. Several measures have been recommended to reduce the risk of postoperative pelvic abscesses, including intraoperative peritoneal irrigation. Outcomes of the measures conflict, and no intervention has been proven more effective than another.

**Stump Appendicitis**

Stump appendicitis, a form of recurrent appendicitis, may occur when an inadequate amount of appendiceal tissue is resected, and a long stump is left behind.

**Mortality**

The mortality associated with appendectomy is low; it is considered a relatively safe procedure. Morbidity and mortality after appendiceal perforation are 5.1 per 1000. However, the mortality rate can differ depending on the geographic location, as evidenced by more developed countries having a rate of 0.09% to 0.24% and developing countries having a rate of 1% to 4%.
