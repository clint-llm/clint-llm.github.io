High-altitude pulmonary edema is classically associated with a rapid ascent that does not allow time to acclimatize to altitude—individual susceptibility, environmental factors, and underlying medical comorbidities all influence one’s likelihood of developing HAPE.

HAPE is more common in males and those who use alcohol, sleeping pills, or other substances that cause respiratory depression. Individuals with a history of HAPE are at an increased susceptibility in the future, with recurrence rates up to 60% in some studies.

A rapid rate of ascent is a strong predisposing factor in the development of HAPE. This is noted both in individuals who arrive abruptly at a high altitude, such as air travel to a high-altitude resort, as well as those who reach altitude via trekking. Higher altitudes, colder environments, and destinations requiring a higher degree of physical exertion all correlate with a higher incidence of developing HAPE.

Underlying medical conditions also predispose individuals to the development of HAPE. High-risk conditions include pulmonary hypertension, restrictive/obstructive lung disease, and congenital cardiac abnormalities.

Although not fully understood, genetics play a role in one’s susceptibility to the development of HAPE. Patients at risk of HAPE have reduced nitric oxide and increased endothelin during periods of hypoxia when compared to less sensitive counterparts.
