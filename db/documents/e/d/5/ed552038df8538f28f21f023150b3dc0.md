**Tooth Anatomy and Structure**

The anatomy of the tooth consists of the crown of the tooth which is connected to the root of the tooth which extends into the gum and jaw. The outer most covering of the tooth, the enamel overlays the softer dentine. The nerves and vasculature tunnel through the tooth root canal to the innermost hollow area of the tooth called the pulp canal which houses nerves and vasculature that supply the tooth.

**Oral Cavity Flora**

The oral cavity is host to many bacteria, mainly gram-negative and facultative anaerobes. These bacteria have varying distribution in the oral cavity; in particular, Streptococcus mitisÂ was found to be most typically found on tooth surfaces (Jorn et al. 2005). This is not always the causative organism in a dental abscess because other oral bacterial species can become introduced into the tooth by other means including but not limited to trauma.
