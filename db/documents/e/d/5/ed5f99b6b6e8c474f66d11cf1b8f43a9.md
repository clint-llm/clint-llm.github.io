Vitamin B6 is water-soluble. B6 is one of three water-soluble vitamins that can have toxicity at excessive doses, the others being Niacin (Vitamin B2) and Ascorbic acid (Vitamin C).

It is rare to develop B6 toxicity for an individual on ordinary food diets without supplementation. Excessive supplementation for chronic periods (months to greater than a year) has resulted in sensory neuropathies and movement disorders. Consumption of Vitamin B6 more than 100 mg/dl in adults is required to cause toxicity in an individual. The severity of symptoms is dose-dependent. Additional clinical findings of toxicity may include photosensitivity, GI symptoms such as nausea and heartburn, as well as painful dermatological eruptions. These symptoms resolve for the most part over time with the elimination of the B6 supplement. The B6 toxicity-induced sensory polyneuropathy causes decreased touch, temperature, and vibration sensation and resulted in poor coordination. Increased intakes from supplements may interact with the action of drugs, including levodopa, phenobarbital, and phenytoin.

In toxicology, Vitamin B6 is clinically important in the treatment of Isoniazid (INH), ethylene glycol, and Gyromitrin (toxic mushroom) poisoning.Â  Additionally, it is used preventatively during isoniazid (INH) therapy of tuberculosis to prevent INH-induced polyneuropathy.
