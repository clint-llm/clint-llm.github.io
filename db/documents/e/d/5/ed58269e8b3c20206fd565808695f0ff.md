Complications from gonorrhea result in substantial morbidity and socioeconomic consequences. If gonorrhea infections are not detected or appropriately treated, they can induce serious complications with reproductive health complications in women, including pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic pelvic pain, infertility, first-trimester abortion, and ectopic pregnancy.

Complications specific to males include epididymitis, prostatitis, and proctitis.

The development of N. gonorrhoeae with antimicrobial resistance is a complication that has societal implications. Generally, the development of antimicrobial resistance corresponds to local, regional, and national antibiotic use; populations in countries such as Holland with lower utilization of cephalosporins, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones have a lower incidence of gonococcal resistance than high antibiotic consumption nations.
