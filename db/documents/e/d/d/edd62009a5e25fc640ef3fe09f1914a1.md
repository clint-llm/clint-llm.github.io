Patients with SCI above C3 are the most obvious candidates as their phrenic nerve is intact and can be easily stimulated. Their phrenic nerve can be stimulated at either the neck, the thorax, or the diaphragm. In comparison, patients with mid-cervical SCI cannot be stimulated at the neck or thorax levels as their phrenic nerve is not functional. An advanced technique of stimulating the nerve endings at the insertion of the diaphragm has shown promising results (direct diaphragmatic pacing stimulation).

Other indications include disorders like congenital central alveolar hypoventilation, Arnold-Chiari malformations, basilar meningitis, brainstem tumors, cerebrovascular accidents, Pompe disease, syringomyelia, and meningomyelocele.
