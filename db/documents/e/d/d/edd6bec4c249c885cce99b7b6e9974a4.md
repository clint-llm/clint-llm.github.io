Although the virus may be found in a wide geographic area ranging from Canada to Argentina, most cases occur in the United States. Periodic outbreaks and epidemics have occurred in the Mississippi River valley and along the Gulf Coast, but sporadic cases are reported throughout the United States in the Caribbean, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. In temperate areas, transmission occurs primarily during the late summer and early fall, but in warmer climates, transmission occurs year-round. The biggest epidemic of St. Louis encephalitis occurred in 1975 with nearly 2000 cases reported, primarily in the central states within the Ohio-Mississippi River basin. The annual number of annual reported cases fluctuates dramatically due to periodic epidemics. Since most cases are asymptomatic and testing is not widely available, reporting data is limited.
