The common peroneal nerve often referred to as the common fibular nerve, is a major nerve that innervates the lower extremity. It is one of the two major branches off the sciatic nerve and receives fibers from the posterior divisions of L4 through S2 nerve roots.

The superficial peroneal nerve innervates the lateral compartment of the leg, and the deep peroneal nerve innervates the anterior compartment of the leg and the dorsum of the foot.

- Motor

- Lateral compartment

- Peroneus longus
- Peroneus brevis

- Sensory

- Anterolateral leg

The deep peroneal nerve also providesÂ both motor and sensory innervation in the leg. Deep peroneal nerve innervation is as follows:

- Motor

- Anterior compartment

- Tibialis anterior
- Extensor hallucis longus
- Extensor digitorum longus
- Peroneus tertius

- Sensory

- First dorsal webspace

The following tests can quickly assess the common peroneal nerve and its respective branches for both motor and sensory functions:

- Sensory

- Common peroneal nerve: lateral aspect of the leg just distal to the knee
- Superficial peroneal nerve: the anterolateral distal third of the leg and the majority of the dorsum of the foot (except the first webspace)
- Deep peroneal nerve: first dorsal webspace

- Motor

- Common peroneal nerve: none
- Superficial peroneal nerve: eversion of the foot
- Deep peroneal nerve: dorsiflexion of the foot and great toe extension

This paper will focus on peroneal nerve injuries, including etiologies, epidemiology, history, and physical exam findings, as well as diagnosis and treatment.
