Cryptococcal meningitis usually presents as a subacute meningoencephalitis. The patient commonly presents with neurological symptoms such as a headache, altered mental status, and other signs and symptoms include lethargy along with fever, stiff neck (both associated with an aggressive inflammatory response), nausea and vomiting. Some patients who are HIV positive may have minimal or nonspecific symptoms at presentation.

The duration of symptoms from onset to a presentation is usually 1 to 2 weeks in HIV cases and 6 to 12 weeks in non-HIV cases.

Visual symptoms include diplopia and photophobia at the onset, and reduced acuity later in the disease (due to high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure or compression of the optic nerve and tracts). Other findings include hearing defects, ataxia, aphasia, seizures, and chorea.

Although C. neoformans enters the body through the lungs, the central nervous system (CNS) is the main site of evident clinical infection.
