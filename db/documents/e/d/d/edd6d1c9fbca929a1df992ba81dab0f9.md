We should refer to clinical immunologists in patients with a high index of suspicion of CVID with low immunoglobulin levels for primary care physicians.

Medical treatment for patients with common variable immunodeficiency are illustrated below:

- Intravenous or subcutaneous immune globulin replacement therapy is indicated in individuals with markedly low immunoglobulin levels and does not respond to vaccines (both protein and polysaccharides). It can reduce the number of infections hence decreases antibiotic use and hospitalizations.

- Prophylactic antibiotic with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or macrolides is necessary for patients with chronic lung disease to prevent recurrent infections that could further damage the lungs.

- Individualized treatments for each disease include immunosuppressants for autoimmune conditions, antibiotics for active infections, nutritional supportÂ (including total parenteral nutrition) for severe enteropathy, and colitis.

Monitoring disease progression with pulmonary function testing and a lung CT scan every one to two years after therapeutic interventions have been started.
