Abulia is supposed to occur because of a malfunction of the brain’s dopamine-dependent circuitry. Lesions anywhere in the "centro-medial core" of brain frontal-subcortical circuitry, from frontal lobes to the brainstem, may produce this condition.

Diaschisis is the neurological phenomenon in which damage in one part of the brain results in functional impairment in a remote but interconnected location. This can be the mechanism behind the appearance of abulia in basal ganglia and thalamic lesions because of the complex frontal-basal ganglia-thalamic circuits.

The following structural lesions have been attributed as factors in the etiology of abulia:

- Anterior cingulate cortex:

- Unilateral anterior cerebral artery lesions produce transient abulia often associated with contralateral motor neglect because of damage to the medial premotor area.

- Bilateral lesions in the medial frontal lobes, basal ganglia, supplementary motor areas, caudate nuclei, and cingulate gyri lead to persistent abulia.

- Frontal convexity damage

- Focal subcortical lesions of the caudate nucleus, anterior thalamus, globus pallidus, internal capsule, and midbrain

- Disconnections of limbic tracts projecting from the anterior thalamus to the cingulate

- Embolism occurring in the subthalamic-thalamic penetrating artery of Percheron leading to bilateral meso-diencephalon infarct may damage the medial thalamus and upper mesencephalon. This can lead to abulia.

- Bilateral lesions at or rostral to the meso-diencephalic junction or bilateral damage to the frontal lobes can lead to abulia major.

- Pressure on the bilateral frontal periventricular white matter can cause abulia in hydrocephalus.
