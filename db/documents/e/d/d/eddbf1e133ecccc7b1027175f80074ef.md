Hypercalciuria occurs in 5% to 10% of the adult population and is found in about one-third of all calcium stone formers. Close relatives of hypercalciuric patients tend to have an increased rate of hypercalciuria themselves.  Up to 40% of the first and second-degree relatives of hypercalciuric recurrent stone formers will also have hypercalciuria.

There are more than 30 million kidney stone patients and 1.2 million new kidney stone cases every year in the United States with one-third of them demonstrating hypercalciuria when tested.

Post menopausal women with osteoporosis and no history of kidney stones have a 20% chance of having hypercalciuria.

In children, both the incidence and prevalence of urolithiasis is increasing, particularly over the last 10 to 15 years. Hypercalciuria and hypocitraturia are the most commonly found metabolic problems identified in pediatric stone formers. The most common stone composition in children is calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate, but there is no apparent association between nephrolithiasis and obesity in the pediatric age group while there is such a linkage in adult stone formers. There also appears to be a higher incidence of hypercalciuria (and hyperuricosuria) in children with significant vesicoureteral reflux compared to controls.
