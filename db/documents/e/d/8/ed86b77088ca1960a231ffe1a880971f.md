# Continuing Education Activity

Vasomotor rhinitis affects millions of Americans and costs billions of dollars annually in healthcare costs. Vasomotor rhinitis is the most common form of nonallergic rhinitis and is a diagnosis of exclusion. Avoidance of triggers combined with topical nasal medications is the foundation of treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of vasomotor rhinitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of vasomotor rhinitis.
- Review the evaluation of vasomotor rhinitis.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for vasomotor rhinitis.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to enhance the care of patients with vasomotor rhinitis and improve outcomes.

# Introduction

Nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) describes a syndrome of chronic symptoms of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea, unrelated to a specific allergen. Nonallergic rhinitis can subdivide into numerous different subtypes with vasomotor rhinitis (VMR) being the most common type. Vasomotor rhinitis is a term often used to describe rhinitis symptoms associated with nonallergic, noninfectious triggers with no clear etiology after the conclusion of an exhaustive search for a diagnosis. The pathophysiology of nonallergic rhinitis is complex, with still much to be discovered. It is partly due to an imbalance between parasympathetic and sympathetic inputs on the nasal mucosa.

# Etiology

Although the etiology of vasomotor rhinitis is not well understood, it is thought to be associated with the dysregulation of sympathetic, parasympathetic, and nociceptive nerves innervating the nasal mucosa.

# Epidemiology

Rhinitis, whether allergic or nonallergic, affects roughly 20% of the population in industrialized countries.

# History and Physical

Vasomotor rhinitis is clinically diagnosed. An exhaustive history, complete head and neck examination, and diagnostic testing will rule out infections, allergic, and inflammatory causes.

# Evaluation

The workup for vasomotor rhinitis should include skin testing and/or serum-specific IgE antibodies. As a diagnosis of exclusion, vasomotor rhinitis will typically have a negative skin test and serum antibodies for relevant allergens. Nasal cytology can provide information about cell types composing the mucosa and helps to identify the presence of inflammatory markers. Scrapings from the inferior turbinate, nasal lavage, or nose blowing can provide epithelial cells for analysis. The presence of 5 to 25 eosinophils in high-powered fields is compatible with the diagnosis of nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES), a subset of nonallergic rhinitis.

Distinguishing vasomotor rhinitis from allergic rhinitis can be challenging. Symptomatology and physical exam findings are often very similar. Allergic rhinitis is a nasal disorder associated with an allergen exposure that induces an IgE-mediated inflammatory response. The timing of symptoms provides clues into differentiating between non-allergic rhinitis and allergic rhinitis. Seasonal peaks of pollen, places with pet dander and/or mold spores, geographical relocation leading to symptoms can point to a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. The patient’s history provides essential information for diagnosis. Allergy testing is a clinically useful tool to identify a specific allergen and treat the condition. Allergy testing alone can be nonspecific, but in conjunction with a thorough history and physical exam is valuable in distinguishing between vasomotor rhinitis and allergic rhinitis.

A detailed history will often elucidate an infectious process from an allergic or nonallergic one. Infectious rhinitis also presents with similar symptomatology to nonallergic rhinitis: nasal purulence, postnasal drip, facial pressure and pain, fever, sore throat, etc. The three cardinal symptoms of infectious rhinitis include purulent nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, and facial pressure, and are often present for ten days or longer. A fever may or may not be present depending on the acuity of the infection, and is only 50% sensitive and specific.

# Treatment / Management

Upon determining a diagnosis of vasomotor rhinitis, educating the patient on avoiding environmental triggers is critical.

A stepwise pharmacologic approach is often implemented, with the initial intervention targeted toward the predominant symptom.

Anticholinergic medications can provide relief from unrelenting rhinorrhea. However, the oral preparations have disturbing systemic side effects such as blurred vision, dry mouth, and thickened secretions. A topical anticholinergic like ipratropium bromide is the first choice for rhinorrhea. Two separate randomized controlled trials demonstrated the effectiveness of ipratropium bromide in controlling rhinorrhea.

Oral antihistamines have a limited role in vasomotor rhinitis, with no specific formulation approved. They tend only to benefit those patients with a sneezing and itching component. Topical antihistamines such as azelastine have approval for both allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. Azelastine is helpful in patients with rhinorrhea and nasal congestion. Azelastine is an H1-receptor antagonist. It also inhibits the synthesis of leukotrienes, kinins, cytokines, and adhesion molecule expression, while providing anti-inflammatory effects unrelated to histamine.

Sympathomimetic medications, specifically topical decongestants, can provide short-term symptomatic relief. Topical decongestants work primarily by stimulating alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenoreceptors on the vasculature of the nasal mucosa. This action leads to vasoconstriction, decreased blood flow, and subsequently decreased congestion and rhinorrhea of the nasal cavity. To date, no study has determined the effectiveness of topical decongestants on chronic non-allergic rhinitis. Long-term use of topical decongestants can lead to rebound vasodilation and increased congestion. This condition is termed rhinitis medicamentosa, a form of drug-induced rhinitis. By limiting the use of nasal decongestants to five days and not exceeding the recommended dosing, rhinitis medicamentosa and addiction are avoidable.

Botulinum toxin has also demonstrated a potential role in the treatment of vasomotor rhinitis through its anticholinergic effects.

When medical management alone does not adequately control vasomotor rhinitis symptoms, surgical interventions may be employed. Mucosal sparing inferior turbinate reduction surgery improves obstruction symptoms and acts synergistically with medical therapies.

The therapeutic transection of the vidian nerve is a well-known surgical option for vasomotor rhinitis. The technique aims to disrupt the autonomic nerve supply of the nasal cavity, thus decreasing nasal secretions.

Treating nonallergic rhinitis in pregnancy and the pediatric population presents its own challenges. Management should center around conservative therapy first. Nasal saline irrigations have essentially no risk and may be helpful. If medications are necessary, several options exist. Diphenhydramine may be an option when needed, although with caution in children less than two and in the first trimester of pregnancy. Ipratropium bromide carries a category B rating and is safe in children as young as six. As discussed above, budesonide is the only topical nasal steroid with a category B rating. Fluticasone is safe to use in patients as young as four years of age. Topical decongestants can be used on a limited basis in children as young as 6. Oxymetazoline is the decongestant of choice in both pregnancy and pediatric populations.

# Differential Diagnosis

Primary and secondary causes of nonallergic rhinitis exist. Primary causes include eight subtypes: drug-induced rhinitis; gustatory rhinitis; hormonal induced rhinitis; nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome; senile rhinitis; atrophic rhinitis; cerebral spinal fluid leak; and idiopathic nonallergic rhinitis.

Drug-induced rhinitis is often further divided into three categories: neurogenic, inflammatory, and idiopathic. Numerous medications list rhinitis as a side effect. The most notable offenders are antihypertensive medications, erectile dysfunction medications, and some psychiatric medications. Overuse of topical decongestants leads to rhinitis medicamentosa by a different mechanism. Systemic anti-hypertensive drugs cause rhinitis through neurogenic mechanisms. They induce a parasympathetic dominance of the nasal mucosa by inhibiting norepinephrine release, which leads to congestion and rhinorrhea.

Hormone-induced rhinitis is associated with nasal congestion secondary to elevated estrogen and progesterone. Up to 65% of women self-report nasal congestion at some time during their pregnancy.

Occupational rhinitis (OR) is a nasal irritation and inflammation that occurs from workplace exposures. Causes of rhinitis in the workplace can classify as either allergic, irritant, or a combination. Occupational rhinitis causes often get subdivided into high molecular weight compounds such as plant or animal-derived proteins and low molecular weight compounds, which are often hapten associated. Certain occupations are at an increased risk: bakers, livestock breeders, industry workers, veterinarians, etc.

# Prognosis

Nonallergic rhinitis is a persistent condition that is usually present lifelong. One study by Rondon and colleagues,

# Complications

Chronic vasomotor rhinitis symptoms often interfere with work performance and school attendance due to loss of productivity and frequent doctor visits. Chronic nonallergic rhinitis places considerable physical and economic burdens on sufferers. In a survey of rhinitis patients, 25% endorsed limiting their choice of occupation or place of residence to reduce rhinitis symptoms.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Patient education is critical in managing vasomotor rhinitis. Patients with known environmental, non-immunologic, and irritant triggers should be reminded to avoid exposure to these offending agents. Avoidance of irritating stimuli is the mainstay of treatment. Avoidance measures and medical therapy are often enough to decrease most of the symptomatology and mucosal disease associated with nonallergic rhinitis. If stimuli are unavoidable, educating the patient on pretreating with topical nasal steroids or histamines can limit symptoms.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Vasomotor rhinitis is a diagnosis of exclusion after performing an exhaustive investigation into a patient’s history. Vasomotor rhinitis is the most commonly diagnosed nonallergic rhinitis, not because of high prevalence, but often from healthcare professionals resorting to diagnosis without performing an extensive workup. Allergic rhinitis and nonallergic rhinitis have very similar symptomatology, such as congestion, rhinorrhea, facial pressure, and headache. They are often differentiated by whether an immunoglobulin E (IgE) response assessment is positive. However, not all allergic rhinitis patients are affected by an IgE inflammatory process. Skin and serum allergy tests are often inadequate in their ability to describe local allergic rhinitis.

Clinicians are almost always involved in the care of patients with allergic and nonallergic rhinitis. Whether it is an allergist, otolaryngologist, and/or primary clinician, rhinitis is very common with most providers encountering the disease in their practice. When the diagnosis becomes more complex, consultation with a rhinologist or specialist may be warranted. As will all aspects of healthcare, interprofessional coordination is critical for the effective management of patients with nonallergic and allergic rhinitis. The laboratory technicians collect serum samples for IgE testing and analyze the results. The allergy technicians perform the appropriate allergen skin testing and interpret results. The nurses are vital members of the interprofessional group as they monitor the patient's vital signs, review patients’ medications, assess therapeutic effectiveness, and triage symptom severity. The pharmacists ensure proper dosing for intranasal steroids and histamines and other medical management of rhinitis while screening for interactions amongst medications. Pharmacists can also discuss alternative agents with the prescriber in the event of inadequate therapeutic response or adverse events. The radiologists also play a vital role in analyzing nasal anatomic obstructions on imaging. As with any condition, an interprofessional team approach to diagnosis and management ensures the best potential for positive results for the patient. [Level 5]

Patients with negative systemic allergy assessments and negative imaging are often categorized into a nonallergic rhinitis subtype but have a clinical picture congruent with local allergic rhinitis. A recent cross-sectional study was performed to assess the clinical characteristics of patients with nonallergic rhinitis. Older patients who denied a history of asthma and lacked an inhalant allergy trigger were more likely to have true nonallergic rhinitis. Environmental triggers were not considered a distinguishing feature between local allergic rhinitis and nonallergic rhinitis. The results of this research study may help guide differentiation between truly nonallergic etiologies and those with falsely negative systemic allergy testing. [Level 4]
