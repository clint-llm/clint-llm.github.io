Uterine fibroids are the most common tumor of the reproductive tract, and their presence has a significant impact on health care delivery and costs worldwide. All obstetricians and gynecologists are trained in the management of fibroids. However, skills and expertise, especially within surgical management, can vary significantly across providers.  Depending on the patients’ range of symptoms and goals of care, management strategies are typically decided upon through shared decision-making between the patient and the provider. Symptomatic patients desiring pregnancy should be made aware of their fertility potential before selecting a management option that may significantly delay their time to conception. Gynecologists should consider consulting a fertility specialist to assist in counseling, especially in patients >35 years old.

Multiple other health professionals are needed to coordinate care to improve patient safety, satisfaction, and overall outcomes. For example, when medical management of symptomatic fibroids is adopted, care coordination between the physician, nursing staff, and pharmacists helps to ensure the patient understands expectations for treatment, how to self-administer the medication, potential side effects, and when to follow up to assess the medication’s effect. When a patient prefers a more aggressive form of therapy, but either does not want surgery or is not an ideal surgical candidate due to medical comorbidities, calling on colleagues in Interventional Radiology to assist in treatment may be the best option for specific patients. Follow-up visits to assess symptom improvement should be a shared responsibility between the interventional radiologist and gynecologist.

Lastly, when surgical management is deemed most appropriate for a specific patient, a massive effort of patient care coordination between multiple providers is required to ensure safe transitions between the preoperative, intra-operative, and postoperative phases of care. For some patients, preoperative medical clearance from their Primary Care Provider may be indicated before surgery. For example, patients with chronic blood loss anemia from heavy menstrual bleeding may benefit from hematology consultation for preoperative optimization.

All potential medical issues must be communicated to the anesthesiologist involved prior to surgery. Communication between the office and surgical center or hospital operating room is of utmost importance to ensure the appropriate equipment and staffing is available to perform the surgery. Additionally, many health systems have adopted Early Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols to decrease the length of hospital stays and improve patient outcomes. If an ERAS protocol is utilized, it is crucial for the outpatient nurses to relay the preoperative preparation steps to the patient. The surgeon should communicate the need for such a protocol to inpatient nurses to ensure that the remainder of the protocol is carried out. As such, a coordinated effort amongst health professionals at all levels is necessary to provide the optimum level of patient care and promote patient safety.
