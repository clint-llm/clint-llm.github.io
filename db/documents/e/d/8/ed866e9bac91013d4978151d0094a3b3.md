The oral cavity harbors a diverse microbial flora that under normal conditions resides in homeostasis. The imbalance of this flora or the colonization with new microorganisms from a viral, fungal, or bacterial origin can infect the oral cavity and its mucosa.

Primary bacterial infections of the oral mucosa seldom arise because of the oral epithelium's protective role over the underlying tissues, the saliva's antibacterial characteristics, and the immune responses of the phagocytes.

This article will discuss the buccal aspects of the most common bacterial infections with oral mucosa involvement, including sexually transmitted diseases: syphilis and gonorrhea; a granulomatous disease: tuberculosis; and a condition most commonly affecting young children: scarlet fever.
