Here are some important points

- Holoprosencephaly occurs due to incomplete midline cleavage of the forebrain(prosencephalon) and includes a wide spectrum of intracranial and craniofacial midline defects.

- The etiology of holoprosencephaly could be genetic or sporadic. Genetic causes can be further classified into syndromic and nonsyndromic causes.

- The severity of the craniofacial defects often correlates with the degree of the intracranial anomaly.

- A diagnosis can also be established prenatally using a USG in the first trimester and MRI in the third trimester.

- An MRI is used for a definitive diagnosis of holoprosencephaly. Depending on the clinical and MRI findings, HPE can be classified into alobar, semi-lobar, lobar, and middle intrahemispheric variant.

- Most patients with holoprosencephaly have either associated seizures, hydrocephalus, motor dysfunction, endocrine dysfunction, or gastric dysmotility.

- Prognosis depends on the degree of an anomaly in the patient. While the alobar, labor, and semi lobar variant have a poorer prognosis, the middle intrahemispheric variant has a fairly better prognosis.

- Genetic testing is recommended for the parents with a child showing apparent symptoms or in those showing mild variants.
