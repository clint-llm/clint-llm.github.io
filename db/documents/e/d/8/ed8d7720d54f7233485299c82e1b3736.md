Procalcitonin (PCT) has a set half-life of 20 to 24 hours which provides clinicians and researchers with a rough timeline of when levels should begin to decrease following physiological control of the systemic infection. When physiologic control is reached, PCT should decrease by approximately 50% over 24 hours.

The following clinical scenarios have utilized various PCT cut-off levels to determine the source of an infective process as well as when antibiotic therapy could be utilized or discontinued:

**Arthritis**

- PCT cut-off level: 0.1 to 0.25 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: To discriminate infective (septic) arthritis from non-infective arthritis.

- Type of Study: Observational

**Bacteremic Infections**

- PCT cut-off level: 0.25 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: To rule out bacteremic infections.

- Type of Study: Observational

**Blood Stream Infection (primary)**

- PCT cut-off level: 0.1 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: To differentiate between true infection and a contaminated sample.

- Type of Study: Observational

**Acute Bronchitis/**Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Exacerbations****

- PCT cut-off level: 0.1 to 0.5 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: To reduce (unnecessary) antibiotic exposure in the ED and inpatient setting without adverse outcomes.

- Type of Study: Randomized controlled trial

**Infective Endocarditis**

- PCT cut-off level: 2.3 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: High diagnostic accuracy for predicting acute endocarditis.

- Type of Study: Observational

**Meningitis:**

- PCT cut-off level: 0.5 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: To differentiate viral from bacterial meningitis and reduce antibiotic exposure.

- Type of Study: Before-after

**Neutropenia**

- PCT cut-off level: 0.1 to 0.5 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: To identify systemic bacterial infections within neutropenic patients.

- Type of Study: Observational

**Pneumonia**

- PCT cut-off level: 0.1 to 0.5 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: To reduce antibiotic exposure during hospitalization without adverse outcomes.

**Postoperative Fever**

- PCT cut-off level: 0.1 to 0.5 ng/mL

- Role of PCT:  To differentiate postoperative infections from non-infectious fevers.

- Type of Study: Observational

**Postoperative Infections**

- PCT cut-off level: 0.5 to 1.0 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: To minimize antibiotic treatment in surgical intensive care settings without detrimental outcomes.

- Type of Study: Randomized controlled trial

**Severe Sepsis With or Without Shock**

- PCT cut-off level: 0.25 to 0.5 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: To limit antibiotic treatment in intensive care settings without detrimental outcomes.

- Type of Study: Randomized controlled trial

**Upper Respiratory Tract Infections**

- PCT cut-off level: 0.1 to 0.25 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: To limit antibiotic treatment in intensive care settings without detrimental outcomes.

- Type of Study: Randomized controlled trial

**Urinary Tract Infections**

- PCT cut-off level: 0.25 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: To determine the extent of renal involvement.

- Type of Study: Observational

**Ventilator-associated Pneumonia**

- PCT cut-off level: 0.1 to 0.25 ng/mL

- Role of PCT: To minimize antibiotic treatment without detrimental outcomes.

- Type of Study: Randomized controlled trial

Once the cut-off level is established, the timing and frequency of PCT measurement to assess adequate infection control should be determined.

Algorithms have been established for emergency and intensive care settings, providing clinicians with a quick method for determining when to initiate or discontinue antibiotics.

In the intensive care unit, an algorithm has been instituted to determine when antibiotic treatment should be discontinued in patients with sepsis.
