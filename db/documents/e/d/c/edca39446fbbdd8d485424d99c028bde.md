Researchers have studied the precordial thump in multiple clinical settings. Results of studies looking at out-of-hospital cardiac arrests are mixed.

Hospital-based case series studies looking at the effectiveness of the precordial thump during electrophysiology testing have not had positive results. Amir et al. administered precordial thumps to patients who developed ventricular tachycardia during testing and found that, out of 80 patients, only one patient responded to precordial thump.
