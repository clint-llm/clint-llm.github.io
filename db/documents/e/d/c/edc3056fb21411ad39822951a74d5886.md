The clinical appearance of the epiretinal membrane (ERM) is clearly remarkable. However, some conditions mimic an epiretinal membrane during their early stages:

- Fine vessel tortuosity: Combined hamartoma of retina and RPE

- Membrane over the retina: Proliferative vitreoretinopathy and tractional retinal detachment.
