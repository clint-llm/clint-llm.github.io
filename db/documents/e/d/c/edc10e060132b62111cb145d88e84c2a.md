When there is a concern for overlap syndrome, patients should be referred to a pulmonologist/sleep medicine specialist. A patient can then undergo formal evaluation with polysomnography and pulmonary function testing. These tests will help delineate the diagnosis, provide titration of PAP therapy, and optimize pharmacologic therapy and supplemental oxygen as necessary.
