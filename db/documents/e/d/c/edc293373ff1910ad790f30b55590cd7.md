The risk factors for the development of intermittent claudication are similar to those for atherosclerosis. Modifiable risk factors include smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemias, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus. Non-modifiable risk factors include age, male gender, family history, and congenital predisposition. Investigational risk factors include alcohol, radiation, C-reactive protein, infection, homocysteinemia, lipoprotein(a), reduced adiponectin, and fibrinogen.

Besides smoking, poor renal function is also deemed a high-risk factor for the development of intermittent claudication.
