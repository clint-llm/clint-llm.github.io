Hyperkalemia can be due to spironolactone alone or a synergistic side effect from multiple medications such as beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers that clinicians often prescribe to patients for indications such as hypertension or heart failure. Routine blood work is necessary to evaluate serum potassium levels and any decline in renal function. Additional urine studies to assess kidney function may also be a requirement.
