Treatment options for HAS are limited. Thus, as is described below, the prevention of VCM exposure should be the initial focus of employers and workplaces.

During suspected or confirmed acute exposures, the priority should be to stop ongoing exposure by removing the individual from the contaminated area and performing external decontamination. There should be no delay in the movement to fresh air and away from poorly ventilated areas. Gaseous VCM is denser than air, and low-lying areas may accumulate VCM gas. Rescue personnel may need Level B or Level A protective gear with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) to protect themselves during emergency response to industrial accidents or train derailments.

Workers presenting with the symptoms or signs of hepatic dysfunction, or chronic systemic illness, should receive specialty evaluation by an occupational medicine physician or medical toxicologist for occupational exposure evaluation, as well as a hepatologist for the potential treatment of vinyl chloride-induced hepatic damage and HAS.
