Caffeine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the methylxanthine class and is one of the most widely used drugs in the world. Unlike other psychoactive drugs, it is legal, cheap, and not regulated in almost all parts of the world. As a result, individuals who habitually drink caffeine-contained beverages may develop a physical, emotional, and psychological dependence on it and may experience a caffeine withdrawal syndrome after abrupt cessation of caffeine intake. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of caffeine withdrawal and stresses the importance of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of caffeine withdrawal.
- Review the signs and symptoms of caffeine withdrawal.
- Outline the management options available for caffeine withdrawal.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of caffeine withdrawal and improve outcomes.
