Tracheal stenosis is a rare complication resulting from either failed embryologic development or insults to the tracheal lumen. The most common cause is prolonged intubation and high cuff pressure with resultant stenosis. Mortality rates for severe tracheal stenosis are high, particularly in the pediatric population, and must be identified and treated early. Appropriate classification and grading will allow surgeons and care teams to appropriately triage and treat patients successfully. The reconstructive plan must match the goals of care, and communication between the care team and the patient is essential. Surgical reconstruction through endoscopic or open approaches is generally successful. However, despite advances in surgical technique, complications are still prevalent and must be managed appropriately and expeditiously to prevent unwanted outcomes.
