Pectoralis injury is relatively rare, 365 cases have been reported in the literature in a 2012 meta-analysis.

In 1980, Tietjen proposed a classification for pectoralis major injuries. Grading from I to III,

- Grade I: Sprain or contusion

- Grade II: Partial tear

- Grade III: Complete tear: (a) sternoclavicular origin, (b) muscle belly, (c) musculotendinous junction, (d) insertion

The majority of tears are conservatively managed using analgesia, ice, and sling immobilization in the adducted and internally rotated position. The patient may gradually increase movement from 2 to 6 weeks. Light resistance activities can then be introduced from 6 to 8 weeks, and full return to resistance activity is possible at 3 to 5 months.
