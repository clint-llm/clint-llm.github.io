**Recommended Laboratory Assessments**

- A direct swab of vesicular lesions (within 72 hours of onset) is ideal but avoid lesions that have evidence of crusting or healing. Do not clean area with topical alcohols before acquiring material

- Swab locations include: skin via unroofing vesicles with a sterile needle, urethra via sterile swab, the cervix through the vaginal speculum, urine, swabbing of the conjunctiva, and rectal swabs through proctoscopes

- HSV serotyping

- HSV PCR (if direct swab not possible, PCR is the test of choice)

- Tzank smear - low sensitivity and cannot decipher between HSV serotypes

Given symptoms can mimic acute urinary tract infection, consider urinalysis and culture.

Given HSV is an STI, consider further STI work up to include:

- Gonorrhea/chlamydia testing (urine)

- HIV (known interaction between HSV-2 and HIV in which concurrent infection may occur faster than if HSV-2 was not present)

- RPR
