While the intercostal space receives its innervation exclusively from the posterior side, its pattern of vascularization is both posterior and anterior.

Anterior and posterior intercostal veins draining the intercostal spaces also anastomose within the space and follow a similar pattern to the arteries. The most superior two to four intercostal spaces are drained by the variable highest (or superior) intercostal veins which drain into the subclavian veins which converge to empty into the superior vena cava. The remaining posterior intercostal veins (5 to 11) drain into the azygos venous system.Â  The left posterior intercostal veins are longer than the right because it is they which must cross the midline to reach the caval system. The anterior intercostal veins drain superiorly into the internal thoracic veins, which in turn follow into the brachiocephalic veins to the superior vena cava.

Lymphatic drainage of the left thoracic wall, as well as the right thoracic wall below the level of entry of the azygos vein into the superior vena cava, i.e., vertebral level T4-5, is into the thoracic duct.
