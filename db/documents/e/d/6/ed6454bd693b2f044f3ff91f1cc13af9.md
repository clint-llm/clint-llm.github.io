Clinical diagnosis of dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy is challenging, given heterogeneous phenotypes and similarities to spinocerebellar ataxias. Symptoms and neuroimaging vary according to the age of onset. Late-onset DRPLA can sometimes present as isolated cerebellar ataxia, or dementia.

When it begins before the age of 20 it typically exhibits:

- Myoclonus

- Seizures of different types

- Behavioral changes

- Progressive intellectual disability and deterioration

- Ataxia

When it begins after the age of 20 years it presents with:

- Ataxia

- Choreoathetosis or dystonia

- Psychiatric symptoms (delusions)

- Dementia

- Rarely, head tremors and visual problems

Exam findings include neurocognitive impairment on executive function, language, memory, dysmetria, cerebellar ataxia, motor weakness, upper motor neuron signs, and difficulties with gait.
