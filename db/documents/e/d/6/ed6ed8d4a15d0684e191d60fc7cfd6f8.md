There is insufficient evidence to support the natural course or treated pars defect as the preferred management. Management generally reflects the following treatment algorithm.

- Nonoperative

- 
              
- Observation without activity limitations

Additionally, on the discovery of the condition, vitamin D should be checked, and repleted levels are low.
