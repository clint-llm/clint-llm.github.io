Depending on the acuity level of the facility, continuous electronic fetal monitoring is often done during labor. Many healthcare systems require regular documentation of the electronic fetal heart rate and tocometer and notations written for the performance of resuscitative interventions in the presence of a category two or fetal heart rate tracing. Nursing should alert obstetric providers and anesthetic staff about potential concerns and the possibility of proceeding with an operative vaginal delivery or cesarean section, depending on the patient's stage of labor and fetal heart rate tracing.
