SVAS is seen in syndromic as well as nonsyndromic patients.Â  Williams syndrome, also known as Williams-Beuren syndrome, has autosomal dominant inheritance. Most cases are due to a mutation on chromosome 7q11.23. Nonfamilial forms of SVAS are caused either by mutations in or, in Williams syndrome, deletion of the elastin gene located on chromosome 7q11.23. The deletion in Williams syndrome includes genes other than the elastin gene such as the LIM-kinase gene which is thought to be responsible for the defects in visuospatial cognition that are responsible for the other manifestations of the disease. A rare autosomal dominant disorder such as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) also has SVAS.
