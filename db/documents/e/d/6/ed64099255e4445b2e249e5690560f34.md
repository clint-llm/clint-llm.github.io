Eyelash conditions occur in all ages, both genders, and all ethnic subgroups. Infections (styÂ or external hordeola which are infections of the lash roots and cyst of Moll) are common in children and self-limiting. They also become more common with age because of the increase in eyelid margin inflammation with blepharitis and increased Meibomian gland inflammation.

Demodex infestation is normal and increases with age so that by the age of 70 years, most adults will have Demodex parasites on their lashes. Symptoms are much more common with age as the number of parasites increases.

Trachoma is a preventable disease that causes blindness and afflicts the young in sub-Saharan Africa caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Person-to-person contact (often child-to-mother-to-child) is the mode of spread, but it can also be spread by flies and through clothing. Unsanitary conditions predispose to the spread of this disease.
