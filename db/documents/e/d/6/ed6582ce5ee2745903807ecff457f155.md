Nerve impingement is a problem faced by many because it has many etiologies ranging from accidental to spinal stenosis. The procedure to relieve the nerve from being irritated is spinal decompression. This can be performed at any point in the length of the spinal cord whether it may be cervical or lumbar.

A minimally invasive lumbar procedure can be performed to treat the lumbar spinal stenosis.

As with every surgical procedure, there are risks. These include infection, bleeding, blood clots, spinal leaks, nerve or tissue damage, and allergic reaction to anesthesia. It is important to take into consideration the age of the patient as elderly patients may take a longer time to heal and their history. Associated conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, can delay wound healing and are considered an added risk. Most patients stay in the hospital for an average of 4 to 5 days,Â and they may require rehabilitation services.
