The average effective radiation dose of myocardial perfusion imaging is approximately 12 millisieverts, which is equivalent to the radiation dose of performing 923 posteroanterior chest radiographs. Sestamibi is superior to thallium in terms of toxicity profile due to the lower radiation dose. It is comparable to the radiation dose of coronary CT angiography while being less invasive.
