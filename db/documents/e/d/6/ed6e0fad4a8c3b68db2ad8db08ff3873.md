Oseltamivir is generally well tolerated.

Other side effects occurring less than 1% of the time include conjunctivitis, epistaxis, allergy, arrhythmia, GI bleeding, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, confusion, seizures, and neuropsychiatric events.

Cutaneous adverse drug reactions like erythema multiforme, steven johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis have also been reported.

Serum aminotransferase elevations have been reported in 2% of clinical trials, but enzyme elevation in patients was transient and asymptomatic. The mechanism of hepatotoxicity is possibly immunoallergic. Rare cases of liver injury and jaundice have been reported, but influenza infection can also lead to serum enzyme elevations and jaundice. Consequently, the likelihood score is D(possible rare cause of clinically apparent liver injury).

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

Influenza antiviral medications may decrease the efficacy of LAIV4 (live attenuated influenza vaccine) if administered within 48 hours to 14 days after LAIV4.
