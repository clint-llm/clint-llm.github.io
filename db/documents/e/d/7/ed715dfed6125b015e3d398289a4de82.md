Multi-component prevention programs have been shown to reduce the incidence of delirium across medical and surgical patients by approximately 30%. It is important to adopt an interprofessional approach to managing patients at risk of developing POD. Reorienting the patient, calming the patient while looking for obvious and nonobvious precipitating factors in the post-operative period is important. Successful implementation of an interprofessional programs, such as HELP and modified HELP and ABCDEF bundle at various hospitals, has shown encouraging results.
