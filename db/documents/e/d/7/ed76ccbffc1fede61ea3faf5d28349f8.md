Patients require dietary counseling regarding food rich in zinc. In addition to supplementation, patients deficient in zinc can consider eating more:

- Red meat

- Poultry

- Wheat germ

- Wild rice

- Seeds

Vegetarians may find it more challenging to obtain sufficient dietary zinc. For these patients, options for zinc sources include baked beans, peas, cashews, and almonds.
