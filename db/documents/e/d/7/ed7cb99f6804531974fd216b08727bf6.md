Although difficult to accurately assess, recent data suggest a prevalence rate between 1-2%. DSM–IV (1994) criteria for a behavioral health disorder. Additional research completed by Landsverk and Garland and cited in Mental Health Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect: The Promise of Evidence-Based Practice (Shipman, Kimberly, and Taussig, Heather 2009) found that "between one-half and two-thirds of children entering foster care exhibit behavior or social competency problems warranting mental health services."

Research suggests that concordance rates among siblings raised in the same home to be between 67% and 75%.

The National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being, No. 18  (Instability and Early Life Changes Among Children in the Child Welfare System) shows that 79% of children who died because of abuse or neglect in 2010 were younger than the age of 4. During that same year, 48% of children entering the foster care system were also younger than age 5.
