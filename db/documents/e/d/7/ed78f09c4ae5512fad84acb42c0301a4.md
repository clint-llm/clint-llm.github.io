The cauda equina undergoes a dynamic developmental process inside the embryo. When initially formed, the spinal cord occupies the full space inside the arachnoid and dura mater. With skeletal maturation, the vertebral bodies ossify, and the spine elongates. While the vertebral column elongates with the growth of the embryo, the length of the spinal cord itself progresses at a slower rate and creates the potential space of the lumbar cistern. Due to this elongation, lumbar and sacral spinal nerve roots must travel a greater distance inferiorly within the vertebral column to maintain innervation of distal targets. Akin to the rest of the spinal cord, the horsehair projections that together are termed the cauda equina are enveloped in the dura, arachnoid, and pia mater, the 3 meningeal layers.
