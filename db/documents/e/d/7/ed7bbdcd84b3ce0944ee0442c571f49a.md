Barrett's metaplasia itself does not cause any symptoms. Patients typically present with a history of long-standing heartburn, regurgitation, or dysphagia, which are symptoms typical for GERD. In patients with symptomatic GERD, long-segment Barrett's esophagus is found in 3% to 5%, and around 10% to 20% have short segment disease. Increased severity of underlying GERD is associated with an increased incidence of Barrett's metaplasia.
