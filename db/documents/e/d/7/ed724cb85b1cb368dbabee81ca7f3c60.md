Among the most feared complications of anterior mediastinal masses is the invasion of tumor and metastasis, which naturally foreshadows a poorer prognosis. Additionally, invasive and bulky tumors may present with a variable extrathoracic obstruction, which may result in airway compromise and compression symptoms, such as superior vena cava syndrome and Horner syndrome. If there is true airway compromise, the patient may have to undergo a tracheostomy. Many of the complications associated with anterior mediastinal masses are related to the treatment options. Certainly, any surgical intervention carries risks and related morbidity. Exposure to chemotherapy and radiation have side effects, such as bone marrow suppression and an increased chance of malignancy, respectively.
