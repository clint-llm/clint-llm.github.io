**Early Signs and Symptoms**

Sepsis is defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome plus an infectious source. Therefore, earlier on in the presentation of sepsis, patients present with the following vital sign changes:

- Fever, temperature higher than 38 C, or hypothermia, temperature lower than 36 C

- Tachycardia with a heart rate higher than 90 beats per minute in adult patients or less than two standard deviations for age in pediatric patients

- Tachypnea with respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths per minute in adult patients or more than two standard deviations for age in pediatric patients

**Signs and Symptoms of Severe Sepsis**Severe sepsis is defined as sepsis and end-organ dysfunction. At this stage, signs, and symptoms may include:

- Altered mental status

- Oliguria or anuria

- Hypoxia

- Cyanosis

- Ileus

Patients progressing to septic shock will experience signs and symptoms of severe sepsis with hypotension. Of note, at an early "compensated" stage of shock, blood pressure may be maintained, and other signs of distributive shock might be present, for example, warm extremities, flash capillary refill (less than one second), and bounding pulses, also known as warm shock. This stage of shock, if managed aggressively with fluid resuscitation and vasoactive support, can be reversed. With the progression of septic shock into the uncompensated stage, hypotension ensues, and patients may present with cool extremities, delayed capillary refill (more than three seconds), and thready pulses, also known as cold shock. After that, with continued tissue hypoperfusion, shock may be irreversible, progressive rapidly into multiorgan dysfunction syndrome and death.
