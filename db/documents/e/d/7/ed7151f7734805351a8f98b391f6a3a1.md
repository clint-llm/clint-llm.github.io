**Advantages**

- Relatively short healing time compared to other rejuvenation modalities.

- Relatively low-cost procedure.

- Simple technique that is easy to master

- Well tolerated by patients.

- Minimal risk of post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (many alternative therapies used for the same indications such as CO2 laser resurfacing and deep chemical peels, ablate the epidermis with subsequent re-epithelialization. The epithelial damage in these procedures renders the skin more sensitive to photodamage and dyschromia)

- Can be combined with other acne scar treatment like subcision, chemical peeling, microdermabrasion and fractional resurfacing maximum-giving benefits

**Disadvantages**

- Evidence-based recommendations for the use of microneedling are lacking; most recommendations for its use are based on anecdotal reports and small studies.

- Head-to-head trials against the various other treatment options are sparse
