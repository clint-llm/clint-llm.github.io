In patients with a prognathic mandible (Class III malocclusion) requiring orthognathic surgery to provide mandibular setback, a standard procedure is to prevent interference by muscle and ligament by stripping the medial pterygoid muscle and stylomandibular ligament off the medial side of the proximal segment.

During nerve block procedure for the mandibular arch, the area where the needle should focus is occupied to a large extent by the medial pterygoid muscle. During an inferior alveolar nerve block, if the needle placement is too medial, there are chances that the needle might pierce the medial pterygoid muscle resulting in less effective anesthesia as well as postoperative trismus.
