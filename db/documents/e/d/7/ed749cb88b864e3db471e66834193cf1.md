The concept of quality of life remains relevant to all clinical settings. It is of paramount importance in some fields of medicine, such as hospice and palliative care, where the aggressive pursuit of a cure is set aside to instead satisfy patient goals and maximize the patient's quality of life. It is important to clarify that studies show variability across individuals regarding how disease processes, symptoms, prognosis, and palliative treatments impact the quality of life. It is therefore worth emphasizing that assessing QoL through a limited definition or applying a particular model to all patients would be an error as the literature stands. While there is no shortage of textbook definitions, perhaps the most accurate meaning of QoL is the definition the patient provides when sitting across from their clinician.
