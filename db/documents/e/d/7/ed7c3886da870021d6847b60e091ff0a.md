The symptoms of serum sickness arise as a result of the formation of immune complexes between human proteins and heterologous (nonhuman) proteins. Medications containing heterologous antigens are the most common cause of serum sickness and include vaccinations (i.e., Rabies), immune modulating agents (i.e., rituximab, infliximab) and anti-venoms.

Serum sickness is not to be confused with a serum sickness-like reaction, which results in a similar clinical presentation but does not involve the formation of immune complexes. The most common offending medications include penicillins, cephalosporins (most commonly cefaclor), sulfonamides, bupropion, fluoxetine, and thiouracil.
