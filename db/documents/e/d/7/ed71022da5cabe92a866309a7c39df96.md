Arthrocentesis is a procedure performed to aspirate synovial fluid from a joint cavity. It has both diagnostic and therapeutic uses.Â While arthrocentesis is deemed to be a minor surgical procedure, there is always the potential to injure blood vessels, nerves, and tendons. Thus, the procedure should only be performed by clinicians with extensive knowledge of the anatomy of joints. To minimize the risk of injury, the joint's extensor surface should be in extension with minimal flexion.
