Prolactin is responsible for milk production during pregnancy and lactation. Along with estrogen, progesterone, possibly insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and placental hormones, prolactin stimulates breast alveolar element proliferation in pregnancy.

The hypothalamic control of prolactin secretion is mostly inhibitory by prolactin inhibiting factor and dopamine is the main inhibitor that acts via type 2 dopamine (D2) receptor

Drugs like neuroleptics elevate prolactin because of their dopamine receptor antagonist property, and atypical antipsychotics act by antagonizing both secretions of serotonin and dopamine.

Pituitary or sellar tumors inhibit dopamine-induced hyperprolactinemia because of pressure on the pituitary stalk or interruption of the vascular connections between the pituitary and hypothalamus.

Prolactin causes inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) leading to inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion.
