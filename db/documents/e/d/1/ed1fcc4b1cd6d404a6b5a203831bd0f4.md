Each healthcare team member is also a member of their particular professional discipline. Each team member has a unique perspective to add to the healthcare team but is subject to limitations by their scope and standards of practice. Each healthcare team member must follow the scope and standards of their discipline while providing end-of-life care. Scopes and standards define what care each discipline can provide, to whom and how that care should be delivered. When providers, nurses, respiratory therapists, social workers, spiritual providers, and other healthcare team members act within their scope and standards of practice, the quality and safety of the care the patient receives are greatly enhanced. When these disciplines work together as an integrated team, the care the patient receives and participates in is greatly improved.
