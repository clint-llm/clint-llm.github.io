Several modalities are useful for assessment of the presence of a foreign body in the vagina, including a pelvic exam with or without anesthesia, ultrasonography, pelvic radiography, MRI, and vaginoscopy.

Persistent discharge despite antimicrobial treatment should raise suspicionÂ of a foreign body, and evaluation should take place.

Extreme cases may require surgical intervention to remove foreign objects due to size, position, location, and other complicating factors. General anesthesia may be used to allow for full muscle relaxation and aid in foreign body removal.
