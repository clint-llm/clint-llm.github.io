According to the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association Cholesterol Guideline Recommendations

Lipid panel: Baseline, fasting within 4 to 12 weeks after starting a treatment or dose adjustment, and every 3 to 12 months after that. Consider decreasing the dose if two or more consecutive LDL levels are less than 40 mg/dl.

Liver transaminase levels: Baseline measure of hepatic transaminases. Measurement of the hepatic function if any indication of hepatotoxicity (e.g., unusual fatigue, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, dark-colored urine, jaundice, or scleral icterus) during therapy.

CPK: CPK levels do not require routine monitoring. Baseline CPK may be necessary for patients with a family history of statin intolerance, muscle disease, or other drugs that may increase the risk of myopathy. In addition, patients with muscle pain, weakness, aches, or otherÂ symptoms suggestive of myopathy would need CPK levels.

Evaluate for new-onset diabetes: If diabetes develops, the patient is to continue statin therapy and encourage a healthy diet, exercise, maintaining healthy body weight, and cessation of tobacco use.

If the patient develops confusion or memory impairment, further evaluation is needed for non-statin causes, systemic or neuropsychiatric causes, and/or adverse effects of statin therapy.
