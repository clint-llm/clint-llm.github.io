Treatment options are highly dependent on the grade of LCL injury and if associated injuries are present; therefore, it is imperative to gather definitive imaging promptly. Acutely, all grades of injury can be treated with: rest, compression, NSAIDs, and ice. Ice should not be applied for longer than 15 minutes at a time to the lateral knee to help prevent cold injury to the common peroneal nerve.

Grade 1 and 2: Usually, nonoperative treatment is the therapeutic approach. Patients should be non-weight-bearing and use crutches for one week for better pain control. For the next 3 to 6 weeks, the patient should be placed in a hinged knee brace to stabilize the medial and lateral aspects of the joint while performing functional rehabilitation.

Grade 3:

Recent studies show that in terms of grade 3 isolated LCL injuries, both knee range of motion and pain reduction was highest in those who underwent surgical treatment.
