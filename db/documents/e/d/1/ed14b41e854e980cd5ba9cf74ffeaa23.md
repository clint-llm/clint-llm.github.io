M. tuberculosis, M. leprae, and NTM are all related to the genus mycobacteria. Runyon identified the non-tuberculous mycobacteria in the 1980s. He was able to identify the other mycobacterial species based on their pigmentation changes in the presence or absence of light (photochromogens, scotochromogens, non-chromogenic) and growth characteristics (slow versus rapid).

During the last decade, the use of more advanced molecular and genetic methods for microorganism identification has resulted in the previous Runyon classification getting replaced. Today, the number of identified NTM species has reached more than a hundred, with around fifty that correlate with a lung infection.Mycobacteria avium, M. kansasii, and M. abscessus.
