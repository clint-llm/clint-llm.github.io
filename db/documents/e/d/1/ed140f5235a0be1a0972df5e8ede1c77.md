Transvaginal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help establish a diagnosis of nabothian cysts. MRI can differentiate between endophytic and exophytic growth, and between normal and abnormal conditions. The Nabothian cyst appears characteristically as high T2 signal intensity on MRI.

If cancer is suspected and MRI cannot exclude it, biopsy, conization, and endocervical curettage are efficient investigative tools to be used.

Sadly, despite the use of these modern diagnostic techniques, exploratory laparotomy and hysterectomy may still be required in the case of uncommonly large and deep intracervical cysts when malignancy cannot be ruled out.
