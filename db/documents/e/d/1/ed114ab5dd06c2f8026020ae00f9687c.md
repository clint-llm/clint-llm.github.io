Granulation tissue may persist under several circumstances resulting from underlying conditions and/or errors in the stages of wound healing (errors in the proliferative phase and remodeling phase).

Possible causes of prolonged wound healing include:

- Diabetes mellitus

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- Vascular or arterial insufficiency

- Zinc deficiency

- Low human growth hormone levels

- Older age

- Obesity

- Trauma

- Excess moisture

- Tissue hypoxia

- Medications (steroids, NSAIDs, chemotherapy)

- Alcoholism

- Tobacco abuse

Possible causes of Hypergranulation (excess granulation tissue)

- Wound infection

- Excess inflammation

- Foreign body/material

- Physical irritation/friction

Granulation tissue can also present in:

- Pyogenic granuloma

- Pulp polyps
