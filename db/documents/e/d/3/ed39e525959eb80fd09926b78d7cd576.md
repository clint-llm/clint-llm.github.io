The labial arteries are branches from the facial artery.

The inferior labial artery branches off the facial artery around the same region as the superior labial artery. The main difference in that the inferior labial artery will traverse inferior to the lower lip. The inferior labial artery anastomoses with the contralateral inferior labial artery and mental arteries.

The branching of the labial arteries from the facial artery and the anastomoses with the contralateral side forms a network around the lips. This network helps perfuse the lips and the muscles in this region. The anastomose network of vessels can provide blood flow to either side if one side becomes compromised.

The lymphatic drainage system for the lips is divide by the upper and lower lips. The upper lip drains into the submandibular, infraparotid, and the preauricular lymph nodes. While the lower lip drains lymph fluid into the submental and submandibular lymph nodes. These lymph nodes eventually drain back into the thoracic duct on the left side or the right lymphatic duct on the right side.
