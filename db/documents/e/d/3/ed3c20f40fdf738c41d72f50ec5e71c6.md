Magnesium is an important electrolyte. It is a key part of many reactions that occur in the human body, affecting cellular function, nerve conduction, and other needs. Normal serum magnesium levels are between 1.46 and 2.68 mg/dL. Hypomagnesemia is an electrolyte disturbance caused by a low serum magnesium level (less than 1.46 mg/dL) in the blood. However, it is typically asymptomatic until serum magnesium concentration is less 1.2 mg/dL (0.5 mmol/L).

Hypomagnesemia can be attributed to chronic disease, alcohol use disorder, gastrointestinal losses, renal losses, and other conditions. Signs and symptoms of hypomagnesemia include mild tremors and generalized weakness to cardiac ischemia and death.
