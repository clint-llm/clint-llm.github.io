Bazex syndrome, also known as acrokeratosis paraneoplastica or acrokeratosis neoplastica syndrome is a rare, acral psoriasiform dermatosis associated with malignancies, most frequently squamous cell carcinoma. Typically the carcinoma involves the upper aerodigestive tract, but it is important to know that it can be associated with almost any squamous cell malignancy. It is crucial for providers to be aware of this syndrome so that patients can get a thorough workup to determine the location of the malignancy. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of patients with acrokeratosis paraneoplastica and highlights the important role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.
