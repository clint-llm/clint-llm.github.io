The SOV passes through the superior orbital fissure accompanied by the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III), trochlear nerve (cranial nerve IV), ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V1; including the lacrimal, frontal, and nasociliary branches), abducens nerve (cranial nerve VI), and sympathetic fibers from the cavernous plexus. The IOV has two branches â€“ one passes through the superior orbital fissure, and the other passes through the inferior orbital fissure along with the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V2; including the infraorbital and zygomatic branches) and branches of the pterygopalatine ganglion.
