The exact pathogenesis of sialolithiasis is not well understood, but two dominant theories were suggested. OneÂ of them proposes that there are multiple internal microcalculi within salivary gland secretory granules. When these microcalculi get secreted into the salivary ducts, they may act as a nidus for the formation of larger calculi, ultimately forming a sialolith.
