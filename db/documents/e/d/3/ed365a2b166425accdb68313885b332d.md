Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder that affects multiple systems. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is characterized by an increased predisposition to hamartoma formation.

TSC is usually diagnosed in childhood or infancy, and the affected individuals may present with developmental delay, skin manifestations, or seizures. However, it may also be diagnosed earlier or later, based on a wide array of clinical manifestations.

Some manifestations may be present prenatally, such as cardiac rhabdomyomas or cortical tubers. While other signs, including osseous, renal, or pulmonary lesions are commonly diagnosed in adulthood.

This disease has a highly variable clinical course. Prognosis may be uncertain, and follow-up requires a comprehensive evaluation, often in specialized institutions. This disorder may be overwhelming for some patients and family members; thus, orientation and counseling play a vital role.
