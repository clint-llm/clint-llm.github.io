Surgical management will be broken down into these categories: laceration without eyelid margin involvement, laceration with eyelid margin involvement, and laceration with nasolacrimal system involvement. This activity describes the types of eyelid lacerations, their repair, and potential complications.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the eyelid.
- Review the indications for an eyelid laceration repair.
- Summarize the technique for repairing an eyelid laceration.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care delivery for patients undergoing repair of an eyelid laceration.
