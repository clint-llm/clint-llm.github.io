Hemorrhagic disease of the newborn is a life-threatening condition associated with high mortality and morbidity. But, it can easily be prevented by administering 1 mg IM of vitamin K within 1 hour of birth.

Early and prompt diagnosis of hemorrhagic disease of the newborn can alleviate the devastating consequences. Strong interprofessional communication and care coordination by clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists can help improve outcomes and ensure patient safety. Parents should be counseled regarding the condition, and the severity and follow-up routine with the clinician should be scheduled on a regular basis to check the well-being of the patient.
