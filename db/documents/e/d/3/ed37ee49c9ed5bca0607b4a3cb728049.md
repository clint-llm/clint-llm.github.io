Von Economo encephalitis occurred as an epidemic in Europe and North America between 1916 and 1927. Fortunately, no other epidemic occurred afterward. Only rare cases are still described in the scientific literature. The general physician treated patients with von Economo encephalitis in consultation with an interprofessional team of specialists, including a neurologist and a psychiatrist. The condition became even more complicated when the patients developed chronic parkinsonism, which required treatment with pharmacotherapy. Knowledge of this disease is essential for the healthcare team.
