There is a lack of consensus for both sexes about what constitutes a significantly elevated post-void residual volume, and there is conflicting data. Widely agreed-upon normal PVR values are given here.

**Adults and Elderly**

- Less than 100 mL PVR is considered normal.

- Up to 200 mL PVR may be acceptable.

- Over 200 mL PVR indicates inadequate emptying.

- Over 300 mL is suggestive of urinary retention.

- Over 400 mL is considered urinary retention.

**Children**

- Over 20 mL PVR is considered abnormal but varies with age.

**Urinary Retention**

- A PVR over 500 mL is widely considered abnormal and generally diagnostic of urinary retention. In addition, it may be highly predictive of cauda equina syndrome if associated with other neurological findings.

- Use a Foley catheter or teach the patient intermittent self-catheterization.

- Concern for possible postobstructive diuresis if greater than 1,500 mL is drained immediately.
