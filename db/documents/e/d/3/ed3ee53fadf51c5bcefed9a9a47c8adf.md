Radiographic imaging should be obtained in all patients with acute or chronic shoulder pain.

**Radiographs**

Recommended imaging includes a true anteroposterior (AP) image of the glenohumeral joint (i.e., the “Grashey” view). The true AP image is taken with the patient rotated between 30 and 45 degrees offset the cassette in the coronal plane. Alternatively, the beam can be rotated while the patient remains neutral in the coronal plane. The distance between the acromion and the humeral head (i.e., the acromiohumeral interval) can be calculated. A normal interval is between 7 and 14 mm, and this interval is decreased in cases of advanced degenerative arthritis and rotator cuff arthropathy (RCA).

Other radiographic imaging includes a 30-degree caudal tilt view that can be performed to visualize the presence of acromial spurring. In addition, the “scapular Y” or “supraspinatus outlet” view is used to determine acromial morphology.

**Pertinent findings
**

The following are the most common radiographic changes associated with rotator cuff pathology:

- **Rotator cuff arthropathy:** Proximal humeral migration and decreases in the acromiohumeral interval to <7mm

- 

**Degenerative findings:**

- 
              
- Osteophytes on the acromion, proximal humerus and/or glenoid are often seen in cases of advanced disease
              
              
- Calcification of the coracoacromial ligament (CAL) and/or coracohumeral ligament (CHL)
              
              
- Greater tuberosity cystic degeneration
              
              
- Acromioclavicular joint arthritis

- **“Hooked” acromion:** best appreciated on the supraspinatus outlet view

- **Os acromiale:**best seen on an axillary lateral radiograph

**Ultrasound**

Ultrasound (US) is an often-underutilized imaging modality to detect rotator cuff  tendon and muscle belly integrity. In 2011, a meta-analysis of over 6,000 shoulders revealed a sensitivity of 0.96 and specificity of 0.93 in assessing shoulders for PTTs or FTTs.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful in evaluating the overall degree of rotator cuff  pathology. MRI can be helpful in providing more accurate cuff tear details, including partial- versus full-thickness tears, the extent and size of the tear(s), location, and degree of retraction. In cases of chronic rotator cuff  pathology, the cuff can be assessed for fatty degenerative changes on the T1-weighted sagittal sequence series.

Subdeltoid and/or subacromial bursitis can also be evident and are important considerations as potential sources of pain. In addition, the acromioclavicular (AC) joint, acromial morphology, and long head of the biceps (LHB) tendon integrity are better appreciated. A systematic approach to reviewing shoulder MRIs is important, especially when correlating the MRI findings with the patient-reported symptoms and clinical examination.
