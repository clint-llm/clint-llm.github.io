Obesity is increasing on a global scale. The associated health concerns come with an increasingly global economic burden. In 2021, 73% of adults over 45 years old in England have a BMI greater than 25. The USA has the highest population rates of obesity globally, surpassing 40% for the first time. With the increasing demand for bariatric surgery comes greater pressure on specialist centers and teams. Patients with obesity require specialist equipment such as bariatric hospital beds, operating tables, and bariatric scanners. Bariatric surgery is a sub-specialty and requires specifically trained surgeons and working alongside appropriately qualified teams.

The cost of medical care for patients with obesity is around 30% greater than those with a normal BMI; this cost is higher still for those with a BMI > 35 where is around 81% greater. The median procedural costs from a nationwide American inpatient cohort were $9,219 for gastric band, $10,537 for SG, and $12,543 for gastric bypass. Despite these figures, even if revision surgery is required, bariatric surgery is cost-saving over an individualâ€™s lifetime, compared with non-surgical management. In addition, there are indirect cost-savings associated with bariatric surgery, including less time off work and enhanced productivity.
