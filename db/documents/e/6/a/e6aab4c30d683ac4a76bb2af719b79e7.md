The majority of patients who present with periprosthetic distal femur fractures will not recall a significant traumatic event; instead, they will claim a minor misstep or twisting injury that has led to their presentation to the hospital. Patients may reveal a recent history of fractures and falls and clue the physician into their bone health quality and quantity. Patients will complain of pain in the involved extremity and an inability to ambulate. On physical exam, patients often do not have a gross deformity of the limb but will be exquisitely tender to range of motion to the knee and palpation of the distal femur.
