Extra-pulmonary TB accounts for about 12% of all tuberculosis cases, of which gastrointestinal tuberculosis accounts for 11% to 16% of the cases.

Some studies have reported a female preponderance of GI TB.

There is an unclear association of GI TB with the age of a patient. One study reported that middle-aged patients (reproductive age group) are most commonly affected.

GI TB is commonly seen in populations with lower socioeconomic status. The concomitant contributors of illiteracy and malnutrition also play a role.

In developed countries, TB is associated with patients with HIV/AIDS and in those who have immigrated from developing countries.

In both developing and developed countries, GI TB has also been associated with patients being treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF-alpha) agents and those who have undergone solid-organ transplantation; after renal, renal-pancreas, liver, and cardiac transplants.
