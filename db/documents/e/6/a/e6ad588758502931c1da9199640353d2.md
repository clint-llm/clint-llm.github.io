The incidence of serious fetal and maternal morbidity depends upon the location and magnitude of the rupture as well as the speed of surgical intervention. Lateral ruptures are associated with worse outcomes than midline ruptures—perhaps because of increased vascularity of the lateral uterine wall. A longer time to surgical intervention is associated with more maternal blood loss, a higher risk of coagulopathy, and longer fetal exposure to hypoxia.

Rupture of unscarred uteri is associated with more blood loss, a higher incidence of hysterectomy, and a higher rate of composite maternal morbidity (death, hysterectomy, blood transfusion, or urologic injury) than rupture of scarred uteri.
