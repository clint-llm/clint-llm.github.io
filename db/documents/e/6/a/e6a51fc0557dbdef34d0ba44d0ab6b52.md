There are different proposed techniques to prevent bile duct injury during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The critical view of safety(CVS) is one such technique to ensure proper identification of the cystic duct and artery to prevent common bile duct or hepatic duct injury. The technique requires the separation of the lower third of the gallbladder from the cystic plate, clearance of fat and fibrous tissue from the hepatocystic triangle, and identifying two and only two structures entering the gallbladder, which are the cystic duct and cystic artery.

The rate of bile duct injury in laparoscopic cholecystectomy is less than 1%, which limits the ability to collect enough data through randomized controlled trials to demonstrate statistical significance, though smaller studies do support the use of CVS. SAGES created a Safe Cholecystectomy program online to teach and promote the adoption of attaining the CVS and avoid inadvertent injury, especially in the difficult gallbladder.
