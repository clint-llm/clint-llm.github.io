Congenital pulmonary airway malformation can be diagnosed prenatally and is the most common prenatally diagnosed lung malformation. The diagnostic modality used is fetal ultrasound and can classify as either microcystic or macrocystic based on the size. If further differentiation of the lesion is needed, MRI is used, especially to distinguish between bronchopulmonary sequestration or congenital diaphragmatic hernia. If there is a prenatal diagnosis of CPAM, a chest radiograph should take place after birth. CPAM is most often diagnosed in the second trimester when diagnosed prenatally. If the infant has a diagnosis of CPAM from prenatal ultrasound and is symptomatic after birth, CT or MRI should be done to define the lesion. For asymptomatic infants, if the chest radiograph shows large lesions, bilateral or multifocal cysts, or a pneumothorax, then CT or MRI is recommended immediately. If asymptomatic without these characteristics, then CT or MRI should be done by six months of age. Even if chest radiography is normal, CT or MRI should be done, especially in asymptomatic infants. CPAM types 1 and 4 appear as one or two large air-filled cysts. Type 2 appears as multiple smaller air-filled cysts, giving a “bubbly” appearance on a chest X-ray. Type 3 presents as a solid, homogenous mass on chest X-ray, with a mass effect on the mediastinum.
