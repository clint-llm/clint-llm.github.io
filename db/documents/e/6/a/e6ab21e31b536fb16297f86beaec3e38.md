Early recognition of compartment syndrome is best detected by those professionals who have regular contact with the patients in the ward. These ward staff, typically junior doctors, nursing, and health care assistants, have the most contact time with patients and are in the best position to detect increasing severity in symptoms. These are the members of staff who need the most training in recognizing compartment syndrome and who need to exercise the high index of suspicion and early escalation to a senior doctor who can initiate early aggressive treatment with fasciotomy. Therefore it is the responsibility of the senior doctors and the department management to ensure the ward staff has adequate training to recognize the symptoms, are familiar with pressure measuring equipment, and feel able to escalate appropriately. The interprofessional approach will provide the best method of early detection to facilitate early treatment and provide the best patient outcomes.
