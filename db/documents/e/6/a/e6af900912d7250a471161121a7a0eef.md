The role of the sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) in the pathogenesis of pain and its use was first described as sphenopalatine neuralgia by Sluder in 1908. He described sphenopalatine neuralgia as a unilateral facial pain symptom complex with associated neuralgic, motor, sensory, and gustatory manifestations.Â Today, blockade of the sphenopalatine ganglion is utilized to treat a number of painful conditions.
