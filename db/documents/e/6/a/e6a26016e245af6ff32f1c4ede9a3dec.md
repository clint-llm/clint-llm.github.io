In the context of skin cancer surgery, inadequate oncological clearance may be considered an absolute contraindication to flap reconstruction. Therefore, in some situations, reconstruction may be delayed until clearance or until Mohs micrographic surgery can be performed.

Relative contraindications may include patient factors such as heavy smoking, poorly controlled diabetes, anticoagulants, or reduced perfusion, for which complications may be higher.

These are generally modifiable, for example, through smoking cessation, suspension of coagulant medication, and optimized glycaemic control. Some anatomic regions should be avoided, such as those with poor adjacent skin laxity or proximity to landmarks prone to disruption by tension.
