There are few contraindications for the use of transabdominal ultrasound during the third trimester of pregnancy. The only universally accepted absolute contraindication is patient refusal, following the principle of patient autonomy.

Transvaginal ultrasound is relatively contraindicated during the third trimester, especially in patients without a prior documented placental location, due to concerns for precipitating bleeding in the setting of undiagnosed placenta previa. It is recommended to begin with a transabdominal ultrasound to locate the placenta first, followed by the transvaginal ultrasound if clinically indicated and necessary. However, due to the cervix and the vaginal canal angle, performing transvaginal ultrasound during the third trimester can be potentially safe. The risk of precipitating clinically significant hemorrhage has not been consistently supported in the literature.
