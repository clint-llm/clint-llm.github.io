Identification of HMPV does not require confirmatory testing but is based on a clinical diagnosis majority of the time. However, there are laboratory tests that can be utilized,

Most commonly, confirmation of infection by HMPV is done by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swabs.

Radiographic findings on a chest X-ray are typically nonspecific unless HMPV leads to the development of bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Findings include lobar infiltrates, peribronchial cuffing, hypermutation, or diffuse perihilar infiltrates. It is crucial to assess vital signs and to perform a thorough physical examination looking for signs of respiratory distress and hydration status in order to determine which supportive care measures are necessary.
