**Electrophysiological Studies**

In multifocal motor neuropathy, electrophysiological studies are consistent with motor neuropathy with normal sensory nerve conduction studies. There may be evidence of demyelination marked by prolonged motor nerve latencies and slow conduction velocities. F-wave responses may be absent or prolonged. However, the hallmark finding of MMNCB is a motor conduction block and/or temporal dispersion. When the conduction block is absent or cannot be assessed by routine nerve conduction studies due to a more proximal location, the diagnosis is termed as MMN. Needle electromyography findings may reveal reduced recruitment of muscle unit action potentials (MUAPs) in weak muscles due to proximal conduction blocks.

Conduction block is defined as a more than 50% reduction in compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude or area between proximal and distal nerve stimulation sites and is often indicative of an acquired etiology. In MMNCB, the conduction block characteristically occurs at non-compressible sites. Therefore, the presence of conduction block across the known nerve entrapment sites (e.g., the median nerve at the wrist) cannot be used in the diagnosis of MMNCB. Besides MMNCB, conduction block is also seen in acquired demyelinating conditions, e.g., chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS).

**Laboratory Investigations**

Routine blood and urine laboratory investigations are unremarkable in patients with MMN. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein level is often normal or mildly increased. It is one of the important features to differentiate MMN from CIDP.

Anti-GM1 ganglioside antibodies are present in about half of the cases of MMN.  However, the anti-GM1 titers do not correlate with the treatment. Anti-GM1 antibodies are not specific for MMN and are also seen in acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) variant of GBS, but their presence supports the diagnosis.

**Imaging Studies**

Nerve ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can offer important diagnostic data, especially when electrophysiological investigations are not conclusive. The diagnosis of MMN, indeed, can be a challenge when conduction blocks are not detectable, or in the case of advanced axonal loss. Spinal MRI may reveal T2 hyperintense signals in the brachial plexus with or without contrast enhancement in about half of the patients with MMN and CIDP. In MMN, these signals are asymmetric and often unilateral, but these are bilateral and symmetrical in CIDP.

In MMN, an increase in the cross-sectional area of the median and ulnar nerves may be seen with high-resolution US (HRUS). This finding is helpful when a clinical distinction is difficult with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in which the nerve diameters are typically reduced.

**Diagnostic Criteria**

In 2010, the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) and Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) Task Force revised the following diagnostic criteria to help in the diagnosis of MMN.

**Core Criteria (both must be present)**

- Slowly progressive, focal, asymmetric limb weakness, that is, motor involvement in the motor nerve distribution of at least two nerves, for at least 1 month (usually more than 6 months). If symptoms and signs are present only in the distribution of one nerve, only a possible diagnosis can be made.

- No objective sensory abnormalities except for minor vibration sense abnormalities in the lower limbs.

**Supportive Clinical Criteria**

- Predominant upper limb involvement

- Decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limb

- Absence of cranial nerve involvement

- Cramps and fasciculations in the affected limb

- Response to immunomodulatory treatment

**Exclusion Criteria**

- Upper motor neuron signs

- Marked bulbar involvement

- Sensory impairment more marked than minor vibration loss in the lower limbs

- Diffuse symmetric weakness during the initial weeks
