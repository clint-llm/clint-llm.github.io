A biopsy is rarely needed for the diagnosis of erythrasma. Examination of the skin by microscopy would show rod-like organisms in the horny layer. However, these are sometimes missed. There may also be coccoid forms. There will be hyperkeratosis with some lymphohistiocytic infiltrate around the vasculature of the top layer of skin.

Gram stain shows gram-positive rods. If C. minutissimum is left for long on the culture plate, the culture becomes gram-negative and of varying shapes. C. minutissimum is not acid-fast. It produces acid from dextrose, sucrose, and maltose, but not lactose. It has been proven to be sensitive to erythromycin in vitro but resistant to penicillin. It is difficult to visualize the organism on hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides and it might be better visualized with Periodic Acid-Schiff and Giemsa stains.
