Complications of SPG RFA are mostly associated with the needle insertion and may include infection, internal bleeding or epistaxis, injury to the maxillary artery and nerve or its branches (greater and lesser petrosal nerves), and hemodynamic instability. Occasionally hypesthesia and/or dysesthesia of the upper teeth, hard palate, or pharynx may result, as well as a decrease in lacrimation or nasal mucus production. SPG RFA often causes reflex sinus bradycardia; therefore, close monitoring of vital signs throughout the procedure is essential.

If the patient feels liquid in the back of the throat during the procedure, the RFA needle should be withdrawn slightly and retested. If proper stimulation is achieved, a local anesthetic should be injected to anesthetize the area. If the patient does not report a liquid feeling in the back of the throat, the radiofrequency ablation should be completed, and the patient should then be monitored for any symptoms such as bleeding or infection.
