Eclampsia is a medical condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment toÂ prevent morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. The interprofessional health care team must work efficiently to provide optimal care to both the mother and the unborn child. Nurses or providers triaging patients in the emergency department need to be cognizant of signs and symptoms of eclampsia. They must notify the attending physicians treating the patient as quickly as possible, especially if they are actively seizing and require medication to abort the seizure. Communication between nurses and physicians is vital to ensure that the patients are getting proper intervention. Communication is also important between emergency physicians and obstetricians as the delivery of the fetus may be emergent. Pharmacists review the dosage of medications and check for drug-drug interactions and should report any pharmacological concerns to the clinicians immediately. Ultimately, all members of the interprofessional team care must communicate and be patient-centered to optimize outcomes in eclampsia cases. [Level 5]
