For patients who take prochlorperazine on a short-term basis, there are no recommendations for monitoring. However, some monitoring parameters are recommended for patients with chronic mental illnesses who take the drug long-term.

The concentration of prochlorperazine in the blood is not typically measured. When performed in cases such as suspected overdose, high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry may be performed. The limit for quantifying the metabolite in the plasma is estimated to be around 0.20 ng/ml.

The cytochrome P450 system metabolizes oral prochlorperazine, so monitoring a patient's full list of medications is essential.
