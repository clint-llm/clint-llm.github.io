Examiners frequently check the accommodation reflex during a neurological exam by having the patient focus on a small target like the examiner's fingertip or a pen. The examiner asks the patient to focus on the target used for testing at a distance, and then gradually bring the finger within a few centimeters between the patient's eyes. Look for convergence of eyes and constriction of the pupils.
