The close anatomic relationship of the ulnar artery to the median nerve proximally and the ulnar nerve more distally is worth noting. As the median nerve exits the cubital fossa, it travels distally between the humeral and ulnar head of the pronator teres muscle. The ulnar artery crosses deep to the median nerve and is located deep to the ulnar head of the pronator teres muscle at this level.

In the distal two-thirds of the forearm, the ulnar artery in close anatomic proximity to the ulnar nerve (directly radial to the nerve) with both structures traveling on the radial aspect of the flexor carpi ulnaris. The ulnar artery and ulnar nerve course distally together and enter the hand through the Guyon canal (also known as the ulnar tunnel), a longitudinal fibro-osseous tunnel at the wrist.
