In both sporadic and syndromic cases, neurofibromas are a result of a deletion in the NF1 gene. In sporadic cases, only the lesional cells carry the NF1 mutation. In syndromic cases, neurofibromas are the result of a germline mutation in NF1, encoding the tumor suppressor proteinÂ neurofibromin, on chromosome 17q11.2.
