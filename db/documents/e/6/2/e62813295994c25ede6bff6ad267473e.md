# Continuing Education Activity

The oral cavity is particularly susceptible to the manifestations of viral illnesses. The clinical aspect of viral lesions and the possible causative microorganism is diverse. Thorough knowledge of the physical findings is essential to establish an accurate diagnosis, as timely diagnosis and management limit potential complications. Identifying oral lesions that may be the initial signs of an immunocompromised state is vital and warrant further workup. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of oral lesions of viral etiology and highlights the role of the healthcare team in managing patients with such conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology of common oral manifestations due to viral illness.
- Review the physical exam findings associated with viral lesions of the oral mucosa.
- Summarize the common complications of common viral infections of the oral mucosa.
- Outline the treatment of viral infections of the oral mucosa.

# Introduction

The oral cavity is particularly susceptible to the manifestations of viral illnesses.

Oral lesions associated with viral conditions are encountered in daily practice by a wide range of healthcare providers, including general practitioners, dentists, otolaryngologists, and dermatologists.Herpesviridae, Papillomaviridae, and Poxviridae families, are known to cause oral lesions. RNA viruses, including enteroviruses and paramyxoviruses, can also affect the oral cavity.

Establishing a definitive diagnosis is sometimes tricky.

# Etiology

**DNA Viruses**

**Herpesviridae**

The viruses that belong to the Herpesviridae family are the most common cause of viral infections of the oral cavity.

**Primary Herpetic Gingivostomatitis (PHGS)**

Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is the primary form of infection with herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2). Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are double-stranded DNA viruses that cause mucocutaneous lesions on the oral and genital mucosa.

**Herpes Labialis**

Herpes labialis is the secondary infection with herpes simplex viruses, occurring in about 40% of infected individuals.

**Chicken Pox**

Chickenpox is the primary infection associated with the varicella-zoster virus (VZV or HHV-3).

**Shingles**

Shingles is caused by a secondary infection with the varicella-zoster virus. It occurs due to the reactivation of the dormant virus at the dorsal root ganglion of the spinal nerves, which may occur in immunosuppressed states.

**Infectious Mononucleosis**

Mononucleosis is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV or HHV-4). The Epstein-Barr virus is associated with primary infections but also neoplastic processes.

The primary transmission mode is via close contact with oral secretions due to viral shedding in saliva.

**Oral Hairy Leukoplakia**

Oral hairy leukoplakia is the most common oral lesion caused by the Epstein-Barr virus in patients with AIDS - usually observed with CD4 counts lower than 200 to 300/mm^3.

**Cytomegalovirus**

Cytomegalovirus is also a member of the Herpesviridae family and is otherwise known as HHV-5.

**Kaposi Sarcoma**

Kaposi sarcoma is the most prevalent malignancy seen in untreated HIV patients, and it is associated with the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8).

**Papillomaviridae**

**Human Papilloma Virus**

The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a double-stranded DNA virus that may lead to benign, premalignant, or malignant manifestations in the oral mucosa.

**Verruca Vulgaris**

Verruca vulgaris is a benign lesion also referred to as the common wart, and it is often caused by HPV subtypes 2 and 57.

**Oral Squamous Papilloma**

Oral squamous papillomas are the most common growth in the oral cavity.

**Condyloma Acuminatum**

Condyloma acuminata, also known as genital warts, are caused by the human papillomavirus, mainly subtypes 6 and 11.

**Heck Disease**

Heck disease, also known as focal or multifocal epithelial hyperplasia, is caused by HPV infection with subtypes 13 and 32.

**Poxviridae**

**Molluscum Contagiosum**

Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a DNA virus known as Poxvirus.

**RNA Viruses**

**Enteroviruses**

Enteroviruses, particularly coxsackievirus A and B, are the most common cause of viral infections of the oropharynx.

**Herpangina**

Herpangina is caused by coxsackievirus A, serotypes explicitly 1-10, 16, and 22.

**Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease**

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by the coxsackie virus A16 or enterovirus 71 and is most often found in children younger than ten.

**Acute Lymphonodular Pharyngitis**

Acute lymphonodular pharyngitis is caused by the coxsackie virus type A serotype 10.

**Paramyxoviruses**

**Measles or Rubeola**

Measles, also known as rubeola, is caused by an enveloped RNA virus whose transmission occurs through respiratory droplets. However, the prevalence of measles has significantly decreased due to widespread vaccination.

# Epidemiology

**DNA Viruses**

**Herpesviridae**

****Primary Herpetic Gingivostomatitis (PHGS) and Herpes Labialis****

The worldwide infection rates for herpes simplex viruses range between 60 to 90%.

The infection is usually acquired in childhood by asymptomatic shedders.

**Chicken Pox**

The widespread vaccination for varicella has significantly reduced the incidence of chickenpox and its associated morbidity.

**Shingles**

The lifetime incidence of shingles is estimated to be about 30% for the general population, increasing slightly in patients above the age of 85.

**Infectious Mononucleosis**

Acquisition of the Epstein-Barr virus usually occurs early in childhood and leads to latent infection. It is estimated that greater than 90% of the global population has acquired EBV.

**Oral Hairy Leukoplakia**

Oral hairy leukoplakia caused by EBV is almost exclusively seen in patients with immunocompromised states, such as those with HIV.

**Cytomegalovirus**

The reported rate of seropositivity to CMV in the United States is estimated to be 50%. A higher prevalence is seen with increasing age, particularly in developing countries where rates may be as high as 100%.

**Kaposi Sarcoma**

Four variants of Kaposi sarcoma are recognized, each with specific disease prevalence amongst different patient populations. A classic variant is often seen in males of Mediterranean or Eastern European descent. Patient-specific risk factors, such as chronic steroid use and diabetes, may place them at higher risk.

As its name suggests, immunosuppression-related Kaposi Sarcoma is seen in patients with chronic immunosuppression, particularly solid-organ transplant recipients.

**Papillomaviridae**

**Human Papilloma Virus**

****Verruca Vulgaris, Oral Squamous Papillomas, Condyloma Acuminatum, and Heck's Disease****

The estimated global prevalence of HPV infection is approximately 10%. It is considered the most common sexually transmitted disease, and the highest infection rate is observed in women in their twenties. The prevalence of the disease subsequently decreases with age.

The majority of HPV infections of the oral cavity lead to benign lesions. Squamous papillomas or common warts are most frequently observed in children. Additionally, adults between 30 to 50 years old may also develop oral papillomas. Specific syndromes, such as Down syndrome and Cowden syndrome, have been associated with multiple oral papillomas.

It is worth noting that focal epithelial hyperplasia is associated with a genetic predisposition and is considered an autosomal recessive condition often seen in Native American populations.

**Poxviridae**

**Molluscum contagiosum**

Molluscum contagiosum mainly develops in pediatric patients.****Infection in adults has also been described and, in most cases, occurs in the genital region; therefore considered to be acquired by sexual transmission. It most often occurs in immunocompromised individuals. The infection rate in HIV patients is estimated to be 20%.

**RNA Viruses**

**Enteroviruses**

**Herpangina, Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease, and Acute Lymphonodular Pharyngitis**

Enteroviruses are responsible for various clinical conditions, including HFMD, herpangina, and acute lymphonodular pharyngitis. The patient's age may affect the infection's severity and associated complications. The majority of infections are seen in pediatric patients.Enterovirus infections occur most often in the summer and fall; however, they may happen sporadically year-round too. A higher incidence of viral infection is seen in tropical regions.

**Paramyxoviruses**

**Measles or Rubeola**

The prevalence of measles has reduced significantly since implementing routine childhood vaccination with the MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) jab. This resulted in disease eradication in 2000.

# History and Physical

**DNA Viruses**

**Herpesviridae**

**Primary Herpetic Gingivostomatitis (PHGS)**

As previously stated, PHGS is the primary infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2). Symptoms usually develop after five to ten days of incubation.

The characteristic oral lesions are small vesicles that break and transform into shallow, painful, gray-yellow ulcers.

Oral lesions often accompany systemic symptoms, including fever, sore throat, chills, and lymphadenopathy.

**Herpes Labialis**

Herpes labialis is the secondary infection with the herpes simplex virus due to the reactivation of the dormant virus.

A burning sensation may precede the eruption.

**Chickenpox**

Chickenpox is the primary infection with the varicella-zoster virus. The classic skin lesions are pruritic maculopapular and vesicular eruptions with an erythematous base on the trunk that then spread to extremities.

**Shingles**

Early signs of shingles are pain or paresthesia affecting a specific dermatome due to the involvement of sensory nerves.

Oral involvement is seen when the infection affects the maxillary or mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve.

Moreover, a unilateral vesicular eruption on the oral mucosa and external ear may occur and is referred to as Ramsay Hunt Syndrome. It may be accompanied by unilateral facial nerve palsy due to geniculate ganglion involvement.

**Infectious Mononucleosis**

Even though the infection is asymptomatic in most cases, some patients may experience a triad of fever, reactive adenopathy, and pharyngitis.

**Oral Hairy Leukoplakia**

Oral hairy leukoplakia is an asymptomatic, white patch with a "hairy" appearance that cannot be scraped off. It usually develops on the lateral borders of the tongue.

**Cytomegalovirus**

Most cases of cytomegalovirus infection are asymptomatic, particularly in immunocompetent hosts.

Some patients may develop non-specific oral mucosal ulcerations, particularly in cases of coinfection with HSV or immunocompromised status. The ulcerations may become chronic and involve the lips, buccal mucosa, and oropharynx.

**Kaposi Sarcoma**

The clinical presentation of HHV-8 is characterized by red, blue, or purple macules, nodules, or plaques on the gingiva, hard palate, or tongue's dorsum. The lesions can be single or multiple.

**Papillomaviridae**

**Human Papillomavirus**

**Verruca Vulgaris**

Verruca vulgaris or common warts are benign oral lesions. They are sessile and papillomatous lesions that classically affect the lips, palate, and gingiva.

**Oral Squamous Papilloma**

Papillomas are the most common growth in the oral cavity.

**Condyloma Acuminatum**

Condyloma acutimatum lesions are transmitted sexually and have been reported in the oral cavity.

**Heck's Disease**

Heck's disease is a benign condition that often presents as multiple, painless, white, well-circumscribed papules or plaques in the tongue, labial, and buccal mucosa.

**Poxviridae**

**Molluscum Contagiosum**

Molluscum contagiosum infection often occurs in immunocompromised individuals.

**RNA Viruses**

**Enteroviruses**

**Herpangina**

Herpangina presents as oral vesicular lesions or pseudomembranous ulcers, classically in the posterior oropharynx involving the soft palate and tonsillar pillar. Patients usually report a sore throat.

**Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease**

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is characterized by mucocutaneous lesions and flu-like symptoms, including low-grade fever and generalized malaise.

The skin lesions begin as macular erythema and progress to vesicles. The vesicles may burst, ulcerate and become painful or coalesce to form larger lesions. Cutaneous lesions classically appear on the palms and soles in a linear distribution.

**Acute Lymphonodular Pharyngitis**

Acute lymphonodular pharyngitis is usually associated with other symptoms such as fever and sore throat. The oral lesions are often described as yellow or pink nodules in the posterior oropharynx.

**Paramyxoviruses**

**Measles or Rubeola**

Measles is characterized by three stages. The symptoms of the first stage usually include cough and conjunctivitis. Additionally, patients may develop red macules with a blue or white center located on the buccal mucosa, commonly referred to as Koplik spots. These may precede the second stage by 48 hours.

# Evaluation

**DNA Viruses**

**Herpetoviridae**

**Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (PHGS)**

Diagnosis of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis is based on history and physical exam findings.

Recurrence in immunocompetent individuals is rare, and underlying conditions such as acute leukemia should be investigated.

**Herpes Labialis**

Similar to primary herpetic gingivostomatitis, the diagnosis of herpes labialis is based on clinical findings. The anatomical location of herpes labialis allows for clinical distinction from recurrent aphthous ulcers.

**Chicken Pox**

Diagnosis is usually based on a classic clinical presentation and physical exam findings.

**Shingles**

Reactivated herpes zoster infections are diagnosed based on clinical findings. The most typical clinical sign is the unilateral distribution of the lesions along a specific dermatome.

**Infectious Mononucleosis**

The diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is established when there is EBV-specific IgM in the serum; this is often performed via a mononuclear spot test (heterophile antibody).

**Oral Hairy Leukoplakia**

Diagnosis of oral hairy leukoplakia is often established clinically. The histopathological evaluation of the lesion may also detect EBV. It may be performed with PCR, direct immunofluorescence, or in situ hybridization techniques.

**Cytomegalovirus**

Cytomegalovirus infection is usually seen in patients with HIV/AIDS with CD4 counts of <100cells/mm3.

**Kaposi Sarcoma**

Kaposi sarcoma is diagnosed via biopsy, and a PCR identifies the HHV-8.

**Papillomaviridae**

**Human Papilloma Virus**

**Verruca Vulgaris, Oral Squamous Papillomas, Condyloma Acuminatum, and Heck's Disease**

Oral lesions associated with HPV infection, including verruca vulgaris, squamous papilloma, condyloma acuminatum, and Heck's disease, usually require a biopsy to establish the diagnosis. Specific HPV subtypes are identified with in situ hybridization DNA techniques.

**Poxviridae**

**Molluscum Contagiosum**

Molluscum contagiosum is diagnosed histopathologically. The lesions demonstrate Henderson-Paterson bodies and inclusion bodies in cytoplasm, which are classic findings. Viral identification in the specimen is then performed with in situ hybridization.

**RNA Viruses**

**Enteroviruses**

**Herpangina, Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease, and Acute Lymphonodular Pharyngitis**

Herpangina, acute lymphonodular pharyngitis, and hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) are diagnosed clinically. Serum antibodies may be present and detected on serologic testing. If the diagnosis is questionable, the virus may be cultured from samples of intact vesicles.

**Paramyxoviruses**

**Measles or Rubeola**

Infection is usually diagnosed according to clinical findings. Confirmation with serologic testing may be helpful if the diagnosis is questionable.

# Treatment / Management

**DNA Viruses**

**Herpesviridae**

**Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (PHGS)**

Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis self-resolves after ten to fourteen days and treatment is directed at alleviating symptoms. Patients should be recommended to bed rest, have a soft diet, and increase fluid intake. Oral pain is managed with systemic or topical analgesics, and secondary infection of the lesions can be prevented with chlorhexidine mouthwashes. Immunocompromised or severely unwell patients must be indicated systemic antivirals.

**Herpes Labialis**

Herpes labialis lesions often heal within two weeks without scar formation. However, topical antiviral medication such as penciclovir or acyclovir 5% cream can be indicated during the prodrome stage to reduce the duration of clinical disease.

**Chicken Pox**

Treatment of chickenpox consists of supportive measures: over-the-counter analgesia, increased fluid intake, and a healthy lifestyle. Aspirin should be avoided due to the risk of Reye syndrome.

**Shingles**

Shingles infection is treated with supportive measures, and ulcers are expected to heal in approximately three weeks.

**Infectious Mononucleosis**

In most cases, infectious mononucleosis resolves spontaneously; thus, treatment mainly supports patient-specific symptoms. It is essential to avoid oral antibiotics such as amoxicillin or ampicillin due to the risk of developing a cutaneous eruption.

**Oral Hairy Leukoplakia**

Treatment of oral hairy leukoplakia involves using topical agents such as 0.1% vitamin A and podophyllum.

**Cytomegalovirus**

The recommended antimicrobial therapy for CMV infection is usually intravenous ganciclovir. Foscarnet and cidofovir can also be indicated.

**Kaposi Sarcoma**

Kaposi sarcoma lesions vary in size and location. Treatment depends on the lesion's specific features and ranges from excision, laser destruction, and sclerosing agents to the use of intralesional chemotherapy and radiation.

**Papillomaviridae**

**Human Papillomavirus**

****Verruca Vulgaris, Oral Squamous Papillomas, Condyloma Acuminatum, and Heck's Disease****

Lesions of the oral cavity due to the human papillomavirus, including verruca vulgaris, oral papilloma, and condylomas, require surgical removal. This may be performed with scalpel incision, laser excision, or cryosurgery.

Lesions of focal epithelial hyperplasia or Heck's disease may recur in immunocompromised patients. The recommended therapy includes topical imiquimod 5% cream, cidofovir gel, podofilox solution, or intralesional injection of interferon-alpha.

**Poxviridae**

**Molluscum Contagiosum**

Lesions associated with molluscum contagiosum are usually removed surgically with cryotherapy or chemical destruction with cantharidin.

**Enteroviruses**

****Herpangina, Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease, and Acute Lymphonodular Pharyngitis****

The management of most coxsackie virus A infections is mainly supportive. Symptoms are self-limiting and usually resolve spontaneously within seven to ten days.

**Paramyxoviruses**

**Measles or Rubeola**

The incidence of measles infection has significantly reduced after widespread vaccination.

Treatment with immune serum globulin may be necessary for high-risk populations, including pregnant women, young children, and immunocompromised individuals. It is most effective when administered within six days of exposure to the virus.

# Differential Diagnosis

- Squamous cell carcinoma

- Candidiasis

- Primary or secondary syphilis

- Gonorrhea

- Tuberculosis

- Bacterial pharyngitis

- Pemphigus vulgaris

- Geographic tongue

# Prognosis

Most viral infections in the oral cavity resolve spontaneously and are managed with supportive therapy. However, severe untreated conditions may lead to significant comorbidity. Recognizing specific high-risk viral organisms that may impact patients' prognoses is vital. For example, HPV and herpes viruses are synergistic in developing oral malignancy.

Specifically, EBV, HHV-8, and CMV are associated with malignant neoplasms, including lymphomas, nasopharyngeal or gastric carcinomas, Kaposi's sarcoma, and Castleman's disease.

# Complications

**DNA Viruses**

**Herpesviridae**

**Primary Herpetic Gingivostomatitis (PHGS) and Herpes Labialis**

Primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (PHGS) and herpes labialis can potentially recur, mainly in immunocompromised patients. The untreated cases lead to the dissemination of the infection.

Additionally, reactivation of HSV-1, particularly in the geniculate ganglion, may lead to Bell palsy.

**Chicken Pox**

In cases of severe chickenpox infection, patients may experience severe complications, including Reye's syndrome, encephalitis, and Guillan Barre.

**Shingles**

Long-term complications of shingles infection include postherpetic neuralgia and severe pain in affected areas after the resolution of the infection. This is due to scarring of the affected sensory nerve. Additionally, patients may experience hyperpigmentation and scarring of affected areas.

**Infectious Mononucleosis**

Several complications associated with EBV infection are recognized. These include hepatitis, aplastic anemia, or splenic rupture.

**Oral Hairy Leukoplakia**

Oral hairy leukoplakia is a benign lesion, and malignant transformation has not been described. However, due to the location of lesions and potential size, patients may experience mild complications such as oral burning or pain.

**Cytomegalovirus**

Cytomegalovirus may lead to complications in at-risk populations, e.g., infection in pregnancy can cause fetal transmission and illness. In immunocompromised patients, the infection may disseminate and cause retinitis and blindness.

**Kaposi Sarcoma**

Potential complications of Kaposi sarcoma include ulceration and associated bleeding.

**Papillomaviridae**

**Human Papillomavirus**

******Verruca Vulgaris, Oral Squamous Papillomas, Condyloma Acuminatum, and Heck's Disease******

Human papillomavirus infection and its long-term implications are still not completely understood. Most benign lesions are associated with low-risk HPV subtypes, usually cleared from the oral mucosa with time.

A high-risk subtype, HPV-16, is known to remain in the oral and oropharyngeal mucosa and contribute to HPV-positive oropharyngeal malignancy. The risk of HPV persistence in oral mucosa is particularly increased in smokers.

**Poxviridae**

**Molluscum Contagiosum**

Generally, the disease resolves within six months, but cases where the condition has remained for several years, have been described.

Additionally, patients with immunodeficiency experience larger and refractory lesions with more extensive involvement of the oral mucosa. Some may also develop eczema molluscorum: eczematous plaques around the lesions.

**Enteroviruses**

******Herpangina, Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease, and Acute Lymphonodular Pharyngitis******

Oral lesions and pain caused by coxsackie virus infection may result in dehydration. Additionally, those with severe illness may experience neurologic involvement, like encephalitis or aseptic meningitis.

**Paramyxoviruses**

**Measles or Rubeola**

Complications of primary measles infection are rare due to decreased disease prevalence; however, several complications were described before vaccination. These included pneumonia, keratoconjunctivitis leading to blindness, and CNS infections, including acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, measles inclusion body encephalitis, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

As the information provided in this article suggests, the majority of viral infections of the oral mucosa are benign and self-limiting. However, some conditions may progress and lead to potentially life-threatening complications. Moreover, the development of specific oral lesions of viral nature may suggest undiagnosed immunodeficiency and increase the risk of malignancy.

For this reason, patients should be discouraged from disregarding benign-appearing lesions or mild symptoms. This will allow for adequate treatment initiation, appropriate specialist referral, and optimal disease prevention as warranted.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

Viral infections have a preference for targeting the oral mucosa.

Patients may experience oral pain and systemic symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, and generalized malaise. These symptoms prompt patients to seek medical attention, usually through a primary care physician, dentist, or otolaryngologist. Potential complications of these conditions, including decreased oral intake and dehydration, may lead to visits to the emergency department.

In immunocompetent individuals, most viral infections of the oral mucosa resolve after two weeks with symptomatic treatment. However, in some cases, an interprofessional team of physicians may be needed to establish a definitive diagnosis, initiate therapy and refer high-risk patients appropriately. This team involves several clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), including primary physicians, dentists, otolaryngologists, pathologists, nurses, and pharmacists.

While clinicians will determine the overall course of diagnosis and management, nursing will help coordinate communication between the various clinical entities, provide patient counsel, and assist in examinations and monitoring patient progress. Pharmacists will verify appropriate agent selection and dosing, as well as perform medication reconciliation. An infectious disease specialty pharmacist may be necessary in more challenging cases to optimize treatment. Open communication between all interprofessional team members is crucial to optimizing the management of these infections.

Proper coordination and communication of the interprofessional healthcare team will minimize morbidity associated with prolonged, severe, or untreated disease.[Level 5]
