Fistula is an abnormal communication between two epithelial surfaces. This definition is not without exceptions. It is a general description to differentiate fistulae from sinuses

As the definition implies, fistula connects 2 different surfaces or lumens. It often starts from an offending side and makes its way to an adjacent lumen or surface. An intestinal fistula is a fistula that starts from the intestine. It could connect to a variety of adjacent organs or surfaces. Common examples of intestinal fistulae are: entero-cutaneous fistula, enter-enteric fistula, entero-vesical fistula,

Fistulae are named according to the surfaces or organs they connect like the entero-vesical fistula or the entero-cutaneous fistula.

Intestinal fistulae are a challenging surgical condition. Assessment, management, and prognosis depend on the complexity of the fistula and the underlying etiology. In this article, fistulae starting from the intestine both small and large intestine will be the focus of discussion. Details of specific fistulae will not beÂ included.
