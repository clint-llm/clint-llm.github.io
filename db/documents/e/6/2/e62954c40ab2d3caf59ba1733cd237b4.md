**Acute Allograft Rejection is Classified into Two Pathophysiological Subtypes**

- Acute cellular rejection- A more common form of acute rejection mediated by a T cell immune response against major histocompatibility complex antigens in the donor's lung and usually occurs within the first year of transplant.

- Acute antibody-mediated rejection- As the name suggests, a few weeks to months after the transplant, a separate antibody-mediated pathological process against donor HLA antigens or autoantigens can cause acute respiratory impairment.

**Chronic Lung Allograft Dysfunction (CLAD)**

CLAD is a term coined for any evidence of a decline in lung function beyond a year after transplant and persisting for more than 3 weeks. Based on the physiology of pulmonary function impairment and the microscopic pathology, it has two distinct phenotypes:

- Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BO)– predominantly obstructive disease

2. Restrictive allograft syndrome– predominantly restrictive disease
