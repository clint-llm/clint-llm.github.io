It is essential to obtain both blood and ascitic fluid analysis to diagnose and evaluate chylous ascites (CA). Standard blood tests are required and include a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, lipid profile, liver function tests, total protein, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), amylase, and lipase.

The following tests are considered on a case-by-case basis and depending on the clinical presentation:

**Abdominal Paracentesis**

It****is essential in the diagnosis of CA. CA is suspected when ascites appear milky. A triglyceride level in the ascitic fluid should be obtained, and a concentration greater than 200 mg/dL supports the diagnosis. Fat globules and leucocytes with a predominance of lymphocytes are shown after staining with Sudan III and undergoing microscopic examination. If tuberculosis is suspected, acid-fast bacilli smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be performed. Adenosine deaminase is considered both a sensitive (93%) and a specific (94%) diagnostic test for peritoneal tuberculosis, but in some cases, a peritoneal biopsy may be needed.

**Lipoprotein Electrophoresis**

It is considered a gold standard in the diagnosis of CA by identifying chylomicrons. Elevated ascitic fluid triglyceride levels are the best parameter for diagnosing CA. With a sensitivity and specificity of up to 95%, a recent study has suggested a triglyceride cutoff point of 187 mg/dL (2.13 mmol/L) or a range of 148 to 246 mg/dL (1.69 to 2.80 mmol/L) to establish CA.

**Cytology and Peritoneal Biopsy**

These are important diagnostic tools in the work-up of CA.

**Computed Tomography (CT**)**of the Abdomen**

This is useful to diagnose abdominal masses and lymph nodes in some cases of CA. Fat fluid level is the pathognomonic feature of chylous ascites on a CT scan, which can be demonstrated by positioning the patient in a supine position for some time before imaging is done. Because the specific gravity of lipids is less than that of water, it leads to the formation of a fat fluid level, which may also be seen by ultrasonography.

**Lymphangiography**

It****is considered a gold standard in the diagnosis of CA in cases of lymphatic obstruction. Lymphangiography and lymphoscintigraphy are effective in the selection of patients for surgery, assessment of the effects of treatment outcomes, detection of abnormalities in the retroperitoneal nodes, in addition to detection of any leakage, fistulization, and permeation of the thoracic duct.

**Other Tests**

CA-125 could be particularly elevated in patients with cirrhosis and chylous ascites.
