The APOE gene locus has three main variants, namely E2, E3, and E4, which results in three homozygous (E2E2, E3E3, and E4E4) and three heterozygous (E2E3, E3E4, and E4E2) genotypes. The E3E3 is the most frequent APOE genotype in humans and hence E3E3 form is considered the wildtype.

Dysbetalipoproteinemia prevalence is variable depending on the definition used to determine the condition. Previous studies differed in their inclusion or exclusion of E2/E2 genotype, autosomal dominant mutations, VLDL-cholesterol/plasma TG ratio >0.30 on gel electrophoresis, TG/ApoB ratio, and total cholesterol/Apo B ratio. One study definition states if a patient has a total cholesterol level > 90th percentile & E2/E2 genotype, they are diagnosed with dysbetalipoproteinemia. Prevalence demonstrated in this study was 0.1% or 1 in 1000 in the whole population.

In contrast, another older study definition stated a VLDL-cholesterol/plasma TG ratio >0.30 on gel electrophoresis was needed to diagnose the disease. This study had a prevalence of 0.4% in men and 0.2% in women.

In homozygous apoE2 genotype, there are more hypolipidemic rather than hyperlipidemic.

Men and postmenopausal women are more predisposed than premenopausal women as they do not have the benefit of estrogen. Estrogen affects lipolytic processing and LDL receptor expression.
