Gilbert syndrome is associated with unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia; the bilirubin is typically below 4 mg/dL; however, the bilirubin level can fluctuate depending on exacerbating factors.

Diagnostic imaging of the liver and biliary treeÂ is generally not required unless the provider is considering another diagnosis. As previously discussed, liver biopsy is rarely indicated unless one suspects another acute or chronic liver disorder. Provocative testing with a 48 hour fast or low-calorie diet is generally not indicated. Genetic testing with assays of UG1A1 activity and polymerase chain reaction to identify gene polymorphisms in the TATAA box of UG1A1 should be considered for diagnostic uncertainty.

The provider should have a low threshold to consider other liver diseases that may cause hyperbilirubinemia before diagnosing Gilbert syndrome, as outlined above. If viral hepatitis is suspected, serologic tests for hepatitis A, B, and C should be considered.
