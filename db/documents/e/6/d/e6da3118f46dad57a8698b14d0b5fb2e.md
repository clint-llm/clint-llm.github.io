Tip-shaping or refinement is a common request during a consultation for cosmetic nasal surgery.  However, surgery of the nasal tip has a unique set of functional and aesthetic challenges that must be understood by the rhinoplasty surgeon to ensure a successful outcome. Unfortunately, poor nasal tip cosmesis or function is a frequent factor leading dissatisfied patients to seek secondary or revision rhinoplasty surgeries.  Understanding the anatomic relationships of the nasal tip allows the surgeon to competently perform the surgical maneuvers required to create desired aesthetic changes while preserving function.
