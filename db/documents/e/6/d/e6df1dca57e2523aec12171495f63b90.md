Daptomycin is FDA-approved for administration by the intravenous route. It is available as 350 mg sterile, preservative-free, pale yellow to light brown lyophilized powder for injection, reconstituted as 50 mg per ml in a single-dose vial. It is administered every 24 hours in patients with a creatinine clearance greater than 30 mL/min. The frequency of administration in patients with renal impairment (CrCl less than 30 mL/min) is every 48 hours. The dose of daptomycin required is indication-specific. Administration of the desired dose should be over 30 minutes in adults and children over the age of 7. Daptomycin should be infused over 60 minutes in children one to six years of age. Daptomycin administration can also be an intravenous push over 2 minutes in adult patients only.

**Pharmacodynamics/Pharmacokinetics**

Route of Administration: Intravenous

Inhibition of bacterial growth: Bactericidal

PK/PD parameter:  Area under the concentration-time curve to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio (correlates well with its antimicrobial activity)

Absorption: Not applicable

The onset of action: Daptomycin has a rapid onset of action

Distribution: Large volume of distribution at steady-state (approximately 1.0 L/kg) in healthy adult patients. The volume of distribution at steady-state in pediatric and critically-ill patients is significantly lower.

Protein Binding: 90% to 93%; 84% to 88% in patients with a creatine clearance less than 30 mL/min.

Metabolism: Research ash detected minimal amounts of oxidative metabolites. In vitro studies suggest human liver microsomes do not metabolize daptomycin.

Clearance: 8.3 to 9 mL/min/kg in adults with normal renal function. Pediatric patients have demonstrated increased clearance.

Half-life: 8 to 9 hours in healthy adults with normal renal function. The elimination half-life can be significantly prolonged in patients with renal impairment (up to 28 hours). Pediatric patients show a shorter elimination half-life.

Excretion: Daptomycin is primarily eliminated as an unchanged drug in the urine (78%), with a lesser amount eliminated in feces (5.7%).
