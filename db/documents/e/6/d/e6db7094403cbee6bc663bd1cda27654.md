Once a patient is diagnosed with pulmonary artery sling (PAS) and undergoing preparation for surgery needs a complete series of tests to prepare thoroughly. These examinations include chest radiograph, CT/CTA, MR/MRA, electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiogram, and bronchoscopy.

The anesthesia team should perform endotracheal intubation for patients with proper preparation for a "difficult airway." Flexible bronchoscopy should also be performed before incision. For a gentle neck extension, a shoulder roll is useful.
