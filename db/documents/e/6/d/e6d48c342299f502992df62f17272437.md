Tropical pulmonary eosinophiliaÂ can occur in any tropical area but most commonly found in filarial endemic regions like the Indian subcontinent, South East Asia, South America, and Africa. Due to an increased frequency of migration between the continents, this disease is increasing in Western countries. TPE is more likely to occur in non-immune individuals (persons who traveled to the endemic regions) than in the individuals permanently residing in endemic regions due to immunity developed against the filarial infections. TPE is 4 to 7 times more common in males than in females. TPE most commonly affects young adults. The severity of infection is usually high in immunocompromised individuals.
