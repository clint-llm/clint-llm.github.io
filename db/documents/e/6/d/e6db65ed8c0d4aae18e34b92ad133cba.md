Patient education and counseling are the cornerstones of the management of tuberculosis. Proper education materials should be provided to the at-risk population to increase the early detection of tuberculosis. Once a patient is diagnosed with tuberculosis, importance should be given to the fact that the patient is being provided with adequate information regarding the disease they are suffering from and the ways they could adopt to prevent the transmission of the disease to their families. The patient must be taught about the proper drug regimen, the importance of treatment compliance, and the symptoms of any drug toxicities, and to communicate it to the healthcare provider for the proper optimization of the drug regimen.
