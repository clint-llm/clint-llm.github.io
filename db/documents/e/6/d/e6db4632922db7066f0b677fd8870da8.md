B. cereus can be confirmed as the source of a foodborne outbreak by (1) isolation of strains of the same serotype from a food source and the feces or vomitus of a patient, (2) isolation of large numbers of B. cereus serotype known to cause foodborne illness from the food/feces/vomitus of a patient, or (3) isolation of B. cereus from suspect foods and confirmation of the enterotoxin through serology (for the diarrheal toxin) or biological tests (diarrheal and emetic).

In extraintestinal infections, evaluation is made with body fluid analysis. For example, the diagnosis of endophthalmitis can beÂ made by the gram-staining of vitreous fluid.

It is important to note that bacillus species in blood cultures is often considered a contaminant. In the correct clinical setting, this should be regarded as true bacteremia rather than contamination.
