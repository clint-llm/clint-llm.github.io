Accreditation of simulation programs is a relatively new concept. Since 2010, the Society of Simulation in Healthcare (SSH) has been accrediting programs nationally and internationally. This commendation assures a simulation center’s learners, as well as to said center’s administration and stakeholders, that the center follows best practices in the creation, development, maintenance, and expansion of enterprises pertaining to simulation in healthcare. For the Society of Simulation in Healthcare (SSH), accreditation is defined as a “peer-reviewed, customized evaluation of a healthcare simulation program.” Such an evaluation aims to ensure that the program adheres to a high standard by providing quality healthcare education. To meet the requirements outlined by SSH, the applying program must apply for “Core” as well as at least one other area, including Assessment, Research, Teaching/Education, or Systems Integration.
