Spontaneous intestinal perforation of the newborn, also known as focal intestinal perforation or isolated perforation, is a single intestinal perforation typically occurring at the terminal ileum. It is a life-threatening condition that affects very low birth weight infants (birth weight <1500 g) and deficient birth weight infants (birth weight <1000 g).

Spontaneous intestinal perforation is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The perforation location is most commonly focal and involves the antimesenteric border of the terminal ileum.
