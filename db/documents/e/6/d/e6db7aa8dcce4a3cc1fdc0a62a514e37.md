The complications inherent to medical laser procedures are surgical fire, iatrogenic burns to surrounding tissues, and ocular injury.

**Risk of fire**: Following electrosurgical devices, surgical lasers are considered the second most common source of operating room fires.

If an airway fire occurs:

- Remove the fuel source (immediately remove the ETT and other burning fragments).

- Remove the source of ignition (stop the laser).

- Eliminate the oxidizer flow (disconnect the circuit, and stop ventilation and the delivery of gasses).

- Extinguish the remaining fire, if any, with saline.

- Continue anesthesia (via intravenous route).

- Mask ventilate with 100% FiO2.

- Perform direct/video laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy to assess the damage and remove debris. Bronchial lavage may be needed to wash out fragments.

- Re-establish the airway (e.g., re-intubate, place a laryngeal mask).

- Assess for damage to the oropharynx and face.

- Consider ICU admission and tracheostomy if needed.

**Risk of Iatrogenic Burns**

Apart from being a result of airway fires, burns can occur due to accidental exposure of tissues to laser or from the reflection of the laser beam from reflective surfaces in the operative field. The presence of a cuffed ETT limits the possibility of the beam reaching the distal trachea and airway without rupturing the cuff balloon first. Applying saline-soaked gauze to the mucosal areas adjacent to the surgery site is an effective way to prevent such collateral damage.

**Ocular Injury**

Ocular injuries result from the direct exposure of the eye to the laser or a reflection of the beam. Depending on the physical properties of the laser, several structures can be affected, yet the most commonly involved are the cornea (water-rich) and retina (pigment-rich). Personnel outside the operating room must be warned of using a laser via appropriate signage on the outer surface of all doors to the laser OR. Any windows into the laser OR should be covered with opaque coverings. The risk of ocular injury can be significantly decreased by using wavelength-specific filters on safety glasses worn by the patient and operating room personnel.

Other laser hazards, like laser plumes, have been shown to have cancerogenic potential. These can be mitigated by using plume scavenging systems and personal high-efficiency filtering masks.
