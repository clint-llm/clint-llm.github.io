The interprofessional healthcare team for patients with floppy eyelid syndrome potentially includes a team of optometrists, ophthalmologists, PCPs, sleep medicine specialists, and nursing staff. Further medical education on diagnosing and early recognizing FES is essential to avoid sight-threatening conditions. Educating PCPs on the strong association between OSA and FES could facilitate a timely referral to the eye doctor if the PCP team suspects OSA or if a sleep medicine specialist diagnoses OSA.
