MGD is a chronically recurring disease. Though patients tend to have temporary relief, symptoms reappear after some time, following either medical or advanced treatments. Thus it is essential to explain to the patient the nature of the disease need for regular follow-ups and interventions as needed. The patient should also be taught about modifications in daily lifestyle, which can help in preventing the disease recurrence. Following any intervention, either probing, thermal laser treatment, or IPL patient needs topical medications, frequent lid hygiene, warm compresses to prevent blocking of the meibomian ducts, and easy expression of meibum.
