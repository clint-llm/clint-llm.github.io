The infraclavicular block is a regional anesthetic technique developed to avoid the side effects and complications of supraclavicular blocks, particularly pneumothorax. It can be used for postoperative pain control for upper extremity surgeries such as the elbow, forearm, or hand. This activity describes the indications, contraindications, and potential complications of the infraclavicular block and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Discuss the technique for performing an infraclavicular block.
- Describe the indications for an infraclavicular block.
- Specify the complications associated with an infraclavicular block.
- Employ a structured, interprofessional team approach to provide effective care to and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing infraclavicular blocks.
