**Classification**

There have been several ways to classify cervical lymph nodes, which can become quickly confusing for students.

- Superiorly by the horizontal line defined by the lower border of the cricoid cartilage

- Inferiorly by the clavicle

- Medially (anteriorly) by the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle or sensory branches of cervical plexus

- Posteriorly (laterally) by the anterior border of the trapezius muscle

The Virchow node (VN), named in honor of the German pathologist Rudolf Virchow, is an end node or the most proximal of left supraclavicular lymph nodes. Unlike the rest of the left supraclavicular lymph nodes, it belongs to the IV level which is near the jugulo-subclavian venous confluence and, usually, lying on the scalenus anterior muscle and posterior to the platysma and the sternocleidomastoid muscles.

**Anatomical boundaries**

The supraclavicular lymph node chains have an investing fat pad, which is bounded by the following structures

- Posteriorly: by the scalene muscles; hence, which leads to their reference as scalene nodes in some texts

- Anteriorly: by the sternocleidomastoid muscle

- Medially: by the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein

- Laterally by lateral edge of the sternocleidomastoid

**Drainage**

Generally speaking, both right and left supraclavicular lymph nodes drain the neck via efferent lymphatic vessels coming from the accessory nerve lymph node chains, which belong to sublevel Va.
