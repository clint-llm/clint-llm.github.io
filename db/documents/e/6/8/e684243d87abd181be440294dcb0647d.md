The treatment of cholesterol embolization syndrome is primarily medical, consisting of risk factor reduction. Patients should be educated about ways to reduce their risk factors. Diet and exercise should be advised to help with blood pressure control. Smoking cessation should be strongly recommended. The importance of medication compliance and regular follow up at the appointments, especially primary care physician and nephrology follow-up, should be stressed.Â Surgical or endovascular treatment may be indicated if a clear embolic source is identified, and the patient is an appropriate candidate for surgery. In that case, time should be taken to clearly explain to the patient the risk versus benefits of the indicated treatment. The patient should be given an idea about the prognosis, and discussion should be initiated about the code status and advance directives.
