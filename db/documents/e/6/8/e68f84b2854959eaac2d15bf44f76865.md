Unfortunately, due to methodological differences, inconsistencies in definition, and multiple surgical approaches, retrospective reviews found an incidence range ranging from zero to 100%. However, looking broadly, a majority of those studies report that greater than 30% of craniotomy patients suffered from PCH.

Chronic PCH, which is commonly seen with excision of acoustic neuromas, has an incidence of 28.4% at three years postoperatively.
