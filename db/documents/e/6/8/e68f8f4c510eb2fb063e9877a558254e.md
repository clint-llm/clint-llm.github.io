Postoperative care and recovery vary depending on the degree of injury and subsequent repair methods involved. Regardless, the patient should be advised to refrain from strenuous activity for at least two weeks to allow for complete healing with minimal bruising and swelling. Depending on the fractures involved, ancillary care postoperatively may include lubricating eye drops (orbital fractures), nasal irrigations (communication with the sinonasal contents), oral rinses (intraoral incisions used), or soft diet (mandible fractures/malocclusion). Incision lines require antibiotic ointment application (must be an ophthalmic ointment for periorbital incisions) for at least 72 hours postoperatively and then transitioned to petroleum ointment thereafter until the incisions heal completely. Avoidance of sun exposure and/or proper sun protection, as well as the use of silicone-based scar creams/ointments, may help improve the appearance of any scars. The patient should be followed closely postoperatively for any potential complications, namely related to infection and/or visual complaints. Visits usually occur one week postoperatively and then a few weeks thereafter up until the fractures appear stable and any complications are ruled out.
