Fibrosarcomas derive from a mesenchymal cell origin, composed of spindle-cell fibroblasts with uncontrolled proliferation. Most frequently, fibrosarcomas originate from tendons and fascias of deep tissues, but may also occur within the medullary canal or the periosteum of bones. Pre-existing bone lesions or irradiated tissues may also give rise to secondary fibrosarcomas of the bone.
