In pediatric patients: bronchogenic cysts may cause life-threatening compressive symptoms.

In adults: bronchogenic cysts are often incidental radiologic findings.

- Symptoms are secondary to cyst infection or compression of adjacent structures.

- Fistulized bronchogenic cysts cause cough, fever, sputum production, and hemoptysis.

- Non-fistulized bronchogenic cysts are usually responsible for chest pain.

- Pericystic pneumonitis or pneumonia in the adjacent compressed lung are responsible for fever and shortness of breath.
