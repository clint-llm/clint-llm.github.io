The relative afferent pupillary defect is seen in various disorders (see pathophysiology). All the causes may not cause clinically appreciable RAPD.

The causes include:

**Lesions of the Optic Nerve and Visual Pathway**

- Lesions of the optic nerve

- Lesions of the optic chiasm

- Lesions of optic tract

- Lesions of pretectum

- Glaucoma

- Visual field defect

**Lesions of the Retina/Posterior Segment**

- Retinal detachment

- Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO)

- Central serous chorioretinopathy

- Macular degeneration

- Retinitis pigmentosa

- Endophthalmitis

**Induced RAPD of the Contralateral Eye**

- Dense cataract

- Eye patching

- Dark adaptation

**Miscellaneous**

- Amblyopia

- Anisocoria

Lesions of the optic tract, pretectum, dense cataract, and eye patching/dark adaptation produce RAPD in the contralateral eye.
