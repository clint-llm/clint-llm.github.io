In the ED, nifedipine was given once for hypertension, and her blood pressure responded appropriately. The patient also had a 4/5 headache that was treated with acetaminophen and ibuprofen, and it improved. Nephrology was consulted. The specialist recommended a renal ultrasound and other labs as well as starting amlodipine 5 mg daily. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further management.

The patient was started on nifedipine (calcium channel blocker, anti-hypertensive) for her hypertension and then ultimately discharged on carvedilol. Furthermore, for coagulation prophylaxis, she was started on low-dose aspirin due to arteritis involving the left common carotid and vertebral artery.

Rheumatology was also consulted and recommended to start low-dose steroids and mycophenolic acid to help decrease the amount of arterial inflammation.

Nephrology was also consulted in conjunction with cardiology for blood pressure management. In addition to starting anti-hypertensive medications, she was placed on daily fluid restriction.
