The American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) recommends that all patients undergoing general anesthesia with inhalation and/or IV anesthetic agents have standard ASA monitoring. Standard 1 involves the presence of qualified anesthesia personnel. Standard 2 requires monitoring of ventilation, oxygenation, temperature, and circulation. Ventilation is monitored with end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) and inspired anesthetic gases, and oxygenation monitoring is with pulse oximetry (SpO2) and inspired O2 (with alarms). Temperature can be tracked via skin, esophageal, bladder rectal temperatures. Circulation monitoring is with continuous heart monitoring, blood pressure measurements every 5 minutes, andÂ electrocardiogram.

Intraoperative monitoring with a bispectral index (BIS), while not foolproof, can be helpful to assess for changes in the level of sedation. This EEG device will measure brain activity from 0 to 100, with values below 40 usually indicate deep sedation.

Inhaled anesthetics produce skeletal muscle relaxation and affect sensory nerve conduction. During procedures where motor evoked potentials and somatosensory evoked potentials are required for neuromonitoring, the recommendation is to use lower doses of all the inhaled anesthetics or eliminate them and add an intravenous anesthetic.
