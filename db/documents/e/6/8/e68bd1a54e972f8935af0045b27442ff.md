Electrodiagnostic testing is an essential component in the evaluation of patients with a suspected myopathy. There are different types of myopathies, including hereditary and acquired forms, and many specialists have involvement in the care of patients with muscle disorders, including neurologists, physiatrists, rheumatologists, pulmonologists, cardiologists, orthopedic surgeons, and others. This activity will outline the pathophysiological basis for electrodiagnostic testing in disorders of muscle, explain the clinical significance of the test, and highlight the importance of the team approach in evaluating patients with myopathies.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the pathophysiological basis for electrodiagnostic testing in disorders of muscle.
- Describe the typical electrodiagnostic findings in myopathies.
- Review patterns and topographical distribution of abnormal electrodiagnostic signs in different types of myopathies.
- Explain the role of electrodiagnostic testing in the complex diagnostic approach towards patients with myopathy.
