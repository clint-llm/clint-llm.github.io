**Keratorefractive Surgery**:

AS-OCT can be used to determine eligibility for keratorefractive surgery, such as laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) or photorefractive keratectomy (PRK). Patients eligible for keratorefractive surgery must be 18 years or older, have stable refraction for a year or longer, and absent ocular and corneal pathology.

Central corneal thickness (CCT) < 480 μm is two standard deviations below that of a normal cornea and is contraindicated in both LASIK and PRK.

Corneal topography and tomography are also used post-surgically to evaluate residual corneal structure, complications, and if reoperation would be beneficial for a patient with unsatisfactory results.

Galilei is a dual Scheimpflug system commonly used in keratorefractive surgery. By combining corneal surface data and elevation data from Placido disc topography and Scheimpflug imaging, respectively, Galilei can obtain all necessary preoperative keratorefractive surgery measurements. It also delivers excellent accuracy and has the most repeatability than other Scheimpflug devices.

**Keratoconus**:

Keratoconus (KC) is the most common etiology of non-inflammatory thinning of the cornea, called corneal ectasia, causing distortion and conical bulging.

Amsler-Krumeich is an older classification system that was created before many modern, frequently used imaging techniques were developed. A new grading system, ABCD, incorporates anterior (A) and posterior (B) radii of corneal curvature, thinnest pachymetry (C), and visual acuity best-corrected for distance (D). Because the posterior elevation is included as one of its criteria for classification, it serves as a potential grading system in identifying subclinical or at-risk KC.

Before clinical keratoconus is diagnosed (Figures 3A-D), there are signs of subclinical keratoconus (Figures 4A-D). However, differentiating between pre-keratoconus and normal eyes is challenging. There are no widely accepted criteria for establishing such a diagnosis. Keratoconus suspect refers to patients deemed high risk for developing keratoconus based on clinical suspicion alone. Subclinical keratoconus has more tangible evidence in regards to pachymetry, curvature, and elevation though there are no standard cutoff values.  Forme fruste keratoconus (FFK) has an asymmetric bowtie pattern with stable refraction and corneal curvature.

When looking at the anterior surface of the cornea, the cone location and magnitude index (CLMI) uses axial and tangential maps to compare the steepest part of the cornea to the rest to evaluate for KC. The average outside the circle subtracts a 2-mm diameter circle of the steepest average of the cornea (C1), and the difference is called M1. Another 2-mm circle (C2), with the same distance from the center of the cornea as C1 (called r) 180 degrees away, is averaged and subtracted from the average outside circle C2 (labeled as M2). CLMI is then calculated as M1 – M2 if the center of C1 is located outside a 2-mm diameter circumference from the center of the cornea. If not, then CLMI is M1 – (r 3 M2). CLMI using the axial map was the strongest predictor of KC, at a threshold of 0.45.

Corneal tomography is superior to slit-lamp examination alone in the diagnosis of both clinical and subclinical pathology.

When using the Pentacam system, there are many keratorefractive indices to determine keratoconus diagnosis (see Table 2, adapted from Motlagh et al.).

Belin/Ambrósio Enhanced Ectasia Display (BAD) is available on Pentacam and optimizes the concept of the best fit sphere or best fit toric ellipsoid, for keratoconus detection. Called “enhanced BFS,” BAD ignores a 4 mm optical zone containing the thinnest section of the cornea and best fits the remainder of the cornea. In keratoconus, the thinnest section protrudes out and can erroneously skew results to be steeper. By excluding this zone, BAD can focus on the surrounding areas which are at risk for ectasia.

Galilei is also used to evaluate keratoconus, and its measurements are listed in Table 3. However, cutoff values for distinguishing subclinical KC is less accurate than those for clinical KC.

Asphericity asymmetry index (AAI) is the absolute difference between the maximum negative and maximum positive elevation value in relation to the best fit toric aspheric (BFTA) reference surface. AAI’s closer to zero means the corneal surface curvature is roughly equivalent and has little variability. AAI of the posterior corneal curvature is very reliable in detecting clinical KC, with a 100% sensitivity and 99.5% specificity. Normal posterior AAI is generally thought to be less than 20-25 μm. Though there is no standard cutoff for subclinical KC, previous studies have shown posterior AAI to be a promising index, one with a cutoff of 21.5 μm and another of 13.5 μm. However, there needs to be research to validate posterior AAI for ectasia screening further. Anterior AAI is not reliable for neither KC nor subclinical KC. AAI is also known as the Kranemann-Arce index.

**Cataract Surgery**:

For cataract surgery, the defective cataract is removed and replaced with an artificial intraocular lens (IOL). If there is astigmatism, the patient will require a toric IOL to offset that corneal defect. Which toric lens and at which angle of implantation can be determined using corneal tomography. Postoperatively, corneal imaging can be used to detect complications such as Descemet membrane detachment and incorrect incision site closures.

**Glaucoma Assessment**:

Using AS-OCT, information regarding the anterior chamber angle, depth, and anatomy can be obtained and potentially be used to evaluate for glaucoma risk. However, clinical evaluation and gonioscopy remain the standard.

**Corneal Surface Disorders**:

Corneal topography is useful in tracking surface changes such as pterygiums and scars. AS-OCT, in particular, helps evaluate deeper changes to the cornea, such as foreign bodies.

**Corneal Transplant**:

Tomography can be used to evaluate the thickness and health of the donor tissue, essential for a successful transplant. In the recipient, clear knowledge of the precise diseased layer allows less unnecessary tissue removal, resulting in a better rate of graft survival and fewer complications.
