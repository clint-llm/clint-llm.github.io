With alfentanil being an opioid-class analgesic, it has adverse effects common to this group of medications, including respiratory depression, decreased gastrointestinal motility, sedation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and intestinal bloating. An interesting note about alfentanil is that it causes less intense respiratory depression than fentanyl, likely due to its lower total body clearance, smaller volume of distribution, and shorter half-life than other commonly used similar opioid analgesics, such as fentanyl and sufentanil. Additional adverse effects noted to be more specific to alfentanil include hypotension, chest wall rigidity, bradycardia, and tachycardia.
