Hemorrhoids are naturally occurring vascular tissues within the submucosa in the anal canal and comprise loose connective tissue, smooth muscle, and blood vessels with many arteriovenous connections (why hemorrhoidal bleeding is typically bright red). Hemorrhoids are thought to aid in stool continence by providing bulk to the anal canal. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology and presentation of internal hemorrhoids and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in their management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for hemorrhoids. 
- Describe the presentation of internal hemorrhoids.
- Summarize the treatment of internal hemorrhoids
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by internal hemorrhoids.
