There are 3 major types of urinary incontinence:

- Stress urinary incontinence

- Urgency urinary incontinence

- Mixed urinary incontinence

There are also a variety of subtypes including genitourinary (fistula, infectious, congenital) and non-genitourinary (functional, environmental, pharmacological, metabolic). Classification is endorsed by the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA)/International Incontinence Society (ICS).

Stress incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine with increased intraabdominal pressure or physical exertion (coughing, sneezing, jumping, lifting, exercise). The pathophysiology is due to pelvic floor weakness/prolapse and/or loss of the normal urethra vesical angle.

Urge incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine preceded by a sudden and severe desire to pass urine. Bladder contractionsÂ may be stimulated by a change in body position (from supine to upright) or with sensory stimulation (running water, hand washing, cold weather). The pathophysiology is uninhibited bladder contractions caused by irritation or loss of neurologic control of bladder contractions.

Mixed urinary incontinence is a combination of stress and urge incontinence. This type may take on the pathophysiology of both.
