Murmurs of the cardiac system develop due to alterations in blood flow or mechanical operation. Depending on the cause, auscultation findings in pitch, volume, and rhythm may change. The development of murmurs is highly dependent on the etiology and is not always associated with a pathologic process

Murmurs develop from a multitude of mechanisms. Typical cases include low blood viscosity from anemia, septal defects, failure of the ductus arteriosus to close in newborns, excessive hydrostatic pressure on cardiac valves causing valve failure, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and valvular specific pathologies. Regardless of underlying etiology, all involve the creation of disturbed blood flow, which produces a murmur
