The medial pterygoid muscle has a triple function. First, bilateral contraction of the muscle with lateral pterygoid muscle results in protrusion of the mandible.

The medial pterygoid muscle is characterized by short muscle fibers and large physiological cross-sectional area in comparison to other pterygoid muscle (lateral pterygoid). As a result of this configuration, the medial pterygoid muscle can exert about 1.6 times higher force than that produced by the lateral pterygoid muscle.
