There is no special medical care necessary for an uncomplicated vanishing twin pregnancy when the twin is lost during the first trimester of pregnancy. The mother may experience vaginal bleeding or spotting or pelvic pain, which needs regular medical care. The other fetus has higher chances of survival and could be delivered normally.

On the other hand, if the disappearance of a twin complicates the pregnancy during the second or third trimester, then the pregnancy could be treated as high-risk pregnancy, as the outcomes of such pregnancies through later gestational ages might affect the other twin adversely. Regular prenatal visits to assess any signs of complications and keep a check on both maternal and fetal health is necessary to avoid adverse outcomes and their effect on both maternal and fetal health.
