Apremilast is FDA approved for treating psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with moderately to severely active disease, plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for phototherapy or systemic therapy, and adults with Behcet disease associated with oral ulcers. It is a small molecule phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor. Apremilast is also used off-label for various dermatologic disorders that are unresponsive or ineffective to conventional therapy (systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents). This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors pertinent to interprofessional team members in managing patients with moderate to severe psoriatic arthritis unresponsive to first-line therapy, plaque psoriasis, and Behcet disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of apremilast.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of apremilast.
- Review the appropriate monitoring for patients receiving apremilast.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance apremilast use in treating psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, and Behcet disease and improve outcomes.
