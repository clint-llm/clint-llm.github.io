Renovascular hypertension happens when the blood flow to the kidneys is compromised, leading to high blood pressure through a hormonal response by the affected kidney. This is a serious condition and can lead to complications such as heart attack, stroke, and even death. Patients who continue to have high blood pressure in spite of being on multiple blood pressure medications should initiate a discussion regarding the possibility of renovascular hypertension. The clinical provider should also have a high index of suspicion in patients with resistant hypertension and pursue appropriate diagnostic modalities.
