Currently, there is no known treatment for placental insufficiency, other than delivering the fetus if it is at a viable timepoint. Low-dose aspirin and the use of antioxidant therapies, including vitamins C and E, have been shown to promote improved placentation in cases where there is uncertainty for successful placentation.

High-risk women, such as those with chronic hypertension, coagulopathies, or a history of pre-eclampsia, can benefit from having Doppler ultrasound screening at 12 to 14 weeks gestation because if bilateral notching is evident, then low-dose aspirin therapy should be initiated.

In vitro studies have demonstrated that heparin can stimulate neo-angiogenesis and also improve placental perfusion. Heparin’s anticoagulant properties are exhibited by its ability to mobilize tissue inhibition factor into circulation and by the fact that it also enhances antithrombin activity. Additional benefits of heparin when considering placental insufficiency and its downstream consequences are that heparin promotes trophoblastic proliferation, reduces inflammation by downregulating the complement cascade, reduces apoptosis, and it also acts indirectly as a growth factor.

Heparin has also been shown to upregulate certain proteins involved in placental angiogenesis and development. These include angiopoietin-2, which is responsible for chorionic villi vascular remodeling, leptin, which is responsible for the regulation of nutrient transfer, as well as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloprotease-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and angiostatin. Based on its properties and preliminary data, some studies have demonstrated that there may be a role for heparin as a preventive treatment for the placental disease.
