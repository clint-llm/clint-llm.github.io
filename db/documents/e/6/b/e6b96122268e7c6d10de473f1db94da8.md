Neutropenic fever is when there is a single oral temperature greater than or equal to 101 F (38.3 C) or a temperature greater than or equal to 100.4 F (38 C) for at least an hour, with an absolute neutrophilic count (ANC) of less than 1500 cells/microliter.

- ANC = WBC (cells/microL) x percent (PMNs  +  bands) / 100

Following hematological terms are commonly employed to classify abnormal neutrophil counts:

- ANC <200 cells/microL: agranulocytosis

- Neutropenia for > three months: chronic neutropenia

- Neutropenia without associated anemia and/or thrombocytopenia: isolated neutropenia

- Reduced number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils: granulocytopenia
