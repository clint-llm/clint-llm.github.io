This article will review the evidence for the use of the currently available weight loss medications and the medications or substances that have no evidence of benefit or can be harmful and have been discontinued.

Obesity is a very popular topic, and there is growing literature evaluating the efficacy of multiple compounds in its treatment. Unfortunately, however, there is limited evidence to promote a recommendation or discontinuation of a variety of substances and dietary supplements, and patients continue to purchase a variety of over-the-counter compounds that can actually be harmful.

Clinicians should warn patients about the potential risks of weight-loss supplements and should monitor patients who choose to take them. The conclusions from a review from 2015 regarding some of these supplements appear below:

Green tea, Garcinia cambogia, conjugated linoleic acid, and chitosan did not show any effect on weight loss, and their use should not be encouraged by health care providers.

There were inconclusive data regarding the use of chromium, Gambisan, Hoodia gordonii, and Cynanchum auriculatum, and clinicians should not recommend their use due to lack of evidence and potential risk of harm.

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has also been promoted and advertised as potential weight loss therapy; however, clinical trials have not supported that. Several randomized trials have demonstrated that the hCG injections or pills associated with a very-low-calorie diet (500 kcal/day) are no more effective than placebo in the treatment of obesity.

Sibutramine has been withdrawn from the US and European markets in 2010 after the SCOUT study showed a 16% increase in the incidence of cardiovascular events in the medication group (11.4% versus 10% in the placebo). FDA concluded that risks outweighed the benefits. Of note, the population in the study had a significant percent of cardiovascular risk as represented by patients 55 years of age or older, overweight or obese, and with a history of cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus plus one additional cardiovascular risk factor.

Another regulated medication for weight loss, Lorcaserin, was withdrawn from the market in February 2020, after a safety clinical trial data that randomized 12,000 patients showed an increased occurrence of various types of cancer compared to placebo (7.7 versus 7.1 percent of patients), the most common being pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancer. The FDA has not recommended any special cancer screening other than age-appropriate screening for individuals previously on lorcaserin.
