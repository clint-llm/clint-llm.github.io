There has been no specific genetic defect found. It has been reported that overexpression of TGF-beta3 and extracellular matrix proteins may be seen in patients with the acquired form of reactive perforating collagenosis. Although there has been no specific cause found, it appears as if the transepidermal elimination of collagen could be a simple reaction from pruritus or a defect in collagen, leading to focal damage. Serum and tissue concentrations of fibronectin have been reported to be elevated, which may contribute to epithelial migration. Superficial trauma, as well as a cold environment, induces degeneration of collagen. It has also been reported that the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) may play a role in the pathogenesis of acquired reactive perforating collagenosis. The receptor for advanced glycation end products plays a role in the inflammatory response pathway as a multiligand transmembrane receptor.
