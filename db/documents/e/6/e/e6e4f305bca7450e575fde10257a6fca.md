The differential diagnosis of a skin lesion which is FEP can include many other pathologies, both benign and malignant. When FEPÂ is mistaken for a benign lesion, such as acrochordon, seborrheic keratosis, dermal nevus, pedunculated fibroma, lipomatous nevus or neurofibroma, this delays biopsy. Since many benign skin lesions are treated without submitting tissue for biopsy, the diagnosis of FEP may never be made.
