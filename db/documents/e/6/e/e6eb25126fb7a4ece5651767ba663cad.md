The prognosis for medial epicondylitis is favorable, with most individuals obtaining relief from physical therapy, NSAIDs, and bracing. However, prognosis compared to those with lateral epicondylitis is more variable. Those not gaining relief from initial treatments may benefit from corticosteroid injection, prolotherapy, or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection. Surgical correction is rarely needed. Patients have shown a worse prognosis if they have concomitant ulnar neuritis.
