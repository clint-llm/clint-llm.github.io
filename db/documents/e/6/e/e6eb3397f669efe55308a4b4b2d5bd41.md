In the 30-month ATTR-ACT study, the frequency of adverse events was similar in the tafamidis 20 mg, tafamidis 80 mg, and the placebo groups.

- Headache

- Urinary tract infection

- Peripheral edema

- Upper abdominal pain, flatulence, diarrhea

- Influenza, pneumonia

- Acute cardiac failure

- Pain in extremity, myalgia

- Punctate keratitis

- Vaginal infection

- Laboratory abnormalities: altered neutrophil and lymphocyte count, increased liver function test and blood urea nitrogen, increased prothrombin time, reduced serum thyroxine levels

Fecal incontinence and renal impairment may infrequently lead to treatment discontinuation. Severe adverse events are infrequent, with only one reported case of treatment-related pericardial effusion. One case of sudden death related to tafamidis was seen in a small Japanese study.
