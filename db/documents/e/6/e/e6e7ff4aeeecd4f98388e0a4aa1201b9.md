The corneal endothelium is made up of a monolayer of hexagonal cells.

Specular microscopy is a non-invasive modality to document the healthy and diseased endothelium photographically. Specular microscopy is also crucial in assessing the preoperative endothelial health before high-risk surgeries, comparing various techniques, the impact of lasers during refractive surgery, and the assessment of donor cornea before transplantation.

The various endothelial pathologies where specular microscopy plays an important role are Fuch's endothelial dystrophy, corneal dystrophies, posterior polymorphous dystrophy, pseudophakic bullous keratopathy, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy, viral endothelitis, ICE syndrome, trauma, uveitis and pharmacological disruption of the endothelium.

Various specular microscopes are available for documenting endothelial cell details at various magnifications and calibrations.

In 1975 Laing first used the specular microscope for clinical use. Baurne et al. in 1976 used the specular microscope at 200X for rapid endothelial examination and photography. In corneal edema, the specular reflection is masked and hampers visualization of the corneal endothelium. Eye banks also need to assess the donor corneal endothelial status.
