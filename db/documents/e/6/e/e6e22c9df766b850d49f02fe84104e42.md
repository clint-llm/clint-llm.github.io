- Osmolar and anion gaps absolutely cannot be relied upon to rule out toxic alcohol poisoning.

- Ethylene glycol undergoes multiple metabolic steps, with metabolites glycolic acid and oxalic acid being primarily responsible for acidosis and renal injury, respectively.

- End-organ toxicity primarily includes nephropathy secondary to the deposition of calcium oxalate crystals.

- Ethylene glycol is osmotically active while its metabolites are responsible for the associated anion gap metabolic acidosis.

- A normal osmolar gap is not reassuring and should be anticipated in the presence of an anion gap acidosis believed to be related to toxic alcohol poisoning.

- The mainstay of treatment is fomepizole, supportive care, and resuscitation. However, dialysis may be indicated.

- In the absence of end-organ toxicity, ethylene glycol toxicity generally does not require dialysis.

- When patients survive and have resulting renal dysfunction or failure, recovery of renal function is the norm but may take weeks to months.
