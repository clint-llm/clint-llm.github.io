Olanzapine is a second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic medication. The FDA has approved this medication for schizophrenia if the patient is over the age of 13 and bipolar disorder, including mixed or manic episodes. Olanzapine is also approved for use with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), in patients with episodes of depression associated with bipolar disorder type 1 and treatment-resistant depression. It is important to note that olanzapine is not FDA-approved for patients under the age of 13. In addition, the combination of olanzapine with fluoxetine is not approved for patients under the age of 10. This activity covers olanzapine, including mechanism of action, pharmacology, adverse event profiles, eligible patient populations, contraindications, and monitoring, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of olanzapine therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of olanzapine.
- Summarize the approved and off-label indications for olanzapine therapy.
- Review the adverse event profile for olanzapine.
- Outline the importance of collaboration and communication among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes and treatment efficacy for patients who might benefit from therapy with olanzapine.
