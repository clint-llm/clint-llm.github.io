Portal vein thrombosis is a relatively common presentationÂ in clinical practice. Because the disorder has enormous morbidity and mortality if left untreated, the condition is best managed by a team of an interprofessional healthcare professionals. To reduce morbidity, prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary. Patients treated with early anticoagulation have a 5 year survival of 85%. The acute condition has a much better prognosis than chronic portal vein thrombosis, where the liver function is often compromised. TIPS and open surgery procedures are much less used today because of availability of percutaneous techniques, which are associated with much fewer complications.
