Gyrate atrophy of the choroid and retina is a rare genetic condition of autosomal recessive inheritanceÂ that results from mutations affecting the OAT gene on chromosome 10q26, leading to deficiency of the pyridoxal-dependant mitochondrial enzyme OAT which normally metabolizes the amino acid ornithine into pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid.
