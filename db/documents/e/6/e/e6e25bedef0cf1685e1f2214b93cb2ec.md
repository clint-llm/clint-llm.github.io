The P. ovale life cycle includes hypnozoites, which are dormant stages in the liver that can lead to relapse. The presence of hypnozoites in the liver does not cause systemic infection. Symptoms of relapse occur when reactivated hypnozoites are released into the systemic circulation.Â P. ovale malaria is not chloroquine-resistant. Relapse due to P. ovale is relatively rare and may be prevented by the administration of presumptive anti-relapse therapy like primaquine.
