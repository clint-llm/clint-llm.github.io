Ethambutol-induced optic neuropathy (ION) is a well-known disease that can be irreversible but is preventable. Timely and appropriate screenings are important in determining the outcome of the patient. According to epidemiologic studies investigating EON, between 0.7 and 1.29% of patients on EMB showed a prevalence of EON when taking the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended dosages. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed a decrease in the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) that was clinically significant.

Although EMB is a bacteriostatic agent used to prevent the emergence of drug resistance to other first-line drugs, there is beginning to be an acknowledgment for ethambutol resistant strains.

Given the toxicity profile of ethambutol, the decision to use it in treating tuberculosis cases should involve an entire interprofessional team, including infectious disease specialists, other clinicians (including mid-level practitioners), nurses, and pharmacists also specializing in infectious disease. Close monitoring of the patient, careful assessment of the medication profile, and determining the susceptibility of the infection are all key factors in chatting the therapeutic course. With an interprofessional approach, the likelihood of a positive outcome with fewer adverse effects is more likely. [Level 5]
