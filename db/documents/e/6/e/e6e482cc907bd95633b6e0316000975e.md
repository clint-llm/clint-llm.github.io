Glottic insufficiency is characterized by incomplete closure of the vocal folds with phonation, which causes an increased risk of aspiration. Glottic insufficiency also causes laryngeal symptoms including dysphonia and dysphagia. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of airway glottic insufficiency and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the recognition and management of airway glottic insufficiency

**Objectives:**
- Review the pathophysiologic basis of airway glottic insufficiency.
- Outline the expected history and physical findings for a patient with airway glottic insufficiency.
- List the treatment options available for airway glottic insufficiency.
- Describe the need for an interprofessional team approach to caring for a patient with airway glottic insufficiency.
