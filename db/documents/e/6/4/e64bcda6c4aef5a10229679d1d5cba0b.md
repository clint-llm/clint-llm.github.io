**Tumor Markers**: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH).

Serum tumor markers (AFP, HCG, and LDH) should be checked****before any intervention, including orchiectomy, as these may be elevated in non-seminomatous testicular germ cell tumors (NSGCT).

Alpha-fetoprotein is elevated in 50% to 70% of all patients with NSGCT.  Pure seminomas do not make alpha-fetoprotein, so if it's elevated in a patient diagnosed only with seminoma, it means that NSGCT elements were missed. The patient should be treated as having a mixed germ cell malignancy. Syncytiotrophoblasts manufacture human chorionic gonadotropins in seminomas and a few non-seminomatous germ cell tumors such as choriocarcinoma and embryonal carcinomas. LDH is generally a nonspecific tumor marker that is elevated in 20% to 60% of patients with NSGCT and is generally considered an indicator of bulky disease. Alpha-fetoprotein has a half-life of about 6 days, while the half-life of HCG is 24 to 48 hours.  In practical terms, HCG should begin to return to normal about 1 week after orchiectomy, while alpha-fetoprotein will take a minimum of 5 weeks. AFP and β-hCG are also elevated in various lung, liver, gut, bone, and live tumors.

**Ultrasonography**of both testes is the primary initial imaging modality recommended to identify testicular cancer when suspected on physical examination.****

For tissue diagnosis, a radical inguinal orchiectomy should be performed to serve both diagnostic and therapeutic (in stage I disease) purposes. Testicular biopsy can diagnose malignancy, but it may also cause upstaging of the disease in some cases. Testicular cancer spread is generally along well-known lymphatic chains except for choriocarcinoma,s which can spread hematogenously.

All patients with testicular non-seminomatous germ cell tumors should undergo contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis.****β-hCG is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast component within germ cell tumors and is most closely associated with seminomas, although it can present in both seminomatous and non-seminomatous malignancies. β-hCG is commonly expressed by the syncytiotrophoblasts found in choriocarcinoma and approximately 15% of seminomas. Yolk sac tumors, embryonal cell carcinomas, and some teratomas secrete alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).

There is no clinical role or justification for a percutaneous needle biopsy of a possible testicular malignancy. It would expose new lymphatic channels to possible metastatic spread of cancer, resulting in atypical metastases. In those rare situations where a biopsy is needed instead of a radical orchiectomy, it can be done through an inguinal incision with full control of the spermatic cord vascular supply to the testis. In such cases, usually, a frozen section is obtained with the expectation that a radical orchiectomy will be done if the preliminary diagnosis is cancer.  There is also no current clinical role for routine MRI or positron emission tomography at the current time.
