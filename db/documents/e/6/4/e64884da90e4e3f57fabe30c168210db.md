Lateral ligament instability can result from either of two means; functional or mechanical instability.

The most common mechanism of injury in lateral ankle sprain occurs with a plantar-flexory force on an inverted ankle as the body moves over the foot. The ATFL is the most commonly injured ligament followed by the CFL, and then the PTFL
