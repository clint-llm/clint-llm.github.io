Apocrine gland tissue for study can be obtained from patients with osmidrosis, and therefore the glands will be maintained in an active state. The tissue can be cut into small pieces (less than 1 mm^3) and fixed with 70% ethanol for 12 hours at 4 C, then embedded in paraffin. Alternatively, the tissue can be cut into small pieces (less than 1 mm^3) and stored in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 4 C. Staining can then be performed as desired. Apocrine secretion can be visualized with hematoxylin-eosin staining, in addition to other specific stains to identify structural components.
