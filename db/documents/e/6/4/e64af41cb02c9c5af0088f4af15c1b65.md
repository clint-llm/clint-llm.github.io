Neuropsychological assessment is performed for several reasons. The following are a few of the goals and benefits:

- To establish a “baseline” if later changes are anticipated (e.g., pre- and post-surgery) or to help determine if a patient is a good candidate for surgical intervention.

- To gauge an individual’s cognitive and emotional profile (i.e., strengths and weaknesses) and aid in treatment planning.

- Differential diagnosis, when brain-based impairment in cognitive function or behavior is suspected (e.g., memory complaints).

- To establish possible lateralization or etiology of brain lesion.

- To track progress in rehabilitation and the effects of treatment and medication.

- To help with educational placement, interventions, and accommodations.

- For determination of disability, return-to-work/school, driving ability, or forensic (legal) purposes.
