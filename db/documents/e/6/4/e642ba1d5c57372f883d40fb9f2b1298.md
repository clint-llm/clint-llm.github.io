Indications for the assessment of renal function are varied and range from acute emergency to chronic settings. Primarily, renal function tests are performed to identify the renal disease to determine appropriate patient management and prevent further deterioration of renal function. Further indications in patients in whom the renal disease has been identified are to stage level or type of renal disease and to monitor the progression of renal disease to ensure that optimal management occurs timeously and to monitor response to interventions. In other scenarios, renal function tests may be required to establish and monitor renal function where a known or possibly nephrotoxic therapeutic agent is initiated for patient management. Renal function tests are also indicated in those individuals who are transplant donors to assess the initial donor suitability, and after that, to detect any significant deterioration of renal function post-donation. Tests of renal function can also be utilized to identify which area of the functional unit of the kidney (nephron) is affected, for example,Â  glomerular versus tubular disease.
