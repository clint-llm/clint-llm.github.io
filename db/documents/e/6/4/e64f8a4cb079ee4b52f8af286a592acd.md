Managing patients with CSOM requires an interprofessional team composed of otologists, audiologists, radiologists, anesthetists, and nurses. Timely diagnosis and meticulous surgical planning are essential for optimal patient outcomes, including reduced infection rates and improved hearing. In pediatric patients, hearing impairment may profoundly impact speech and language development, and coordination with speech therapists may also be warranted pre and post-operatively. Nurses will assist in patient assessment, coordinate activities among the various specialists, assist in surgery, and offer patient counseling. All interprofessional team members must maintain accurate and updated records so that everyone involved in care has access to the same patient data to guide therapy decisions. The interprofessional model will yield the best patient outcomes with the fewest adverse events.
