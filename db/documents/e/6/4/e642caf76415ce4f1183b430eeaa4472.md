As for any procedure, an escharotomy may cause complications related to the surgery or anesthesia. Following escharotomy, the wounds should be monitored regularly, especially in the first 72 hours to look for signs of incomplete releases, such as distal ischemia in limbs and poor ventilation for chest and abdominal burns. Other complications include bleeding which can be controlled by cauterization, infection, and damage to nearby structures, especially to the ulnar nerve, and the common peroneal nerve due to their relatively superficial course near the incisions. Furthermore, these wounds may require surgical reconstruction in the future, such as skin grafting, and may result in functional deficits as well as cosmetic problems (hypertrophic scar formation).

Complications of inadequate or delayed escharotomy include muscle ischemia and necrosis, a neurovascular compromise that may lead to gangrene and amputation of the affected limb, respiratory compromise in case of chest full-thickness burn, and abdominal compartment syndrome in case of an abdominal burn. Moreover, systemic complications include myoglobinuria, renal compromise, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalemia.
