The patient's eyes are protected with a transparent covering or just partially covered while keeping the medial part accessible to the surgeon, who will be regularly checking for any swelling indicative of orbital hematoma.

Both nasal cavities are initially packed with oxymetazoline-soaked cotton for decongestion. The patient is then draped.
