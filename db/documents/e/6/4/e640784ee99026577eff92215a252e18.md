Since its initial proposal for bupivacaine toxicity, ILE therapy has become recognized as the standard treatment for LAST and is recommended for local anesthetic-mediated cardiac arrest. Furthermore, ILE therapy has been used for experimental rescue treatment of other lipophilic drug overdoses, toxicities, and toxin antidotes, though with variable success. As such, ILE therapy is relevant to physicians, advanced care providers, nursing teams, pharmacists, and ancillary staff across the interprofessional healthcare team, especially in anesthesiology, emergency medicine, and critical care.

The decision to use ILE requires strong clinical judgment on the part of the ordering clinician. Nursing staff will typically administer the therapy and must be familiar with administration protocol and potential adverse effects. The pharmacist must have involvement from the standpoint of dosing, medication reconciliation, and working with the nursing staff regarding administration and adverse events. These are but a few examples of the need for interprofessional teamwork when using ILE therapy in patients experiencing anesthetic toxicity. [Level 5] Despite the increasing awareness of ILE therapy, more clinical studies and research are needed to explain better its mechanism of action, other appropriate indications, optimal dosing, and associated complications.
