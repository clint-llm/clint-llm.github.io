The clinical manifestations of parapneumonic effusion or empyema are related to various factors like the presentation timing and the virulence of the causative organism. Common symptoms of bacterial pneumonia with parapneumonic effusion include a cough, expectoration, and a rise in body temperature, pleuritic chest pain, and difficulty breathing.

In most patients the following clinical signs are present in clinical examination and include:

- Fever, tachypnea, and tachycardia

- Pleural effusion (dullness to percussion decreased tactile fremitus and decreased or absent breath sounds)

- Adjacent pneumonia (rales or crackles and/or bronchial breath sounds)
