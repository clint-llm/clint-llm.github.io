The history of accommodative excess must be recognized. Most often, clinicians consider all visual and asthenopia symptoms only as a refractive problem.

Asthenopia is a terminology or word to describe eye strain, or fatigue of the eyes, such as that caused by reading, near work, or looking at a computer screen for too long.

Symptoms of the accommodative excess are common, including blurring the vision for distance and near. Initially, it is associated with excessive near work, headache, eyestrain, brow ache, ocular deviation (esotropia), and sometimes diplopia.

In the case of spasm of accommodation, asthenopic symptoms are more marked than visual symptoms.Â Accommodative spasm subjects may be associated with macropsia due to optical illusion. Far and near points become nearer to the eye (in accommodative spasm condition, near point is abnormally close). Pupillary diameter becomes smaller (miosis).
