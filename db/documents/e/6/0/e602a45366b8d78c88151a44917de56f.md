The skin biopsy of patients with erythromelalgia associated withÂ thrombocythemia showed arteriolar fibrosis and occlusion with platelet thrombi that spared the venules, capillaries, and nerves. In less than 10% of cases, skin biopsies showed decreased epidermal nerve fiber density. Biopsy specimens in patients with primary and secondary erythromelalgia are non-specific.
