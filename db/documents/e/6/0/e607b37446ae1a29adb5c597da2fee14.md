The role of the infertility specialist, radiologist, anesthesiologist, and overall nursing team is continually expanding to increase the fertility rates among the couples undergoing ovulation induction. In addition, nursing staff provides their help in the initial consultation, assistance during transvaginal ultrasound scanning, and administration of medications at a proper time along with the appropriate dosage.

Interprofessional team monitoring is critical for the success of the ovulation induction and improving the overall patient outcome. Every team member is responsible for monitoring for any complications that may arise during the entire treatment process.
