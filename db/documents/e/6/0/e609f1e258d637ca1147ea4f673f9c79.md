Assessment of the geriatric trauma patient is unique, and this population requires special attention. As the elderly population increases, the number of geriatric trauma patients also rises. Geriatric patients often suffer from mild to severe cognitive impairment, cardiovascular, and pulmonary insufficiency, which can complicate trauma. This activity describes the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of geriatric trauma and stresses the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain why the geriatric population is at risk for trauma.
- Describe why geriatric trauma patients are at higher risk of complications or death.
- Identify management considerations for geriatric trauma patients. 
- Explain why careful planning and discussion amongst interprofessional team members involved in the management of geriatric trauma patients will improve outcomes.
