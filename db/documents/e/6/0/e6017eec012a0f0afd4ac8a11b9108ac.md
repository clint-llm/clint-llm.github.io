The chin represents an often underappreciated aesthetic component of the face; however, the chin remains an essential facial subunit that plays a significant role in overall facial attractiveness. Chin augmentation, or genioplasty, is a common facial plastic surgery procedure used to improve facial aesthetics.

Although several methods exist to augment the chin, including osseous genioplasty, this article will focus specifically on chin augmentation using alloplastic chin implants.
