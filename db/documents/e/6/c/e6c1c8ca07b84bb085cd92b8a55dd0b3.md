Cleft palate repair sets should include the following:

- A fine suction cannula (e.g., Frazier 7 Fr)

- Mouth retractor (e.g., Dingman, Fisher, etc.) with tongue blades of different sizes.

- Periosteal elevators (e.g., Freer, Cronin, Molt #9, Warwick-James, Mitchel's trimmer, Barsky cleft palate rasp)

- Retractors (e.g., single hook, Guthrie hook)

- Long forceps (e.g., Gerald toothed, non-toothed forceps)

- Long scissors (e.g., Metzenbaum long scissors)

- Long needle holder (e.g., Rider)

- Electrosurgical knife (electrocautery)

- Diathermy with long Colorado tip

- Long bipolar electrocautery forceps

Surgical loupes with 2.5-4x magnification are highly recommended for cleft palate repair; however, some surgeons may prefer to use an operating microscope.
