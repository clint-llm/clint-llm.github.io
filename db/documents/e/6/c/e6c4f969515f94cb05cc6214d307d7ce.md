Klippel Trenaunay syndromeÂ is a complex vascular malformation syndrome with multi-system involvement. A collaborative approach among health care professionals is important to provide optimal care for these patients. The diagnosis is usually considered by the pediatric provider as clinical findings are often seen in the neonatal period and throughout childhood. Referral to a dermatologist for confirmation of the diagnosis and consultation with radiologists can aid in the appropriate evaluation of these patients. Patients with limb length discrepancy may benefit from orthopedic expertise for orthotics or epiphysiodesis and in cases of severe hypertrophy de-bulking procedures.

Hematologists are often involved due to the high risk of thrombosis and the need for prophylaxis during surgeries. Vascular surgery involvement may be required for chronic venous insufficiency for sclerotherapy and, in refractory cases, open surgical procedures. Larger institutions have specialized clinics for patients with Klippel-Trenaunay consisting of a multi-disciplinary team, including dermatologists, orthopedists, dermatologists, and vascular surgeons. Medical and surgical care should be tailored to each patient, depending on the extent of the disease involvement. The primary care provider plays an important role in coordinating care among various specialists to optimize outcomes.
