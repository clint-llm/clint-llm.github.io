DDAVP, an ADH analog, can be administered orally, intranasally, subcutaneously, or intravenously. In adults, the dose is ten mcg by nasal insufflation or 4mcg subcutaneously or intravenously. In newborns or young infants, the dose is one mcg subcutaneously or intravenously over 20 minutes with a maximum dose of 0.4 mcg/kg.

It is essential to replete fluid losses in diabetes insipidus, as some patients may have thirst impairment and will not respond adequately to water intake.

**Central Diabetes Insipidus**

The preferred therapy is DDAVP.

It is crucial to monitor hyponatremia, as water retention can lead to sodium concentration changes that may cause brain injury. The patients and families should be educated to observe for nausea, vomiting, lethargy, headaches, confusion, seizures, and coma symptoms.

Other treatment options for central diabetes insipidus include a low-solute diet (low salt, low protein), thiazide diuretics, chlorpropamide, carbamazepine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID).

DDAVP is considered safe during pregnancy.

**N****ephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus**

The first step is to correct the underlying cause. If possible, discontinue the offending agent, such as lithium.

A low-solute diet may decrease urine output. The lower amount of total solutes ingested, the lower the urine volume that will be excreted.

Thiazide diuretics may be used in conjunction with dietary changes. The mechanism of administering a diuretic for polyuria is to promote the reduction of urine volume, which triggers the endogenous release of aldosterone. By having less water delivered distally, there would be less water loss in the collecting tubule, where ADH targets its effects.

Other treatment options include DDAVP and NSAIDs. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which has antagonistic effects on ADH.
