The popliteal artery is the primary vascular supply in the region of the knee and lower leg.

The popliteal vein runs posterior to the popliteal artery and receives blood from multiple tributaries.

- Genicular veins

- Sural veins

- Small saphenous vein

- Anterior tibial vein

- Posterior tibial vein

- Peroneal veins

Popliteal lymph nodes can be found throughout the popliteal fossa, closely associated with the popliteal vessels. These nodes drain into the deep inguinal lymph nodes.
