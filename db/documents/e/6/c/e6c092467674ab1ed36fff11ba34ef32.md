Workup in Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma should include the following:

- **Complete blood count:**May show anemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, pancytopenia, lymphocytosis, and thrombocytosis. These changes in peripheral blood counts can be due to extensive bone marrow infiltration, hypersplenism from splenic involvement, or blood loss from gastrointestinal tract involvement.

- **Serum chemistry tests:**Can help rule out tumor lysis syndrome, commonly in rapidly proliferative NHL such as Burkitt or lymphoblastic lymphoma. Lactate dehydrogenase levels can also be elevated due to high tumor burden or extensive infiltration of the liver.

- **Imaging:**usually a CT scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis or a PET scan. Dedicated imaging, such as an MRI of the brain and spinal cord or testicular ultrasound, might be needed.

- **Lymph node and/or tissue biopsy:**A lymph node should be considered for a biopsy if one or more of the following lymph node characteristics is present: significant enlargement, persistence for more than four to six weeks, progressive increase in size. In general, lymph nodes greater than 2.25 cm (i.e., a node with biperpendicular diameters of 1.5 x 1.5 cm) or 2 cm in a single diameter provide the best diagnostic yields. Excisional lymph node biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. Fine needle aspiration of the lymph node is avoided.  An excisional biopsy of an intact node allows sufficient tissue for histologic, immunologic, and molecular biologic assessment and classification by hematopathologists.

- **Lumbar puncture:**usually reserved in those with a high risk of CNS involvement, i.e., highly aggressive NHL (Burkitt lymphoma, DLBCL, peripheral T cell lymphoma, grade 3b FL, mantle cell lymphoma, precursor T or B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive NHL), who have epidural, bone marrow, testicular, or paranasal sinus involvement, or at least two extranodal disease sites.  CSF should be sent for both cytology and flow cytometry.

- **Immunophenotypic analysis of lymph node:**peripheral blood, and bone marrow. The tumor cells in Burkitt lymphoma express surface immunoglobulin (Ig) of the IgM type and immunoglobulin light chains (kappa more often than lambda), B cell-associated antigens (CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a), germinal center-associated markers (CD10 and BCL6), as well as HLA-DR and CD43Expression of CD21, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)/C3d receptor, is dependent on EBV status of the tumors. Essentially, all endemic BL cases are EBV positive and express CD21, whereas the vast majority of non-endemic BL in non-immunosuppressed patients are EBV negative and lack CD21 expression. Mantle cell tumor cells express high levels of surface membrane immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgD (sIgM±IgD), which is more often of lambda light chain type. They also demonstrate pan-B cell antigens (e.g., CD19, CD20), CD5, and FMC7. Nuclear staining for cyclin D1 (BCL1) is present in >90 percent of cases, including those that are CD5 negative.

- **Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy:**sometimes needed for the staging of the NHL. However, with the widespread use of PET scans, their utility is decreasing.
