Both increased and decreased blood volumes have associated clinical complications. HypovolemiaÂ can occur through a hemorrhage, sodium depletion, water loss, and the loss of plasma. Dehydration can also cause reduced blood volume but only occurs due to a lack of water. The two are distinct terms due to their effect on plasma osmolality, but both result in decreased blood volume.

Hypervolemia occurs when blood volume increases and can occur through renal failure, congestive heart failure, liver failure, excessive sodium intake, or any other dysfunction of sodium regulation.
