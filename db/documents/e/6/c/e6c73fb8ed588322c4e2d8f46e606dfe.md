In females, N. gonorrhoeae most commonly infects the cervix, resulting in cervicitis. When female patients with gonococcal urogenital infections have symptoms, they may complain of vaginal discharge, dysuria, or pelvic pain.

Although more than 50% of females will not manifest symptoms of their gonococcal cervix infections, most males, more than 90%, will manifest urogenital gonorrhea symptomatically.

Like cervicitis, gonococcal infection of the pharynx, the rectum, and the female urethra often present asymptomatically or with subtle symptoms.N. gonorrhoeae manifests systemically as fever/septicemia, tenosynovitis, arthritis, and vasculitis.
