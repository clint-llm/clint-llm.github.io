The efficacy of alcohol-based hand sanitizers is dependent on the technique of application and its usage. Even though there are no strict guidelines, most researchers suggest applying the sanitizer to the palm and thoroughly rubbing it all over both hands until they are dry. Several studies have compared the amount needed to be effective, and there have been varying recommendations ranging from 1.1 mL to 3.0 mL. FDA recommends a quantity of 2.4 mL as sufficient. Similarly, the application time also varies from 15 seconds to 30 seconds, with most data lying somewhere in the middle.
