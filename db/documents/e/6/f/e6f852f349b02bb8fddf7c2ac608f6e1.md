Complications are uncommon in dermatophytic infections.

One such complication includes Majocchi granuloma, is a rare condition in which the dermatophyte invades via a follicle and advances deeper into the dermis or subcutaneous tissue.  Minor skin trauma such as shaving can predispose patients to Majocchi granuloma.  Lesions involve the hair follicles and appear as erythematous nodules or papules.  These may even progress to abscesses.  Oral antifungals such as terbinafine 250 mg once daily for 2 to 4 weeks are the recommended therapy in cases of Majocchi granuloma.
