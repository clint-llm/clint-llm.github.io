No contraindications exist to the use of IV dantrolene to treat malignant hyperthermia. Oral dantrolene is contraindicated in patients withÂ underlying liver disease, including cirrhosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, and hepatitis B or C infections.

Dantrolene is an FDA pregnancy category C drug. For pregnant patients, it is permissible to use dantrolene in instances of malignant hyperthermia; in other instances, clinicians should consider alternatives, even though fetal harm is not expected based on limited human data. Alternative agents should be employed in breastfeeding patients or have the patient discontinue breastfeeding during treatment and for 48 hours following treatment cessation.
