Elbow dislocation is the most common joint dislocation in pediatric patients and the second most common in adult patients. The incidence is reported at 6 to 13 per 100,000 persons per year. The injury more often occurs in adolescent male athletes. Specifically, varsity football and wrestling participants are particularly susceptible to this injury.  Posterior elbow dislocations comprise 90% of all elbow dislocations.
