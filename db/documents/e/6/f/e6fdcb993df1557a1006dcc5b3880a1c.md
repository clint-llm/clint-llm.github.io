The world health organization defines patient safety as the “absence of preventable harm to a patient during the process of health care and reduction of risk of unnecessary harm associated with health care to an acceptable minimum.”

The FDA classifies medical devices into three categories. Class I and II are low and intermediate-risk, respectively, and require 510k for market approval. Class III devices belong to the highest risk category, and a premarket approval application (PMA) is generally required for their premarket approval. The MAUDE database is maintained by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), a branch of the US FDA responsible for protecting public health. As of 2017, the database had more than 4 million recorded events, with approximately 2000 new reports submitted daily.

The search within the MAUDE database is limited to adverse events reported over a 10-year time period. The reporting can be either mandatory (for manufacturers, importers, and device user facilities) or voluntary (for healthcare professionals, patients, caregivers, and consumers). The operators and device manufacturers submit their reports to the database after an adverse event or device failure is encountered. Each medical device report contains information regarding the device used, the model number, the date of the event if the devices were returned to the manufacturer for their analysis, the date of return, a narrative description of the adverse events by the operators, as well as the manufacturers.

Based on the type and severity of the events, they can be classified into the following main categories: death, injury, malfunction, or other. The database is updated every month. Routine monitoring of these reports is carried out by the FDA and the manufacturers to identify device-related safety signals and correct them in an effective and timely fashion.
