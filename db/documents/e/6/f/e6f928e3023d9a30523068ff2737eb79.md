# Definition/Introduction

Trousseau’s sign for latent tetany is most commonly positive in the setting of hypocalcemia.

# Issues of Concern

The normal level of calcium in the blood is between 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL.

Hypocalcemia can present in numerous conditions, most commonly in the setting of vitamin D deficiency or hypoparathyroidism.

# Clinical Significance

Through the utilization of a thorough history and physical exam, healthcare practitioners may be able to discover if a patient has hypocalcemia early in their presentation to a healthcare facility after finding Trousseau’s sign during blood pressure measurement, allowing for rapid intervention.

# Nursing, Allied Health, and Interprofessional Team Interventions

Vital signs are often obtained at the beginning of a patient encounter, frequently by a nurse, certified nursing assistant, or medical assistant. Therefore, Trouseeau's sign may commonly be noted by the allied health professional taking the vital signs, rather than by the clinician. Recognition of the sign and communication to the clinician may be the only opportunity for the patient to have this issue addressed.
