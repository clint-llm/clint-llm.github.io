Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder is a parasomnia in which affected individuals act out their dreams while in the REM stage of sleep. Unfortunately, this can involve violence and can lead to the injury of self or others without conscious awareness. Patients with this disorder can typically recall the content of the dream upon awakening. Many patients with REM sleep behavior disorder will eventually develop neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia, or multiple system atrophy. However, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder can also occur secondary to narcolepsy or use of antidepressant medications. This activity describes the risk factors, evaluation, and management of rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in enhancing care delivery for affected patients.
