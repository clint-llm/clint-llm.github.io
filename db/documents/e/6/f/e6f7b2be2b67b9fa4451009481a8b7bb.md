Obesity affects at least one-third of adults and 17% of youth in the United States and confers an increased risk of related comorbidities such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. After many years of failed medical treatments for obesity, a variety of successful surgical treatments have evolved. Weight loss surgery has proven to be an effective cure for obesity, as well as a treatment for the secondary comorbidities. Extensive research demonstrates the long-term benefits of obesity surgery versus other non-invasive treatments in similar populations.
