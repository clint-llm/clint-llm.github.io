A large number of cases of genital warts fail to respond to treatment and often recur, especially with repeated infections from sexual contact or the long-incubation period of HPV. Verifying patient compliance with therapy, changing the therapeutic agent, and adding isotretinoin can help.Â Morbidity associated with the disease is due to pruritus, bleeding, and the psychosocial burden of genital lesions, while mortality is due to its malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma.

Immunocompromised patients are likely to have more resistant lesions than the general population with more frequent recurrences. They are also more likely for their lesions to develop a malignant transformation into squamous cell carcinoma.
