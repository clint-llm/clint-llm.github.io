Testicular cancer is the most common solid malignancy among young men. The incidence is highest among White race individuals, lowest among African-Americans, and most rapidly increasing in Hispanic populations.

Cryptorchidism increases the risk of developing testicular cancer in the affected testicle from four to sixfold. Still, the relative risk falls two to threefold while orchiopexy is performed before puberty.

The worldwide incidence of testicular cancer is increasing, with the highest rate in Scandinavia (Norway and Denmark), Germany, Switzerland, and New Zealand.
