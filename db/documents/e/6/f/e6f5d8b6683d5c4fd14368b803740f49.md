As mentioned above TS is caused by mutations in TSC 1 which encodes the protein hamartin and TSC 2 which encodes the protein tuberin. These proteins normally suppress the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), however, when mutated, they cause unregulated proliferation of cell growth forming multi-organ hamartomas.Â mTOR is activated in the proliferating fibroblast-like cells within facial angiofibromas. The cells produce an epidermal growth factor called epiregulin, which stimulates epidermal cell proliferation so that they are produced at a faster rate. Angiofibromas of TS also have vascular proliferation from increased expression of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF stimulates mTOR.
