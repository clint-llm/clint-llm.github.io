When the patient is known HIV positive, and the CD4 count is less than 200 cells/µL, or an AIDS-defining illness is present, this is considered pathognomonic for the diagnosis of AIDS.  There are several AIDS-defining illnesses that in and of themselves suggest a severely immunocompromised state when HIV-positive:

- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy

- Brain toxoplasmosis
