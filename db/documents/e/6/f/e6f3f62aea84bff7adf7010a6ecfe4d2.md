Several approaches to CPB have been described. The two most commonly practiced approaches are the posterior and anterior para-aortic approaches. The anterior approach should be considered in patients with advanced disease who may have abdominal discomfort, cannot lie prone, or have recently undergone abdominal surgery. A diagnostic block of local anesthetic should be performed before the neurolytic block to confirm pain relief attributable to the block. Within the literature, alcohol is the preferred agent for neurolytic celiac plexus blocks as it is considered to be more effective.

**Posterior Para-Aortic Approach**

Place the patient prone with support under the abdomen to increase the thoracic kyphosis. Note the following anatomical landmarks: midline spine and vertebral bodies, iliac crests, 12th rib, and lateral border of the paraspinal muscles. Disinfect the skin and drape in the usual fashion.

With radiographic tools, identify the T12 and L1 vertebral bodies. Identify and mark the inferior border of the 12th rib. A skin wheal should be placed at the inferior border of the 12th rib approximately 6 to 8 cm from the midline. An appropriate spinal-type needle should be advanced at a 45-degree angle from posterior to anterior toward the ventral surface of the T12-L1 intervertebral space until the vertebral body is contacted.

Once the vertebral body has been contacted, the spinal needle should be advanced approximately 1 cm further into the prevertebral fascial plane. Once the needle is in the desired position, confirm the appropriate location by the contrast spread under CT or fluoroscopic guidance. A diagnostic block with local anesthetic or a therapeutic neurolytic block can now be performed. The left-sided approach has been shown to be reliable in a unilateral block. A bilateral block can be performed if the unilateral block proves insufficient.

**Anterior Para-Aortic Approach**

With the patient supine, map the needle trajectory using CT or fluoroscopic guidance. Disinfect the skin and drape in the usual fashion. A skin wheal should be placed on the abdominal wall anterior to the T12 vertebral body. An appropriate spinal-type needle should be inserted and directed toward the abdominal aorta; this course will typically encounter abdominal viscera, including the bowel, stomach, and liver. The final position of the tip of the needle should be anterior to the aorta and diaphragmatic crura. Inject the neurolytic agent into the antecrural space.

This approach is often quicker than the posterior para-aortic approach and well tolerated by patients; the potential for organ injury limits its use.
