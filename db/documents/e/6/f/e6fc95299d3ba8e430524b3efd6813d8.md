Acquired aural atresia, although rare, is most often seen following external ear trauma, such as motor vehicle accidents, gunshot wounds, or otologic surgery. In rare instances, canal stenosis and atresia have been described in the setting of neoplastic changes and idiopathic inflammatory processes.

The exact cause of congenital aural atresia is often multifactorial. Several defined syndromes are associated with ear malformations, but most cases are idiopathic. It ultimately results from disruption of the normal embryological development beginning as early as the sixth week of gestation.

It may also demonstrate either an autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance pattern, suggesting multiple genetic aberrations as potential causes. Treacher-Collins syndrome is most commonly caused by a TCOF1 gene mutation and is associated with aural atresia. The TCOF1 gene is involved in various aspects of early craniofacial development, including the first and second pharyngeal arches. Crouzon syndrome is caused by an FGFR2 or FGFR3 mutation on chromosome 10. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant syndrome fashion, often causing craniosynostosis and occasionally causing aural atresia.

Several external risk factors have also been identified. These include maternal isotretinoin use, maternal thalidomide use, vascular insults often due to maternal cocaine abuse, and maternal diabetes.
