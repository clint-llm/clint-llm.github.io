There have not been a significant number of pantoprazole overdoses, which have led to serious medical consequences. There is no specific antidote for an event such as this. Furthermore, pantoprazole is not removable from the body via hemodialysis. As a result, treatment in Pantoprazole overdose focuses on symptomatic relief. In laboratory studies have shown that single doses ranging from 709 mg/kg to 887 mg/kg caused death in animal subjects (mice, rats, and dogs). Acutely, there was evidence of hypoactivity, tremor, and ataxia in these animals.
