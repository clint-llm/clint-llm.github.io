Human growth hormone (HGH), also known as somatotropin, is a 191 amino acid single-chain polypeptide produced by somatotropic cells within the anterior pituitary gland. As its name implies, scientists originally found it to be responsible for growth regulation during childhood. However, research has determined that HGH is also responsible for the regulation of many of the body’s other basal metabolic functions and operates as an acute phase stress reactant.
