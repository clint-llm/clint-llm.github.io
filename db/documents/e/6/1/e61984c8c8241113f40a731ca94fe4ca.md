**Lymphadenopathy**

Swollen lymph nodes usually indicate infection from bacteria or viruses. Swollen inguinal lymph nodes could indicate an infection of areas of the lower body. One of the more concerning causes of inguinal lymphadenopathy is sexually transmitted infections. Sexually transmitted infections that commonly presents with inguinal lymphadenopathy are lymphogranuloma venereum, secondary syphilis, and chancroid caused by Chlamydia trachomatis(L1-L3), Treponema pallidum, and Haemophilus ducreyi, respectively.

Lymphogranuloma venereum

Lymphogranuloma venereum is a disease of the genital area caused by the gram-negative bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis (serovars L1, L2, and L3). Lymphogranuloma venereum primarily affects the lymphatic system and has three stages. The secondary stage of lymphogranuloma venereum can present with unilateral or bilateral tender inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Syphilis

Syphilis is a bacterial infection caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Clinical presentation of secondary syphilis can present with diffuse lymphadenopathy along with fever, skin rashes, and condylomata lata.

Chancroid

Chancroid is a rare sexually transmitted disease caused by a small gram-negative rod, Haemophilus ducreyi. Fifty percent of infected individuals present with tender inguinal lymphadenopathy along with ulcers with exudate.

**Lymphedema**

Lymphedema is the swelling that typically occurs in the arm or leg due to the lymph vessels unable to drain lymph fluid sufficiently. Damage to the inguinal lymph node can present with lymphedema of the lower limb. Infection-related lymphedema is more common in developing countries in tropical and subtropical regions. Wuchereria bancrofti is a nematode known to commonly cause lymphedema of the leg. Transmitted by mosquito bites, Wuchereria bancrofti invade lymph nodes and causes inflammation and damage to the lymph node and lymphatic system.

In developed countries, lymphedema causes are commonly due to malignancy or treatment of malignancy. Treatment includes the excision of malignant lymph nodes for diagnosis and radiation treatment.

**Cancer Diagnosis**

Cancer can appear in the lymph node as the primary site of cancer or can spread there from another primary site. Cancer cells are able to migrate through the lymphatic system and end up in a lymph node that is draining the primary site. For carcinomas that disseminate through the lymphatic system, they commonly spread to the regional node before spreading to the next tier of nodes. These immediate regional nodes are called the sentinel lymph nodes. If the clinician suspects an individual of having cancer, a biopsy or dissection of the sentinel lymph node that is draining the site of interest can help to determine if cancer has metastasized. Upon finding a cancerous cell in the sentinel lymph node, this information can assist with staging cancer and direct mode of therapy.

Common tumors that metastasize to the inguinal lymph node include squamous carcinoma of the vulva, penis, and anus.

Vulvar Cancer

The vulva is the area of skin surrounding the urethra and vagina. Vulvar cancer is more common in postmenopausal women and can present with lumps or bumps and itching. Other symptoms include tenderness, bleeding, and skin changes. The precise etiology of vulvar cancer is unknown, but some factors increase the risk of someone getting vulvar cancer. These risk factors include older age, exposure of human papillomavirus, smoking, a weakened immune system, and a skin condition involving the vulva.

Penile Cancer

Penile cancer is most common in Asia, Africa, South America. Penile cancer begins as a small lesion on the glans that varies on appearance. The lesion can appear as masses growing from skin or white or reddish-colored mass. Risk factors include uncircumcised and human papillomavirus infection. Other risk factors include a history of phimosis, balanitis, chronic inflammation, tobacco use, lichen sclerosis, and poor hygiene.

Anal Cancer

Anal cancer is cancer that occurs in the anal canal. Patients can present with anal bleeding, weight loss, a sensation of a mass, tenderness, and itching. Risk factors include older age and human papillomavirus infection.
