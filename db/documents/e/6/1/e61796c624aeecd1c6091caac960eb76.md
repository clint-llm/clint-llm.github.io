Subclavian artery thrombosis is a rare presentation, but it is often symptomatic when it occurs. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a cardiologist, radiologist, vascular surgeon, nursing staff, and pharmacists. It is essential to treat the condition causing subclavian artery thrombosis, and this will also include reducing risk factors like smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. To that end, the various clinicians from different specialties will drive the overall direction of care, but nursing and pharmacy will make significant contributions.

Nurses will assist in patient evaluation, help coordinate specialist referrals, and assist in surgical procedures. Pharmacists will coordinate medication management, offer patient medication counsel, help with anticoagulant protocols, and perform medication reconciliation. All specialists, nurses, and pharmacists must maintain open communication lines with the rest of the team and maintain accurate and updated records so everyone involved in care has access to the latest accurate patient data. This interprofessional paradigm will result in the best patient outcomes. [Level 5]
