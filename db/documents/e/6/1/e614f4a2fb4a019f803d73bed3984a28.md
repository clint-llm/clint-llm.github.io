**Anovulation Disorders are divided into 3 groups by the World Health Organization**

- ****Group I Disorders:**Hypothalamic failure leading to Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism which is responsible for 10% anovulation cases.**
- **Examples:**Kallmann Syndrome, Panhypopituitarism from apoplexy, autoimmune destruction, adenoma interference, or infections. Postpartum hemorrhage (Sheehan Syndrome) or head trauma can also cause hypothalamic failure that is irreversible or transient.

- **Group II Disorders:**HPO axis dysfunction which is responsible for 85% of anovulatory cases.
- The most common cause of female infertility in the United States is ovulatory dysfunction, in which a variety of hormonal factors interfere with the complex sequence of hormonal events required to trigger ovulation. Problems can occur at any point in this pathway (hypothalamus, pituitary, ovary) and can lead to failure to ovulate. The most common cause of chronic ovulatory dysfunction in the United States is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, or PCOS, which interferes with ovulation at multiple points.
- **Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome**is considered an endocrinopathy that is the etiology for anovulatory infertility (i.e. >90% of cases). PCOS is characterized by irregular menstrual cycles secondary to anovulatory bleeding caused by friable hyperplastic endometrial tissue, hyperandrogenism, and it is associated with various metabolic derangements (i.e. hyperinsulinemia).
- It is understood, hyperandrogenism is the result of the balance-derangement between Androgen hormone levels and LH/FSH levels. The exact mechanism for how this is caused is not entirely understood, but research supports the thought that peripheral conversion of estrogen into androgens by adipose tissue is one mechanism for elevating serum androgen levels and depleting estrogen.
- Hyperinsulinemia secondary to insulin resistance is thought to play a role in PCOS. During puberty, it is common for a degree of Insulin resistance to be seen resulting from Insulin-growth factor-1 (IGF-1). This process is considered largely normal if IR is confined to glucose metabolism. In women with PCOS, IR affects multi-systems including the liver resulting in decreased sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) synthesis. Reduced SHBG levels contribute to the elevation of free androgens, further deranging the hormone balance. 


- **Immature Hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian Axis**
- Anovulation that presents with irregular menstruation in adolescent females as a result of an immature hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis can be a common, expected finding. An anovulatory pattern of menstruation can be seen during the first year after the onset of menarche and persist till 18 years-of-age. The HPO axis is believed to have reached maturation. Persistent irregularities should be further evaluated for “non-functional” causes of inoculation.

- **Group III Disorders:**Ovarian insufficiency or failure suggesting the premature depletion of oocytes as a result of genetic, iatrogenic, or acquired causes.
- **Examples:**Turner Syndrome is the most common genetic form of Premature Ovarian Insufficiency and Autoimmune Thyroiditis induced hypothyroidism is the leading autoimmune-mediated condition that can result in a group III anovulation dysfunction.
