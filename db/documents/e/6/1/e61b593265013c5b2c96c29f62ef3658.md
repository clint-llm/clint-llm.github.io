Patients with Asherman syndrome may have light or absent menstrual periods (amenorrhea). Still, some patients have normal periods based on the surface area of the cavity that is affected. Others have no periods but have severe dysmenorrhea (pain with menstruation) that may occur around the time of the anticipated menstrual period. The pain may indicate that the endometrial build-up occurs during the cycle, but that menstrual flow is obstructed due to adhesions near or within the cervix. These adhesions can present as recurrent miscarriage and/or infertility due to deficient endometrium and its poor vascularisation.
