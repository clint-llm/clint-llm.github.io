For mono-place chambers, one specially trained outside attendant may conduct and supervise up to 2 simultaneous hyperbaric chamber treatments and must be in continuous attendance outside the chambers. Multi-place chamber operations require both outside and inside specialty trained attendant(s). Those inside attendants are breathing compressed chamber air and can be at risk for decompression illness just like a scuba diver. Appropriate safety protocols and procedures must be in place to minimize that risk. An outside chamber operator is pressurizing the chamber and is in constant communication with the inside attendant.

A safety director is required to ensure maintenance and safe operations for the hyperbaric facility.

A specialty trained hyperbaric physician prescribes and supervises the pressure, time, and gas profiles of the hyperbaric treatments and examines the patient before and after the hyperbaric treatments. A specialty trained hyperbaric nurse provides expert wound care, administers medications, and provides training and education to the patients.
