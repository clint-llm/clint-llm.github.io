Sexually transmitted infections are disease processes from close physical contact between males and females by transmission through sexual contact. Sexually transmitted infections, previously known as sexually transmitted diseases, involve the transmission of an organism between sexual partners through different routes of sexual contact, either oral, anal, or vaginal. Sexually transmitted infections affect all people and can be prevented with proper education and barrier control. STIs are more frequently underrecognized and have a higher incidence in medically underserved populations. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of sexually transmitted infections and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.
