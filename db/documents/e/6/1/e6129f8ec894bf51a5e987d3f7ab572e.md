The managment of patients with portal hypertension is with an interprofessional team that consists of a pathologist, radiologist, gastroenterologist, general surgeon, dietitian, and an internist. As outpatients the majority of them are followed by the nurse practitioner and primary care provider. Some of these patients may develop variceal bleeding and require TIPS. Only experienced interventionalists should perform a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in a dedicated interventional suite with adequate personnel, including experienced technologists and nursing staff. Ideally, the anesthesiology team should be available to provide anesthesia as appropriate. an interprofessional team approach is very useful in the management of these patients including interventional radiology, gastrointestinal (hepatology) medicine, and transplantation surgery as they each add their unique management skills. Because TIPS is not 100% effective, patients need close follow up and the transplant team consulted. Some of these patients may benefit from a liver transplant. The overall outcome of patients with portal hypertension is poor. Liver transplant is not the ideal solution because of expense and shortage of organs.
