Bile is synthesized in the hepatocytes and secreted into the bile canaliculi until it reaches the sphincter of Oddi. If the sphincter closes, the bile is refluxed back up into the gallbladder to be stored and concentrated there. Bile becomes concentrated by the reabsorption of water and electrolytes and to some extent by the reabsorption of bile salts. Once the food is present in the duodenum (especially fatty food), the I cells are stimulated to secrete CCK which in turn causes gallbladder wall contraction as well as relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi. The bile then flows into the second part of the duodenum and causes emulsification of large fat droplets into small ones. The formation of micelles aid in the absorption of fat and fat-soluble particles.; this is because the micelle has a central hydrophobic core and peripheral hydrophilic form. The fat and fat-soluble vitamins will become incorporated into the central hydrophobic part of micelle for reabsorption.
