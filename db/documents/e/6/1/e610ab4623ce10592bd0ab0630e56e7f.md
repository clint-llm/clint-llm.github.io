In general, all types of esophagitis can mimic each other as the initial clinical presentation is usually similar and will require further detailed history and further diagnostic test including endoscopy and histopathology examination. Histologically Reflux esophagitis can closely mimic eosinophilic esophagitis. In these cases, usual clinical practice is to prescribe Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for 8 weeks. Acid reflux esophagitis usually responds well to PPI treatment with a resolution of eosinophilic infiltration but the persistence of clinical symptoms or eosinophilic infiltration on repeat endoscopy confirms EoE. Endoscopy appearance of the esophageal lesion with histology also confirm different types of infectious esophagitis.

Because retrosternal chest pain and dysphagia or odynophagia are common symptoms are shared by many other diseases differential diagnosis is usually broad. Some important differential diagnosis which must be considered is acute coronary syndrome with atypical chest pain, malignancy, peptic ulcer disease, rings and webs, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, achalasia, and esophageal motility disorder.
