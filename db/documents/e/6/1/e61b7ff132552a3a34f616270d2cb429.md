The prognosis of bronchiolitis obliterans depends on the underlying pathology. Some patients achieve complete improvement; however, those with constrictive disease generally demonstrate a more progressive course, but at present, there is insufficient research to provide a statistical correlation. Lung function often deteriorates over time, so patients will usually need to have repeated lung testing throughout their lives. Progressive disease may require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation in very severe cases. The worst cases may require a lung transplant.
