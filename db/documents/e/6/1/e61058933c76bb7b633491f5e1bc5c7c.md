The diagnosis and management of vestibular migraine are complex and best done with an interprofessional team. This team may include primary clinicians, neurologists, neurotologists, otolaryngologists, nurses, and pharmacists. There are many treatments for vestibular migraine but there is no specific treatment that works for everyone. Current treatment options include lifestyle changes such as caffeine omission, and avoidance of known dietary, behavioral or sleep hygiene triggers. Prophylactic medications such as topiramate, nortriptyline, propranolol may provide some benefit despite few controlled studies on the matter. Vestibular rehabilitation may play a role. Treatment of associated anxiety is a necessity.
