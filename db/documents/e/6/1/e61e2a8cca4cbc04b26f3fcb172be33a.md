Duplex ultrasonography (US) is the ideal screening and diagnostic imaging modality to detect aÂ popliteal artery aneurysm and estimate its diameter. The US also provides detailed information regarding vessel patency, development of mural thrombus, and the status of outflow vessels. CT or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography are other alternatives to duplex ultrasonography and can accurately measure true lumen diameters as well as assist in the planning of operative repair. Conventional angiography is reserved for either elective endovascular repair of an aneurysm or in cases of threatening acute limb ischemia for initiation of thrombolytic therapy.
