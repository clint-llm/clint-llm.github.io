A vestibular migraine is an elusive diagnosis with variable presentation and without pathognomonic testing despite significant associated morbidity.

Familiarity with recently accepted Barany Society and the International Headache Society diagnostic criteria is important to make a diagnosis. See below:

- At least 5 episodes of vestibular symptoms of moderate or severe intensity lasting 5 minutes to 72 hours

- Current or previous history of migraine with or without aura according to the ICHD classification

- One or more migraine features with at least 50% of vestibular episodes: headache with at least 2 of the following characteristics: one-sided location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe pain intensity, or aggravation by routine physical activity; photophobia or phonophobia; visual aura

- Not better accounted for by another vestibular or ICHD diagnosis

Vestibular migraine can present at any age, although middle-aged women are most commonly affected.

One theory exists that a vestibular migraine may be caused by vestibular end-organ disease; therefore, regular patient monitoring is merited to evaluate for possible contributing morbidity.

A vestibular migraine may be associated with other illnesses such as Meniere syndrome or BPPV. The verdict is currently out regarding the chronology of events/triggers. Do Meniere attacks trigger a vestibular migraine, or does a vestibular migraine give rise to Meniere syndrome features?
