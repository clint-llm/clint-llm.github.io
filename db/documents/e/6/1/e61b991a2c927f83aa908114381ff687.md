The precise diagnosis of adrenal cortical nodular hyperplasia might be obtained through laboratory and imaging tests requested by endocrinologists. After exclusion of the differential diagnoses, the patient might need to be referred to general and/or laparoscopic surgeons to schedule the appropriate operation. As ablative procedure imposes the lifelong demand for glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement, the patient should be followed up by an interprofessional team, including surgeons and endocrinologists. During surgery, the anesthesiologist should be prepared for the most lethal and possible complications. Regarding the postoperative complications, the registered nurse is supposed to frequently check the vital signs to preclude the possible devastating and irreversible consequences of bleeding and thromboembolic events. In suspicious occasions of bleeding and thromboembolic events, timely management with fluid replacement and emergent anticoagulant initiation respectively, is preferred. The pathologist should precisely examine the specimen to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other possible differential diagnoses.
