Gastric lymphomas can be classified histologically as marginal zone B-cell lymphomas of MALT type, diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, follicular lymphomas, mantle cell lymphomas, Burkittâ€™s lymphomas, T-cell lymphomas, and plasmacytomas. MALT lymphoma and large B-cell lymphomas make up nearly 90% of all gastric lymphomas. The histologic characteristics of MALT lymphoma include centrocyte-like cells, plasma cell infiltration, and destruction of gastric crypts defined as lymphoepithelial lesions. These centrocyte-like cells will express CD19, CD20, and CD79a but do not express CD5, CD10, CD23, and cyclin D1.
