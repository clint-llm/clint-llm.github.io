In the patient with postpartum fever and abdominal/pelvic pain, key conditions in the differential diagnosis include urinary tract infections (including pyelonephritis), pneumonia, surgical site infections, and septic pelvic thrombophlebitis.

For patients with acute endometritis/PID, the differential diagnosis includes ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhagic or ruptured ovarian cyst, ovarian torsion, endometriosis, acute cystitis, and GI causes (e.g., appendicitis, diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome).

Chronic endometritis typically presents as either irregular bleeding or fertility challenges. The differential diagnosis of irregular bleeding is broad, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends classifying abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) according to the PALM-COEIN system, which is an acronym standing for polyps, adenomyosis, leiomyomas, malignancy, coagulopathy, ovulatory dysfunction, endometrial causes (of which chronic endometritis is one cause), iatrogenic/infectious, and not-yet-classified.
