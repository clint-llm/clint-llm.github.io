Patients should be informed about the symptoms of cryoglobulinemia so that medical therapy can be sought early to avoidÂ potential organ damage. Patients with mild disease that manifests primarily as arthralgias and fatigue benefit from understanding and avoiding the precipitating factor (i.e., cold temperatures, trauma). Moreover, NSAIDs could be advised to reduce the symptoms acutely.
