When Euphorbia latex exposure has been confirmed, patients should be educated on the toxic nature of the plant and advised to avoid contact with similar plants if feasible. If the individual is required to handle these plants, they should be instructed to avoid direct skin contact and use PPE, including gloves and goggles. Gloves or clothing that come into contact with the plant or sap should be washed immediately. Ornamental Euphorbia plants should be kept out of reach of small children and pets. If the patient is at risk for future exposure to toxic plants, they should be encouraged to take photographs of plants and bring these to any medical evaluations for review.
