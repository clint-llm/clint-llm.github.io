Fibrosarcoma has a poor prognosis due to its aggressive disease course. To maximize outcomes, patients must seek medical treatment from trained specialists with an understanding of musculoskeletal tumors.

Optimal outcomes are seen when there is complete surgical tumor resection with histologically tumor-free margins, appropriate adjuvant treatment to surgical intervention to maximize treatment benefit, and minimize recurrence. There is the prevention of tumor invasion and metastasis. All patients should undergo routine medical screenings and should inquire with their primary care physician regarding any soft tissue masses they may have noticed on self-examination.
