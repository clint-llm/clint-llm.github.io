C. burnetii can be isolated in a lab in cell culture media, but since laboratory transmission has been reported, growing it in a lab can be hazardous. Its culture and manipulation of the contaminated specimens should only be allowed in biosafety level 3 laboratories.

Lab findings seen in patients with acute Q fever include normal white blood cell count (90%), thrombocytopenia (25%), raised transaminase levels (70%), smooth muscle autoantibodies (65%), and anti-phospholipase antibodies (50%). In chronic patients, leukocytosis (25%),leukopenia (15%), increased transaminase levels (40%-60%), thrombocytopenia (26%-50%), anemia (40%), increased creatinine levels (65%), smooth muscle autoantibodies (40%), circulating immune complexes (90%), antinuclear antibodies (35%) and rheumatoid factor (60%) are seen.
