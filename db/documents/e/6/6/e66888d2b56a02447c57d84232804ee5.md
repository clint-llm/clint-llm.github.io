The Breast Imaging and Reporting System (BIRADS) published by the American College of Radiology (ACR), provides a classification system for breast masses and biopsy criteria. The classification system is based on imaging features correlating to cancer risk, and ranges from 1 through 6, the greater the classification, the higher likelihood of cancer. Generally, a breast biopsy is indicated in any patient with a complex cyst, solid mass, indeterminate or suspicious solid mass, indeterminate or suspicious microcalcifications, and suspicious architectural distortion.
