Early diagnosis of chronic pulmonary thromboembolism is a challenging task due to nonspecific symptoms and delayed manifestation of the disease. Confirmation of the diagnosis requires a combination of imaging techniques such as echocardiography, Ventilation/perfusion scan (V/Q) scan, and CT pulmonary angiography.

Initial evaluation of a patient often includes Chest X-ray, which may be normal in the early stages of the disease. In later stages, Chest X-ray shows signs of pulmonary hypertension, cardiac chambers enlargement, and segmental oligemia with pleuroparenchymal scarring.

Transthoracic echocardiography is a primary diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, but it is not specific, as it cannot differentiate between acute and chronic PE.

V/Q scan has high sensitivity (90 to 100%) and specificity (94 to 100%) and is a first-line screening tool for diagnosing CTEPH.

Right heart catheterization with conventional pulmonary angiography is the gold standard in diagnosing CTEPH. Novel techniques such as dual-energy CT, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are also valuable diagnostic tools and assist in the evaluation of patients with CTEPH.

The combination of different diagnostic tools can provide additional information and assist with differential diagnosis, planning treatment strategies, and assessing response to treatment.
