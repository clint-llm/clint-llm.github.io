- HIV lipodystrophy is a complication of ART. It results in abnormal accumulation of fat around the waist and localized loss of fat from the facial area. Current treatment is with tesamorelin, a synthetic growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), and dermal fillers.

- Prophylaxis can be initiated to attempt the prevention of many of the common opportunistic infections described above.  When CD4 counts fall to less than 200 cells/µL, prophylaxis for PCP pneumonia is begun with one double-strength TMP-SMX tablet. Toxoplasma gondii prophylaxis should commence when the CD4 count is less than 100 cells/uL, and first-line treatment is also with one double-strength TMP-SMX.  Disseminated MAC prophylaxis will be necessary when CD4 counts fall below 50 cells/uL, and the treatment of choice is azithromycin.

- With the addition of ART, cardiovascular disease is now the major cause of morbidity and mortality for HIV patients.

- The number of CD4 cells within the affected individual will fall by approximately 50-80 cells/µL per year if ART is not initiated, and the decline may be even faster once the count falls below 200 cells/uL.

- When the patient is known HIV positive, and the CD4 count is less than 200 cells/uL, or an AIDS-defining illness is present, this defines the diagnosis of AIDS.

- Some more emphasized common AIDS-defining illnesses would include: candida esophagitis, invasive cervical cancer, PCP pneumonia, disseminated TB, Kaposi sarcoma, and Cryptosporidium diarrhea.
