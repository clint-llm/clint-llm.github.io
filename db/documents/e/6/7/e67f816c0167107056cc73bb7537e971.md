A good clinical evaluation of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) involves a detailed history and physical. The morphology and location of the dermatitisÂ is often the best indicator of the offending agent. Patch testing can be performed to help confirm the diagnosis. If the diagnosis is still not certain, a skin biopsy usually demonstrates spongiosis.
