Neuronal brain tumors are a diverse group of primary central nervous system tumors consisting of lesions with either a primarily neuronal background or a mixed glial and neuronal background, termed glioneuronal tumors. These are rare tumors most commonly associated with epilepsy, although other symptoms may also occur, such as headaches, focal neurological deficits, and acute hydrocephalus. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of neuronal brain tumors and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients that are found to harbor these tumors.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of neuronal brain tumors.
- Describe the presentation of neuronal brain tumors.
- Review the evaluation and management of patients with neuronal brain tumors.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional discussion regarding the evaluation and management of patients with neuronal brain tumors.
