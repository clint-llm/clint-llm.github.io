Some pathologies result in the formation of intra-articular loose bodies or synovial proliferation.

- Crystal deposition disease (tendinosis Calcarea)

- Osteocartilaginous loose bodies

- Osteochondritis dissecans

- Neurotrophic arthritis

- Rheumatoid arthritis

- Degenerative arthritis

- Tuberculous arthritis

- Osteochondral fractures

- Soft tissue tumors

Other benign synovial disorders include synovial hemangioma, lipoma arborescent, and pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS).

Differential diagnosis should also consider the possibility of a malignant lesion. Interosseous low-grade chondrosarcoma that extends into a joint and synovial cell sarcoma can be considered if the lesions involve bone adjacent to a joint. MRI findings help differentiate possible malignant. Marrow invasion is not usual with synovial chondromatosis. It is more likely to be present with malignant lesions.

For both the clinician and the pathologist, it can be challenging to distinguish synovial chondromatosis from chondrosarcoma. The classic indicators of malignancy, such as bony invasion, permeation, and destructive growth across joints, develop late in the disease course. Recurrence (especially multiple episodes of recurrence) is a significant sign that warrants consideration of malignant transformation. However, the number of lesions, the size, or the rate of change do not correlate with malignancy.
