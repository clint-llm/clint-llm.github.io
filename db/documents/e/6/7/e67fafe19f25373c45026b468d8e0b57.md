The classical clinical presentation of SGH is of a solitary nodule or multiple skin-colored or yellowish papules localized on the face (forehead, cheeks, chin) or in the upper trunk. The clini­cal lesions display a central dell corresponding to the follicular infundibular ostium. These lesions are soft and vary in size from 2 to 9 mm.

Dermoscopically, sebaceous hyperplasia reveals a pattern composed of aggregated white-yellowish nodules corresponding to hyperplastic sebaceous glands. The ostium of the gland is sometimes visible as a small crater or umbilication in the center of those yellowish nodules.
