Dysregulation of the endogenous opioid system has implications in a wide variety of disease states reflective of its wide distribution throughout the human nervous system and body.

**Pain Dysregulation**

Research shows that mu-opioid receptor (MOR) availability to decreases in patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia in addition to having an elevated concentration of endogenous opioid concentrations in their CSF. Further, pain-evoked brain activity, as measured by fMRI, was found to be proportional to MOR binding potential.

**Substance Misuse Disorders**

Enkephalins have implications in sensitization to cocaine, where they show strong expression in mesocorticolimbic areas.

**Feeding Behavior**

In a mouse gene knockout model for the pro-enkephalin gene, mice without the pro-enkephalin gene were found to have lower overall body weights as compared to the wild-type mice under similar conditions.
