Pancreatitis associated with hypertriglyceridemia is treated with intravenous (IV) fluids and bowel rest. Also, IV insulin infusion (as low as 1 unit/hour) is an effective management strategy as it suppresses lipolysis and decreases triglyceride assembly in the liver. Plasmapheresis is an effective option when the triglyceride levels are extremely high. Upon recovery from an acute episode of pancreatitis, attention must be paid to reduce triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL, although less than 150 mg/dL is considered ideal.

Fibrates are the first-line drugs for lowering triglycerides and can achieve a 30% to 50% reduction with a concomitant increase in HDL-C.

Omega-3 fatty acids (OM3FA) are FDA approved for the treatment of severe and very severe hypertriglyceridemia (greater than 1000 mg/dL). OMF3FA reduces triglycerides by 20% - 50% at a dosage of 3 g to 4 g/day.

Niacin has two formulations - immediate release and extended-release. Niacin reduces triglycerides by about 10% - 30%, while it increases HDL-C by 10-40% and lowers LDL-C by 5-20%.

Statins lower triglyceride by about 10% - 30% but in a dose-dependent manner. Statins are used as monotherapy in triglyceride levels of more than 500 m/dL when indicated to decrease cardiovascular risk.
