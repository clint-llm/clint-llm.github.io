Otoscopy is a routine exam performed by many health practitioners for both screening purposes and evaluating specific ear complaints. Given the frequent use of otoscopes, they represent a potential source for the spread of infection. Research suggests that over 40% of otoscopes may become contaminated with potentially pathogenic microbial organisms such as pseudomonas, staphylococcus, aspergillus, and candida species.
