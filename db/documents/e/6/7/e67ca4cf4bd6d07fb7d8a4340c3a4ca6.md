Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is for those who want to quit smoking, as abruptly stopping can cause withdrawals and cravings. Nicotine withdrawal occurs after person smoking cigarettes discontinues the use of cigarettes suddenly. Using NRT helps reduce the motivation to smoke cigarettes because the body still gets nicotine from another safer method.
