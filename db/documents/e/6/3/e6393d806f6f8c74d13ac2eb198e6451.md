The dive reflex has been described as a series of physiological changes that take place in the body in response to a mammal holding its breath while submerged in water. The answer as to why this complicated dynamic reflex takes place is quite simple: to preserve life. The diving response demonstrates a cessation of breathing, decreased heart rate, and an increase in peripheral vascular resistance leading to a redistribution of blood flow to adequately perfuse the brain and heart while limiting flow to non-essential muscles.
