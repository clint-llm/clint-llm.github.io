Functions of transferrinÂ include:

- Free Fe3+ is insoluble at a neutral pH; when iron binds to transferrin, it becomes soluble.

- Deliver and transfer iron to all the various biological tissues between sites of absorption, utilization, and storage

- Prevent the formation of reactive oxygen species.

- Chelate-free toxic iron and acts as a protective scavenger.

- Deliver WBC macrophages to all tissues

- Transferrin is a part of the innate immune system; the binding of transferrin to iron impedes bacterial survival.

- Transferrin acts as a marker for inflammation; the level of transferrin decreases during inflammation.
