Deficiency of RBC membrane proteins (mostly spectrin) results in defective linkage of RBC inner membrane cytoskeleton to its outer lipid bilayer.Â This defect results in loss of RBC membrane stability and deformability with progressive membrane lipid bilayer loss in the microvasculature. Membrane loss results in spherocytosis, a drop in mean corpuscular volume (MCV), an increase in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), and increased osmotic fragility of RBCs. Spherocytes are destroyed and cleared from circulation during passage through the spleen.
