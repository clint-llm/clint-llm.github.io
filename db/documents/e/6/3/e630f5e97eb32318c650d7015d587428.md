Propofol toxicity is primarily a healthcare professional’s responsibility to recognize and manage.  First and foremost, the patient must be an appropriate candidate for propofol administration.  Second, education for the clinical team on the proper use of propofol is a requirement; this includes knowing the limits of safe infusion rates.  Pharmacists can check that the correct medication formulation and concentration are ready for use.  The propofol administration should be with pumps with defined maximum infusion limits.  Nursing staff should never let rates exceed 4mg/kg/min.  Regular physical examinations and workups of the patient’s condition should be monitored.  Close supervision of the patient is necessary.  Dietitians may be helpful to the team in safely increasing carbohydrate load to help prevent propofol toxicity. If PRIS is suspected, the team must take quick action to stop the propofol infusion and treat it accordingly. All these interprofessional personnel working together as a coordinated healthcare team can best ensure the safe use of propofol for procedures, as well as reacting to PRIS if it does begin to manifest.
