As is true with all procedures, the key to success is adequate preparation. To fabricate a wrist splint, first, obtain all equipment as outlined above. If you do not have a sink available in your procedure room, fill a bucket or emesis basin with a few inches of warm water. Place a sheet or chuck pad on the floor and under the extremity to be treated. Using web roll, measure the length of the splint to be applied (see technique section below for lengths) and tear at the appropriate length. For plaster splints, tear three additional layers of web roll to be used as padding (optional for pre-padded). Using the measured web roll strip as a guide, cut the pre-padded casting material with fiberglass to size with shears/scissors or, if using plaster, cut 8 strips of equal length and layer on top of each other.
