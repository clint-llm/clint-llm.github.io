**Coronary Perfusion Pressure and Coronary Blood Flow**

It is important to note that CPP is not the only determinant of coronary blood flow. While CPP provides the pressure which drives coronary perfusion, coronary autoregulation describes the process which allows coronary blood flow to match myocardial demand over a range of CPP between 60Â to 180mmHg.

Flow = Difference in pressure across a vessel/resistance

Therefore, CPP represents the pressure gradient across the coronary vasculature, while resistance is mediated by autoregulation to deliver the required flow rates.

**Table 1. Coronary autoregulation is under the control of neurohormonal, endocrine, metabolic, and endothelial-derived systems, which induce either coronary vasoconstriction or vasodilation.**
