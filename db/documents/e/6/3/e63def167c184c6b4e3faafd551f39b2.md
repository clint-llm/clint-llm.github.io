Other gaseous toxicities can present with similar symptoms. Following differentials should be considered when assessing a hydrogen sulfide toxicity patient.

- Hydrocarbons commonly cause dyspnea and cough and may lead to respiratory distress. Infiltrates can be seen on a chest X-ray. CNS depression and myocardial dysfunction can also occur.

- Cyanide has a similar mechanism of action as hydrogen sulfide, and patients may also have an overlap of some symptoms, including seizures, tachypnea, and coma. Cyanide, however, is more likely to also present with headache, nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias, cyanosis, and renal and hepatic failure. Cyanide classically has a smell of almonds rather than the rotten egg smell of hydrogen sulfide.

- Patients with carbon monoxide poisoning and methemoglobinemia can also present with headache, dyspnea, and confusion but are also more likely to have symptoms of chest pain, nausea, and vomiting. Context is key when differentiating many of these toxic gases with overlapping symptoms. Co-oximetry can help rule out carbon monoxide poisoning and methemoglobinemia.
