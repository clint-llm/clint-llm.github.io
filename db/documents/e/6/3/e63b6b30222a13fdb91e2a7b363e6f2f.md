Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy manifests in the neonatal period as corneal edema and opacification. Edema can result in 2Â to 3 times the normal corneal thickness.SLC4A11 gene is active in corneal endothelium, and codes for bicarbonate transporter-related protein-1 (BTR1) that acts as a sodium-borate cotransporter to relieve excess water from the stroma. In CHED, BTR-1 is dysfunctional and often fails to reach the plasma membrane to perform its purpose.
