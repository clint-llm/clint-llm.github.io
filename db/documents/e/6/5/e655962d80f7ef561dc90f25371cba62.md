The year 1978 saw the first reported case of Allgrove syndrome (AS) or 3A syndrome (AAA).

The clinical presentation of classical signs and symptoms of the syndrome is dependent on the age of the patient. Ophthalmological abnormalities are usually present at birth, whereas adrenal and gastrointestinal abnormalities are apparent after six months to the first decade of life.Â Neurological dysfunction from the involvement of central or autonomic nervous systems is also common with Allgrove syndrome observed during the adolescent period.
