A patent foramen ovale is a remnant opening of the fetal foramen ovale. The foramen ovale is a conduit for blood to flow from the right atrium to the left atrium in the fetal state. Usually, the PFO closes at birth, but in about 25% percent of the population, it does not close. Within this subset, a few people experience symptoms or sequelae related to PFO patency. It is these patients who should receive an evaluation for possible PFO closure.
