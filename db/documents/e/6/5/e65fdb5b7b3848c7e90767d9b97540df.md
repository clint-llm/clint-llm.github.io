The many tiny blood vessels that surround the spinal cord and nerve roots are paramount to delivering nutrition, oxygen, and chemomodulators. Compression of these structures limits the ability of these vessels to deliver vital nutrients, resulting in an ischemic effect of the structure. The subsequent inflammation from their compression results in (ischemic) pain along the path of this nerve root. This compression causes an increase in cytokines, TNF-alpha, and the recruitment of macrophages.
