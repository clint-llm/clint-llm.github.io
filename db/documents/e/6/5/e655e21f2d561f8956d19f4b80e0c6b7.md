Four principal arteries supply the brain, namely one internal carotid artery (ICA) and one vertebral artery on each side. Classically the internal carotid arteries on both sides are referred to as the anterior circulation, while the vertebral-basilar arterial system composes the posterior circulation.

Each ICA divides into 3 terminal branches: the ACA, the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the anterior choroidal (artery ACh A). The PCAs are the terminal branches of the vertebrobasilar artery. Anatomists describe different segments of ACA, MCA, and PCA based on the bifurcating pattern.

- A1: Horizontal or pre-communicating begins at the carotid bifurcation and ends at the level of ACom A.

- A2: Vertical or post communicating segment or pre callosal begins at Acom A and ends at the junction rostrum-genu of the corpus callosum.

- A3: Pre-callosal

- A4: Supra-callosal

- A5: Postero-callosal

A3 together with A4 and A5 are referred to as peri-callosal artery.

MCA is subdivided in:

- M1: Sphenoidal

- M2: Insular

- M3: Opercular

- M4: Cortical

PCA is subdivided in:

- P1: Pre-communicating

- P2: Post-communicating

- P3: Quadrigeminal

- P4: Calcarine

ACA, MCA, and PCA harbor important perforating branches that supply vital structures such as the pituitary gland and its infundibular stalk, the optic chiasm, hypothalamus and thalamus, midbrain and basal ganglia.
