Paradoxical embolism is an uncommon cause for acute arterial occlusion. Paradoxical Embolism (PDE) occurs when a thrombus crosses an intracardiac defect into the systemic circulation. Patients may present with symptoms based on the site of the resultant embolization. These sites can include the brain, heart, gastrointestinal tract, or extremities. Patients may present with a cerebrovascular event, chest pain, migraine, cold extremity, or mesenteric ischemia. The emboli is usually a blood clot but maybe a fat particle, air, amniotic fluid, or tumor. The management of paradoxical embolism is medical and/or surgery, depending on the location of the embolus.This activity reviews the evaluation and management of paradoxical emboli and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the most common presenting site of a paradoxical embolus. 
- Explain the factors that lead to the development of paradoxical emboli.
- Explain how to properly treat paradoxical emboli.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve outcomes for patients affected by paradoxical emboli.
