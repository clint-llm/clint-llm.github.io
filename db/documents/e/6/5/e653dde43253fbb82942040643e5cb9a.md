Ancylostoma duodenale, the human hookworm, is the most common parasitic infection in countries with poor access to adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene. Anclyostoma duodenale along with other soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are transmitted through contact with contaminated soil. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, presentation, and diagnosis of ancylostoma and stresses the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of ancylostoma infection.
- Review the presentation of a patient with ancylostoma infection.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for ancylostoma.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with ancylostoma infection.
