A fistula is an abnormal connection between 2 epithelial surfaces. This is a general definition that applies to most of the known fistula but not all of them. The general description differentiates fistulae from sinuses, abscesses, and other forms of luminal tracts or extra-luminal collections. Fistula connects two surfaces or lumens. It begins on the offending side and makes its way to an adjacent lumen or surface. It follows the easiest and shortest path to the adjacent organ. Recto-vaginal fistula starts from the rectum and extends to the vagina. This activity describes the pathophysiology, etiology, and presentation of rectovaginal fistula and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of rectovaginal fistula.
- Review the presentation of the rectovaginal fistula.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for rectovaginal fistula.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with rectovaginal fistula.
