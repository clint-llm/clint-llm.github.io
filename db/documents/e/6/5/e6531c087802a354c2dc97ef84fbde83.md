The exact pathophysiologic mechanism is unknown, but there are some possible explanations for the different forms. One study suggested that patients with the disease have increased the immunologic activity of lymphocytes when exposed to brachial plexus nerve extracts versus sacral plexus nerve extracts. Another study suggested that in patients with early disease, there is an increase in antibodies to peripheral nerve myelin. These findings, along with the association of disease occurrence with recent infection or vaccination, serve as a basis for the immunologic mechanism of the disease. The hereditary form is an autosomal dominant brachial plexitis due to various types of mutations in the Septin 9 gene, chromosome 17q25. Septin 9 is a guanosine 5' triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein highly expressed in glial cells. It is involved in cytoskeleton regulation and function. The hereditary form of brachial plexitis is associated with recurrent disease.
