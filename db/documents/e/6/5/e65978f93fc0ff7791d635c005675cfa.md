Scar formation occurs due to cutaneous dermal injury and is under the influence of various etiologic factors: genetic predisposition; depth, type, and location of the skin injury; the degree of tension; local infection or inflammation; and hormonal influences.

Hypertrophic scars and keloids characteristically demonstrate abnormal fibroblast proliferation and excessive collagen production in response to a range of skin injuries, often arising with a familial tendency.

Hypertrophic scars are the result of excessive collagen synthesis with insufficient collagen lysis during the remodeling phase, which leads to the formation of thick, hyalinized collagen bundles of fibroblasts and fibrocytes.

In contrast, atrophic scars are characterized by dermal depressions that develop as a result of collagen destruction induced by cutaneous inflammation.
