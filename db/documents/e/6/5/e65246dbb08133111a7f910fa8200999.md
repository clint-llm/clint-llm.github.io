Since an increased risk of bleeding is the major concern with vitamin E toxicity, a thorough medication history must be obtained, including any anticoagulation or antiplatelet agents. The history should also include any over-the-counter supplements with exact dosages as patients may be taking many available supplements at their own discretion. The history of weight loss or weight gain may also be important when considering the malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins. With vitamin E toxicity, other fat-soluble vitamins can be decreased.

Some of the major drugs that vitamin E can interact with can cause complications with increased bleeding, hepatobiliary dysfunction, and malabsorption of other fat-soluble vitamins. When vitamin E levels are supplemented at levels greater than 300 mg daily, prescription medication interactions can occur. These common medications include aspirin, warfarin, cyclosporine, and tamoxifen.
