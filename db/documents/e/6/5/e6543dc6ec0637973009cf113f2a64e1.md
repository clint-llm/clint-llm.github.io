Multiple theories exist regarding the true etiology of TGA, but none are proven. These theories have included vascular phenomena, depression, migraines, epilepsy, or psychogenic origins. Studies have supported and debunked arterial ischemia as a source. Vascular congestion was considered and is still one of the leading hypotheses, although questions regarding the associated with certain age groups and the fact thatÂ it is not seen with venous thrombosis have yet to be explained. In addition, it rarely occurs more than a couple of times in a patient's life. Essentially, the theories generated regarding the etiology of TGA do not explain all of the clinical aspects of TGA to date.
