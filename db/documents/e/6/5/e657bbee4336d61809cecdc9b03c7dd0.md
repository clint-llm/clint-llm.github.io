Xeroderma can be acute or chronic in nature, with many individuals experiencing life-long dry skin. Most cases can be managed conservatively with gentle cleansing and adequate moisturization. Patients should recognize and avoid triggers, including harsh soaps/detergents, extreme climate, rough/tight clothing, excess alcohol, spicy foods, citrus fruits, and stress.
