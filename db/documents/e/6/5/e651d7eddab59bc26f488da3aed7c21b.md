The long-term complication rate from typical HUS is low, and most patients make a full recovery. Yearly evaluation for proteinuria, raised blood pressure, and renal insufficiency should be done for at least 5 years.

Those diagnosed with familial atypical HUS are at the highest risk of developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring routine dialysis. Familial atypical HUS patients also require several rounds of plasma exchange, placing the patient at risk for line infections.

Other rare complications include transient or permanent diabetes mellitus, seizures, coma, stroke, abnormal liver functions, and hepatomegaly.
