Most of the patients presenting tend to have significant suppression of the immune system when diagnosed with hairy leukoplakia. The condition occurs relatively soon after seroconversion of HIV, i.e., before AIDS. The CD4 count on an average when the condition is first detected may range from 235-468/microL. Studies have found that patients with AIDS in association with hairy leukoplakia have a shorter lifespan than those who do not show signs of this lesion. Moreover, if these patients get co-infected with the hepatitis B virus, their condition may worsen, resulting in early progression to AIDS.
