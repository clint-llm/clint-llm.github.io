**Tuberculin Skin Test (TST)**

This test measures the immune response to the purified protein derivative (PPD) which is a solution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex antigens.

The administration should be performed by a skilled personnel: 5 tuberculin units (0.1 ml) are applied intradermally on the volar surface of the forearm to form a 6-10mm wheal (Mantoux method).  After placement, a follow-up visit in 48 to 72 hours is needed so the results can be interpreted. The area of induration, not the erythema, is measured in millimeters.

**Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA)**

Two assays are approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) test and the T-SPOT.TB (T-Spot) test. As previously mentioned, the CDC endorses the use of these methods for screening of LTBI in place of the TST, and United States TB screening guidelines indicate that they can be used in place of a PPD for latent infection screening.

Since the immune reaction is performed ex vivo in the laboratory, only one visit is needed for a single blood draw, and the results are available in 24-48 hours. Also, there is no chance of a cross-reaction with antigens of BCG with these tests.

IGRA methods are preferred for individuals who may not return for a TST reading. IGRA tests also may be more persuasive in a patient with prior BCG immunization because of the lack of cross-reactivity with antigens.
