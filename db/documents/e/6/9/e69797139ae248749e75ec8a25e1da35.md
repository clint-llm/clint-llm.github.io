Increased nutrition following a prolonged period of starvation can result in refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome commonly occurs in populations at high risk for malnutrition ranging from patients with eating disorders to renal failure patients on hemodialysis. It can be fatal if inappropriately managed in a timely manner due to electrolyte and metabolic disturbances that manifest in cardiopulmonary, hematologic, and neurological dysfunction in these types of patients. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of refeeding syndrome.
- Summarize the epidemiology of refeeding syndrome.
- Describe the clinical markers for refeeding syndrome. 
- Explain the role of the interprofessional team in management of patients with refeeding syndrome.
