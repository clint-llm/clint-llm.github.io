The Seidel test assesses for the presence of aqueous humor leakage from the anterior chamber. This leakage is from a defect in the cornea or sclera from multiple causes, including trauma, post-surgical leak, corneal perforation, and corneal degeneration. The test was first described in 1921 by Dr. Erich Seidel (1882-1948), a German ophthalmologist, for which the test is named. He used the test to evaluate leakage in the postoperative patient but later expanded its use to other causes or anterior chamber leakage. This activity reviews the role of the Seidel test, its indications, and highlights the interprofessional team's role in the evaluation of orbital trauma.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the technique of performing the Seidel test.
- Outline the indications for the Seidel test.
- Summarize the clinical relevance of the Seidel test.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients with orbital trauma.
