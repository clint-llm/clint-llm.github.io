The natural history of sinus node dysfunctionÂ is usually a slow progression over decades. In the early stages, most patients are asymptomatic. When symptoms do develop, they are usually attributed to hypo-perfusion to vital organs with high oxygen demand. Sinus pauses or severe bradycardia results in central nervous system (CNS) underperfusion which manifests in paroxysmal presyncope or syncope. The sudden termination of AF in tachy-brady syndrome typically results in a prolonged sinus pause and failure to return to sinus rhythm which can manifest in syncope. Renal and gastrointestinal hypoperfusion may result in oliguria and abdominal pain, respectively. Rhythms with AF or atrial flutter pose a significant increased risk of thromboembolism, manifesting as transient ischemic attack or cardioembolic stroke, thus carrying the worst prognosis. Chronotropic incompetence results in fatigue and exercise intolerance. Palpitations are usually felt during episodes of tachycardia, after termination of tachyarrhythmias or due to prolonged pauses. Worsening of angina pectoris or congestive heart failure are also reported.
