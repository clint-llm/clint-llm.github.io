Treatment is largely centered on symptomatic relief and palliative care as there is no cure for FFI. Different treatment modalities mentioned in the literature are as follows.

- Discontinuation of medications that may exacerbate confusion, memory, and/or insomnia is important.

- FFI patients show an inadequate response to sedatives. Tinuper P et al. described a lack of effect of barbiturates or benzodiazepines on EEG in FFI patients.

- Problems with swallowing may warrant the placement of a feeding tube.

- Reder AT et al. investigated gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and found its administration to induce slow-wave sleep (SWS) in a patient with FFI.

- Several treatment options using compounds such as pentosane polysulfate, quinacrine, amphotericin B have been studied with inconclusive results.

- An Italian study using doxycycline, as a treatment option, over a period ofÂ 10 years is ongoing.

- Psychosocial therapy is important for both the patient and the family. Hospice care can also be beneficial.
