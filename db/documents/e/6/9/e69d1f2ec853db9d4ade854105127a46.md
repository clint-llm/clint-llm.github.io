The Hexokinase method is one of the diagnostic methods to quantify glucose concentration in different biological fluids. The robustness and accuracy of this method make it one of the most used methods for plasma glucose estimation. Quantifying plasma glucose concentration helps the clinician evaluate the patientâ€™s glycemic state. This activity reviews the principle, method, and safety of the hexokinase method. It shows the clinical utility of this method in the diagnosis or monitoring of different clinical conditions affecting plasma glucose concentration. This activity also shows the role of the interprofessional team in the quantification, quality control, and interpretation of results in different clinical scenarios.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the principle and method of plasma glucose estimation by the hexokinase method.
- Outline pre-analytical, analytical, and post-analytical variables affecting plasma glucose estimation results.
- Identify interfering factors and biological variations affecting plasma glucose levels.
- Review the interpretation of results considering variables affecting the plasma glucose estimation.
