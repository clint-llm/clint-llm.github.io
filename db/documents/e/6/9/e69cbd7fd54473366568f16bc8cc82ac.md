Serotonin syndrome is diagnosed clinically and requires a thorough review of medications and a careful physical exam. Symptoms tend to develop rapidly after exposure to the precipitating drug: 30% within one hour, 60% within 6 hours, and nearly all patients with toxicity developing symptoms within 24 hours of exposure. The spectrum may range from barely perceptible tremors to life-threatening hyperthermia and shock. Signs and symptoms include agitation, anxiety, restlessness, disorientation, diaphoresis, hyperthermia, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting, tremor, muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, dilated pupils, ocular clonus, dry mucous membranes, flushed skin, increased bowel sounds, and a bilateral Babinski sign. Clonus and hyperreflexia are particularly common. Neuromuscular findings tend to be more pronounced in the lower extremities. As compared to the neuroleptic malignant syndrome, patients with serotonin syndrome are more likely to have associated gastrointestinal symptoms and clonus.

Several criteria exist for making the diagnosis: Sternbach, Radomski, and Hunter. The Hunter test is accepted as the most accurate, but the criteria were designed specifically for patients with SSRI overdose, not serotonin syndrome from other agents; therefore, it may not reveal the disease in patients with minor symptoms.

**Hunter Criteria**

- History of exposure to a serotonergic drug

- Plus one or more of the following:

- spontaneous clonus

- inducible clonus with agitation and diaphoresis

- ocular clonus with agitation and diaphoresis

- tremor and hyperreflexia

- hypertonia

- temperature over 38 C with ocular or inducible clonus
