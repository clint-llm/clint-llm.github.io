Principal facts for HIV prevention are patient education which includes the following:

- Inform all sexual partners if the individual is HIV positive.

- Use a clean needle to inject drugs and dispose of it. It is imperative that one should do not share it with anybody.

- Male circumcision reduces the likelihood of HIV infection. Discuss it with the primary care provider.

- Use a clean condom at all times when having sexual intercourse. Preferably use a condom that contains a water-based lubricant, which is more protective.

- The HIV-positive female must be treated during pregnancy.

- Use emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil to reduce the risk of a sexually transmitted HIV infection. It must be taken every day, and the individual can still be involved in safe sex practices. It does not prevent other sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis.
