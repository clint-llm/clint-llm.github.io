**Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)**, otherwise called a stroke, is the third major cause of morbidity and mortality in many developed countries. Stroke can be either ischemic or hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is due to the loss of blood supply to an area of the brain. It is a common type of stroke.

**Hemorrhagic stroke**is due to bleeding into the brain by the rupture of a blood vessel. Hemorrhagic stroke may be further subdivided into intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). ICH is bleeding into the brain parenchyma, and SAH is bleeding into the subarachnoid space. Hemorrhagic stroke is associated with severe morbidity and high mortality.
