Contraceptive selection is an equally complex and important decision. The goals of the healthcare team should be aimed toward providing high-quality, patient-centered counseling. Family planning care has evolved from a clinician-directed approach aimed at preventing unwanted pregnancies to one of shared decision-making eliciting patient preferences and reasons for seeking contraception. Furthermore, the shared decision-making approach provides the opportunity for preconception counseling and assessment for medical comorbidities that could affect the safety of certain methods. It serves as an encompassing model fit for all people for which contraception may be of benefit and protects against any bias. This approach has been shown to increase patient knowledge, promote confidence in their choice, and improve patient satisfaction. The patients' ability to make informed decisions consistent with their values should be of utmost importance.
