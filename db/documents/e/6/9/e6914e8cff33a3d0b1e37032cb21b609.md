The basal ganglia are a collection of subcortical nuclei through which information from the cortex is modulated and returned to the cortex to execute a coordinated movement. Acetylcholine has grossly inhibitory effects on movement, and dopamine has grossly excitatory effects on movement. Certain medications act to block dopamine receptors, leading to a potential pro-movement state. Acute dystonic reactions are postulated to be a result of an imbalance of anticholinergic and dopaminergic effects in this pathway.
