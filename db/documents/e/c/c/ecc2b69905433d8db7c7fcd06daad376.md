The popliteal artery runs anterior to the popliteal vein and is the primary blood supply to the popliteal region as well as the lower leg. It is a continuation of the femoral artery that is referred to as the popliteal artery once it passes through the adductor hiatus. At the level of the popliteal muscle, it sends a branch anteriorly to form the anterior tibial artery, and the popliteal artery continues to split into the posterior tibial artery and the peroneal artery. Within the popliteal fossa, the vein crosses the artery moving from the medial aspect to the lateral aspect.

The lymph from the lymph nodes in the popliteal fossa ascends within the thigh along with the popliteal vessels and then subsequently the femoral vessels until it drains into the deep inguinal lymph nodes. There are several lymph nodes embedded in the fat layer found in the popliteal fossa and along the popliteal vessels.
