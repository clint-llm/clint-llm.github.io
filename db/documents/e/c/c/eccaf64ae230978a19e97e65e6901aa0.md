Treadmill stress testing is a form of cardiovascular stress testing that typically utilizes electrocardiography along with blood pressure monitoring and exercise, typically involving a treadmill or bicycle. This form of stress testing is generally performed according to protocols. However, patients unable to exercise can sometimes still undergo this test with the administration of a pharmacologic agent that stimulates the heart's activity, simulating exercise-induced changes. This activity specifically focuses on treadmill exercise stress testing and reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in performing treadmill exercise stress testing; this activity also highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the care of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Review the indications for treadmill testing.
- Identify the contraindications to a treadmill test.
- Explain the clinical significance of a treadmill test.
- Summarize a structured interprofessional team approach to provide effective care and appropriate surveillance of patients undergoing a treadmill stress test.
