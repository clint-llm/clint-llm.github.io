Coprolalia is most often associated with tic disorders, specifically Tourrette's, thus the healthcare provider is encouraged to identify the existence or absence of an underlying tic disorder.

Other conditions that merit consideration in the differential diagnosis are Sydenham chorea and Hemiballismus. Both could have coprolalia involved but the motor tics and the ballistic/choreiform movements are pretty clear.
