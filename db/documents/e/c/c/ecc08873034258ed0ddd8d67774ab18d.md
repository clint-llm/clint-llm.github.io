The histology of reactive perforating collagenosis classically is transepidermal. Vertically oriented, cupping, or invagination of the epidermis most commonly is seen. Vertically oriented perforating bundles of basophilic collagen are present at the bases of the invagination of the epidermis with focal extrusions. A keratin plug most likely is found in the cupping of the epidermis. Histology is variable depending on the stage of the lesion. New lesions will show epidermal hyperplasia, degenerated basophilic collagen fibers with later lesions showing invagination of the epidermis with a keratin plug. The vertically oriented basophilic collagen fibers are highlighted with Verhoeff-Van Gieson staining, which stains the collagen fibers red. This differentiates reactive perforating collagenosis to elastosis perforans serpiginosa, which will not show any staining of elastic fibers.
