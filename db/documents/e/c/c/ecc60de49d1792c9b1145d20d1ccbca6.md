The key is patient education. The nurse practitioner should educate the family that even though dramatic in appearance, these seizures do not lead to neurological disease or dysfunction. The more parents are aware of this disorder, the less likely it is that they will rush to the emergency room or seek alternative unproven remedies. However, the parents should also be educated on when to bring the child with a seizure to the emergency department because in some cases the cause may be a virus or a bacterial infectionÂ of the brain. The pharmacist should educate the family on managing the fever with acetaminophen and not aspirin. However, the family should also be educated that antipyretics do not prevent future febrile seizures.
