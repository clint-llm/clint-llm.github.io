Methemoglobinemia is a condition with life-threatening potential in which diminution of the oxygen-carrying capacity of circulating hemoglobin occurs due to the conversion of some or all of the four iron species from the reduced ferrous (Fe2+) state to the oxidized ferric (Fe3+) state. Ferric iron is unable to bind and transport oxygen. Increased levels of methemoglobin results in functional anemia. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of methemoglobinemia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of methemoglobinemia. 
- Describe the presentation of 
methemoglobinemia. 
- Explain the management of
methemoglobinemia .
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by methemoglobinemia.
