Fresh frozen plasma is indicated for the deficiency of coagulation factors with abnormal coagulation tests in the presence of active bleeding. Fresh frozen plasma is also indicated for a planned surgery or invasive procedure in the presence of abnormal coagulation tests, for the reversal of warfarin in the presence of active bleeding, or planned procedure when vitamin K is inadequate to reverse the warfarin effect, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and congenital or acquired factor deficiency with no alternative therapy. Based on a systematic review, other specific recommendations for fresh frozen plasma include trauma patients requiring massive transfusion and warfarin-related intracranial hemorrhage.

Other situations where the administration of fresh frozen plasma cannot be recommended for or against based on systematic review include fresh frozen plasma transfusion at a plasma-to-RBC ratio of 1 to 3 or more in trauma patients with massive transfusion. Conditions that cause the deficiency of multiple coagulation factors and may require the administration of fresh frozen plasma include liver disease and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Fresh frozen plasma transfusion may not be tolerated in patients with liver disease as patients may not tolerate the infusion volumes necessary to achieve adequate hemostatic levels of coagulation factors.
