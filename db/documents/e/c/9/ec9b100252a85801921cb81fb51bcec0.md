The technique of volar splinting of the upper extremity can be used to immobilize hard and soft tissue injuries as well as painful nontraumatic conditions. Examples of hard tissue, skeletal injuries include distal radius fracture, Colles fractures, metacarpal and carpal fractures (except the first metacarpal and trapezius). Examples of soft tissue injuries include large skin lacerations as well as structural soft tissue injuries such as tendon or ligament injuries. A volarÂ splint may also be used to provide symptomatic relief from inflamed and painful, but not injured, joints such as gout, rheumatoid arthritis, or other painful inflammatory conditions.
