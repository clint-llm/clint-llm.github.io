Treatment of scapholunate advanced collapse is difficult and not always predictable. Nonoperative treatment can include NSAIDS, wrist splints, and possible corticosteroid injections for mild disease.

Operative treatments include

- Stage I SLAC wrist

- Radial styloidectomy and scaphoid stabilization procedures
- PIN and AIN denervation

- Stage II SLAC wrist

- Proximal row carpectomy (PRC) is indicated to treat stage II (but not stage III) SLAC wrist.  

- Note that a PRC procedure is contraindicated in stage III deformity given that this implies an element of capitolunate arthritis, and patients inevitably report inferior outcomes in this clinical scenario

- Stage III SLAC wrist

- Scaphoid excision and four-corner fusion

- Produces reliable, positive outcomes in patients suffering from debilitating stage II or stage III SLAC wrist deformity
- Outcomes are equivalent in the long-term when comparing this procedure to a PRC in stage II SLAC wrist deformity


- Wrist fusion

- Indicated in the setting of Stage III SLAC wrist or pancarpal arthritis
- Wrist fusion procedures result in positive outcomes with respect to pain relief, but wrist motion is compromised compared to scaphoid excision/four-corner fusion (the latter demonstrates preserved wrist motion following surgical reconstruction via the lunate/distal radius articulation at the lunate fossa)
