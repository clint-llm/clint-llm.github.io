Primary bone cancer (PBC) is a rare malignant tumor of the bone, originating from primitive mesenchymal cells. It accounts for around 0.2% of all malignancies worldwide and is idiopathic in most cases. There are multiple subtypes, with osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma, the most common. Each varies in demographics, imaging appearance, and biological behavior. They are frequently aggressive and require early diagnosis, utilizing imaging and tissue biopsy. Surgical excision remains the mainstay of curative treatment, with chemotherapy and radiotherapy often used in conjunction.
