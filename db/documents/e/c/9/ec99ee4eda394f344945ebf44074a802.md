There are over 470 species of sharks throughout the world. Their habitats include saltwater and freshwater alike. They generally prefer the shallows in temperate, tropical regions, which is usually where divers and surfers come into contact with them and potentially become the victims of shark trauma. While this is a genuine threat to safety, it continues to remain statistically unlikely. Nevertheless, for those shark attacks that do occur, they become increasingly more perpetuated secondary to the level of mutilation achieved from even a singular bite. The wounds sustained from a shark bite have not been shown to follow any singular disease course or bacterial growth pattern. Even when non-fatal, massive blood loss, amputation, and vital organ puncture can occur. Even though sharks have not become more aggressive over the years, the incidence of shark attacks is increasing, thought to be due to the rise of water activity by people within the sharks’ environment.
