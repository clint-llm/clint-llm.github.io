Management of hyperamylasemia involves an interprofessional team potentially consisting of a gastroenterologist, emergency physician, internist, or family medicine physician. Amylase levels will most commonly be assessed in the acute care setting when ruling out the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. Gastroenterologists may evaluateÂ serum amylase levels post-ERCP to assess for post-procedural pancreatitis.
