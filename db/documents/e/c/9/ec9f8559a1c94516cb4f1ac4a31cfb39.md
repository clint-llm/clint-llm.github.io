OTFC is an opioid, and its side effects include nausea, constipation, confusion, dizziness, somnolence, addiction, asthenia, and hypotension. The therapeutic range is 1Â to 3 nanograms/milliliters. High plasma levels can lead to respiratory depression and death. Concomitant consumption of other central nervous system (CNS) depressants (i.e., alcohol, heroin, benzodiazepines) may contribute to additive adverse effects; hence, patients with multiple CNS depressant medications require careful monitoring. Similar to all opioids, avoid use in the elderly with a history of falls.
