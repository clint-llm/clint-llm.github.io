Differentiating hibernomas and atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDLS) can be difficult. Intraabdominal hibernomas can also mimic WDLS, especially when heterogeneous in an appearance on CT and MR imaging. Branching flow voids and enhancing vascular structures can favor hibernoma over WDLS. Both ALT/WDLS and hibernomas can contain thick and enhancing septations. Aggressive ALT can present with local invasion, metastasis, and regional metastasis. When imaging is inconclusive, image-guided biopsy or open biopsy should be considered. Due to reported cases of arteriovenous shunting, it has been suggested that a core needle biopsy should be avoided in deep lesions.

Surgical excision is the definitive treatment for these neoplasms. Differentiating hibernomas from lipomas on MR imaging is considered less of a diagnostic dilemma, considering lipomas tend to be more homogenous in their MR appearance with a reliable signal loss on fat suppression.
