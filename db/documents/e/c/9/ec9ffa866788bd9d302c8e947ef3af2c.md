Differential diagnoses to consider in patients presenting with symptoms of hypoparathyroidism include:

- Hypomagnesemia

- Postoperative complications of thyroidectomy and other types of head and neck surgery - may be transient or permanent:

- Abnormal development of parathyroid tissue, for example, DiGeorge Syndrome

- Activating mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor - autosomal dominant hypocalcemia

- Activating antibodies of the calcium-sensing receptor

- Autoimmune destruction of parathyroid tissue, for example, polyglandular autoimmune syndrome, Type 1

- Infiltration of parathyroid tissue, for example, granulomatous disease, hemochromatosis, metastatic disease

- Radiation injury

- Parathyroid hormone resistance, pseudohypoparathyroidism
