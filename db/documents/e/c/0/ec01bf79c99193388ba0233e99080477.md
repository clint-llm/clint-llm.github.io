According to FDA reports, there have been 76 cases of aripiprazole overdose. These include instances of both deliberate and accidental overdose in combination with other substances. There is currently no known antidote for aripiprazole overdose. However, early charcoal administration partially prevents the absorption of the drug if it is ingested orally, e.g., tablet. Management of aripiprazole overdose should focus on supportive therapy. The clinician should obtain an EKG to identify any cardiac arrhythmias, such as QTc prolongation.
