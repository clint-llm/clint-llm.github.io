Patient education and involvement of parents/guardians in the decision-making for management are important. Observation or patching with close follow-ups might be sufficient in patients with minimal head postures or latent deviations. Parents can be reassured and explained about the natural course of the disease. If surgery is indicated, a detailed discussion about the risks and benefits should be discussed with the parents. They should also be hinted towards the possible psychological impact of strabismus on the child and directed to support groups, which can benefit the childâ€™s wellbeing and outcome.
