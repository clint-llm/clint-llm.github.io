The pubic symphysis is a non-synovial amphiarthrodial joint with an interposed fibrocartilaginous disc separating hyaline cartilage. The joint normally has minimal motion due to the static ligamentous complex. The pubic symphysis serves as the insertion point of the rectus abdominis and origin of the adductor complex. The antagonistic nature of the rectus abdominis, which elevates the pubic symphysis while the adductors depress the joint, serves as a nidus for the development of osteitis pubisâ€”the repetitive use of the anterior pelvic musculature results in chronic tendinosis. The chronic muscle imbalance results in abnormal forces across the pubic symphysis, causing symphyseal instability, pubic bone stress reaction, and eventually degeneration of the hyaline cartilage. Another emerging theory poses that osteitis pubis develops secondary to increased compensatory motion across the joint because of limited motion elsewhere in the kinetic chain, such as in femoroacetabular impingement.

Birmingham et al. found increased rotational motion at pubic symphysis when cam-type FAI was mimicked in cadaveric pelvis specimens.
