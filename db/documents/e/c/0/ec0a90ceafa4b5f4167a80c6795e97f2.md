Learning is the change in the behavior of an organism that is a result of prior experience.

It was Plato, the ancient Greek philosopher who first pondered about how an individual learns new information when the subject is brand new to him. According to Plato, learning is a passive process where knowledge is already innately in an individual at birth, and any information acquired is merely a recollection of knowledge the soul already holds. John Locke later offered a contrasting ‘blank slate’ theory where humans are born without any innate knowledge and which is gained from the environment. Since then, there have been numerous different theories proposed about the process of learning.
