All patients withÂ lymphangioleiomyomatosis should be advised to avoid using estrogen-containing oral contraceptive pills, given the increased rate of worsening symptoms with their use. Progesterone-based oral contraceptives appear to be safe and could be an alternative. Pregnancy can also increase the risk of worsening symptoms and complications, but patients with LAM reported having multiple pregnancies without complications. Patients with LAM should receive influenza and pneumococcal vaccination.
