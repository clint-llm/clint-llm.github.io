Reported symptoms of NSCLCs can include cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, blood in sputum, wheezing, hoarseness, recurring chest infections (including bronchitis and pneumonia), weight loss, and loss of appetite and fatigue. However, NSCLC patients often show no symptoms in the early stages of the disease. Social history may include extensive smoking history or occupational exposure to heavy metals, asbestos, and radon exposure. Metastases may occur in advanced disease, and symptoms may include bone pain, spinal cord impingement, and neurologic symptoms (headache, weakness or numbness of limbs, dizziness, seizures).
