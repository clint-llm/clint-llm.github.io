ABR testing for infants is performed when the infant is asleep and is limited to the duration of the patient’s nap. Patients are kept awake and sleep-deprived until the start of the procedure to maximize the time of sleep. For patients who are unable to maintain a sufficient duration of sleep for accurate results, sedation or general anesthesia may be required.  A full sleep state is not required when ABR testing is performed on adults; however, they need to be in a quiet and relaxed state during the test to reduce muscle or movement artifact.

Detailed patient history is required prior to conscious sedation, including medical illnesses, medications, drug allergies, and adverse drug reactions. Oral intake is stopped 8 hours prior to sedation. Prior to placement of the surface electrodes, the external auditory canals are examined by the otolaryngologist under otomicroscopy. Cerumen and debris are cleared out with care not to cause canal trauma or bleeding, which can attenuate the auditory stimulus.  If middle ear effusion is present, the physician will consider a myringotomy with fluid evacuation and possible myringotomy tube placement. Testing will be inaccurate if there is fluid in the middle ear during the test.
