For surgery to the insula and Sylvian fissure, superficial nerves of the scalp should be preserved when possible during superficial dissection. For example, in a pterional (frontotemporal) craniotomy, the temporal branches of the facial nerve (CN VII) should be respected, given their supply to the frontalis muscle. The auriculotemporal (from CN V3) and zygomaticotemporal (from CN V2) nerves represent the somewhat variable sources of overlying superficial sensation of this area.
