Adrenal glands produce hormones necessary for normal body functioning; the deficiency of these hormones is called adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency can present along a spectrum ranging from mild nonspecific symptoms to life-threatening shock. The decrease in adrenal function may be masked until stress or illness triggers an adrenal crisis. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of adrenal insufficiency and highlights the role of interprofessional team collaboration in the recognition and management of adrenal insufficiency.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of adrenal insufficiency.
- Outline the laboratory evaluation for adrenal insufficiency.
- Review the treatment options available for adrenal insufficiency.
- Summarize some interprofessional strategies that the healthcare team can employ to improve outcomes for patients with adrenal insufficiency.
