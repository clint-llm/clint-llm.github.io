The physiology of vomiting is related to multiple organ systems. When noxious stimuli are perceived (which may be anything, including a fearful sight, a foul odor, or even a distressing memory), the area postrema of the brain is activated, leading to vagal stimulation. The resultant neuro-endocrine mediated processes result in salivation, closure of the glottis to protect the person’s airway from aspiration, relaxation of the stomach’s sphincters, retroperistalsis of small intestinal contents to the stomach, and finally contraction of stomach and abdominal muscles to propel vomitus to the mouth and into the environment. The gastrointestinal tract itself has several receptors, including cannabinoids, histamine, and other chemical agents, which can serve to directly influence the process of vomiting when stimulated directly, in addition to stimulation from the nervous system.

Cannabis has activity at a variety of receptors along the multiple neurologic and endocrinologic pathways, which informs its unique ability to be both a pro- and anti-emetic. For example, cannabinoid receptor (CB) 1 and 2 receptors in the brain are present in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and scattered throughout the parasympathetic nervous system (including the vagus nerve, with all of its influence on the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland axis), leading to cannabis having a potent effect on a large swath of bodily processes.
