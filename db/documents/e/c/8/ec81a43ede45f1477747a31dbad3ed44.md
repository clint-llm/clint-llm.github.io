Exposure to V-series nerve agents should be considered if there is a clinical history concerning for exposure to nerve agents or symptoms of nerve agent exposure. Decontamination and treatment should begin as soon as possible. Laboratory tests for the presence of V-series agents in the body are not readily available and are not used to guide management. Patients may demonstrate lab abnormalities consistent with metabolic acidosis and the breakdown of striated muscle. Decreased erythrocyte cholinesterase levels may be observed after exposure to nerve agents. V-series nerve agents can also be detected in patients or in the environment by M8 paper, M9 tape, the M256A1 Chemical Agent Detector Kit, or the Joint Chemical Agent Detector (JCAD).
