Symptomatic lumbar disc herniations are short-lived, and studies have shown that 85 to 90% of the cases will resolve within 6 to 12 weeks and without substantial medical intervention. However, if symptomatic for more than six weeks, patients are less likely to improve without intervention.

Factors predicting successful outcomes after surgery include severe preoperative leg and lower back pain, shorter symptoms duration, younger age, better mental health status, and increased preoperative physical activity.
