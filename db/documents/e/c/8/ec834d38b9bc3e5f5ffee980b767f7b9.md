Headache with neurological deficits and CSF lymphocytosis (HaNDL syndrome) is a migraine-like headache associated with aphasia, sensory, and motor deficit. It is a rare self-limiting disease with single to multiple episodes. Although patients are usually symptomless between the episodes, the neurologic deficits can last up to 7 weeks. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of HaNDLE syndrome and reviews the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of HaNDL syndrome?
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with HaNDL syndrome?
- Review the treatment options for HaNDL syndrome?
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by HaNDL syndrome.
