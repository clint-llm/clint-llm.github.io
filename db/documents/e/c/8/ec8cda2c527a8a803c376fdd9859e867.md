MNTI presents as a fast-growing, painless, bluish swelling in infants less than 12-months old. Due to its rapid enlargement, this lesion causes facial asymmetry but is otherwise asymptomatic. The most commonly reported location for this lesion is the maxilla and skull. The mean size for MNTI is 3.5 cm; however, the size of the largest reported lesion is greater than 20 cm. While males have slightly higher predominance, in older age cohorts >3 years of age, females have a higher prevalence.

MNTI presenting on the skull or intracranially usually have a benign behavior similar to that of lesions that arise in the jaw. However, symptoms may differ based on presenting location, such as seizure, increasing intracranial pressure, and neurologic dysfunction.
