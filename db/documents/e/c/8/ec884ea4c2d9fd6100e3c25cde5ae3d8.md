Chondrocalcinosis is a relatively common imaging finding in asymptomatic patients. Studies have described a higher prevalence of these findings in late adulthood without gender predilection.

Due to a broad range of clinical manifestations, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease should be considered in patients presenting with signs and symptoms suggestive of rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis.

A number of specialists use the high-resolution US in the evaluation of patients with crystal arthropathies, as it may provide useful findings to help differentiate CPPD from other conditions such as gout. Chondrocalcinosis presents earlier in the US than in plain films. This modality may also find use in patients with symptomatic arthropathies of unclear etiology, or with inconclusive results in the fluid aspirate. Additionally, it could potentially decrease the need for using more expensive imaging modalities such as MRI.
