Belonging to the family Taeniidae, the tapeworm Echinococcus is responsible for causing echinococcosisÂ in humans. There are four species of Echinococcus known to produce infections in humans. Among these, E. granulosus and E. multilocularis are the most common ones responsible for causing cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), respectively. On the other hand, E. vogeli and E. oligarthrus cause polycystic echinococcosis, but the incidence in humans is quite rare.
