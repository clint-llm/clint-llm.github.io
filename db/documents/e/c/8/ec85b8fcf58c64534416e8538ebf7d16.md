Apraxia of eyelid opening is defined as a non-motor abnormality characterized by the patient's difficulty in eyelid elevation bilaterally. There is an inability of voluntary eye reopening without an orbicularis oculi spasm despite sustained frontalis contraction. It is most commonly associated with blepharospasm (persistent focal dystonia, with eyelid muscle contraction). The definition is a misnomer, given that it is very rarely a pure and true apraxia.

Max Heinrich Lewandowsky, a renowned German physician and academician, first described it in 1907 in his essay Über apraxie des Lidschlusses. Later, Schilder reported in 1927 two patients (one with Huntington's chorea) and Riese in 1930 one patient with frontotemporal injury from a bullet. No other reports are found in the literature until 1965 when Goldstein and Cogan reported four patients (Huntington's disease, parkinsonism, parkinsonian syndrome after cyanide attempted suicide, and cerebral diplegia).
