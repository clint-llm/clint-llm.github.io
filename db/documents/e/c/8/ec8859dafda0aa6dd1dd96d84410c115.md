Corticosteroids are widely used medications due to their benefit. However, they have many adverse effects. Their widespread use and many adverse effects place significant importance on their understanding by all healthcare team members. Their effects that are therapeutic in one patient may be detrimental in another. For example, their glucose-raising effect may be helpful in a patient with adrenal insufficiency but harmful in a patient with latent diabetes mellitus.

All interprofessional healthcare team members should be ready to educate their patients on corticosteroids and their potential adverse effects, and the modifications that can reduce these harmful effects. This team includes clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nursing staff, and pharmacists, all working collaboratively with open communication to ensure optimal treatment outcomes with minimal adverse events. All patients on any form of chronic systemic corticosteroid therapy should be identified and advised to carry a treatment card or other signifierÂ that they're on steroid therapy. In this era of electronic medical records, a tag may be applied to patients' charts to specifically notify other healthcare team members about the patient corticosteroid use. Many patient deaths and much morbidity are preventable through proper patient education and communication within the interprofessional team. [Level 5]
