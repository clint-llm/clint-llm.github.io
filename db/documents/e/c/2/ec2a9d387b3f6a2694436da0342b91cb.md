During the perioperative period, the brow lifting patient will interact with multiple medical professionals of different disciplines. The surgeon's responsibility is to evaluate the patient preoperatively and determine the appropriate operative intervention if the patient meets candidacy criteria. The surgeon must also provide the patient an understanding of what to expect during and after surgery, set expectations, and discuss the recovery process. The patient's primary care provider may also be involved in the decision-making process and may help optimize any underlying medical conditions in preparation for surgery and general anesthesia.

Communication among all members of the operative team (surgeon, assistant, anesthesia provider, nurse, technologist) is critical for ensuring a safe and efficient procedure is performed. Postoperatively, outpatient nurses will play a major role in the patient's recovery, providing education regarding wound care, return to activity recommendations, and performing suture removal if needed. In addition, nurses are often the first to answer questions about potential complications, which is why they must have a thorough knowledge of normal and abnormal postoperative courses.

From start to finish, initial evaluation to suture removal, patients are cared for by clinicians, surgeons, nurses, and technologists, each of whom has the opportunity to improve the surgical outcome by honing their individual skills and by working as part of an interprofessional team.[Level 5]
