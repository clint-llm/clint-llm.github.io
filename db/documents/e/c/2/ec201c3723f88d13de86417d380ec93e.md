Oxcarbazepine can lead to central nervous system (CNS) side effects due to its blockade of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. Some common side effects that patients experience when taking oxcarbazepine are sedation, dizziness, abnormal gait, headache, ataxia, fatigue, confusion, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or rash.

Oxcarbazepine is structurally similar to carbamazepine and thus has an increased risk of Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis in Asian patients with the HLA-B*1502 allele. When experiencing a side effect, the recommendation is to wait and continue medication if the side effect is not disruptive to life or dangerous. With time, most side effects do cease. If side effects continue, physicians should consider switching to another agent, and augmenting oxcarbazepine with another agent is usually unsuccessful. It is important to note that side effects may increase when increasing the dose of oxcarbazepine.

Oxcarbazepine can possibly exacerbate myoclonus in patients, and it appeared to induce absence seizures in a patient with Rasmussen syndrome.

Oxcarbazepine is a potential teratogen, and it can cause major congenital malformations. The risk is much lower as compared with valproate.

Oxcarbazepine is structurally similar to carbamazepine, and it can cause liver injury (rarely), which is similar to carbamazepine-induced liver damage.

Carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and eslicarbazepine can cause movement disorders.
