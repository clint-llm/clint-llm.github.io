Several clinical and histopathological variables of primary uveal melanoma were found to be associated with metastatic death. These include increasing patient age, increasing tumor size (tumor elevation and independently tumor diameter), ciliary body involvement, extraocular extension, epithelioid cell type, lymphocytic infiltration, presence of fibrovascular loops, and several biomarkers, including human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules, and others, by immunohistochemical methods.

Approximately 50% of patients with ocular melanoma will develop metastases by 10 to 15 years after diagnosis. A small percentage of people will develop metastases even later, i.e. 20-25 years after their initial diagnosis. Metastatic disease is universally fatal. This 50% mortality rate is unchanged despite treatment advances in treating the primary eye tumor. More research is needed urgently to improve patient outcomes.
