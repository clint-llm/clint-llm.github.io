**CSF & Serum Antibodies**

PNS antibodies are detected before, during, or years after diagnosis of a neurological syndrome.

Simultaneous testing of both serum and CSF for antibodies should be done to maximize detection rates.

Basic panel diagnostics study for the following antibodies is recommended: Hu, Ri, Yo, Tr, Ma, CRMP5, and amphiphysin. However, it must be noted that various antibodies might be associated with the same paraneoplastic syndrome, and one antibody may be associated with different syndromes. Several antibodies may be found simultaneously in the same patient with SCLC or thymoma.

Higher titers of paraneoplastic antibodies correlate well with the diagnosis as well as the level of differentiation of the tumor.

In general, CSF analysis shows mild pleocytosis, i.e., 30 to 40 white blood cells per cubic millimeter, slightly elevated protein level 50 to 100 mg/dL, elevated IgG level, and presence of oligoclonal bands. Cytologic testing should be performed on CSF samples to exclude meningeal metastasis of cancer.

**Electroencephalogram (EEG)**

EEG in PNS often shows nonspecific findings like generalized slowing and periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs). However, PNS patients with anti-neuronal antibodies are significantly more likely to have observed frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) relative to control patients without the paraneoplastic disease.   A characteristic finding also is the presence of epileptiform activity over temporal regions in limbic encephalitis. In addition, EEG helps to exclude subclinical seizures or nonconvulsive status epilepticus, the latter present at increased frequency in patients with PNS.  While typically not specific for paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, the presence of simultaneous rhythmic delta waves with beta frequency activity producing a “delta brush” pattern is specific for NMDAR Ab positive encephalitis among paraneoplastic conditions, even though it can also be seen rarely in non-paraneoplastic disease.

**Imaging**

Increased MRI signal in T2 weighted/FLAIR imaging in bilateral medial temporal lobes supports the diagnosis of definite limbic encephalitis in the appropriate clinical context. MRI is also used to exclude stroke or metastatic disease. FDG-PET CT shows hypermetabolism in the medial temporal lobes and is more sensitive than MRI in the diagnosis and evaluation of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.

Both extensive optic neuritis identified on gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI and enhancing T1 and/or T2 hyperintense longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM) on spinal cord MRI, the latter by definition extending more than 3 vertebral segments, have been identified in paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic forms of NMOSD and MOG antibody-positive myelitis.

**Cancer Screening**

Since detecting the tumor is essential for treatment, a Whole-body PET scan is the best screening method for localizing occult cancer.

The likelihood of a tumor being revealed by a whole-body CT scan or FDG-PET is more than 95% when the patient presents with a classical PNS like PEM and a well-characterized onconeural antibody.

The 2010 task force recommended repeat cancer screening 3 to 6 months after the initial evaluation, followed by screening every 6 months for up to 4 years if testing remains unrevealing.  Also, if an identified cancer is not consistent with the PNS or the identified antibody, a continued search for another cancer should be considered.

Sometimes the tumor may never be identified as a result of immune-mediated eradication of tumor cells.
