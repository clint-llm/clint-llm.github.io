The prognosis of NSIP is significantly better than that of UIP. Five and 10-year survival is 43% and 15% respectively among patients with UIP, compared to 86% to 92% 5-year survival and 26% to 40% 10-year survival rates among patients with NSIP with the fibrotic component. Fibrotic NSIP is thought to have a worse prognosis than inflammatory, cellular NSIP.
