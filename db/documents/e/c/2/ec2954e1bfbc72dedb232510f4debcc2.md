- Arachnoid cysts are relatively common, and most are incidental.

- The most common locations for arachnoid cysts are in the anterior, middle cranial fossa, and in the retrocerebellar cistern.

- The arachnoid cyst should have a thin wall and no enhancement.

- The fluid in an arachnoid cyst should follow fluid density on CT and fluid intensities on MRI.
