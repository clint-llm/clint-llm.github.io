IPE can be confirmed radiographically; although, it may be so mild that a computed tomography (CT) scan is a more definitive test. SDPE may have some transitory respiratory or cardiac disorders underlying it, so respiratory function tests and blood gases are indicated. A thorough cardiac investigation including troponins, creatine kinase-MB, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), serial electrocardiograms, and early echocardiogram is also important. Coronary artery assessments may be required, and cardiac pathology addressed. Abnormal cardiac tests should be repeated to demonstrate reversibility or if they are transitory, as seen with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and reversible myocardial dysfunction. With IPE, BNP is typically high. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) can be monitored by measuring copeptin (stable C-terminal domain of precursor hormone to ADH). Natremia and albuminuria were typically lower. Ischemia-modified albumin is typically elevated and decreases after normobaric oxygen treatment that reduced hypoxemia. Biomarkers are helpful in the early diagnosis and distinction of IPE from decompression sickness.
