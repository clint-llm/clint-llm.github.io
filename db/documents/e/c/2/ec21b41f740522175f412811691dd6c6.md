While there is no single optimal structure, the consolidation of all team members for interprofessional rounds that occur at a set time on a regular schedule is considered best practice. Standardization of start time improves rounding effectiveness by facilitating greater participation among team members as they know when they will be needed. Rounds should emphasize a systematic, coordinated approach to patient data presentation, the formation, and documentation of medical therapy plans, the order of team member input, and a summary of overall goals of care for the day. In many ICUs, rounds occur each morning to establish the daily plan of care and allow the providers, including nurses and pharmacists, to work as a team to provide patient and family education, coordinate care, and monitor the patient's progress. A coordinated interprofessional team effort will lead to the best outcomes. [Level 5]
