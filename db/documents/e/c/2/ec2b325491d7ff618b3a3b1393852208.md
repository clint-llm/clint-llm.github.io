Hemifacial spasm (HFS) is a disorder characterized by paroxysmal, involuntary twitching of facial muscles of one side of the face innervated by the ipsilateral facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve). It is considered a subtype of peripheral (neuromuscular) movement disorder. As the name suggests, the disorder is almost always unilateral except in some rare cases of severe hemifacial spasm (less than 5%), during which one can see the bilateral involvement of facial muscles. This activity reviews the cause of hemifacial spasms and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in their management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of hemifacial spasms.
- Describe the clinical features of hemifacial spasms.
- Summarize the treatment of hemifacial spasms.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by hemifacial spasms.
