ACR presents as a mononuclear inflammatory response infiltrating myocardial tissue with predominant lymphocytic cells. Immunohistologic assessment can confirm the presence of CD-4 and CD-8 positive T lymphocytes with high affinity to interleukin-2 receptors. Presence of increased intercellular adhesion molecules with high MHC-II expression on cardiac myocytes is present. These findings should be distinguished from Quilty effect, which carries no clinical significance. Quilty lesions extend to the endocardial surface and include significant B-lymphocytes distinguishing from acute cellular rejection.

AMR leads to intravascular macrophage accumulation with interstitial edema, hemorrhage and neutrophilic infiltration in and around capillaries.

The predominant feature of CAV is a diffuse, progressive thickening of the arterial intima that develops in both the epicardial and intramyocardial arteries of the transplanted heart.

**Histological Grading**

ISHLT ACR grading

- Grade 0 – No rejection

- Grade 1 R, mild – Interstitial and/or perivascular infiltrate with up to one focus of myocyte damage. (grade 1A, 1B and 2 in 1990 system)

- Grade 2 R, moderate – Two or more foci of infiltrates with associated myocyte damage.  (grade 3A in 1990 system).

- Grade 3 R, severe – Diffuse infiltrate with multifocal myocyte damage, with or without edema, hemorrhage, or vasculitis. (grade 3B and 4 in 1990 system).

Immunopathologic findings for Acute AMR

Positive immunofluorescent staining for C4d, C3d, and Anti HLA-DR or immunoperoxidase staining for C4d and CD68 (or C3d)

AMR grading

- Grade 0- Negative histologic and immunopathologic findings

- Grade 1- Presence of positive histologic and immunopathologic findings

- Grade 2- Presence of both histologic and immunopathologic findings

- Grade 3- Presence of severe histologic plus immunopathologic findings
