It is important to develop a formulation with a regimen that is not complex for a patient to follow to improve patient outcomes through adherence to developed pharmaceutical formulations.

Not only is patient compliance essential, but the collaboration of all healthcare professionals involved in health care is also crucial in ensuring proper implementation of pharmaceutical formulations. The physician has to understand why and how the medication interacts with the human body. It is also imperative that nurses, pharmacists, and other essential team members maintain good communication and display accountability in administering medications to ensure patient safety.
