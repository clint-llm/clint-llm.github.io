Congenital pulmonary airway malformation results from the cessation of lung development during various stages of embryogenesis. There are a variety of genes implicated in this process including thyroid transcription factor gene (Nkx2), sex-determining region Y- box 2 gene (Sox2), Hox gene (Hoxb-5), Ying Yang 1 gene (Yy1), fatty acid-binding protein-7 gene (FABP-7), acyl-CoA synthetase 5 (ACSL5) platelet-derived growth factor B gene (PDGF-B), sonic hedgehog (SHH), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), sprouty 2 (SPRY2), Wnt signaling pathways, transforming growth factor B (TGFB), and fibroblast growth factors 10, 9, and 7 (FGF10, 9, 7). All of these genes have a role in cell proliferation or apoptosis, leading to the various types of malformations under the CPAM classification.
