Imdevimab is a new monoclonal antibody that has been authorized for emergency use by FDA due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a novel agent, all interprofessional healthcare team members involved in patient care need to be up to speed on the latest information regarding the use of this drug. Initial results show a decreasing viral load and clinical benefit if the drug is initiated early in high-risk patients with mild to moderate disease.

The drug combination is administered via IV infusion or SQ, and there is the possibility of infusion and injection-related side effects including pyrexia, chills, urticaria, pruritis, abdominal pain, and flushing, along with hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. Observation in the infusion center after transfusion for at least 60 minutes is recommended. The interprofessional team of healthcare professionals needs to have the necessary medications and equipment in the room to ensure safe outcomes. In cases of something as serious as anaphylaxis, proper and prompt intervention can be life-saving.

Pharmacists can help clinicians and nurses to ensure proper dosing, monitor drug interactions, and educate patients and staff on potential side effects. Proper collaboration between all interprofessional healthcare team members, including clinicians, infectious disease specialists, mid-level practitioners, nurses, and pharmacists, will help achieve optimal patient outcomes while minimizing patient risks.
