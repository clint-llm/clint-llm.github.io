The adverse reproductive effects of nicotine are predominantly fetal neuroteratogenic effect. Smoking has been associated with retardation of fetal growth. Evidence shows that smoking is causative for premature births, stillbirths, placental abruption, and sudden infant death syndrome. The incidence of spontaneous abortions, ectopic pregnancies, and placenta previa in women smokers is increasing. Behavioral disorders have been observed among infants born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy. Smoking is recognized as a significant risk factor for poor maternal-fetal outcomes.
