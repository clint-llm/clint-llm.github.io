Orthostatic vitals including blood pressure and heart rate in response to upright posture for at least 3 minutes is essential for the diagnosis of orthostatic syncope. A resting 12-lead electrocardiogram is useful to rule out arrhythmias. Targeted blood testing is reasonable including complete hematology, glycemic and metabolic profiles to rule out associated conditions such as anemia, metabolic or renal derangements. In selected patients with suspected neurodegenerative disease and syncope, referral for autonomic evaluation is reasonable to improve diagnostic and prognostic accuracy.
