Absence seizures are brief seizures during which the patient is unresponsive. They are generally seen in children between 4 and 12 years of age. Absence seizures occur in multiple genetic generalized epilepsies, including childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME.) Atypical absence seizures have been reported in up to 60% of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The condition has a classic EEG finding of a 3 Hz spike and wave discharges. Absence epilepsy is an electroclinical diagnosis (clinical presentation and EEG findings). This activity reviews the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of absence seizures and highlights the differential diagnosis of absence seizures/staring spells.

**Objectives:**
- Explain how to evaluate a patient presenting for staring spells.
- Identify the first-line medications for absence epilepsy, including some associated side effects.
- Prepare approaches to counsel the family of a patient with newly diagnosed absence seizures. 
- Explain how interprofessional team members can collaborate to promptly diagnose, evaluate and treat patients with absence seizures and provide counseling to the patient and their families to enhance patient outcomes.
