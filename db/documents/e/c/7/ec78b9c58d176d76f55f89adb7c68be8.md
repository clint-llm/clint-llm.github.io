Relationships between the sonographer, radiologist, and ordering physician (urologist or primary care clinician) are crucial to optimize patient-centered care. As with any diagnostic data, interpretation and subsequent action will require the efforts of an interprofessional healthcare team, including clinicians, mid-level practitioners, nurses, radiologists, and ultrasound techs, all working collaboratively and sharing information openly to drive optimal patient outcomes.

A good working relationship between the radiologist and ordering physician is key to having an open dialogue about the indications for and the extent of diagnostic capabilities of TRUS to ensure that testing is ordered correctly. As new technologies develop or are made available at certain institutions, communication should increase accordingly. This is especially important as machine capabilities vary between institutions, and the use of new technologies can improve patient care by providing increased and more accurate information.

The relationship between the radiologist and sonographer is equally as important. As the radiologist is limited by the sonographer's images, a common understanding of the technique is crucial to avoid any missed or inaccurate diagnoses.
