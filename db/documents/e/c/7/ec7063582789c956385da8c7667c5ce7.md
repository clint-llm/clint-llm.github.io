Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is a safe, efficacious, and minimally invasive advanced therapy indicated to treat urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urgency, frequency, and fecal incontinence in the United States for patients refractory to behavioral and pharmacologic treatment. In Canada and Europe, it is also indicated for chronic constipation.

Sacral neuromodulation therapy was developed in 1982 by Tanagho and Schmidt, gaining FDA approval in 1997.

SNM has been proven to produce good clinical results in otherwise intractable cases. One study conducted by Siegel et al. evaluated the therapeutic success rate in 340 patients using SNM at 36 months. The success rate for overactive bladder was 83% for patients who underwent SNM implantation (95% CI). Additionally, 80% of patients reported improvement in all urinary symptoms.

The mechanism of action of sacral neuromodulation is not completely understood. However, the therapy seems to modulate spinal cord reflexes and brain involvement via afferent signaling rather than direct motor stimulation of the detrusor or urethral sphincter.
