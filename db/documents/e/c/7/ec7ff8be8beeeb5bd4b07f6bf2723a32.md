Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a neuropathic pain disorder characterized by ongoing pain disproportionate to the degree of tissue injury and persists beyond the usual expected time for tissue healing.

In the 16th century, Ambroise Par√© reported cases with CRPS like symptoms for the first time which developed after phlebotomy.

CRPS has two subtypes: type I, formerly known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy, and type II, formerly known as causalgia. Type I occurs in the absence of nerve trauma, while type II occurs in the setting of known nerve trauma. Clinically they are indistinguishable and follow a regional rather than a dermatomal or peripheral nerve distribution and favor the distal extremities, though spread outside of the initially affected area commonly occurs to the proximal or contralateral limb.

CRPS not only impacts function, sleep, and activities of daily living but also takes a significant mental and psychosocial toll on the patient.
