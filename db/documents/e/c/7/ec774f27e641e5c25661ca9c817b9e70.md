Overall, the majority of viral cases and antibiotic-treated cases will resolve without any complications. Most of the patients are treated as outpatients. The swelling and tenderness may persist even after antibiotic therapy but should be significantly improved. In case of persistence, compliance should be checked, and receive further evaluation if required. The decrease in body temperature in the first three days of antibacterial treatment is considered a good prognostic marker.
