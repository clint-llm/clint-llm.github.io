The complications can be categorized as follows:

- Neurological - quadriplegic, quadriparesis, central cord syndrome, and cruciate paralysis

- Phrenic nerve injury (C3-5 level)

- Vertebral artery injury (C2-6 level)

- Spinal cord injury-compression, transection, contusion, and traumatic syrinx

- Early complications of the surgery - hematoma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, injury to a vertebral artery hematoma (especially in lateral mass fixation), graft extrusion, cord edema, and cord herniation

- Late complications of surgery - surgical site infection, tracheo-oesophageal fistula, implant failure, adjacentÂ  segment disease, kyphotic deformity, and nonunion

- Secondary complications relating to spinal cord injuries - such as pneumonia, pressure ulcers, deep vein thrombosis, urinary tract infections, muscle atrophy, and spasticity

- Collateral impact on the care providers - heighten the caretaker burden scale in multispectral patterns (physical, economic, social, and emotional aspects).
