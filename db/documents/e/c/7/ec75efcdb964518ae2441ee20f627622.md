When it comes to mood, the two important chemicals in the brain are serotonin and norepinephrine. These often decrease in people who are depressed and are the main targets of antidepressants. Protriptyline has the fastest onset of action among other tricyclic antidepressants, and thus clinical effects can occur within the first week of use. It is a secondary tricyclic amine and structurally similar to nortriptyline. It undergoes limited first-pass hepatic metabolism and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Protriptyline has a long half-life of 80 to 200 hours when used long-term, requiring up to a month to reach a steady state. The half-life of protriptyline is approximately 74 hours (greater than three days).

- Increases norepinephrine neurotransmission by blocking norepinephrine reuptake pump.

- In the frontal cortex, dopamine neurotransmission increases secondary to the norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.

- At high doses, protriptyline can increase serotonin neurotransmission.

- Protriptyline also can cause calcium-independent cell death.
