According to the "ecology of medical care" model, only a minority of patients seek medical care for their symptoms; and most of these are managed by their primary care physician/provider (PCP). Therefore, it is crucial to provide patients with information on self-management and when to contact their PCP. The involvement of community pharmacists and nurse practitioners can play a vital role in achieving these goals. PCPs and allergy specialists often work closely in co-managing patients with AR. Access to healthcare and specialists varies globally, but PCPs, pediatricians, allergists, and/or ENT specialists may be involved in caring for these patients when available.
