At a cellular level, smooth muscle functions as an involuntary non-striated muscle. Smooth muscle contains thick and thin filaments that do not arrange into sarcomeres, resulting in a non-striated pattern. On microscopic examination, it appears homogenous. Smooth muscle cytoplasm contains large amounts of actin and myosin. Actin and myosin act as the main proteins involved in muscle contraction. Actin filaments attach to dense bodies spread throughout the cell. Dense bodies can be observed under an electron microscope and appear dark. Another important structure is the calcium-containing sarcoplasmic reticulum, which aids in sustaining contraction. The shape of smooth muscle is fusiform, which is round in the center and tapering at each end. Smooth muscle can tense and relax but has greater elastic properties than striated muscle. This quality is important in organ systems like the urinary bladder, where the preservation of contractile tone is a necessity.
