Granular cell tumors can appear in all age groups but are thought to arise most commonly in the 4th to 6th decades.

These are rare tumors. According to a study by Lack et al. at a single institution over 32 years, the overall incidence of granular cell tumors in surgical specimens was 0.03%.

Although most are solitary, 7% to 29% of patients can have multiple lesions on presentation, 30% of which involve the skin and subcutaneous tissue.

Overall, they involve the cutis and subcutaneous tissue in 30% of patients, involve the breasts in 15% of cases, the respiratory tract in 10% of cases, and the gastrointestinal tract in 5% to 11%. 1% to 2% of them are malignant based on histology or clinical presentation.
