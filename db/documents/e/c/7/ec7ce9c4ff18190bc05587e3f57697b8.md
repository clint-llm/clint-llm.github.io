There are several etiologies of angioedema, most notably angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use. With tens of millions of people taking ACEIs, the incidence of ACEI angioedema is rising

Other etiologies include IgE-mediated allergic reactions (such as to food, drug, or environmental triggers), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use (including aspirin), and chemically-induced histamine release (most commonly opiates, highly cationic antibiotics, and muscle relaxants)

HAE and AAE are rare. AAE is due to an acquired deficiency of (C1-INH), caused by either consumption (type 1) or inactivation (type 2)
