The majority of congenital dacryostenosis cases resolve without the need for surgery. Treatment consists of performing lacrimal sac massages performed by the parents. Moderate pressure over the lacrimal sac should be applied in a downward direction two or three times per day.

If the obstruction persists beyond the age of six months, lacrimal duct probing is advocated. This procedure is performed by an ophthalmologist, usually under general anesthesia. The procedure is performed by inserting a small blunt probe or irrigation cannula into the punctum and advancing it until it abuts the obstruction and reaches the nasal cavity. Irrigation with saline is often performed to ensure patency.

The combination of probing and irrigation is an easy, quick procedure with a high rate of success.

Additional procedures include balloon dacryocystoplasty, dacryocystorhinostomy, and conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy. These interventions can be performed both in pediatric and adult patients. The balloon dacryocystoplasty is a simple and minimally invasive technique. It is usually advisable for the treatment of incomplete obstruction of the lacrimal drainage system and for cases who have failed a simple probing and irrigation procedure. Usually, a stent is left in place after the procedure.

Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a more complex procedure that requires the removal of a part of the lacrimal bone to create a window between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity.

When the obstruction is in the canaliculi, the procedures discussed above will not work. A conjunctivodacryocystorhinostomy may be indicated. This procedure involves a complete by-pass of the lacrimal drainage obtained, inserting a Pyrex glass tube (Jones tube). Periodic removal and cleaning of the Jones tube, followed by immediate replacement, may be needed.

Opening of the obstructed nasolacrimal ducts in adults with an antegrade dilatation has been suggested, but sufficient studies proving the efficacy of this procedure have not been completed.
