Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors, including etanercept (E), infliximab (I), adalimumab (A), certolizumab pegol (C), and golimumab (G), are biologic agents which are FDA-approved to treat ankylosing spondylitis (E, I, A, C, and G), Crohn disease (I, A and C), hidradenitis suppurativa (A), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (A), plaque psoriasis (E, I and A), polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (E), psoriatic arthritis (E, I, A, C, and G), rheumatoid arthritis (E, I, A, C, and G), ulcerative colitis (I, A and G), and uveitis (A). There are also several off-label indications. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of tumor necrosis factors, so providers can direct patient therapy where they are indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanisms of action as a class and the specific effects of each agent in the TNF inhibitor class.
- Identify the specific indications for each member of the TNF inhibitor class.
- Outline the adverse event profile of TNF inhibitors.
- Review the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team and how it can enhance patient care with TNF inhibitor therapy to improve patient outcomes for patients with conditions where these agents are indicated.
