The clinical presentation depends on the location and cause of the stricture.

History of fever and leukocytosis suggests an infective cause or sequelae to the strictures. History of weight loss, abdominal or back pain, worsening performance status should be taken with caution since it could warn towards a possible malignant etiology.

The previous history of hepatobiliary surgery, autoimmune disease, pancreatitis, cholelithiasis, or chemotherapy should be elicited as it can be pivotal inÂ determining or eliminating the differential diagnosis.

Further efforts should be made during the physical examination to elicit specific clinical signs like Murphy and Courvoisier signs, as this may also help in narrowing down the diagnosis or etiology of jaundice. The presence of hard masses in the abdomen may point towards an advanced malignant process.
