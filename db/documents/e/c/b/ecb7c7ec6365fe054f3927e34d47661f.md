The initial evaluation of the trauma patient is the primary survey. The mnemonic ABCDE is a helpful way to remember the order of the evaluation.

- A: Airway and cervical spine protection. An easy way to assess the airway is to have the patient speak. Ask them their name.

- B: Breathing. Listen for bilateral breath sounds and look at the chest wall motion during the respiratory cycle.

- C: Circulation. This helps determine whether the patient is in shock.

- D: Disability. This is the Glasgow coma scale (GCS)

- E: Exposure and environmental control. Undress the patient and cover them with a warm blanket.

The secondary survey follows the primary survey.

Laboratory markers are often useful in traumatic settings. Sensitive markers for hemorrhage include elevated serum lactate and a base deficit, which can both be obtained from an arterial blood gas. It is important to remember that initial hemoglobin and hematocrit are not sensitive for traumatic hemorrhage.

Multiple imaging modalities can be useful in evaluating pelvic trauma. An ultrasound can be used to perform a Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam while in the trauma bay. A FAST exam is used to identify free fluid. It cannot differentiate bowel contents from blood.

X-ray, while useful for quick evaluation in an unstable patient, is overall inferior to a computed tomography (CT) scan, which provides greater detail of injuries. The ability to add contrast increases the ability to find injuries. A triple-phase contrast-enhanced CT consists of an arterial phase, a portal phase, and a delayed phase.

Gross hematuria in the setting of a pelvic fracture, blunt trauma, or low-density free-fluid in the pelvis are absolute indications for lower urogenital evaluation. Cystography, either conventional or CT, is the imaging study of choice for bladder injury. For a CT cystogram, the bladder is filled with 40 mL of water and 350 mL of contrast agent. Images are then taken when the bladder is completely filled and again when it is drained. The identification of contrast outside the bladder confirms the diagnosis. The contrast will remain in the pelvis in extraperitoneal bladder ruptures. Intraperitoneal injuries show contrast lining the bowel loops and diffusing through the mesenteric folds.

Urethral injuries typically present with blood at the urethral meatus, urinary retention, or suprapubic fullness. Straddle injuries can present as perineal ecchymosis or hematoma.

Female genital trauma, as mentioned above, can have psychological stressors for the patient if caused by sexual abuse or assault. If an abusive history is given, the appropriate police and support services should be notified. Assessment includes a detailed history and thorough physical exam. If necessary, a “rape kit” should be available for evidence collection. The exam starts by examining the external genitalia, looking for ecchymosis, edema, or lacerations. An internal speculum exam should then be completed looking for lacerations or impaling injuries from pelvic bone fractures.

Penile fracture is typically a straightforward diagnosis based on the history and physical exam. It is not uncommon for these patients to present in a delayed fashion due to patient embarrassment over the situation. Patients will usually describe an acute bending of the penis, followed by a snap or pop, acute pain, and immediate detumescence. Buck’s fascia usually limits swelling to the penis, creating the “eggplant deformity.” However, swelling can spread to the perineum and scrotum if Buck’s fascia is disrupted. The penis is often swollen and ecchymotic. It tends to deviate to the side opposite the tunic tear because of the hematoma at the fracture site. If the history and physical are consistent with penile fracture, then no imaging is necessary. Ultrasonography is the imaging modality of choice for penile fractures if imaging is necessary. It can also help identify the location of the tear.

A ruptured testis should be considered in all blunt scrotal trauma. The most common symptom is extreme pain, rapid swelling, and nausea. Ecchymosis can be variable, and hematoma size does not correlate with the degree of injury. Pain and scrotal hematocele (blood and fluid within the tunica vaginalis compartment) often limit the physical exam. The first imaging tool of choice is a testicular ultrasound. Ultrasonography has a reported specificity of 93.5% and a sensitivity of 100% for testicular rupture.
