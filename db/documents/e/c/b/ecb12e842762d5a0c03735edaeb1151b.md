**Reasons Delegation is Necessary forÂ the Modern Health Care Environment**

If delegation decisions are so challenging and legally charged, why should nurses delegate? Fiscal constraints, nursing shortages, and increases in patient care complexity have cultivated an environment in which delegation is necessary. If appropriately used, delegation can significantly improve patient care outcomes.

**Improper Delegation**

Improper delegation can negatively impact patient care while also potentially exposing the delegator to legal action.

**Essentials of Communication**

While employing the five rights of delegation in nursing practice, it is important to remember that the way the delegator asks the delegatee to perform a task can make a big difference. The delegator must use direct, honest, open, closed-loop communication to encourage teamwork and safe task performance.
