Vulvar hematomas are more common in the obstetric population, with an incidence ranging from 1:300 to 1:1000 deliveries.

Non-obstetric vulvar hematoma follows a bimodal age distribution. It is more common during childhood or early adolescence because the labia majora, which is composed of fat for its protective functionality, is less developed in young pre-pubertal females.
