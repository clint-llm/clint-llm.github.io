Complications of trochanteric bursitis are rare. Complications are more closely associated with NSAID use and, infrequently, corticosteroid injection. NSAIDs can cause gastric ulceration and subsequent bleeding in those that are high-risk or are taking anticoagulants. Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding can be occult, and patients should be counseled regarding signs or symptoms of anemia. Complications associated with corticosteroid injections include elevated blood glucose levels (especially in those with poorly controlled diabetes), injection site irritation, or injected site bleeding.
