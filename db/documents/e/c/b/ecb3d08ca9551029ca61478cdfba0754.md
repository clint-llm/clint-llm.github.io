The esophagus starts forming during the fourth week of gestation with the development of a nascent foregut. At this time, it is barely a small tube separating the stomach from the pharynx but proceeds to undergo rapid division and differentiation over the next few weeks. The circular muscle fibers, ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus, and blood vessels begin to develop in the sixth week.
