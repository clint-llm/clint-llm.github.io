Potential vaginal foreign body cases require an interprofessional effort, including the primary clinician, gynecology specialists, and nursing. Examination for vaginal foreign bodies requires questions about topics that may be sensitive to the patient. It is also important to note the personal aspect of a genital exam. Thus, extra steps are necessary for all personnel involved in the patient’s care. The patient should receive a gown and blanket, and the blanket should be used during the exam to cover anatomy that does not need to be exposed. Providers should speak to the patient openly and refrain from judgmental remarks. A welcoming environment between the providers and patients will enhance medical care by minimizing barriers. It is paramount that privacy is offered, including asking the patient if she would like her visitors to leave the room, and that a chaperone is present. A female nurse can fill the chaperone role, and other nursing duties are covered below. Interprofessional cooperation and teamwork are essential to successful outcomes in these cases. [Level 5]
