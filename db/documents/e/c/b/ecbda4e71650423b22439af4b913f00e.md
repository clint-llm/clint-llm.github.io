Adverse effects of insulin classify according to those caused by the drug itself and those caused by the specific route of administration. Hypoglycemia is, by far, the most common adverse effect of insulin therapy.

The subcutaneous route of administration also has adverse effects. Pain at the injection site, lipodystrophy at the injection site are the most common adverse effects of daily subcutaneous injections.

Somogyi effect: Some patients who take insulin before bed wake up with high blood sugar levels. This effect occurs when the insulin causes a hypoglycemic condition in the body, which activates the antihyperglycemic hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, resulting in rebound hyperglycemia; this can be corrected by reducing the dose of bedtime insulin or changing the time of insulin dosing.

Dawn phenomenon: It is the presence of high blood glucose levels in the body in the early hours of the day due to inadequate insulin in the body. To correct this phenomenon, the dose of bedtime insulin needs to increase to be able to keep the blood glucose levels under control throughout the night and the early hours of the morning.
