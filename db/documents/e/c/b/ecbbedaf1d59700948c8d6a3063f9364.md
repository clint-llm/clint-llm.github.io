Fluid therapy is a critical component of the clinical management of patients. It consists of colloid therapy as well as crystalloid therapy. The most commonly used crystalloid worldwide is normal saline which is used in the management and treatment of dehydration (e.g., hypovolemia, shock), metabolic alkalosis in the presence of fluid loss, and mild sodium depletion. This activity describes the indications, action, and contraindications for normal saline as a valuable agent in the use of fluid and electrolyte resuscitation. This activity also highlights the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., administration, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the interprofessional team in the management of critically ill patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for the various concentrations of normal saline. 
- Describe the contraindications to normal saline.
- Review appropriate monitoring parameters for normal saline.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving outcomes and decreasing adverse effects of normal saline when it is used in critically ill patients.
