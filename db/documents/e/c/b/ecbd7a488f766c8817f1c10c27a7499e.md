The omentum is made up of cells that are mesothelial in origin. It is said to be a type of visceral adipose tissue with a total surface area of 1500 cm2. It hangs in front of the abdominal organs like an apron, and it is also connected to the spleen, stomach, pancreas, and colon. The omentum exhibits angiogenic, fibrotic, stem cells, and immune activities responsible for promoting vascularization, accelerated healing, and limiting infection in the abdominal cavity. These activities can also lead to pathological changes like omental tumor formation and metastasis.
