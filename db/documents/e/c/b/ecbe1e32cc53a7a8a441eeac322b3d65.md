Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis probably occurs commonly, but it is infrequently documented in the literature. For this reason, the exact incidence of CNH remains unknown. When not associated with autoimmune processes, this disease commonly affects men of middle age or later (70-90% of patients) but may affect women and younger adults as well. CNH can occur in all ethnicities; however, it is more frequent among fair-skinned people with a history of chronic sun exposure.
