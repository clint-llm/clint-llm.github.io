Aldolase B is the key enzyme in fructose metabolism, and its deficiency can lead to a toxic accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate. Fructose is rapidly converted into fructose-1-phosphate by fructokinase, leading to depletion of inorganic phosphate and ATP. This lethal cascade leads to increased production of uric acid and a release of magnesium along with impaired protein synthesis and metabolic disturbances, which are believed to be responsible for hepatic and renal dysfunction.

Aldolase B is responsible for the reversible conversion of fructose-1-phosphate to 3 carbon sugars. In individuals deficient in aldolase B activity, this causes an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate, leading to subsequent inhibition of both glycolytic and gluconeogenesis pathways, thus causing hypoglycemia in individuals.

The pathogenesis for renal tubular dysfunction is believed to be due to decreased activity of vacuolar-ATPase, responsible for endosomal acidification, and proton secretion, because of the deficiency of the aldolase enzyme leading to renal tubular dysfunction.
