On transvaginal ultrasound, the fetal heartbeat may be detected beginning around six weeks. The presence of a fetal heartbeat helps confirm the viability of a pregnancy. A fetal pole may also be detected at six weeks of gestation. The fetal pole is the first sign of the developing fetus that appears on imaging. It can be described as a thickened, hyperechoic structure adjacent to the yolk sac. The fetal pole will continue to grow into the developing fetus.
