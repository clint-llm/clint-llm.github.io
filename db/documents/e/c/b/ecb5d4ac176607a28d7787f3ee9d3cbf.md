**Scapholunate Dissociation**

Primary healing of the scapholunate ligamentous complex offers the patient the best opportunity to maintain normal wrist mechanics. However, surgical repair or reconstruction may be required. Special consideration needs to be given to the chronicity of the injury and the presence of carpal arthrosis, as this will alter the treatment choice. Multiple classifications exist to assist in determining which treatment option is indicated for the patient's stage of instability.

The goals of acute injury treatment are to promote healing of the scapholunate dorsal component, reduce scapholunate interval, maintain normal carpal alignment, prevent abnormal carpal mechanics that can result in degenerative changes, and limit damage to uninjured wrist structures.

- Stage I: partial ligament injury

- immobilization 
- physical therapy with reeducation of wrist proprioception 
- arthroscopic ligament debridement with or without thermal shrinkage
- percutaneous K-wire fixation of the scapholunate joint

- Stage II: complete ligament injury with normal scapholunate alignment on static radiographs

- repairable ligament

- open dorsal scapholunate ligament repair (volar ligament repair not necessary


- nonrepairable ligament

- dorsal ligament reconstruction
- dorsal scapholunate capsulodesis

- Stage III: complete ligament injury with static scapholunate interval widening

- repairable ligament

- open dorsal scapholunate ligament repair + reduction of interval


- nonrepairable ligament

- dorsal ligament reconstruction
- dorsal scapholunate capsulodesis

- Stage IV: complete ligament injury with static scapholunate interval widening and increased scapholunate angle (DISI deformity) 

- reducible deformity

- ligament reconstruction


- fixed deformity

- partial carpal arthrodesis

- Stage V: complete ligament injury with arthritic changes (SLAC wrist) 

- treatment is dependent on the location of degeneration

**Lunotriquetral Dissociation**

Effective treatment of lunotriquetral ligamentous complex injury is dependent on chronicity and the presence of carpal instability.

- Acute injury <6 weeks from injury, no malalignment on static radiographs

- immobilization with or without mid-carpal corticosteroid injection

- Acute injury with failed conservative management
- arthroscopy and injury classification

- Grade I: ligament attenuation, no gap between lunate and triquetrum

- ligament debridement   


- Grade II: ligament attenuation, <2 mm gap 
- 
- ligament debridement + K-wire fixation

- Grade III: ligament disruption, >2 mm gap

- ligament debridement + K-wire fixation 


- Grade IV: complete ligament disruption, able to pass arthroscope between lunate and triquetrum 

- open ligament repair

- Chronic injury with reducible carpal instability

- ligament reconstruction
- lunotriquetral arthrodesis

- Chronic injury with fixed malignment (VISI deformity) 

- triquetrum-hamate arthrodesis
- lunotriquetral arthrodesis + radiolunate arthrodesis
