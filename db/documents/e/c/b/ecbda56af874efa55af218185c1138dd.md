Erysipelas remains a clinical diagnosis, and assessing a patient for any recent skin trauma or pharyngitis is important. Patients often experience systemic symptoms, such as malaise, fever, and chills 48 hours before the onset of the skin lesion. It has been well described that erysipelas presents as an area of skin erythema that is sharply demarcated with raised edges. Often patients will complain of burning, tenderness, and itchiness at the site. More severe disease can present with vesicles, bullae, and even frank necrosis.

The location of inflammation is very important. In lower extremity erysipelas, it is recommended to examine the interdigital toe spaces for fissures, scaling, or maceration.Â  Redness and swelling involving a joint should raise suspicion for other more serious disease processes like septic arthritis.
