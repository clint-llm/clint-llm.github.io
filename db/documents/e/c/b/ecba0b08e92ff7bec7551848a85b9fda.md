Prognosis of pulseless ventricular tachycardia heavily depends on the time from the onset of tachycardia to defibrillation and restoration of sinus rhythm and efficient perfusion. Shorter delays in defibrillation associated with higher survival rates, up to 50%. Delays in treatment up to 15 minutes decrease the survival rates to as low as 5%.
