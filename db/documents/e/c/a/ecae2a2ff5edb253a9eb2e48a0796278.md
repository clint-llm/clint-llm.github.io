**Cataplerotic Processes**

Citric acid intermediates may leave the cycle to biosynthesize other compounds. Citrate can be diverted to fatty acid synthesis; alpha-ketoglutarate to amino acid synthesis, neurotransmitter synthesis, and purine synthesis; succinyl-CoA to heme synthesis; malate to gluconeogenesis and oxaloacetate to amino acid synthesis.

**Anaplerotic Processes**

Intermediates can also be inserted into the citric acid cycle to replace cataplerotic processes and ensure the cycle continues. For example, throughout the whole body, pyruvate can enter the cycle by way of pyruvate carboxylase, thus inserting additional oxaloacetate into the cycle. This increase in oxaloacetate pushes the cycle forward towards the already exergonic citrate synthase reaction. The liver is a particular case in that it can produce alpha-ketoglutarate by transamination or oxidative deamination of glutamate.
