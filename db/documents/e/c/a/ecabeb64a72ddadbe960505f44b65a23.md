The presence of dry eyes, thyroid disease and proptosis and clotting disorders are relative contraindications. There are different degrees of dry eyes. When a patient has severe dry eyes, it is wise to counsel the patient to avoid blepharoplasty as even a moderate increase in corneal exposure can make the patient's dryness significantly worse. In the presence of thyroid orbitopathy with proptosis, blepharoplasty may create lagophthalmos with corneal and visual problems. Clotting disorders have to be managed individually and with the help of their physicians. Patients who have had one or more previous blepharoplasty procedures (which we see increasingly commonly), should be examined carefully for the availableÂ skin and orbicularis function as well as any lagophthalmos before suggesting further blepharoplasty. Finally, there is a subset of patients who have photophobia: it is best to avoid blepharoplasty in these patients.
