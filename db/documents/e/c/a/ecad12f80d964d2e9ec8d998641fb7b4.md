The major complications for the mother who survives amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) are:

- Renal failure

- Prolonged respiratory failure with adult respiratory distress

- Myocardial infarction

- Cardiomyopathy

- Congestive heart failure

- Left ventricular systolic dysfunction

- Prolonged coagulopathy

- Liver failure

- Seizures

- Anoxic encephalopathy

- Other cognitive impairments

- Infants delivered precipitously during maternal AFE frequently sustain hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). The usual result is a markedly cognitively impaired child who may go on to have chronic epilepsy, motor impairment, and developmental delay.
