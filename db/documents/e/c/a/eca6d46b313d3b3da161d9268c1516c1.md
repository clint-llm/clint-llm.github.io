Many different pathophysiological processes can occur during embryogenesis of the GI tract. Many of these can are correctable by surgery and do not cause fetal demise in utero. A few of these embryological defects have associations with other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and Down syndrome.Â  Therefore, babies with meconium ileus and duodenal atresia require close monitoring and further evaluation for cystic fibrosis and Down syndrome, respectively.

It is vital during pregnancy to get routine ultrasounds to assess for polyhydramnios to suspect any GI anomalies. If a GI anomaly is suspected, it is important to monitor closely for any future surgeries needed for the baby.
