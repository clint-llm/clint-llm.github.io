Difficulty swallowing is a common problem encountered in clinical practice, especially when treating elderly patients. An uncommon acquired condition usually seen in older men is known as a Zenker diverticulum. This condition is considered a false diverticulum, as it only involves the mucosa and submucosa, and is caused by herniation of the esophagus through a muscular defect in the cricopharyngeus muscle. This diverticulum leaves the patient susceptible to dysphagia, halitosis, and aspiration. A Zenker diverticulum is assessable with a barium swallow study. Another condition that requires clinical intervention is esophageal or pharyngeal strictures or webs. These acquired conditions are often related to gastroesophageal reflux and can critically narrow the esophagus or UES, making swallowing difficult. Serial dilations are often necessary to alleviate these strictures. Cancer can also present with signs of dysphagia, and the dysphagia is usually for solid foods, like the dysphagia seen in strictures and webs. Cancer will also present with more severe signs such as blood and weight loss as the cancer is actively dividing. Esophageal motor dysfunctions can occur and include conditions like diffuse esophageal spasms and achalasia. Both of these conditions make it difficult to move food bolus through the esophagus and the stomach.
