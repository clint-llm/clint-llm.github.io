Most surgical or traumatic wounds require skin closure of some kind. Most commonly, this closure is done by suturing, as opposed to staples or surgical glues. A closure is a means of primary repair of skin and deeper layers (subcutaneous tissue, fascia, etc.) to promote wound healing. Suturing offers advantages like low dehiscence rates and greater tensile strength than other closure methods.

Historically, some form of wound closure mechanisms have been employed and were very similar to modern sutures. Several thousand years before the common era (BCE), eyed needles, sometimes made of bone, were used to pass a suture through wounds. The suture materials included hemp, flax, hair, linen, pig bristles, grass, reeds, and other plants.

Presently, there are innumerable options for sutures. Therefore, to appropriately choose a suture type, it is necessary to understand the characteristics of different sutures. The ideal sutures are easy for the surgeon to handle, provide appropriate strength and secure knots, can tolerate wound changes like swelling and recoil, cause minimal inflammation or infection risk, are easily visible, and are relatively inexpensive.
