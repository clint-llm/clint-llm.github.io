Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS) is a condition that can affect twin gestations that share one placenta. This disorder highlights the importance of determining the chorionicity (number of placentas) and amnionic (number of amniotic sacs) for all twin gestations, which will influence management. Twin gestations can be dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA, two placentas, and two amniotic sacs), monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA, one placenta, and two amniotic sacs), or monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA, one placenta, and one amniotic sac).

In the most accepted model of monozygotic twinning, the number of placentas and amniotic sacs depends upon when the splitting of the zygote occurs; DCDA twins result when splitting occurs between days 1 to 3, MCDA twins result when splitting occurs between days 3 to 8, MCMA twins result when splitting occurs between days 8 to 13, and conjoined twins result when splitting occurs on or after day 13.

To diagnose TTTS prenatally, an ultrasound must show a single placenta, one twin with oligohydramnios, and one twin with polyhydramnios. Oligohydramnios is typically defined as a maximal vertical pocket (MVP) of < 2 cm, while polyhydramnios is typically defined as an MVP of > 8 cm. Growth discordance and intrauterine growth restriction can occur but are not required for the diagnosis of TTTS. In monoamniotic twin gestations, findings consist of polyhydramnios and fetal bladder differences.
