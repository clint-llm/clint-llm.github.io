Complications of benign tumors are mostly related to the direct mass effect on surrounding tissues, as described above. If surgical biopsy or excision is pursued, then complications are related to the surgery performed and the techniques utilized. For anterior or lateral orbitotomies, the main complications of note include orbital hemorrhage, postoperative orbital cellulitis, damage to the extraocular muscles, globe, or optic nerve, dryness from decreased lacrimal gland function, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak, or recurrence of the tumor. Close monitoring after orbital surgery is crucial to managing these sight-threatening complications in a timely manner.
