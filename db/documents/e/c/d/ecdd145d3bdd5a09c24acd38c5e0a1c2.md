Relative contraindications to temporal artery biopsy (TAB) are few.

Authors disagree on the value of performing a biopsy after prolonged corticosteroid therapy. Some reports indicate that corticosteroid therapy does not significantly affect the sensitivity of the biopsy. In contrast, others claim that 2 to 4 weeks of therapy may substantially affect biopsy results.

A prior TAB performed correctly and yielded a negative result for giant cell arteritis may be a contraindication to a contralateral TAB; in this circumstance, the contralateral TAB is positive in only 2% to 3% of patients.
