Some of the common findings in patients with sickle cell nephropathy include:

- Hyperfiltration from glomerular hypertrophy with eGFR exceeding more than 200 ml/minute/1.73 mt2. Hyperfiltration is seen in 51% of patients with HbSS with contribution from hemolysis mediated vasculopathy

- Self-limiting microhematuria, which can be painless to visible, painful gross hematuria, requiring transfusions.

- Microalbuminuria and proteinuria which increases with age, reaching more than 60% of patients with SCD by age 45 years

- Nephrotic syndrome in up to 4% of patients

- Hyposthenuria is almost universal in SCD

- Renal infarction presenting with flank or abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fevers

- Hyperkalemia and mild hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (type IV renal tubular acidosis)

- Urinary tract infections and pyelonephritis

- Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus

- Acute kidney injury

- Progressive chronic kidney disease
