The obturator externus muscle receives blood supply from branches of the obturator and the femoral artery. The anterior branch of the obturator artery travels along the pubic ramus and supplies the obturator externus. The MCFA is the branch off of the femoral artery and also provides vascularization to the muscle. These two branches, as well as the posterior branch of the obturator artery, anastomose with one another near the obturator externus muscle.

It should be noted that there is some variability in the supply of the anterior branch of the obturator and the MCFA; therefore, the obturator externus can receive vascularization from either one or both of these arteries.

The obturator internus muscle receives blood supply from branches of the obturator artery, the gluteal artery, and the pudendal artery. Branches of the obturator artery include the muscular branches which supply the iliacus and iliopsoas muscles, in addition to the obturator internus.

One study by Fronhofer et al. found significant variation in the branching pattern of the inferior rectal branch to the obturator internus muscle. Their analysis concluded that 31% of cases had one branch to the obturator internus, 43% had two branches, 11% had three branches, and 15% lacked a branch from the inferior rectal artery altogether.
