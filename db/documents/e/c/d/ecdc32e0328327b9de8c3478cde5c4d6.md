Obesity is a significant and increasing health problem worldwide.

In simplest terms, weight change depends on the balance between energy intake and energy expenditure. However, this relationship is non-linear and involves many variables such as body mass composition, energy partition, and energy storage.

Weight change in patients with obesity is a complex multifactorial problem. Weight loss itself decreases the energy required and thus expenditure to perform equivalent PA activities after weight loss. Negative feedback circuits have been shown to influence food intake by increasing appetite and decreasing satiety.

Weight loss is the primary treatment for patients with obesity. While some improvement in cardiovascular risk has been demonstrated with a weight loss of 2 to 3%, clinical guidelines recommend a weight loss of 5% to 10% over 6 months to produce significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors.
