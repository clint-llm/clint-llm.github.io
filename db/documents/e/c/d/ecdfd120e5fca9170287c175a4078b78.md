Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of arthritis in clinical practice and is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. The presence of radiographic evidence of OA occurs in most people by age 65 and is found in about 80% of those over age 75. OA can range from an asymptomatic condition to debilitating oligo or polyarthritis. Mechanical pain is the most common presenting symptom of this disease. The hands, knees, and hips are the most commonly affected joints, although any joint can be affected.
