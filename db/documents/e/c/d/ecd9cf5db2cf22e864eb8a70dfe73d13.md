The classic history and reasons for consultation include frequent complaints of the absence of tears while crying/dry eyes at birth due to alacrima, feeding difficulties, repeated vomiting, weight loss due to underlying achalasia, or seizure secondary to hypoglycemia resulting from the adrenal crisis, and delayed growth/milestones.

Other clues in the history that can aid in early recognition include the history of familial consanguinity, symptoms of autonomic failure (orthostatic hypotension), developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, seizures, and the presence of similar clinical findings in the siblings. Distinct physical features include microcephaly, long-thin facies with prominent philtrum, orthostasis, hypernasal speech, ataxia, skin thickening with fissuring of palms, and soles.
