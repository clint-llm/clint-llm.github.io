Twisting of the intestine leads to proximal bowel distention and distal bowel decompression. Initially, peristalsis may increase, leading to frequent bowel movements. Vomiting may occur due to the proximal bowel distention. The twisted bowel will first cut off venous blood flow and lead to bowel wall edema and inflammation. The third spacing of fluid often occurs as well. The thickened and inflamed bowel wall is at risk for ischemia and bacterial translocation. Bacterial translocation can cause peritonitis and bacteremia, most commonly from Escherichia coli. As the bowel further twists, the arterial flow will be cut off, leading to bowel ischemia and eventually perforation, peritonitis, and death if untreated.
