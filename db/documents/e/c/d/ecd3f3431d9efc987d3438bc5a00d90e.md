Catatonia again is a complex combination of psychomotor abnormalities and mood and thought processes. There are at least forty different signs and symptoms that have been associated with catatonia. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual V has criteria for catatonia with specifiers, including that for schizophrenia. Three of the twelve symptoms must be present.

- Catalepsy (i.e., passive induction of posture held against gravity)

- Waxy flexibility (i.e., slight and even resistance to positioning)

- Stupor (no psychomotor activity; not actively relating to the environment)

- Agitation, not influenced by external stimuli

- Mutism (i.e., no or little, verbal response but this is not applicable if there is established aphasia)

- Negativism (i.e., opposing or not responding to external stimuli)

- Posturing (i.e., spontaneous and active maintenance of a posture against gravity)

- Mannerisms (i.e., odd caricature of normal actions)

- Stereotypies (i.e., repetitive, abnormally frequent, non-goal-directed movements)

- Grimacing

- Echolalia (i.e., mimicking another's speech)

- Echopraxia (i.e., mimicking another's movements)

Walter's paper categorizes the symptoms into four major categories: 1. Motor signs (such as immobility) 2. Behavioral signs (negativism) 3. Autonomic instability (tachycardia, hyperthermia) 4. Inability to suppress motor functions (stereotypy, echolalia, echopraxia).

A complete psychiatric history, along with collateral information and a complete neurological examination is key to diagnosing catatonia in a person with schizophrenia. The onset and duration of symptom onset are key to understanding catatonia.
