Imbalanced nutritional status adversely affects the health and wellness of individuals. By evaluating the nutritional status of individuals early on, nutritional screening and assessment allow for timely intervention and thus help maintain the health and wellness of individuals and improve quality of life. Timely interventions, especially in specific groups of individuals, such as infants, growing children, pregnant and lactating mothers, etc., help prevent long-term complications.

Nutritional assessment and intervention together break the vicious cycle between malnutrition and various diseases or conditions, in which malnutrition aggravates a disease/condition, and the disease/condition, in turn, precipitates malnutrition. Breaking this cycle helps in improving clinical outcomes. Nutritional and clinical management based on comprehensive nutritional assessment results in positive healthcare outcomes by reducing the recovery period, hospital length of stay, risk of complications, susceptibility to infections, and mortality associated with clinical and surgical illnesses. The use of standardized, systematic nutrition risk screening and assessment in the clinical setting also helps in reducing overall healthcare costs.
