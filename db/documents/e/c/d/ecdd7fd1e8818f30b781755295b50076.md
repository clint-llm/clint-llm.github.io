Causes of wrist drop include a stab wound to the shoulder area just below the clavicle as this is the area where the radial nerve is the terminal branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. A knife wound, for example, may easily transect the cord. The radial nerve can also be injured if there is a humeral fracture because the radial nerve runs through the radial groove on the lateral border of the bone.
