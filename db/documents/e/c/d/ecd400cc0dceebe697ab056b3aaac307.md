In the absence of significant physical findings and a history that is consistent with the Rome IV criteria or the "Rule of Three," the diagnosis of colic can be made confidently, and further evaluation is unnecessary. However, the presence of fever may necessitate a workup for sepsis and involve blood and urine cultures, imaging and even lumbar puncture. Abdominal distension may suggest the need for abdominal radiography or ultrasonography, while positive fecal occult blood testing may support suspected cow's milk allergy. Increased lethargy should prompt consideration for a septic workup and computed tomography (CT) of the brain. Suspicion for traumatic injury should be evaluated by skeletal surveys and CT of the head.
