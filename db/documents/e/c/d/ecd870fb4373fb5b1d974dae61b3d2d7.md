Histopathology of pityriasis rotunda lesions can reveal variable findings including hyperkeratosis which is mainly ortho-keratotic but can be para-keratotic, with plugs observed within hair follicles, elongated rete ridges, a diminished or absent stratum granulosum, slight spongiosis, enhanced pigmentation of the basal layer, pigmentary incontinence, and perivascular infiltrate of small lymphocytes. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain for fungus is negative. These changes are similar to those observed in ichthyosis vulgaris. However, the histopathological aspect may be normal.

Grimalt et al.Â performed an ultrastructural study on biopsies from pityriasis rotunda lesional skin. They noted the existence within the epidermis of vacuoles of lipid and crystal-like inclusions. Granules of keratohyalin were normal, and keratinosomes were increased. The stratum granulosum was reduced to one layer. The cementing substance connecting corneocytes was abundant. These findings were suggestive that pityriasis rotunda was more related to congenital ichthyosis than to ichthyosis vulgaris.
