Complications that are related to fractures of the fibula shaft are rare but do exist. Case reports exist of damage to the superficial peroneal nerve. There have also been reports of arterial damage and compartment syndrome in patients with isolated fibula fractures.

Nonunions may also present and may be symptomatic, in which case a compression plate and autogenous bone grafting is the gold standard treatment. These plates can be left in place for life unless they become irritable. Removal is usually delayed until at least 12 months.
