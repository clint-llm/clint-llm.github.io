HT156 is an alveolus protein specific to type I pneumocytes. It is on the apical plasma membrane. It can serve to target these cells to monitor for alveolar epithelium disease progression.

Surfactant-associated proteins, CD44v6 expressed on the basolateral membrane, pepsinogen C (a protease), lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 3, and E-cadherin can all be found on or within the type II pneumocytes. HTII-280 has an apical membrane integral protein specific to type II pneumocytes.

Alveolar macrophages contain CD11b and CD68, which are possible markers for alveolar macrophages. In one study, there was an increased percentage of CD63, CD204, or CD206 markers within the lungs of patients with COPD versus nonsmokers and smokers.
