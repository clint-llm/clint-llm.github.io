There have been two possible causes of microscopic colitis theorized, and a genetic component that predisposes to the condition, including medications and smoking tobacco. Medications that have links as causative or that lead to flares include NSAIDs.

Smoking may play a role in microscopic colitis, as it has been linked to multiple other inflammatory conditions as well. It has been linked to an increased risk of microscopic colitis and can lead to the development of microscopic colitis more than ten years earlier than in non-smokers.

Celiac disease is another inflammatory bowel condition that primarily affects the upper GI system. This syndrome is associated with HLA-DR3-DQ2 haplotype, which also correlates with microscopic colitis, similarly to celiac disease; the inflammatory process is similar between the two syndromes.
