Even though FNA appears to be a simple procedure, a number of complications can occur which include the following:

- Bruising

- Hematoma

- Infection

- Pneumothorax if the needle is advanced deep in the chest area

- Pain

So far there is no evidence to show that FNA causes seeding of breast cancer or worsens survival or prognosis. More important, FNA does not affect the number of falsely positive mammograms as long as the radiologist has prior information of where the FNA was performed.
