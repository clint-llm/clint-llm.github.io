- Acute and chronic female urinary retention are initially treated the same.

- Always convert to self-catheterization, if possible, until the patient is voiding normally.

- Use an experienced female nurse for self-catheterization patient teaching.

- Urodynamics is not generally very helpful in evaluating patients with acute urinary retention.

- Tamsulosin is worth trying as there is evidence of some efficacy; it is well tolerated and may provide a psychological (placebo effect) benefit.

- All younger ladies with unexplained urinary retention should be suspected of Fowler syndrome.

- All postoperative patients with urinary retention should have their catheters irrigated. A cystogram should be performed if no irrigation can be aspirated from the bladder.

- Sacral neuromodulation and/or posterior tibial nerve stimulation are reasonable treatment options for most women with chronic urinary retention.

- Patients who demonstrate very little detrusor activity and lack bladder sensation tended to have the worst outcomes after aggressive management (transurethral surgery, botulinum toxin urethral injections) of their urinary retention.

- After significant pelvic trauma with a suspected urethral injury, a suprapubic tube should be placed.

- In rare cases, an imperforate hymen can cause an obstructive type of urinary retention in pubescent girls.
