Specific glycosylation patterns and lectins appear to vary among M cells, although some lectins have been used to characterize M cells. The UEA-1 and WBA lectins have been used to stain specifically for M cells, though it is not clear how commonly these lectins are involved with M cells.RANKL expression, among various tumor necrosis factors and other cytokines, is needed to signal for the development of M cells from the stem cells mentioned above. Deletions or functional modifications of RANKL have been linked to M cell deficiency.
