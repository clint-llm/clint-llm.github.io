If laser airway surgery is planned, intubation should be performed with designated "laser-safe" endotracheal tubes. It is important to note this "laser-safe" name is a misnomer, as airway fire is still possible with these devices, but they have been designed with additional safety features such as dye-filled supplementary cuffs and are constructed of less-flammable materials such as metal.

Apneic techniques, spontaneous ventilation, and alternative airway devices such as laryngeal mask airways (LMAs) or jet ventilation are possible though used very infrequently in laser airway surgery for access and control reasons. A secured airway, with a specially-designed tube and a team familiar with specific challenges and risks of laser airway surgery, is always the safest option.
