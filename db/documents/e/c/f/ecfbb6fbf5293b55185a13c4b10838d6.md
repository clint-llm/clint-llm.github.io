**Migraine Treatments in Pregnancy**

Of note, risks and benefits should merit a thorough discussion with the patient in detail. Ergotamine is contraindicated during pregnancy and was in FDA category X under the prior pregnancy drug rating system. NSAIDs are not advised for use in the third trimester as they may increase the risk of prematurely closing the fetal ductus arteriosus. Valproate is contraindicated during pregnancy and was also in FDA category X. First-trimester exposure to topiramate correlates with cleft lip/palate. Topiramate was in FDA category D.

**Migraine Treatments in Children**

Of the abortive medications discussed, which include NSAIDs/acetaminophen, triptans, antiemetics, and dihydroergotamine, there are variable age restrictions/recommendations. No abortive class agents discussed here have an absolute contraindication. Dosing will typically be weight-based or smaller than adult doses. As for preventive treatments, although data is limited in the pediatric population, the classes of medications discussed here (beta-blockers, antiepileptics, calcium channel blockers, and antidepressants) have all been used.
