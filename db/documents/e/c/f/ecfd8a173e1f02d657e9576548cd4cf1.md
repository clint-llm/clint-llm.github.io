One of the most common tendons used in orthopedic surgery is the semitendinous tendon. The use of this tendon can result in negative changes for the locomotor system, also as the knee biomechanics.

After the use of semitendinous tendon in orthopedic surgery, the knee can be more unstable during the rehabilitation phase, and as the semitendinous muscle is a medial rotator, the individual can develop a lateral rotation movement dominance that can lead to overuse of biceps femoris and dysfunctions of near joints, also by overuse.
