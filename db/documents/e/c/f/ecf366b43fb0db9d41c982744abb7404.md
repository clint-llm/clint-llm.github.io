Lofgren syndrome is a specific acute clinical presentation of systemic sarcoidosis, consisting of a classic triad of fever, erythema nodosum, and bilateral hilar adenopathy; however, thisÂ characteristic triad is not always present and has also been associated with migratory polyarthritis, especially involving ankles in men. Must have a chest radiograph to confirm hilar adenopathy. Otherwise, no specific confirmatory tests are necessary. There is significant overlap among other known etiologies of erythema nodosum which can also contribute to systemic granuloma formation. Should presentation deviate from classic findings listed above further workup and, histopathologic correlation is required. Ultimately, sarcoidosis remains a diagnosis of exclusion.
