Glossopharyngeal neuralgia is a rare painful condition characterized by brief paroxysmal painful attacks in the glossopharyngeal nerve distribution. Pain episodes can occur within minutes of each other and then stop entirely for days at a time. The physical examination of patients with glossopharyngeal neuralgia is generally benign, and the painful areas do not show any signs of sensory abnormalities for both light touch and pinprick. This activity reviews the definition, etiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnoses, and management of glossopharyngeal neuralgia.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the diagnostic criteria of glossopharyngeal neuralgia.
-  Review the pathophysiology of the glossopharyngeal neuralgia.
- Outline the management options for glossopharyngeal neuralgia. 
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with glossopharyngeal neuralgia.
