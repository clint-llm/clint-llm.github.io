Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a procedure employed to "cleanse" the blood of various pathologic entities including antibodies, immune complexes, cellular elements, infectious agents, and toxins. A variety of conditions are responsive to therapy with TPE either as a first-line intervention or adjunct therapy. TPE, or plasmapheresis, consists of the separation of whole blood into its liquid and cellular components via centrifugal or membrane-filter technique followed by reintroduction of albumin and/or donor plasma tp the cellular components and re-infusion. This activity reviews the process of TPE, the evaluation and treatment of conditions responsive to therapeutic plasma exchange, and the role of an interprofessional team performing this interventional therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Review the mechanistic process of therapeutic plasma exchange.
- Summarize common conditions responsive to therapeutic plasma exchange.
- Describe the mechanism(s) by which therapeutic plasma exchange accomplishes treatment of said conditions.
- List the common complications associated with exchange transfusions.
