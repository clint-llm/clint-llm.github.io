Loop diuretics induce its effect by competing with chloride to bind to the Na-K-2Cl (NKCC2) cotransporter at the apical membrane of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and blocking the cotransporter, which inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride. By inhibiting NaCl reabsorption, tonicity in the interstitium decreases, and free water excretion increases as a result. Blocking of the NKCC2 cotransporter makes potassium unable to be reabsorbed back into the lumen, which results in the loss of calcium and magnesium ions.
