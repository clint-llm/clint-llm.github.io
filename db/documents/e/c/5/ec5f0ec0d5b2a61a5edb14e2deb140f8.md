Dosing of oseltamivir phosphate is via the oral route, and it can be administered with or without meals. It is available in capsule form of three different dosages (30, 45, and 75 mg) and an oral powder for reconstitution to suspension for pediatric patients. Therapy should initiate as early as possible, and maximum benefit is derived when started within 48 hours of the onset of illness. However, treatment must be initiated before the 48-hour window for severe illness or patients at risk of complications.

**Seasonal Influenza A and B Treatment (five-day oral course)**

- Adults: 75 mg BID

- Infants 0 to 8 months: 3 mg/kg/dose BID

- Infants 9 to 11 months: 3.5 mg/kg/dose BID

- Children 1 to 12 yrs old:

- Less than 15 kg: 30 mg BID
- Greater than 15 kg to less than 23 kg: 45 mg BID
- Greater than 23 kg to less than 40 kg: 60 mg BID
- Over 40 kg: 75 mg PO BID

Patients with severe infections admitted to an intensive care unit or immunosuppressed may require oseltamivir treatment for a prolonged indeterminate duration (more than five days).

**Treatment Dosing Adjustments for Creatinine Clearance**

- CrCl 30 to 60 ml/min: 30 mg BID

- CrCl less than 30 ml/min: 30 mg daily

- Hemodialysis patients: 30 mg after dialysis x 5 days (assumes 3 HD sessions)

**Seasonal Influenza A and B Prophylaxis (seven to 10-day oral course)******

- Adults: 75 mg daily

- Infants 0 to 8 months: 3 mg/kg/dose daily (not indicated for under three months unless clinically critical)

- Infants 9 to 11 months: 3 mg/kg/dose daily

- Children 1 to 12 yrs old:

- Less than 15 kg: 30 mg daily
- Greater than 15 kg to less than 23 kg: 4 5mg daily
- Greater than 23 kg to less than 40 kg: 60 mg daily
- Over 40 kg: 75 mg daily

**Prophylaxis Dosing Adjustments for Creatinine Clearance**

- CrCl 30 to 60 ml/min: 30 mg daily

- CrCl less than 30 ml/min: 30 mg every other day

- End-stage renal disease: use is not recommended

While recommendations for oseltamivir include the treatment of avian influenza infections, the optimum dosage and duration of therapy are unknown for these infections.

**Use in Specific Patient Populations**

**Patients with Hepatic Impairment:**According to the manufacturer's labeling information,  no dosage adjustment is recommended in case of mild to moderate liver disease. According to a pharmacokinetic study, in severe hepatic impairment(Child-Pugh class C), oseltamivir exposure(AUC) is approximately six times increased. Use in severe hepatic impairment is not recommended.

**Patients with Renal Impairment:**The first dose should be 75 mg for patients with normal body mass. Subsequent doses should be decreased according to the degree of renal impairment.

**Pregnancy Considerations:**Complications of influenza during pregnancy include late pregnancy loss and a decrease in mean birth weight.

**Breastfeeding Considerations:**Limited clinical information suggests that oseltamivir and its active metabolites are excreted into breast milk in trace amounts. It is a former FDA pregnancy class C. A maternal dose of 150 mg oseltamivir daily produces low levels in milk and is not anticipated to cause adverse drug reactions in breastfed infants.
