Antiepileptic medications are generally not recommended for seizures that are brief, infrequent, or in patients who have fewer than 2 seizures. Antiepileptic treatment is usually reserved for children with a high risk of recurrence. Rescue benzodiazepines may remain the treatment of choice in children with PS as more than half the patients with this condition have the risk of autonomic status epilepticus but a low risk of frequent, prolonged seizures.

In ICOE-G, children may have frequent seizures requiring antiepileptic medications. Carbamazepine has more than 90% clinical response and is the first-line medication in such children. Other medication options include sodium valproate and phenobarbital.
