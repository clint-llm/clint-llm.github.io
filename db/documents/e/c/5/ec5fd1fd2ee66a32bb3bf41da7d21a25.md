There are no specific contraindications to a colposcopy other than an active or untreated cervical or vaginal infection. If a patient is pregnant, certain steps of the colposcopy procedure are excluded. The endocervical curettage component is not performed due to potential risks of adverse effects on the pregnancy without substantial benefit. Furthermore, pregnancy can limit management options due to the fact that cervical excisional procedures are contraindicated during pregnancy.
