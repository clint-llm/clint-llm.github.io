The following complications may accompany these lesions

- Pathological fracture: The main complication of SBC is a fracture. Pain, younger age of presentation, proximal humeral lesion, change in the size of a cavity with age, distance from growth plate, multiple septations, and early recurrence are signs of an active cyst and increased fracture risk

- Pain

- Malignant transformation is rare in UBC. Rare cases of malignancies have been reported several years after the treatment of ABC

- Arthritis

- Pressure symptoms

- Growth disorder: Limb length discrepancy or axial deviation may be induced in children if cysts transgress the physis or involve the epiphysis

- Recurrence: No treatment guarantees complete cure except for complete surgical resection - the post-treatment recurrence rate in case of UBC is about 10 to 30%; hence, the least aggressive treatment is the initial option

- Aggressive surgical treatment for femoral neck lesions has generally been advocated given the dreaded complications associated with pathological femur neck fractures (like avascular necrosis, residual coxa vara, etc.).

- General risks related to management of cysts: Unanticipated residual structural deformity and functional disability,  and injury to adjacent vital structures (e.g., neurovascular) can occur
