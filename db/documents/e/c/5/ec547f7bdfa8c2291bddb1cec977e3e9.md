A mechanical ventilator and an external oxygen supply are required to deliver PSV. For invasive ventilation, an endotracheal tube, ventilator tubing, an endotracheal tube holder, and equipment for monitoring telemetry, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation are necessary. For non-invasive ventilation, CPAP tubing and a well-fitting full face or nasal mask are requirements.
