Equipment required for interpolation flaps is generally the same for other local or regional flap surgery, with a few possible additions.

Pre-operatively

- Template material (non-stick dressing material, surgical cottonoid, foil suture wrapper, or other material that allows the creation of a template or pattern for the flap). This can also be done sterilely on the operative field.

- Local anesthetic

- Surgical scrub/preparation solution

Intra-operatively

- A scalpel with #15 blade

- Toothed forceps

- Curved iris scissors, preferably serrated (to thin fat from flap if indicated)

- Shea or other fine dissecting scissors

- Skin hooks

- Suture (4-0 or 5-0 absorbable sutures and 5-0 or 6-0 non-absorbable suture)

- Gauze

- Electrocoagulation device

- A standard soft tissue or flap tray may be required for larger flaps such as the deltopectoral

- Doppler ultrasound to identify perforators/pedicle (many authors opt not to use this, but it can be helpful).

Post-operatively

- Non-adherent petrolatum-soaked gauze ribbon dressing (to place on the raw surface of the pedicle)

- Fluffed gauze or other absorbent material for post-op bulky dressing

- Adhesive dressing material or tape with elasticity
