Symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer depend on the stage of presentation. Earlier symptoms may include epistaxis or unilateral nasal obstruction. The classic triad of symptoms including neck mass due to lymph node metastasis, otitis media, and nasal obstruction is rarely seen. All three, however, are individually very common presenting symptoms of nasopharyngeal cancer. Symptoms are based on the extent of the tumor and the pattern of spread. Cranial nerve involvement may lead to facial numbness, diplopia, or any symptoms related to cranial nerve palsies. The third, fifth, sixth, and 12th cranial nerves are most commonly affected. Dysphagia and odynophagia as seen in other head and neck cancers are rarely seen in early-stage nasopharyngeal cancer since the site of origin is above the oropharynx.
