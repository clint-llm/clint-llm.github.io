Doses up to 7000 mg of bamlanivimab (10 times the FDA recommended dose) or 7000 mg of etesevimab (5 times the FDA recommended dose ) have been studied in clinical trials, which did not show any of the dose-limiting toxicity. If an overdose of bamlanivimab and etesevimab happens, treatment comprises supportive measures, including vitals and clinical status monitoring. As of now, there is no specific antidote available for the overdose.
