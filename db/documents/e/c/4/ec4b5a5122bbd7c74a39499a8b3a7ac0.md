Eyelid myokymia is often observed in clinical practice by eye care providers, emergency physicians, and nurses. Although this condition is best managed conservatively, a referral to the ophthalmologist is important in cases that persist or if there is a suspicion of an underlying problem and for proper management, if it becomes debilitating. Â Good communication between health care providers is required to improve patients outcomes.
