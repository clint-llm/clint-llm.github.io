The Mustarde technique treats the underdeveloped antihelical fold.  When examining the ear the surgeon should apply gentle pressure to form the planned antihelical fold.  Then mattress suture points should be marked 8 mm on each side of the new antihelical fold. Hydrodissection with local anesthetic is critical to promote anesthesia and hemostasis; 1% local lidocaine with epinephrine 1 to 100,000 is typically an acceptable local anesthetic. Cartilage tattoo can be performed with methylene blue to mark the cartilage site of suturing.  A postauricular incision is made to provide access for the sutures. There is an option to score the cartilage which can help weaken it to ensure that the cartilage loses its elasticity. The horizontal mattress sutures should include three separate sutures from superior to inferior about 10 mm apart.
