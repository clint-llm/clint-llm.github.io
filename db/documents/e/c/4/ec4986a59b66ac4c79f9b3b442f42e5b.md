Cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) is an antigenic tumor marker that is commonly expressed by the epithelial ovarian neoplasms and other tissues, such as cells lining the endometrium, fallopian tubes, pleura, peritoneum, and pericardium.

CA 125 is one of the serological tests carried out when suspecting ovarian neoplasm in a woman and is used in monitoring patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancers.
