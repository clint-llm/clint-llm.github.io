Similar to bladder exstrophy, children undergoing epispadias repair require optimal postoperative care. The following elements must be taken care of during management of these children:

- Adequate pain relief: The surgery involves the repair of one of the most sensitive parts of the urinary tract i.e., bladder neck and urethra. Therefore, adequate postoperative analgesia is a must. Epidural analgesia in the initial postoperative period is followed by most of the centers across the globe. Intermittent pain can be relieved by using intravenous analgesics.

- Bladder spasms: As soon as the child is able to take orally, an anticholinergic medication should be started. These not only play a major role in detrusor relaxation but also have a local anesthetic action.

- Immobilization of the lower extremities: The immobilization of lower extremities is preferred when osteotomy is performed. However, performing the osteotomy is solely based on the surgeon's preference. Some surgeons emphasize on lower limb immobilization using a hip spica even when osteotomy is not performed.

- Care of the indwelling catheter: Care of the bladder catheter cannot be emphasized more. It is always better to use a self-retaining catheter in these surgeries.
