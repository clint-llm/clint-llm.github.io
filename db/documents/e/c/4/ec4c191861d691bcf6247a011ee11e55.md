Due to the pathological structure and mobility of the lumbosacral junction in patients with Bertolotti syndrome, there are possibly several reasons why pain accompanies an LSTV.

One possible cause of Bertolotti syndrome may arise from an abnormal iliolumbar ligament.

Although the transitional articulation may appear to be the most salient source of pain, other associated etiologies that may obfuscate the clinical picture may be discogenic pain and lumbar radiculopathy. There has been an identified association between the presence of an LSTV and disc herniations, as well as facet joint degeneration at the spinal level above the LSTV.

The disc located directly above the transitional segment, likely L5-S1, has been commonly degenerated at far greater rates than the disc between the transitional vertebra and the sacrum.

Stenosis of the intervertebral foramen has been continuously demonstrated in Bertolotti syndrome, likely due to degenerative changes at the facet joints at the level above the LSTV.
