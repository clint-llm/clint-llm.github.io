In many western countries, malaria is rare. The interprofessional team must remain diligent and consider screening questions to help diagnose and evaluate potential world travelers that might be infected. Once a diagnosis is made, a team approach of clinicians, nurses, and a pharmacist working to make sure the patient continues treatment will provide the best patient outcome.  The key to managing malaria is to prevent it in the first place.

The pharmacist should recommend chemoprophylaxis to travelers going to visit endemic areas. In addition, the pharmacist should emphasize the importance of medication compliance. They should also check for contraindications and drug-drug interactions.

The nurse should educate the patient on the use of DEET, mosquito nets, and wearing appropriate garments when venturing outside.

The public health nurse should educate homeowners on removing all standing water near the home and getting rid of the trash that acts as a breeding ground for mosquitoes. When a traveler returns from an endemic area with fever, an infectious disease consult should be obtained. The earlier the infection is diagnosed, the better the outcomes. [Level 5]
