Lumbar sympatholysis can be an effective treatment option for patients suffering from chronic, intractable pain in the lower extremity as a result of various causes such as complex regional pain syndrome, post-herpetic neuralgia, inoperable peripheral arterial disease, phantom limb pain, erythromelalgia, or hyperhidrosis.  The relief and symptom improvement resulting from the destruction of the lumbar sympathetic chain can last up to several years at a time and can be performed by chemical neurolysis, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, and surgical sympathectomy approaches.  In order to help provide effective and safe care for patients suffering with these often debilitating conditions, it is important for healthcare providers to have an understanding of these techniques as well as having an understanding of the indications for, contraindications for, potential side effects of, and potential complications of lumbar sympatholysis.
