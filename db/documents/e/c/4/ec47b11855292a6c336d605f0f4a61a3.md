The successful diagnosis and treatment of EBV positive mucocutaneous ulcers rely highly on an interprofessional and patient-centered approach. Given the rarity of EBVMCU and its typical self-remitting course, it is likely that this condition is commonly overlooked or misdiagnosed. As early diagnosis and treatment of EBVMCU can vastly decrease sequelae and improve patient outcomes, it is important for health care workers to work together to obtain a prompt diagnosis.
