**Solitary osteochondroma**

Literature suggests that solitary osteochondromas may result from a developmental abnormal rather than representing a true neoplasm.

**Hereditary multiple exostoses**

The hereditary form of the osteochondroma (HME) is associated with a loss-of-function type of mutation in the tumor suppressor genes EXT1 and EXT2 that are responsible for the synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) which results in HSPG deficiency and subsequent development of multiple osteochondromas.
