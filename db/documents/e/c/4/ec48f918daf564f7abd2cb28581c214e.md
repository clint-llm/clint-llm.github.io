There are several anatomic variants of the internal thoracic artery. It becomes crucial to be aware of these variations in the surgical setting, most often during coronary artery bypass grafting as the left internal thoracic artery is the conduit of choice for coronary bypass. In cadaveric studies, the internal thoracic artery has been reported to arise from the distal subclavian artery, rather than the proximal portion.
