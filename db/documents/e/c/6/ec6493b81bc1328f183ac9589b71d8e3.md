During labor, the assessment of the amniotic fluid color can determine if the infant is at risk for amniotic inhalation upon birth. If the meconium-stained amniotic fluid is noted, a neonatal resuscitation team should be involved. In places with limited perinatal resources, an amnioinfusion could be tried, but the benefits of this procedure are unclear.
