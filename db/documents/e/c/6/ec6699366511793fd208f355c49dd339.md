Despite having the same essential structural components as the rest of the world, the nose is unique among individuals. Genetics and environmental variation have led to evolutionary changes to the anatomy of the nose within our species. The shape of the nostrils, the angle of the nasal tip, and the width of the nasal bridge are examples of visible variations that give each person a distinct nose.

The uncinate process of the ethmoid bone, as previously described, attaches to the lacrimal bone and the inferior turbinate. The third attachment can vary between the lamina papyracea, the roof of the ethmoid, and the middle turbinate.

**Middle Turbinate**

The middle turbinate, as previously described, has some common variations associated with it. The variants can obstruct the infundibulum, middle meatus, and if severe, the nasal cavity. As with the inferior turbinate, the middle turbinate can also enlarge by a process called aeration. When the middle turbinate is aerated, it is termed concha bullosa. Normally the middle turbinate is curved downward and laterally like the other turbinates. When the middle turbinate is curved upward, and medially it is named a paradoxical middle turbinate.
