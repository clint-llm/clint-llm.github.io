As many patients with kratom toxicity will primarily be seen in the emergency department, performing a primary survey and assessing the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation is crucial. Developing a broad differential in these patients is imperative as initial presenting symptoms may vary based on the dose of kratom ingested. Also, screening for kratom misuse is primarily based on patient disclosure, as kratom is not detected on regular drug screens.

There are no formal, evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of kratom toxicity. Presentations for kratom toxicity can differ as symptoms vary based on the dose ingested and whether the substance has been altered. The physiologic effects of kratom ingestion vary dose-dependently, where stimulant-like effects are seen at lower doses, and opioid-like effects are seen at higher doses.

At higher doses, kratom toxicity can mimic an opioid toxidrome. While there are reversal agents, like naloxone, for opioid overdoses, the efficacy of reversal agents has not been well established with kratom toxicity. However, there are cases that have reported potential benefits, and some studies have recommended their use.N-acetylcysteine has been used, as inÂ other cases of drug-induced hepatitis.
