While medical treatment has not shown to prevent or delay the onset of valvular disease,

AS is classified based on effective orifice area (EOA), the jet velocity, the ejection fraction, and the transvalvular pressure gradient. Two of the most common approaches to determine EOA are Gorlin formula and continuity equation. Doppler echocardiography is used to determine velocity time integral (VTI), which is the smallest cross-sectional area of the stream, to estimate EOA using continuity equation. However, it sometimes overestimates the severity, which can lead to unnecessary intervention.

Due to the growing success of TAVR, ACC/AHA guidelines for the indications of AVR changed in 2014.

1) Patients considered to be at prohibitive risk for surgery and a predicted post-TAVR survival longer than 12 months (class I indication, level of evidence B).

2) As an alternative to SAVR in patients considered to be at high risk for surgery (class IIa indication, level of evidence B).

**SAVR Versus TAVR**

From 2004 to 2008, aortic valve replacement (AVR) had a mortality of 2.8%.  Due to porcelain aorta and high surgical risk, 1/3 of the patients with severe AS aged greater than 75 are deemed unsuitable for aortic valve replacement.

Andersen et al. demonstrated the feasibility of TAVR in 1992 using a porcine aortic valve folded into a balloon expandable stent.

In patients with systolic dysfunction, TAVR has shown to normalize ventricular-arterial coupling, decrease LV hypertrophy and restore normal LV function.

**Sequelae of TAVR**

Major complications associated with TAVR are para-valvular leaks, stent migration, conduction disturbances, and stroke.

Para-valvular leakage (PVL) or LVOT obstruction can occur due to stent migration or rotation if the calcific nodules on the native valves are not sufficient to anchor the stent.

Two large randomized trails compared TAVR and SAVR in high-risk patients and revealed that TAVR is associated with a stroke rate from 4 to 5%, which is highest amongst percutaneous cardiac interventions. FDA requires all TAVR patients to have a follow-up CT to look for signs of leaflet immobility since reduced leaflet motion has been shown to associate with an increased incidence of strokes and transient ischemic attacks.

Direct, or near direct, contact of the bioprosthetic valve and coronary ostium can lead to coronary obstruction, which correlates with a high mortality rate.

Conduction abnormalities due to compression of atrioventricular (AV) node or His bundle can occur due to oversized valves and if the stent positioning is too deep into the left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT). On the other hand, positioning the valvular prosthesis supra-annularly can increase the risk of coronary ostia occlusion. The need for a permanent pacemaker in PARTNER A Cohort was not significantly different for the patients undergoing TAVR versus SAVR. Siontis and colleagues found that conduction abnormalities were 2.5 times more prevalent with self-expandable valves compared to balloon-expandable valves. They also suggested that male sex, baseline conduction abnormalities, and intra-procedural AV block were predictors of a permanent pacemaker placement after TAVR.

Vascular sequelae are independent predictors of death. Major vascular complications arise after retrograde delivery through the femoral arteries due to the size of trans-catheter valves in a collapsed state. It can lead to dislodging of calcific debris from arteries and can lead to stroke.

Logistic EuroSCORE and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) algorithms are the two most frequently used death-prediction models used for TAVR patients. The trans-apical approach has correlated with a higher mortality rate than the transfemoral route.
