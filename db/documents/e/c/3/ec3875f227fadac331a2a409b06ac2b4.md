The internist, infectious disease expert, oncologist, and hematologist may administer interferon to their patients for a variety of reasons. However, these professionals need to be aware of interferon-inducedÂ retinopathy. A baseline eye exam by an ophthalmology nurse is recommended. If the patient has any change in vision or ocular complaints, a consult with an ophthalmologist is necessary. If a patient presents with an ophthalmological complication while receiving IFN therapy, the general recommendation is to stop IFN treatment. However, some authors suggest discontinuing treatment only in those with severe retinopathy or those with preexisting diseases like diabetes mellitus. A good outcome results in many cases after stopping IFN.
