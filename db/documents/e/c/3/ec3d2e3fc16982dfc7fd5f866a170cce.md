Initial treatment in an awake patient includes removal from exposure, including removal of clothing, and administration of high flow oxygen. Intravenous fluids and vasopressors should be administered to hypotensive patients. Correction of acidosis based on arterial blood gases and lactate dehydrogenase levels should be done. In higher toxic doses where a patient may be altered or in severe respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary edema, treatment consists of sodium nitrite administration of 300 mg intravenous given over two to four minutes. Sodium nitrite causes methemoglobin to accumulate at low levels. This promotes the conversion of the sulfide to sulfmethemoglobin, which is less toxic than the sulfide. This medication is most effective if given within minutes, as hydrogen sulfide toxicity escalates rapidly. After treatment with sodium nitrite, levels of methemoglobin should be checked within 30-60 minutes, with ideal levels below 30%. If levels of methemoglobin become concerning, methylene blue may be administered. Other than sodium nitrite administration for the treatment of hydrogen sulfide, there is some evidence to suggest hyperbaric oxygen can help improve the delivery of oxygen to end organs. Another medication, cobinamide, has shown promise in animal models for hydrogen sulfide and cyanide toxicity.
