Allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, is a urate-lowering medication.

Allopurinol is FDA approved for the following indications:

- Gout

- Prevention of tumor lysis syndrome

- Prevention of recurrent calcium nephrolithiasis in patients with hyperuricosuria

Other non-FDA-approved indications include Lesch-Nyhan syndrome-associated hyperuricemia and recurrent uric acid nephrolithiasis prevention.

American College of Rheumatology recommends initiating urate-lowering therapy such as allopurinol in patients with an established diagnosis of gouty arthritis in the following situations:

- Frequent attacks of acute gouty arthritis, defined as equal to or more than two attacks per year

- Chronic kidney disease stage 2 or worse

- Presence of tophi or tophus on clinical exam or imaging

- History of nephrolithiasis

It is important to note that asymptomatic hyperuricemia is not an indication of allopurinol or any urate-lowering therapy.

Van Liere E. et al. conducted a study on using low-dose azathioprine and allopurinol (LDAA) to treat inflammatory bowel disease. Allopurinol was added to azathioprine to improve its tolerability. The investigators found that LDAA was better tolerated in patients compared with standard azathioprine monotherapy.
