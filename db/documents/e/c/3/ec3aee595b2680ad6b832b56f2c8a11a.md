Myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (MEI) usually remits within six months toÂ five years from onset. Reflex variant MEI induced by auditory or tactile stimuli has a better prognosis and an excellent AED response. However, the photosensitive reflex variant is difficult to manage, and EEG photosensitivity persists several years after clinical remission. Approximately one-fifth of Myoclonic epilepsy of Infancy develop afebrile generalized tonic-clonic seizures later in the clinical course when AED is withdrawn. Two-thirds of MEI has normal psychomotor development, and approximately one-third develop mild cognitive, behavioral, or motor deficits. Early-onset of seizures and poor seizure control are risk factors for a poor neuropsychological outcome.
