Certain exposures of the patient and the form of the lesion make osteochondral allograft contraindicated. Following are some important contraindications:

- Advanced multicompartmental osteoarthritis

- Bipolar full-thickness chondral lesions with a bone to bone contact

- Inflammatory arthropathies

- Patients with concomitant conditions with prolonged steroid use

- Smoking and alcohol abuse

Relative contraindications: Associated conditions such as ligamentous instability, absence of meniscus, malalignment, and obesity.

Absence of more than 50% of the ipsilateral compartment meniscus may benefit from simultaneous meniscal transplantation.

Malalignment must be corrected with osteotomies to decrease the load over the affected compartments, thus increasing graft survival.
