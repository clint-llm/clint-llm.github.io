Craniopharyngiomas are rare, benign tumors of the central nervous system. Craniopharyngiomas are epithelial tumors that typically arise in the suprasellar area of the brain, extending to involve the hypothalamus, optic chiasm, cranial nerves, third ventricle, and major blood vessels. It can produce a wide array of symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and vomiting, visual and endocrine disturbances. It represents a special challenge for the physicians treating it; these physicians commonly include neurosurgeons, neuro-ophthalmologists, neurologists, endocrinologists, and pediatricians. Curative surgeries are extremely difficult due to their location and infiltration into the surrounding structures. Further, the quality of life is compromised due to the development of multiple complications, including panhypopituitarism, visual problems, obesity, and mental disorders.
