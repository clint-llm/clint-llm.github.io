OCT-A is not without its limitations. OCT-A is highly sensitive to motion, and although eye-tracking methods are commonly deployed within devices, patient collaboration is required.

OCT-A technology is also dependent on the light source and, as such, is limited by media opacities, leading to signal attenuation and shadowing artifact.
