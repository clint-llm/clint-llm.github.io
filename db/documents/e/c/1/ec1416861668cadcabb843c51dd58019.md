Proper circulation of oxygenated blood is such an incredibly important function of the human body that it is included in the “ABCDE’s” (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure) of the primary survey conducted in the emergent clinical setting.

The internal carotid artery, being one of the most clinically relevant and vital arteries, supplies oxygenated blood to crucial structures such as the brain and eyes. The internal carotid arteries are branches of the common carotid arteries that bifurcate into the internal and external carotids at the level of the carotid sinus.
