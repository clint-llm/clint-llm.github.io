Salter-Harris fractures (physeal fractures) refer to fractures through a growth plate (physis)Â and are, therefore, specifically applied to bone fractures in children. The classification system used to grade fractures according to the involvement of the physis, metaphysis, and epiphysis is important as it has implications for both prognosis and treatment.
