The most common risk factors associated with bronchopleural fistula (BPF) in the postoperative setting include right-sided pneumonectomy and right lower lobectomy. The fistula is commonly found on the stump beside the residual lobe due to the increased risk of ischemic necrosis or the pooling of secretions leading to bacterial overgrowth and colonization. The increased risk of BPF associated with right pneumonectomy is due to the more extensive resection required.

Other causes include:

- Chemotherapy and radiation therapy

- Lobectomy-right, bi-lobectomy, and lower lobectomy

- Diabetes mellitus

- Heavy smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

- Bullous lung disease

- Spontaneous pneumothorax or other parenchymal abnormalities

- Low nutritional status or poor wound healing

- Previous ipsilateral thoracotomy

- A large diameter bronchial stump (greater than 25 mm)

- Extensive lymph node dissection

- Age older than 60 years

- Fever

- Corticosteroid use

- Leukocytosis

- Tracheostomy

- Bronchoscopy for sputum suctioning/mucous

- Residual tumor in the resection margins

- Tightness of the individual sutures

- Excessive peribronchial and paratracheal dissection

- Prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation

- Tuberculosis

- Hemophilus influenza

- Streptococcus viridans

- Staphylococcus aureus

- Pseudomonas aeruginosa

- Klebsiella pneumoniae

- Pneumococcus

- Non-hemolytic streptococcus

- Aspergillus

- Histoplasma capsulatum

- Gastroesophageal reflux disease with Barrett esophagus

- Boerhaave syndrome

- Broncholithiasis

- Lung cancer

- Thyroid cancer

- Esophageal cancer

- Lymphomas

- Thoracic trauma with tracheobronchial tree disruption

- Bougie intubation

- Necrotizing lung disease associated with radiation or chemotherapy

- Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Especially in patients requiring ventilation with high airway pressures

- Ventilator-induced barotrauma

- Overzealous manual ventilation

- Central line placement
