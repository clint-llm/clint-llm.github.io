Patients with dementia are at increased risk of driving impairment, and fitness to drive should be evaluated in all patients with neurocognitive disorders. There is currently no gold standard test or scale to determine driving fitness, and many clinicians do not feel comfortable making a recommendation to stop driving. This activity reviews the evaluation of driving impairment in patients with dementia and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the importance of assessing driving fitness in patients with dementia.
- Identify the neuropsychiatric and physical impairments that place patients with dementia at risk for driving impairment.
- Summarize the different screening tools used to assess driving fitness in patients with dementia.
- Describe when a patient should be formally declared unfit to drive and how to aid patients in their transition.
