VIgilence for cardiac arrhythmias and electrolyte imbalances is necessary. Any cardiac arrhythmia is visible with CAS overdose secondary to the AV node blocking effects of CAS. Electrolyte imbalances include hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia. CNS depression may also occur either due to the direct toxic effects of CAS or due to the generalized cerebral hypoperfusion. Although rare but mesenteric ischemia can also occur.
