The utility of clinical ultrasonography has continued to expand over the last 50 years. Ultrasonography as an imaging modality has multiple benefits; it can provide real-time imaging at a low cost and without any harmful ionizing radiation. The addition of Doppler has further expanded its utility. It is frequently used to assess vascular patency and organ perfusion, as well as in advanced echocardiography to evaluate for valvulopathy and cardiac function.

To optimize imaging and make appropriate clinical determinations, it is instrumental that users understand the principles of different doppler modalities and how Doppler information is processed.
