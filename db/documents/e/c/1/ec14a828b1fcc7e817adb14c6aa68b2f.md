Algor mortis has been used as a tool to estimate the postmortem interval between death and the discovery of an individual who has died. This is especially important in medicolegal and forensic death investigations. However, numerous variables affect the rate and direction of algor mortis and complicate its use in estimating time of death.

Studies have shown that the body mass index influences cooling rates, but only 36% of cases were in a linear progression over time even in a controlled ambient temperature.
