Patients with AR pupils, implicating a late-stage syphilis infection can require a team of health-care professionals to aid in their treatment and recovery. An infectious disease specialist should be consulted for the underlying infection or co-infections, and consultation with ophthalmology. Patients may require cardiology and neurology depending on the extent and a breadth of other symptoms. Patients should be educated on safe sex practice to prevent transmission and re-infection.
