Treatment of overt hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is essential to decrease the risk of maternal and fetal complications. Maternal complications include an increased risk of pregnancy loss, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, placental abruption, and preterm labor. When thyrotoxicosis progresses to a thyroid storm, there is an increased risk of congestive heart failure, admission to intensive care, and maternal death.

Overtreatment with antithyroid drugs in pregnancy can cause fetal hypothyroidism. Conversely, women who receive adequate antithyroid treatment during pregnancy usually give birth to a euthyroid neonate. However, TRAbs that previously crossed the placenta will still be present. Antithyroid drugs are metabolized by the newborn within two to three days of birth. TRAbs can then cause neonatal hyperthyroidism, affecting 1.5 to 2% of neonates in mothers with Grave disease. This may resolve within a few weeks or persist for four to six months.

**Thyroid Storm**

A thyroid storm is a life-threatening complication that can occur when hyperthyroidism is uncontrolled and is a manifestation of the most decompensated state of disease. In addition to uncontrolled hyperthyroidism, there is usually a precipitating event before a thyroid storm. These events can include labor, cesarean section, preeclampsia, trauma, or an infection.

On initial presentation, fetal distress may be noted. As the mother receives treatment, the fetal status may improve. Delivery should be avoided if possible since both labor or cesarean section can worsen thyroid storm.

**Postpartum Thyroiditis**

Postpartum thyroiditis (PPT) is a condition that typically occurs within six weeks of delivery but may happen up to one year postpartum due to immune rebound after normal immunosuppression of pregnancy.
