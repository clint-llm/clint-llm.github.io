The injection of intravenous contrast typically occurs through peripherally inserted IV catheters. Larger catheters in larger veins allow a faster rate of administration and larger volumes of contrast to be delivered. The most common site for placement of the IV catheter is the antecubital fossa. This location tolerates sizes adequate for the use of power injectors. Power injectors are machines often built into or controlled by the CT scanner that injects the contrast at a preselected rate, length of time, and volume to meet needed imaging requirements for the desired clinical question. The utilization of power injectors depends on the gauge of the catheter and the flow limits. More distal IV locations often do not tolerate 14 to 20 gauge needles and, if utilized, see a higher rate of contrast extravasation and associated complications.

As inÂ contrast injection, the timing of image acquisition can be hand-selected by a technologist.

The homogenous distal venous opacification is much more variable than central arterial opacification because more patient factors come into play. Most studies take place at a set time interval after contrast administration. An alternative method that has lower variability sets at trigger once a targeted area enhances beyond the selected threshold and then starts the imaging.

For pathology in the upper extremity, contrast should be injected in the contralateral side to prevent confounding venous enhancement or streak artifact.
