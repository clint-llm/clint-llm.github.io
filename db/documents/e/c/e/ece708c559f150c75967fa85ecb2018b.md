**External Beam Radiation Therapy**

This can be useful for the control of primary and metastatic disease at a variety of sites. Based on data from smaller studies, these treatments can result in symptom relief and debulking of disease.

**Systemic Chemotherapy**

This can be considered in patients with extensive metastatic disease and those with unresectable disease. Studies reporting on treatment outcomes with chemotherapy in the setting of metastatic pheochromocytoma utilized regimens involving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, dacarbazine, and vincristine.

**Radionuclide Therapy**

MIBG: This treatment can only be considered for tumors that can take up MIBG (meta-iodobenzylguanidine) and utilized in unresectable diseases or cases with high tumor burden. MIBG scintigraphy can be used for the localization of catecholamine-secreting tissues because of its structural similarity with noradrenaline.

**Novel Therapies**

A significant new development in the treatment of metastatic pheochromocytomas includes the utilization of agents that can inhibit angiogenesis and proliferative signaling in the tumor cells. Many such activities in tumor cells are mediated by the interaction of several growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factors [VEGF], platelet-derived growth factors [PDGF], and others) with tyrosine kinase receptors.

Sunitinib: This medication blocks VEGF1, VEGF2, VEGF3, PDGF-alpha, PDGF-beta, c-kit, fms-related tyrosine kinase 3, and RET protooncogene receptors and has the potential to reduce angiogenesis and cell growth.

Axitinib: This medication is an inhibitor of VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2). This is especially important in metastatic pheochromocytomas, which frequently exhibit a tumor environment of pseudohypoxia which stimulates the synthesis of VEGF by the tumor cells and results in enhanced angiogenesis.

**Other Investigational Targeted Therapies**

Other therapies currently undergoing investigation include cabozantinib (VEGFR2 and c-MET receptor inhibitor) and hypoxia-inducible factor 2 alpha (HIF2A) inhibitors.
