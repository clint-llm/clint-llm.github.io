The rare clinical manifestation of Popliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome (PAES) was defined approximately 40 years ago. It has a preference for young to middle-aged patients. The hallmark of this disease is a vascular compromise within the popliteal fossa resulting in an insidious, progressive course of exercise intolerance and calf pain with exertion relieved by rest (claudication). While the incidence of this disease has risen slightly in recent years, the true prevalence is unknown as the number of cases is likely underreported. This activity describes the evaluation, and treatment of PAES, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most common age group to be affected by popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.
- Describe the most common clinical presentation of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.
- Summarize the treatments available for popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.
- Outline the medical management and education options the interprofessional team should provide to a patient with popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.
