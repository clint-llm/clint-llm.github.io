The array of laboratory testing and imaging that may be pertinent in the evaluation of anemia include:

- Complete blood count (CBC):

- Includes hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).

- Reticulocyte count:

- Serves as an estimate of bone marrow red blood cell output.

- Iron profile:

- Includes serum iron, ferritin and total iron-binding content (TIBC).

- Peripheral blood smear:

- Microscopic evaluation of red blood cell morphology.

- Serum creatinine:

- Serves to assist in the evaluation of renal function.

- Thyroid function tests:

- Includes thyroxine (T4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone level (TSH).

- Coagulation screen:

-  Includes activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT/INR), and thrombin time (TT).

- Liver function tests (LFT):

- LFT panels may vary but should include calcium, transaminases, total protein, bilirubin, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase.
- Additional tests that may provide information about the liver function include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), 5'- nucleotidase.

- Hemolysis profile:

- The profile contains haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and indirect bilirubin.

- Macrocytosis profile:

- The profile contains vitamin B-12, folate, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine.

- Hemoglobin electrophoresis:

- Evaluates the hemoglobin amino acid chains.

- Abdominal sonogram:

- Evaluates the size of the spleen size

- Bone marrow analysis:

- Hematology consult is required to obtain this.
