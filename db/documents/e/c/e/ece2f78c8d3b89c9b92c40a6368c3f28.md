The basis for differential diagnosis is on the main laboratory characteristic of CVID: hypogammaglobulinemia.

Hypogammaglobulinemia can be primary or secondary. The primary causes are more common in children.

- Secondary hypogammaglobulinemia can be due to decreased production (drugs, disorders that cause bone marrow suppression, Goodpasture syndrome, malignancy) or increased loss (protein-losing disorders such as enteropathies, nephrotic syndrome, burns).

- Primary hypogammaglobulinemia can be due to deficiency in IgG1 and IgG2, hyper-immunoglobulin M syndromes, and other combined immunodeficiencies.
