There are several physiological anomalies of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle and tendon that have been described in the literature and typically occur in the palm.

These variations may include those involving muscle belly itself, the presence of additional accessory tendons, duplicate tendons, and variant tendon-tendon anastomoses.

The literature has classified the anatomical variations of the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle and tendon as followed

- Type I: A small muscle attached to the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon proximally and index finger distally. During digital flexion, this muscle invades the carpal tunnel and could cause intermittent symptoms related to median nerve compression.

- Type II: A small muscle arising from the flexor retinaculum is attached to the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon in the distal palm.

- Type III: An additional digastric muscle inserted on the base of the middle phalanx of the index finger, passes under the carpal tunnel, with an apparent proximal path.

- Type IV: The flexor digitorum superficialis muscle belly that corresponds to the index finger and extends into the carpal tunnel, that can cause similar symptoms as type I.

- Type V: A small muscle crossing the median nerve anteriorly attached to the flexor digitorum superficialis muscle of the middle finger by a tendon and deep surface of the transverse carpus ligament. The anomaly was found about 8 cm proximal to the wrist fold and was unlikely to be clinically significant.

Studies have demonstrated the absence of flexor digitorum superficialis muscle or tendon components as variations that may be clinically relevant. In particular, the congenital absence of the flexor digitorum superficialis component that corresponds to the little finger may cause difficulty with determining normal function during the examination of a finger laceration.
