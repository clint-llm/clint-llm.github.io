Pure-tone evaluation is typically performed in a sound-treated booth to reduce the impact of external sounds, with the booth environment and electroacoustic equipment calibrated to American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards to optimize inter-test and intra-test reliability. Audiometers generate the sounds presented for testing, controlling the pitch, loudness, transducer type, and ear of presentation.

Various transducers may be used depending on the auditory pathway being assessed and the anatomical limitations of the ears. Standard electroacoustic transducers for pure-tone audiometry are supra-aural headphones, insert earphones, circumaural headphones, and bone conduction oscillators.

Regardless of the method of presenting the tones, patient responses are typically given with a button, a hand raise, or a verbal acknowledgment, with adaptations made for children unable to give a deliberate response with reliability.

Pure-tone screenings, such as in schools or inpatient hospital environments, are performed with calibrated portable audiometers that may test air and bone conduction or air conduction only, depending on the model.
