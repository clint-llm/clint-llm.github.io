Few studies have compared the gold standard ultrasonography with clinical examination to detect non-cephalic presentation in the third trimester of pregnancy. These investigators found that abdominal palpation fails to detect a significant percentage of mal-presenting fetuses.

Clinical examination was relatively sensitive in multiparous women and those with lower body mass indices. The specificity of clinical examination increased significantly as gestational age increased, and body mass index decreased. When abdominal palpation was evaluated as a screening tool for identifying malpresentation, it was found that false-positive diagnoses were a more frequent error because of the low prevalence of malpresentation in low-risk populations.

Leopold maneuvers have been reported to be difficult in obese pregnant women and pregnancies complicated with polyhydramnios, fibroids, or anterior placental location. In clinical practice, the use of repeated procedures by a second examiner, pelvic examination, and rescheduling a return visit with a sequential abdominal examination can serve to improve the accuracy of abdominal palpation findings.

Leopold maneuvers can help mothers to perceive and visualize fetuses. Thus abdominal palpations can develop the maternal-fetal relationship, which plays an important role in a child's psychological, cognitive, and social development.
