**Diagnostic Indications**

Hemoptysis, chronic unexplained cough, stridor, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, nodal staging of lung cancer, pulmonary infiltrates, pneumonia, atelectasis, suspected tracheomalacia, tracheoesophageal fistula, and post lung transplant surveillance.

**Therapeutic Indications**

Foreign body retrieval, tracheal and bronchial stent placement balloon dilatation of airway stenosis, ablation or debulking of endobronchial tumors, management of persistent air leak or bronchopleural fistula, difficult intubations, bronchoscopic lung volume reduction surgery, bronchial thermoplasty for asthma, whole lung lavage, and as an adjunct during percutaneous tracheotomy.

**Diseases for Which Bronchoscopy Is Not the Optimal Diagnostic or Therapeutic Tool**

There are diseases in which bronchoscopy is commonly done, however, the diagnostic and therapeutic yield is poor. Deshwal et al have grouped these into the following categories

1. Infectious causes:

- Cystic fibrosis

- Smear negative pulmonary tuberculosis

2. Hemoptysis

3. Radiological findings

- Atelectasis in a patient on mechanical ventilation

- fibrosing mediastinitis

- Pleural effusion

4. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy from the following causes

- Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis

- Stage 1 Sarcoidosis

- Congestive lymphadenopathy

- Calcified lymphadenopathy

- Lymphoma

- COPD exacerbation and lymphadenopathy
