The goal of treating acute cholangitis is managing both the biliary infection and the obstruction. The mainstay of treatment is antibiotic therapy directed towards enteric pathogens and biliary drainage. Acute emergency management entails assessing ABC (airway, breathing, circulation), cardiac monitoring and pulse oximetry, obtaining intravenous access, providing aggressive fluid and electrolyte replacement as appropriate, and supportive care. Initiation of early intravenous antibiotics known to achieve high biliary concentrations such as fluoroquinolones, extended-spectrum penicillins, carbapenems, and aminoglycosides is required. In more severe cases, adequate hemodynamic support, including vasopressors, may be needed. Hospitalization is necessary for cases of acute cholangitis, with mild to moderate cases managed in the general medical units, while those with severe disease and signs of sepsis and hemodynamic instability to be admitted to intensive care units.

In mild cases, the majority of patients respond to medical therapy. Those who do not respond to medical therapy require immediate decompression.
