Duret hemorrhage is attributable to descending transtentorial herniation from any cause. Herniation syndromes occur secondary to elevations in intracranial pressure leading to intracranial compartmental shifts.Â  Duret hemorrhage is reported most frequently with increases in intracranial pressure from diverse etiologies, including subdural, epidural, intraparenchymal hemorrhages, trauma, brain neoplasms, acute diffuse cerebral edema, hyponatremia and rarely following administration of thrombolytics.
