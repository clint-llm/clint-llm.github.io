AVN of the femoral head results from disruption of the vascular supply to the bone. Potential causes of AVN of the femoral head include causes that are clearly known such as when direct trauma has occurred, and in instances where the inciting event is unknown and only can be associated with risk factors that predispose to the disease process. Below are risk factors associated with the development of AVN of the femoral head.

**Risk Factors**

- Irradiation

- Trauma

- Hematologic disease (leukemia, lymphoma)

- Dysbaric (Caisson disease)

- Marrow-replacing diseases (Gaucher disease)

- Sickle cell disease

- Alcoholism

- Hypercoagulable states

- Steroids

- Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)

- Transplant patient

- Viral (CMV, hepatitis, HIV, rubella, rubeola, varicella)

- Protease inhibitors

- Pancreatitis

- Vascular insult

- Subacute bacterial endocarditis

- Polyarteritis nodosa

- Rheumatoid Arthritis

- Giant cell arteritis

- Sarcoidosis

- Idiopathic

Previous associations have linked AVN of the femoral head to inherited coagulopathies and genetic polymorphisms that are potentially treatable pathophysiologic conditions. It is believed that AVN of the femoral head is a multifactorial disease associated in some cases with a genetic predisposition and an exposure to one or more risk factors.
