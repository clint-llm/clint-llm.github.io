The discovery of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (PDE5 inhibitors) for causing the erection of the penis was accidental, noticed as a side effect while being administered to investigate their ability to treat hypertension and angina. Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors (PDE5Is) are now widely used in the management of erectile dysfunction. This activity illustrates the indications, mechanism of action, administration, adverse drug reactions, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of PDE5 inhibitors. This activity also demonstrates the importance of an interprofessional team in the treatment of patients with erectile dysfunction, high altitude illness, lower urinary tract symptoms, angina, or pulmonary hypertension, using PDE5 inhibitors (i.e., sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil, etc.)

**Objectives:**
- Identify FDA-approved indications for the administration of PDE5 inhibitors.
- Describe the contraindications of PDE5 inhibitors.
- Summarize the mechanism of action of PDE5 inhibitors.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the use of PDE5 inhibitors and improve outcomes.
