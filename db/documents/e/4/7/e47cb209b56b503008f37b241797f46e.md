The incidence of neural tube defects is ranging from 1.0 to 10.0 per 1,000 births worldwide. The prevalence of neural tube defects in the USA and many European countries is around 0.5 to 0.8 per 1000 births, and recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies is up to 5%. The prevalence of neural tube defects has variable rates among different geography, ethnicity, gender, and countries. Prevalence is higher among Whites as compared to Blacks and females as compared to males. The risk of neural tube defects for some ethnic/racial groups (e.g., Irish and Mexican) is higher than others (e.g., White and Asian).
