These can include aseptic/chemical meningitis, myelosuppression secondary to intraventricular chemotherapy, catheter-related infections, intraventricular catheter malpositioning, unidirectional catheter obstruction, leukoencephalopathy, Ommaya reservoir exposure, and chemotherapy-related myelopathy.
