Since its advent, balloon sinuplasty has become an intensely debated topic within the realm of otolaryngology. Proponents of this minimally invasive procedure note its ease of use, safety profile, cost, efficacy, and reimbursement as reasons for attempting to broaden its surgical indications. Physicians who lean away from BSP, in comparison to FESS, will list similar reasons as to why it needs to be utilized less in the field. With that in mind, the authors of this study wanted to touch on revision rates, complications, and cost-effectiveness of this procedure.

The CLEAR study(s) by Bolger et al. and Weiss et al., were considered the initial landmark papers for postoperative complications and efficacy.

Another landmark trial in the literature, termed The BREATHE 1 study, by Stankewitz et al., performed only balloon sinuplasty on 58 maxillary ostia with the Entellus FinESS system. They utilized CT imaging of the sinuses to look at patency rates with this new system. They found that at the three month follow up appointments, 95.8% of the ballooned maxillary sinus ostia were patent via CT imaging.

A more recent study focused on 2851 CRS patients who underwent BSP-only surgery compared with both hybrid procedures as well as FESS alone. The overall complication rate six months after surgery for BSP and FESS was 5.26% vs. 7.35%, respectively. The complications rate breakdown can be seen in the above section entitled “Complications”. In regards to revision rates, this study reported that 7.89% of BSP only patients underwent revision compared with FESS (16.85%) and hybrid (15.15%). It was noted that revisions of balloon only cases were almost exclusively done by FESS.

Koskinen et al. focused on comparing BSP and FESS in regards to the duration of sick leave and post-operative adhesions. They found a significant difference between the median amount of sick leave in the BSP treated patients (4 days) vs. the FESS treated patients (14 days), although they noted that “sick leave” was the estimate of recovery time made by the surgeon.

Adhesions or synechiae within the nasal cavity have been documented post-operatively after FESS procedures, but minimal literature has noted formation after BSP. In one study, which compared SNOT-22 scores and rhinometry in uncinectomy only vs. BSP, three out of thirty BSP patients developed synechia postoperatively compared to 12 of 32 in the uncinectomy group.

The authors do note the possibility of publication bias in the literature. Four of the larger studies listed in this project were sponsored by either Acclarent or Entellus, the two main manufacturers of BSP devices. We hope that with the recent increases in BSP only procedures, more data can be used to study the efficacy of balloon sinuplasty better and allow us to reach a consensus on clinical indications for the procedure. The authors note some discrepancies within the literature concerning complications, especially in regards to skull base injury, and hope that more focus can be placed on reporting any suspected BSP related complications. It is the authors’ opinion that BSP can provide symptomatic improvement, without major complications, in the correctly selected patient population. Although there is some conflict in regards to its indications and clinical use, with its mucosal tissue sparing properties, it can serve as a great tool in the arsenal of otolaryngologists for patients suffering from chronic sinus disease.
