Taste may be affected in many clinical conditions, such as upper respiratory and middle ear infections since the facial nerve passes through the middle ear along its course to the central nervous system. Bell palsy can often present with taste disturbance as well. Radiation therapy is also a common etiology of taste disturbances, designated post-irradiation gustatory dysfunction.
