Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins; therefore, it is no surprise that collagen is comprised of amino

X can be any of the other 17 amino acids, and every third amino acid is glycine.

Collagen is composed of 3 chains. The chains are wound together to form a triple helix. Since glycine is the smallest of all the amino acids, it allows the chain to form a tight configuration, and and it can withstand stress.

The process of collagen synthesis occurs mainly in the cells of fibroblasts which are specialized cells with the main function of synthesizing collagen and stroma. Collagen synthesis occurs both intracellularly and extracellularly. Although different types of collagen may undergo different post-translational modifications, the basic outline for collagen synthesis is listed below.
