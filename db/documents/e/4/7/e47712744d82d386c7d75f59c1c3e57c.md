Hysterectomy is a common gynecological surgical procedure. When clamping uterine arteries, particular attention must be paid not to damage ureters given their close anatomical relationship. Uterine arteries travel in the lateral to the medial direction at the level of the cervix. Ureters lie 1.5Â to 3 cm away from the uterine wall, so attention must be paid to the level where the uterine arteries meet the uterus. At this intersection of the uterine arteries and ureters, ureters lie under the arteries, so attention must be paid not to damage the ureters when clamping the arteries.
