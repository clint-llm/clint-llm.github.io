Primary physicians and other health professionals should help patients reduce their risk of thrombosis by providing accurate information on prevention and treatment. Both venous and arterial thrombosis share similar risk factors, and efforts should be made to educate and encourage patients to make healthy lifestyle choices. For example, chronic smokers should be encouraged to quit smoking. Those who are morbidly obese should be encouraged to change their diet and lifestyle accordingly.  Patients with metabolic syndrome or uncontrolled blood pressure should receive education on the importance of lifestyle modification and, when indicated, secondary prevention with medical management.

Patients admitted to the hospital are also at higher risk of thrombosis. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) in 2018 recommended prophylaxis in patients admitted to hospital settings. Patients who do not get prophylaxis like unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or mechanical prophylaxis are at high risk of developing thrombosis. Therefore, care is necessary when managing patients admitted to the hospital, and daily reassessment of the risk of thrombosis is recommended in these settings.
