As optic atrophy is not a disease but a sign of some other condition, it requires interprofessional communication and a multi-disciplinary approach to this problem. The disease outcome can be enhanced by interacting with physicians to manage conditions such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis and with surgeons when dealing with tumors and space-occupying lesions. Dieticians have to be involved in cases of nutritional anomalies. Optometrists have to play a role in providing visual care and rehabilitation. Similarly, the role of nurses in patient care when individuals have bilateral visual loss or have restricted activities from systemic disease is also of prime importance. Occupational rehabilitation involves employers and social service providers. Overall, efforts should be made to improve the quality of life of the affected individuals.
