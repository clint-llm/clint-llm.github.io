Pathophysiology associated with ACTH can stem from 3 different mechanisms. Issues can be with the pituitary, adrenals, or ectopic secretion.

The pituitary can be hypofunctioning or hyperfunctioning, leading to either a decrease or increase, respectively, in ACTH. Pituitary insufficiency is usually the result of an adenoma that destroys the gland. It can also be caused by pituitary apoplexy, a sudden hemorrhage into a pituitary tumor causing sudden loss of ACTH. Sheehan syndrome is a less common cause of pituitary insufficiency. It is a pituitary infarct after massive blood loss during childbirth.

The adrenal can also be hypofunctioning or hyperfunctioning. Diseases associated with the adrenals include Addison and Cushing.

Ectopic secretion refers to the production of a hormone outside of its normal physiology mechanism. Benign or malignant tumors secrete hormones. Normal feedback loop mechanisms do not control the production of the hormone. Cushing syndrome is associated with ectopic ACTH production.
