The best evidence for the management of plantar fibromatosis is limited to case series, mainly owing to the rare nature of the disorder.

Conservative treatment should be the first line of treatment. Steroid injections and radiotherapy have shown good clinical results, but the benefits compared to side effects are not fully known. Shockwave therapy shows promising results, but further studies are needed to look at outcomes and potential complications. Local excision shows the highest recurrence rate and should be avoided. Subtotal fasciectomy and wide excision should be the only surgical treatment considered for highly symptomatic primary and recurrent lesions.
