Warfarin is an oral medication administered once daily. Patients can take the drug at any time of day, but dosing recommendations are usually for the afternoon or evening. By taking warfarin later in the day, healthcare providers have the opportunity to individualize the dose based on a patient's current international normalized ratio (INR). An INR provides a standardized measurement of the prothrombin time (PT), reflecting how quickly a patient's blood clots via the extrinsic and common clotting pathways. The INR allows for the standardization of specific laboratory variances in the measurement of the PT. A healthy patient who is not taking warfarin should have an INR of approximately 1.0. Most patients have a goal INR of 2.0 to 3.0, but some indications, such as a mechanical mitral heart valve, require an INR goal of 2.5 to 3.5.

If a patient misses a dose, the individual should take the dose as soon as possible on the same day, but the patient should never double a dose the next day to make up for a missed dose. Regarding potential drug-drug interactions, changing the administration time of warfarin does not typically avoid an interaction except in the cases of patients taking a medication that affects warfarin absorption, such as bile acid sequestrants and sucralfate.
