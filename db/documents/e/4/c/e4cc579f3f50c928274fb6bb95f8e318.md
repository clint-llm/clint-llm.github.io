Liver biochemical tests usually demonstrate a cholestatic pattern, with an elevation of the serum alkaline phosphatase being a characteristic finding. The elevation of transaminases (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase) is modest at 2 to 3 times the upper limit of normal. Bilirubin and albumin levels may be normal at the time of diagnosis but become increasingly abnormal as the disease progresses. Elevated serum bilirubin levels suggest the possibility of more advanced disease, dominant biliary strictures, or cirrhosis.

Atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies are positive in about 26% to 94% of patients with PSC, although they are not specific for the disease. Elevated concentrations of total immunoglobulins (IgM in 50%) may be seen. Positive antinuclear antibodies and smooth muscle antibodies should alert clinicians to the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis-related PSC or overlap syndromes. Immunoglobulin subsets elevation (IgG4 in 10%) may also be seen. Serum IgG4 elevations are not specific to IgG4-related diseases. Serum IgG4 levels of more than four times the upper limit of normal and/or IgG4:IgG1 ratio of more than 0.24 strongly suggests IgG4-associated PSC.

Imaging, usually with ultrasound or computed tomography, may be performed in the patient with persistent cholestatic liver tests to exclude biliary obstruction. The diagnosis of PSC is typically made with the demonstration of characteristic multiple and focal areas of stricturing and dilation of intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts on cholangiography. A cholangiogram may be obtained using magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC). MRCP is usually the first test of choice. Because ERCP is an invasive procedure, and the diagnostic accuracy of MRCP is comparable to ERCP, MRCP is preferred over ERCP. PTC is reserved for patients who are not able to undergo MRCP, for example, those with implanted metal devices) or ERCP.

A liver biopsy is usually not needed for diagnosis unless overlap with autoimmune hepatitis or a small-duct PSC is suspected. Noninvasive diagnostic tools that assess fibrosis, like magnetic resonance elastography and transient elastography of the liver, are promising. Still, their specific role in evaluating the degree of liver fibrosis in patients with PSC is unclear.

Diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of PSC include:

- An increased serum alkaline phosphatase level that persists for more than six months

- Cholangiographic findings of bile-duct strictures detected using either MRCP or ERCP

- Exclusion of causes of secondary sclerosing cholangitis

The key feature on histology is periductal or onion skin fibrosis.
