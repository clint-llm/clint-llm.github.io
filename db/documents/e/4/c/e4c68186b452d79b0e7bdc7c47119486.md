When considering a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, the differential diagnosis should always include other personality disorders since overlap is common, especially within cluster B. Other diagnostic considerations include:

- Substance use disorder

- Non-suicidal self-injury disorder (a time-limited phenomenon in many patients)

- Bipolar disorder (5-times less prevalent, but co-morbidity approaches 15%)

- Autism spectrum disorder (patients with congenital deficits in theory of mind may also show severe mood dysregulation)
