Most often, RVT has an insidious onset, producing minimal to no symptoms, and is usually diagnosed incidentally during imaging for some other reason**.**Renal venography is the gold standard diagnostic test for RVT and has the additional advantage of a therapeutic procedure. However, it is rarely used in current practice due to the availability of lesser invasive tests. Renal ultrasonography(USG) is a safe, non-invasive test, though it is usually not sensitive enough to make a diagnosis of RVT. Renal USGÂ shows an enlarged kidney and hyper-echogenic kidney in approximately 90% of the patients in the early phase of acute RVT.

No specific laboratory studies are indicated for renal vein thrombosis (RVT), except those specific for the underlying etiology (e.g., for nephrotic syndrome or coexisting hypercoagulable state).
