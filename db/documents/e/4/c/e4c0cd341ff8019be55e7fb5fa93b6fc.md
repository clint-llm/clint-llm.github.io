Complete removal of the nodule and infected hair is the treatment for white piedra. The first-line antifungal regimen is topical 2% miconazole or 2% ketoconazole four times a day for two weeks. For patients that refuse to shave, the addition of 100 milligrams of oral itraconazole once a day for a course of three to four weeks has been effective. For patients allergic to azoles, 6% precipitated sulfur in white petrolatum or 2% selenium sulfide foam is the treatment of choice.

Although data is limited, voriconazole has been shown to be the most active drug against trichosporonosis and should be the first-line treatment for patients that are neutropenic and have disseminated disease. As a second line, one can use itraconazole and fluconazole; they have moderate susceptibility based on their elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations. Most experts recommend combination therapy consisting of amphotericin and voriconazole/5-flucytosine.

Another alternative is amphotericin B and should be used in unresponsive and resistant trichosporonosis along with voriconazole or micafungin. Lastly, it is important to remember that echinocandins have no effect when treating this fungal infection. Regardless of the antifungal options, a cure for invasive trichosporonosis depends on the duration of neutropenia and source control by surgical intervention.
