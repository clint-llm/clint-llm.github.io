Macrolide antibiotics have varying levels of cardiotoxicity. Erythromycin carries the most prominent risk of cardiotoxicity among the more commonly used macrolide antibiotics. It induces QT prolongation and increases the risk of the potentially deadly heart rhythm known as torsades de pointes. Careful monitoring of the QTc interval on the EKG is recommended to minimize risk. Clinicians should monitor potassium, magnesium, and calcium levels in high-risk patients. There is no known reversal agent for erythromycin.
