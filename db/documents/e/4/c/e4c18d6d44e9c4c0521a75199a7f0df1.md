An interprofessional team approach must be taken for this condition. This interprofessional healthcare team includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, and PAs), and nurses, coordinating their activities to achieve better patient outcomes.

Accurate diagnosis with an accurate evaluation of the extent of this disease must be concluded by all involved. The surgeon is the main specialist for diagnosis and treatment, but familiarity and a high degree of suspicion of this condition must be present by the initially treating primary caregiver or emergency physician. Delay in making an adequate diagnosis and treatment could lead to the progression of this condition with increased patient morbidity and mortality.
