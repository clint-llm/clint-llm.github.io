The most common etiology of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is idiopathic and without an identifiable cause. DCM can have a familial or genetic predisposition although these cases are usually classified under idiopathic if no clear genetic link is identified. DCM has been associated with mutations in genes for Desmin (cytoskeletal), Lamin C (nuclear membrane), or Myosin (contractile proteins). The secondary causes include infectious myocarditis (e.g., viral, Chagas disease, Lyme disease), ischemic disease, hypertension, medication-induced (e.g., Anthracyclines), alcohol abuse, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), peripartum cardiomyopathy, or infiltrative disease. Ischemic cardiomyopathy caused by coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cause of congestive heart failure. However, ischemic cardiomyopathy is classified as its own disease entity and is only described as a cause of DCM in occult disease in patients without known CAD. Stress cardiomyopathy, also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or Broken heart syndrome, is a relatively uncommon but increasingly reported cause. However, it is often classified as its own entity separate from primary DCM. It is characterized by transient ballooning of the left ventricular (LV) apex typically following a severe psychological or physiological stress that is believed to be secondary to intense catecholamine surge.
