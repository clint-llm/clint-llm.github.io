Arnold-Chiari or Chiari malformations describe a group of deformities of the posterior fossa and hindbrain, which includes the cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. These deformities lead to problems ranging from cerebellar tonsillar herniation through the foramen magnum to the absence of the cerebellum, with or without other associated intracranial or extracranial defects such as hydrocephalus, encephalocele, syrinx, or spinal dysraphism. This activity examines when this condition should be considered within a differential diagnosis and how to evaluate the patient for it properly. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the classification of Chiari malformations.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with a Chiari malformation.
- Outline the management options available for Chiari malformations.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with Chiari malformations.
