The indications of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube replacement are:

- Dislodged PEG tube: If the tube is dislodged within 24 hours, a temporary tube (e.g., Foley catheter) should be placed in the track to prevent track closure which starts occurring anytime between 8 to 24 hours and narrows further as time passes.

- Malfunctioning PEG tube

- Obstructed G-tube not responding to traditional unclogging measures(e.g flushing with water or pancreatic enzymes mixed with bicarbonate solution)
