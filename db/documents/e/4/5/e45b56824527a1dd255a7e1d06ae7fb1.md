CSX was previously thought to be a benign condition. Recent literature has associated females with anginal chest pain and no evidence of stenosis on imaging with adverse cardiovascular events. Such occurrences include MI, stroke, cardiac death, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for heart failure.

CSX further causes a prominent decline in a patient's quality of life and difficulties in daily activities. The diagnosis of CSX is one of exclusion which further prompts extensive workup and assessment that can be costly and time-consuming. The challenge of achieving therapeutic efficacy from pharmacotherapy also poses additional barriers as traditional therapy for managing anginal chest pain is often unsuccessful. This often prolongs CSX symptoms, prompts hospital admissions, restraining daily activities, and inability to attend work.

Although the prognosis of CSX is exemplary, the high prevalence rate results in periodic hospitalization from recurring episodes of chest pain. Clinical manifestations are reported to reduce in roughly 30% of patients and progressively worsen in 10 to 20%. Patients who suffer from a deteriorating disease course often face diagnostic challenges and procedures, potentially causing disability.
