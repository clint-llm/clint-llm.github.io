CAPD can be a difficult condition to diagnose, given that its etiology is so broad. Generally, CAPD is linked to a specific lesion or disorder, or the cause may be unknown.

There are several leading causes and risk factors for CAPD.

- Degeneration of the CANS

- Most commonly due to age-related changes

- Genetics

- Neurological disease or damage

- Cerebrovascular disorder - e.g., stroke
- Brain injury or damage - e.g., meningitis or head trauma
- Neurodegenerative disorders - e.g., multiple sclerosis
- Lesions or tumors of the central nervous system (CNS)
- Epilepsy
- Neurotoxins - e.g., heavy metals

- Otological disease - e.g., auditory deprivation as a result of chronic otitis media

- Developmental delay

- Prenatal/neonatal risk factors

- Anoxia
- Hypoxia
- Prematurity
- Drug exposure
- Hyperbilirubinemia
- Cytomegalovirus
