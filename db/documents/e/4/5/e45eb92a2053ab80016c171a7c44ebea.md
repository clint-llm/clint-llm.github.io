It is vital to ensure that catheter patency is maintained via an infusion through the catheter at 1 to 3 mL/hour, with or without the use of a pressurized bag system. The infusate fluids commonly used are normal saline or normal saline with 1 to 2 units/mL of heparin. Studies indicate that using a heparinized solution does not reduce the risk of catheter thrombosis.

There have been previous reports of hyperglycemia secondary to the infusion of glucose-containing fluids through the arterial lines. In addition, limb ischemia and skin and tissue necrosis due to accidental infusion of medications through the arterial catheter have also been reported. Therefore, the arterial line should be clearly labeled to avoid these complications, and two nurses should thoroughly check the infusing fluids.

The perfusion distal to the catheter needs to be monitored by nursing staff, and the catheter should be removed if any concerns for ongoing impairment in perfusion arise.
