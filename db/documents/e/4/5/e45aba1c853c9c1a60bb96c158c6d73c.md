Enalaprilat injection is usedÂ in the management of hypertension when oral therapy is not practical.

While considering enalaprilat injection, clinicians should pay attention to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor drug, captopril, is reported to cause agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with collagen vascular disease or renal impairment, and that available data are not sufficient to conclude if enalaprilat injection does have a similar risk. In considering the administration of enalaprilat injection, healthcare providers should note that ACE inhibitors affect blood pressure less in African American patients than in other races in controlled clinical trials. In addition, it should be taken into account that African American patients receiving ACE inhibitor medicines have been reported to have higher chances of angioedema than other patients.
