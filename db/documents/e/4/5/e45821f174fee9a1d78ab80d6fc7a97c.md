Menarche is a female’s first menstrual cycle, marked by her first episode of menstrual bleeding. Menarche occurs during puberty, preceded by breast growth, axillary and pubic hair growth, and a growth spurt. At the initiation of each menstrual cycle, a number of primordial follicles in the female’s ovaries continue development. One becomes the dominant follicle and continues to grow while the other follicles become atretic and cease to develop. The dominant follicle develops into a Graafian follicle, at which point meiosis I has completed, and the ovum is no longer in prophase I arrest.
