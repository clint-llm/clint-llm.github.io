Some causes or conditions have been reported in connection with pulmonary papillomas in the literature:

- Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has a key role in squamous cell papilloma. Serotypes 6 and 11 are frequently reported in simple papillomas while subtypes 16, 18 and 31 play a key role in the malignant transformation. Malignant transformation is very rare. It occurs in squamous cell papilloma, and TP53 mutations have been frequently implicated.

- Smoking has been implicated in squamous cell papilloma without real proof of its etiological role.

- Rare conditions have been described and consist of mainly abscesses and eventually bronchiectasis, which may enhance the development of squamous cell papillomas.
