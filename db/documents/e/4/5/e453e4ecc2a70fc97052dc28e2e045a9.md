Osteomalacia is a preventable metabolic bone disorder. As most cases are related to vitamin D deficiency, it can usually be treated appropriately and be cured. If other clinical factors have contributed to the development of osteomalacia, then treatment will need to be tailored and adjusted as necessary.

Once identified and an appropriate treatment plan is in place, lab values may begin to normalize within weeks of initiation. Symptom improvement is also appreciable in a similar period. Patients require interval lab monitoring after starting therapy. Overall, healing of osteomalacia may take many months to a year, depending on the cause.
