Infection is the most common known complication of congenital pulmonary airway malformation and usually occurs in the first few years of the lives of asymptomatic infants, especially if surgical resection does not take place. The most commonly known malignant complication associated with CPAM is pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB). The risk factors for developing PPB include having type 4 CPAM, having multifocal or bilateral cystic lesions, having a family history of PPB, and having a pneumothorax. An association exists between CPAM type 1 and bronchoalveolar carcinoma. There is also a risk of pulmonary hypoplasia leading to subsequent pulmonary hypertension, with type 3 CPAM as the lesion can occupy an entire lobe or entire lung.
