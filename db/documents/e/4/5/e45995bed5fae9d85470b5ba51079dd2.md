In trauma and other rare instances, the extensor hallucis longus tendon can be ruptured or damaged. In the event of a rupture or significant damage, the patient can present with a dropped hallux and loss of dorsiflexion, which can affect gait; this can be repaired surgically by the transfer of theÂ first slip of the extensor digitorum longus and extensor hallucis brevis to the damaged extensor hallucis longus.

The anterior compartment of the leg is also the most common site for acute compartment syndrome.
