Since candida is a normal oral flora that proliferates in immunocompromised states of health, one way of decreasing the risk of esophageal candidiasis is to improve health conditions that can cause immunosuppression. Decreasing the use of antibiotics, systemic steroids, and the proper use of inhaled steroids can also be used to limit the risk of esophageal candidiasis. Prophylactic fluconazole may be necessary for patients that have recurrent infections.
