Once a patient is on PSV, the nurse will monitor vital signs with attention to respiratory rate and pulse oximetry, telemetry with attention to arrhythmia and tachycardia, and the patient's comfort with the ventilator setting. Continuous monitoring by a member of the healthcare team is necessary during the first 5 to 10 minutes of starting PSV. Signs of respiratory distress, hypoxemia, and tachyarrhythmias are indicators that the patient is not tolerating PSV, and the nurse should contact the physician immediately. In addition, the bedside nurse should alert the respiratory therapist in the case of ventilator alarms sounding.
