Hot flashes are most commonly associated with perimenopause and menopause. In any woman presenting with hot flashes, whether she is perimenopausal age or status-post surgical or medically induced menopause, pathology must be ruled out as the cause. Menopause can be confirmed by the cessation of menses for at least 12 months and estradiol and FSH levels.
