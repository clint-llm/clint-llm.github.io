The entirety of a cell’s DNA is called its genome. During cell division, the whole genome is replicated exactly and distributed to 2 daughter cells. A human cell typically has about 2 meters of DNA. Due to the enormous length, the DNA must be highly condensed to fit into the nucleus of each cell. The highly condensed packages of DNA are termed chromosomes when the cell has completed the synthesis phase and is ready to undergo mitosis. Various proteins aid the DNA in folding compactly into subunits of nucleosomes and chromatin. Human somatic cells have 2 sets of 23 chromosomes for a total of 46 chromosomes - 22 sets of autosomes and 1 set of sex chromosomes. A single set of chromsomes is inherited from each parent.
