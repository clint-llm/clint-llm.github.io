Live vaccines are most effective than killed vaccines because they retain more antigens of the microbes. However, toxoids, including those that cause tetanus and diphtheria, are the most effective bacterial vaccines because their effect is based on inactivated exotoxins that stimulate strong antibody production. Subunit vaccines, including hepatitis B, meningococcal, and Hemophilus influenzae B vaccines, are effective when conjugated to carrier proteins such as tetanus toxoid. Vaccinologists produce subunit vaccines either by recombinant DNA technology or by antigen purification from different bacterial strains.

Vaccines contain one or various immunogens (peptides), which antigen-presenting cells can engulf, process, and present along with MCH antigens to CD4+ T cells. These lymphocytes can synthesize cytokines that activate humoral and cellular responses, including antibody production, activation of CD8+ T cells, macrophage stimulation, and other functions.

B cells can recognize vaccines made of carbohydrates and other compounds except for proteins. Subsequently, B lymphocytes can differentiate into plasma cells that produce specific antibodies to protect against infectious diseases caused by bacteria, including meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. This immune response against a non-peptidic antigen does not involve T-cell presentation, class switching, affinity maturation, or generation of memory T cells.

Using adjuvants enhances antibody synthesis and T-cell responses.
