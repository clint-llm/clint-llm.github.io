Evaluation with imaging forms the hallmark of diagnosis of the GLAD lesion and should be performed early when clinical suspicion is raised. Lesions may be more difficult to detect on non-contrast MRI or CT arthrography imaging, but the newer 3T MRI scanners may improve the pick-up rate without contrast.

The pathognomonic finding of the GLAD lesion is a superficial tear to the anterior-inferior labrum with an associated underlying glenoid cartilage defect. The cartilage defect may range from being superficial in depth to a trans-chondral defect exposing subchondral bone. This is demonstrated well on MRA, as contrast is observed tracking the labral tear and filling into the chondral defect or tracks under a damaged articular flap. It is described that the scan should ideally be performed with the shoulder in abduction and external rotation of patient mobility allows, as this significantly enhances both accuracy and sensitivity in detecting anterior labral tears of the shoulder.

This positioning is not necessarily standard for investigating the more common anterior-inferior labral tears and will likely reflect individual unit protocols and the index of suspicion pre-imaging.
