Due to morbidity associated with a sural nerve biopsy, all conservative diagnostic techniques must be exhausted before performing a biopsy. These include a thorough patient history and physical examination, electromyography, nerve conduction velocity, and others. Bevilacqua et al. recommended that once these methods are exhausted, a biopsy should be performed only if the condition meets three criteria

- There is evidence that the condition might be different than diabetic peripheral neuropathy

- The disease suspected causes histopathological changes in the nerve

- The biopsy results will change the treatment plan

As a valuable diagnostic tool for over 50 years, conditions possibly warranting a sural nerve biopsy include

- Vasculitic neuropathy as the diagnosis responds well to immunosuppressive agents.

- Neuropathy secondary to leprosy

- Chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy

- Hereditary sensory-motor neuropathy

- Acute and chronic axonopathy

- Demyelinating neuropathies
