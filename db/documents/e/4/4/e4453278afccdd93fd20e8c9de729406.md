A myriad of complications can arise secondary to pathologic fractures and their surgical management. From a surgical standpoint, failure of fixation or reconstruction can occur secondary to poor healing potential or local progression of the disease. Hardware can become infected, which requires long-term antibiotics and/or removal of hardware and revision depending on patient prognosis. Additionally, complications such as deconditioning or venous thromboembolism may arise secondary to poor mobility during the recovery period. There are five accepted modes of failure specific to endoprostheses, as described by Henderson et al. Type 1: soft tissue failure. Type 2: aseptic loosening. Type 3: structural failure. Type 4: periprosthetic infection. Type 5: tumor progression.
