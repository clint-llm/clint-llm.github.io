Healthcare workers including the primary care provider, emergency department clinician, orthopedic surgeon, nurse practitioner, and sports physician should be familiar with ankle splinting. The technique of splinting can be found throughout multiple fields of medicine including emergency medicine, orthopedics, primary care, and podiatry. It is primarily used to immobilize a joint or limb to allow for pain control, injury stabilization, and ultimately tissue healing. In the acute setting, splinting is useful as a temporizing treatment for sprains, strains, joint dislocations, and fractures. In the chronic setting, splinting is useful mainly for inflammatory or degenerative conditions. The main goal of ankle splinting is to prevent dorsiflexion and plantar flexion as well as inversion and eversion of the ankle joint. Specific conditions that call for ankle splinting include injuries to the distal tibia or fibula, ankle joint, or hindfoot.
