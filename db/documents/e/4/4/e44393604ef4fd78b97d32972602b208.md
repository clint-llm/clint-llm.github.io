Sternoclavicular joint injuries are uncommon injuries that involve the sternoclavicular joint and its associated ligaments. They can be traumatic or atraumatic. In traumatic injuries, the trauma often occurs in a motor vehicle accident or during contact or collision sports. A sprain of the joint can occur when no instability or laxity occurs. Posterior dislocations are less common than anterior and are associated with greater morbidity due to adjacent mediastinal and vascular structures. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of sternoclavicular joint injury and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Differentiate between subluxations and dislocations of the sternoclavicular joint.
- Explain the course of an evaluation for a patient presenting with an injury to the sternoclavicular joint, including any differentials.
- Review the treatment and management of various sternoclavicular injuries.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by injuries to the sternoclavicular joint.
