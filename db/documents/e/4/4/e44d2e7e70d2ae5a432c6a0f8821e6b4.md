The EWpg nucleus houses choline acetyltransferase-positive cell bodies responsible for the parasympathetic innervation of the eye.

In response to the signal from the EWpg, the postganglionic ciliary bodies relay the signal along their axons by way of the ciliary nerves towards the eye. This relay leads to the innervation of the sphincter pupillae (causing miosis) and ciliary muscles (ocular accommodation). The constriction of the pupil moderates the amount of light the retina is exposed to, which is the efferent limb of the pupillary light reflex. Additionally, the contraction of the ciliary muscles leads to the relaxation of the zonular fibers, allowing for increased convexity of the lens and, subsequently, an increase in refractive power and accommodation.

Since the discovery of the two cell populations of the EW nucleus, the function of the EWcp has been a subject of ongoing research. The EWcp is located medial and dorsal to the OCN in the midbrain and is comprised of a collection of peptidergic neuron cell bodies.
