Lab investigations are generally not required in establishing the diagnosis of diet-associated carotenemia. A good history and physical exam help narrow the differentials to tailor investigations. Laboratory investigation reveals elevated serum carotene levels, often in the range of 250 to 500 microgram/dl, with normal or slightly elevated liver enzymes. Measuring carotene levels in the skin could be facilitated by using reflection spectroscopy and Resonance Raman spectroscopy, both being noninvasive optical quantitative techniques for measuring carotenoid antioxidants in human skin in vivo. Plasma carotenoid status may be predicted by skin carotenoid status.

A skin biopsy specimen could reveal autofluorescence in the superficial layer and a pemphigus-like pattern of intracellular autofluorescence.

Vitamin-A level is normal except in the rare case of inherited enzyme deficiency where the level will be low.
