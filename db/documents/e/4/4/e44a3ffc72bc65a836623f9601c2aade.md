The biological effect of radiation on the tissues includes DNA damage, lipid peroxidation, and protein denaturation. The cellular consequences include cell death and dysfunction. In virtually all tissues that demonstrate late effects of radiation, there is a characteristic obliterative endarteritis. Current research into the etiology of delayed radiation injury has shown that the process of radiation injury begins during the time of radiation treatment and involves the elaboration of many bioactive substances, especially fibrogenic cytokines. TGF-beta is the most commonly studied cytokine associated with late effects of radiation as well as several other cytokines.

Acute/Subacute radiation patterns usually develop after 5000 centigray (cGy).

Occurs acutely (near immediate) and the result of cellular toxicity by free radical damage to cellular DNA.

Subacute injuries (2 to 3 months post radiation) usually involve the lung.

Delayed injuries occur more than 6 months to years after completion of radiation treatment. These are precipitated by further injuries in the previously irradiated field such as surgery or trauma. Delayed radiation injury often develops after 6500 centigray (cGy).
