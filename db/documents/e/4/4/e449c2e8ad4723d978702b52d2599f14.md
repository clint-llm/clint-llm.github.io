Perioperative suggestions to reduce delirium and brain dysfunction include:

- Avoiding medications that trigger deliria such as anticholinergic medications, benzodiazepines, and meperidine.

- Using light sedation whenever possible and safe

- Ensuring adequate pain control with regional techniques and non-opioid adjuncts

- Using multi-component bundles aimed at reducing delirium such as: 

- Attention to hydration and electrolytes
- Early mobility
- Restoring hearing aids and eyeglasses postoperatively

- Using dexmedetomidine for sedation in the postoperative period if sedation is required.

- Treating only those with hyperactive symptoms refractory to non-pharmacologic approaches
