Presbycusis is a diagnosis of exclusion.

- Noise exposure

- Infection

- Ménière disease

- Trauma

- Autoimmune disease

- Perilymph fistula

- Genetically-inherited hearing loss

- Otosclerosis

- Tumor

- Exposure to ototoxic agents

- Metabolic dysfunction

In addition to audiometry, further testing such as imaging or metabolic assessment can be considered if hearing loss does not follow classic presbycusis characteristics. Other conditions associated with presbycusis, such as diabetes, hypertension, renal impairment, and hyperlipidemia, should be evaluated.

If the pattern of hearing loss is conductive, then an alternative diagnosis to presbycusis should be considered. These include:

- Cerumen impaction

- Foreign body

- Tumor obstruction

- Infection

- Perforation

- Otosclerosis

- Cholesteatoma

Presbycusis should be considered in older adults presenting with changes in mood and cognition as these may be due to underlying hearing impairment.
