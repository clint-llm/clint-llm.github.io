Parvovirus B19 is a non-enveloped, icosahedral virus containing a single-stranded, linear DNA genome. This virus only infects humans. The virus is known to cause fifth disease, also known as erythema infectiosum or slapped cheek syndrome, which occurs mostly in young children but can occur in adults. It can also cause an aplastic crisis in those with certain anemias, hydrops fetalis in pregnant women, polyarthropathy, and papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome (PPGSS) in young adults. Transmission of the virus occurs through respiratory secretions and blood products. If a woman becomes pregnant and gets infected, the virus can be passed to her baby.
