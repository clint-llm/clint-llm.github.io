The skin's two main layers are the epidermis and the dermis. The epidermis comprises closely packed epithelial cells, and the dermis is composed of dense, irregular connective tissue where the blood vessels, hair follicles, sweat glands, and other structures are housed. The hypodermis lies beneath the dermis. Its composition is mostly loose connective and fatty tissues. Muscles, tendons, ligaments, bones, and cartilage are all under hypodermis.

The epidermis is composed of keratinized, stratified, squamous epithelium. The dermis contains blood, lymph vessels, nerves, and other structures, such as hair follicles and sweat glands.
