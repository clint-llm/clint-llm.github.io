Adverse effects of tolterodine are significantly lower than that of other antimuscarinic drugs indicated for the same use.

However, the following effects are still present:

- Dry mouth

- Dry eyes

- Constipation

- Headache

- Blurred vision

- Drowsiness

Elderly patients who use multiple medications are more at risk for adverse effects because of drug-to-drug interactions.

Considering more clinically relevant adverse effects, tolterodine has the potential to cause disturbances in the cardiac and central nervous systems. Because of muscarinic receptors in the heart, low doses of tolterodine can cause an increase in heart rate by acting on M1 and leading to tachycardia, palpitations, and cardiac rhythm disorders. Due to this potential adverse effect, the suggestion is that those with any heart-related problems use caution when taking this drug. In the central nervous system, all five subtypes of the muscarinic receptors are present, and because of the lipophilicity of tolterodine, it can cross the blood-brain barrier. This situation can give rise to CNS problems such as depression, cognitive impairment, confusion, or the most common effect, dizziness. Therefore, any patients with pre-existing neurological conditions should be cautious, and further advisement from their physician is strongly recommended.
