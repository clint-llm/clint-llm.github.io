As discussed above, pulsus paradoxus typically manifests in patients with pericardial disease,Â notably, cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis. Other cardiac causes include right ventricular infarction and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Additionally, non-cardiac disease states can also lead to pulsus paradoxus including pulmonary disease (severe COPD, asthma, tension pneumothorax, large bilateral pleural effusions, pulmonary embolism), as well as any cause of cardiac compression (iatrogenic during surgery, marked obesity, pectus excavatum).
