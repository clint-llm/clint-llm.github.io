Histologically, gastritis definitively demonstrates by the presence of at least grade 2 neutrophils or mononuclear cells in at least one gastric biopsy site or grade 1 neutrophils or mononuclear cells in at least two sites.H. pylori and not miss the diagnosis.

The first appearance of H. pylori infectionÂ in gastritis tends to be antral. The inflammation, composed mainly of mononuclear inflammatory cells and plasma cells, is superficial and mostly in the upper layers of the mucosa of the corpus (body of the stomach).

The chronic inflammation of gastric mucosa is associated with neutrophilic inflammation; the effects are dependent on the cytotoxicity of the H. pylori strain. The most cytotoxic strains will result in the development of atrophic gastritis. The lost mucosal glands in atrophic gastritis become replaced with new immature glandular and epithelial cells resembling glands of intestinal tissues.

In the early phases of autoimmune gastritis, lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration of oxyntic mucosa is present with accentuation in the deeper glandular portion. Hyperplasia of endocrine cells in gastric mucosa is an early feature in autoimmune gastritis. Oxyntic glands may undergo destruction, and parietal cells show pseudohypertrophy as the disease progress. In advanced disease, marked atrophy of the oxyntic glands and diffuse lymphoblastic infiltration of the lamina propria are present. Intestinal metaplasia is present in end-stage disease.
