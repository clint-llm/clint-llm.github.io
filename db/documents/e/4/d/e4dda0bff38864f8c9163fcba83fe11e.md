**Imaging Modalities**

There is a wide array of imaging modalities for evaluating the lumbar spine. The type of test depends on the pathology, the amount of radiation involved, contraindications, and any allergy to contrast. The American College of Radiology considers these and has recommendations on the kind of test based on symptoms. ACR appropriateness criteria can help to select the right imaging modality based on suspected pathology for symptoms such as suspected spine trauma, low back pain, low back pain with fever, etc.

**Plain Radiograph**

Radiographs are economical, portable, and readily available. They are the first-line modality for evaluating back pain. Radiographs can evaluate vertebral body height, displaced fractures, and dislocations. They help in assessing the stability of the spine with flexion and extension views. However, evaluation of nondisplaced fractures, metastases, and soft-tissue abnormalities are subject to limitations of overlying hardware, positioning, and bowel gas.Â The radiation dose from radiographs also limits their use in pregnant patients.
