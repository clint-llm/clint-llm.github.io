Naegleria fowleri, a member of the genus Percolozoa, is also known as the "brain-eating amoeba." It is a eukaryotic, free-living, amoeba named after Malcolm Fowler who described the initial cases of primary amebic encephalitis (PAM) caused by N. fowleri in Australia. N. fowleri is found in freshwater that is usually contaminated with soil. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of Naegleria, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with Naegleria. 
- Review the pathophysiology of Naegleria. 
- Summarize the treatment of Naegleria.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by Naegleria.
