The superficial facial musculature originates from the second arch mesenchyme, which migrates during development and forms a pre-muscular lamina. This pre-muscular laminae ultimately gives rise to the mandibular, temporal, infraorbital, and cervical laminae during the eighth week of embryogenesis. The platysma muscle originates from a part of the cervical lamina, which encloses the inferior portions of the parotid gland and cheek, while the SMAS derives from the superior portion.
