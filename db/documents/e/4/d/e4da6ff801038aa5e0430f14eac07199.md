Pityriasis rosea is an acute self-limiting papulosquamous disorder. It is characterized by a herald patch followed by scaly oval patches on the trunk and proximal extremities in a "Christmas-tree" appearance. Pityriasis rosea means rose-colored scale. Pityriasis rosea is also known as pityriasis circinata, roseola annulata, and herpes tonsurans maculosus. The skin eruption usually lasts 6-8 weeks and begins with a 'herald patch.'
