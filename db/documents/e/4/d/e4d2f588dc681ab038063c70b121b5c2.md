MVP can be asymptomatic and can also present with symptoms of atypical chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea on exertion, and exercise intolerance. Other symptoms, such as anxiety, low blood pressure, and syncope, suggest autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Occasionally, supraventricular arrhythmias are seen, suggesting an increased parasympathetic tone.

In MVP, the mid-systolic click is followed by a late systolic murmur. This finding is commonly heard at the apex. The murmur of MVP varies with position. The murmur is accentuated when the patient is standing and in the Valsalva maneuver (systolic click comes earlier, and the murmur is longer) and diminishes when the patient is squatting (systolic click comes later, and the murmur is shorter).

The murmur of MVP is similar to the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A mid-systolic click is a diagnostic of MVP. The handgrip maneuver increases the murmur of MVP and decreases the murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The handgrip maneuver also decreases the duration of the murmur and delays the timing of the mid-systolic click in MVP.

Over the years, it has been noted that patients with MVP do develop a range of autonomic symptoms that include:

- Panic attacks

- Anxiety

- Exercise intolerance

- Palpitations

- Fatigue

- Atypical chest discomfort

- Orthostasis

- Mood changes

- Syncope
