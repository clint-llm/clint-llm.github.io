The immediate complication of an advanced pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis could be severe hypoxemia and respiratory failure, which will ideally require intubation & mechanical ventilation. The severe hypoxemia is due to the extensive interstitial involvement with impairment of gas transfer. Complications are also attributable to the complications of underlying malignancy and also to the side effects of chemotherapeutic agents. An acute thrombotic pulmonary embolism aggravating the pre-existing respiratory failure is quite possible in such patients who are relatively immobile due to persistent dyspnoea with risks for deep vein thrombosis.

Also, an episode of lower respiratory infection could aggravate the dyspnoea & underlying respiratory failure. Though the vast majority of organ supports are going to be futile, in certain patients (e.g., with underlying COPD), the respiratory crisis might have been precipitated by a potentially reversible infection that needs administration of antimicrobials. Ventilator-associated complications, including barotrauma & infections, could develop if invasive ventilatory support is employed in such scenarios.

When the cause of respiratory failure (eg.pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis versus interstitial pneumonia) is undiagnosed at admission in a patient without underlying malignancy, then the complications could also result from attempts at definite diagnostic measures including transbronchial lung biopsy or open surgical biopsy.
