Patients should be educated not to wait to be seen by an ophthalmologist or optometrist if they are having changes in their vision. Vision loss from a retinal detachment can be permanent, and patients should be made aware of this. If patients receive a diagnosis of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, surgery will likely be necessary. ThoroughÂ education about the surgical process can help alleviate fears about having surgery. Educating patients may help improve compliance with the treatment and result in an optimal surgical outcome; this may be especially important following a pneumatic retinopexy, where they may have to remain in a face-down position so that the gas bubble can tamponade the retinal detachment effectively.
