Cowden syndrome is generally characterized by hamartomas that can involve any organ and have the potential for malignant transformation.

Multiple extra-mucocutaneous manifestations can also occur in Cowden disease. The skeletal system may form a high-arched palate, scoliosis, or macrocephaly. More than 85% of patients may have gastrointestinal involvement with hamartomatous polyps.
