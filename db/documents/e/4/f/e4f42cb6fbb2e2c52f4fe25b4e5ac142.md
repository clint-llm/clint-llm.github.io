In an emergency, clinicians must distinguish between torsion and inflammation of the testis. Antibiotics are not necessary for viral causes of the disease. Supportive therapies such as bed rest, antipyretics, analgesics, scrotal support, and hot or cold packs for analgesiaÂ are advisable.

Antibiotics should start empirically based on the likely pathogens according to age and sexual history.

- If there is suspicion of an enteric bacteria is suspected, then fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin) for 10 to 14 days are the preferred drugs. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is also an option for these pathogens.

- If there is suspicion of a sexually transmitted pathogen, then treatment should consist of ceftriaxone 250 mg single shot intramuscularly and doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10 to 14 days. Azithromycin is also an option in place of doxycycline.

Sexual partners of the patient with sexually transmitted pathogens should receive treatment.
