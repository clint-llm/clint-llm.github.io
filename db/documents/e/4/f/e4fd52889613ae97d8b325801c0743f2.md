Agranulocytosis can be broadly classified into two distinct categories, inherited and acquired. The hereditary disease is due to genetic mutations in the gene coding for neutrophils elastase or ELA2. The most commonly seen mutations are intronic substitutions that inactivate a splice site in intron 4. Acquired diseases may be due to various medications,

The following are the medications commonly involved with agranulocytosis:

- Cancer chemotherapies

- Analgesic and anti-inflammatory (gold, naproxen, and penicillamine)

- Anti-thyroid (carbimazole, propylthiouracil)

- Anti-arrhythmics (quinidine, procainamide)

- Anti-hypertensives (captopril, enalapril, nifedipine)

- Anti-depressants/psychotropics (clozapine, amitriptyline, dosulepin, mianserin)

- Anti-malarials (pyrimethamine, dapsone, sulfadoxine, chloroquine)

- Anticonvulsants (phenytoin, sodium valproate, carbamazepine)

- Antibiotics (sulphonamides, penicillin, cephalosporins)

- Miscellaneous (cimetidine, ranitidine, chloropropamide, zidovudine)

Infections that can cause agranulocytosis include:

- Bacterial (typhoid fever, shigella enteritis, brucellosis, tularemia, tuberculosis)

- Rickettsial (rickettsialpox, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever)

- Parasitic (kala-azar, malaria)

- Viral (human immune deficiency, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis viruses, human herpesvirus 6)

Autoimmune conditions such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and bone marrow diseases like myelodysplastic and leukemias are also associated with agranulocytosis.
