The 2014 EAU guidelines and the 2016 AUA guidelines state that the coaxial technique is the preferred approach for percutaneous biopsy and has not been associated with tract tumor seeding based on data from a large series of patients.  The alternative to the coaxial technique is to remove and then reinsert a needle for each pass.  A small retrospective study of renal biopsies found no difference in complications or outcomes between the two techniques

Core biopsy specimens result in greater sensitivity and specificity than fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens for both targeted biopsies (TB)

For NTBs, a minimum of about five to ten intact glomeruli is required to make a diagnosis

Some physicians plug the needle track with thrombin, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), or gelatin sponge, but randomized controlled trials comparing any of these products against no intervention or placebo for percutaneous renal biopsies in people have not been performed.
