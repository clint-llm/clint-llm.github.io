The internal carotid arteries first penetrate the temporal bone through the carotid canal before giving off branches supplying the eyes via the ophthalmic artery and its daughter central retinal artery.

There are several small branches of the ACA that branch at or near its junction with the ACoA. These include the recurrent artery of Heubner (RAH), the orbitofrontal artery, and the frontopolar artery. Identification of these arteries is essential, particularly the RAH, as their location places them at risk of injury in surgery of aneurysms and tumors.

The vertebral arteries arise from the corresponding subclavian arteries and course via the transverse foramina of the cervical spine into the foramen magnum.

Occlusion of each arterial territory causes damage to different functional areas of the brain. As a result, each branch has a unique constellation of symptoms that may present when affected.
