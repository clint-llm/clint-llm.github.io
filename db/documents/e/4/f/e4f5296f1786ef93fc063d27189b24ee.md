**The Schilling Test**

This test is divided into two main stages:

**Stage 1**

The patient is given radiolabeled vitamin B12 orally, followed by an intramuscular (IM) dose of unlabeled vitamin B12 one hour later. The injection is given to ensure that none of the radioactive B12 binds to any vitamin B12 depleted tissues, for example, the liver. A 24-hour urine collection monitors the absorption and excretion.

If stage 1 is abnormal, stage 2 may be done 3 to 7 days later.

**Stage 2**

If the previous stage provides an abnormal result, stage 2 can be done to assess whether there is a deficiency of the intrinsic factor. Stage 1 is repeated along with an oral dose of intrinsic factor. A 24-hour urine collection is carried out to assess the level of vitamin B12.

**Stage 3**

There can be many reasons for an abnormal test. One of them is bacterial overgrowth, and for that reason, stage 3 of the test may be performed. In this stage, a 2-week course of antibiotics is prescribed before giving another dose of labeled vitamin B12.

**Stage 4**

If stage 3 results are abnormal, stage 4 of the test is performed to reveal any underlying problems with the pancreas causing deficiency of vitamin B12. In this stage, a 3-day course of pancreatic enzymes is given to the patient, followed by the administration of the radiolabeled dose of vitamin B12. A urine sample is collected over 24 hours.
