The characteristic histopathological finding of Waardenburg syndrome is the absence of melanocytes (few dihydroxyphenylalanine positive cells are present). In the hypopigmented skin, melanosomes or indeterminate dendritic cellsÂ in the keratinocytes are present. Langerhans cells are normal in the epidermis, while on the edge of depigmented areas, the number of pigment cells is decreased with many abnormalities of nuclear and cytoplasm. Inside of vacuoles, a clear halo appears with some surrounding melanosomes.

Histopathological findings of ears reveal atrophy of the spinal ganglion, the number of nerve fibers are also decreased with the absence organ of Corti.
