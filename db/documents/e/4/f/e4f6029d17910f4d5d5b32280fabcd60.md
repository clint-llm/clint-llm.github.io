Breast cancer is the most common malignancy after lung cancer worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women.

There are two broader divisions of breast lesions, namely, benign and malignant.Â Though the breast's benign lesions are much more prevalent, they gain much less attention as they are usually non-fatal.

Among the neoplastic lesions, the most common of the benign neoplasm is the fibroadenoma. It constitutes almost 7% of all the lesions of the breast. These are quite common among young females. They tend to develop under the influence of estrogen and are hence seen more during pregnancy and late menstrual cycles. They regress and calcify after menopause. The other common types of benign neoplasms are phyllodes tumor and intraductal papilloma.

Some of the risk factors are; age above 40 years, nulliparous, delayed first pregnancy, oral contraceptives, obesity, high-fat diet, family history, genetic factors, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, and ionizing radiation. It is observed to be more common in the Western world and Afro-American females than Asians and Africans.

In diagnosing and analyzing breast carcinoma, the clinician needs to remember that it is confined to females alone but can also manifest in males.

Screening is one of the best methods for early detection of the lesions of the mammary gland. Screening of breast is generally by mammography, infrared breast thermography, etc.
