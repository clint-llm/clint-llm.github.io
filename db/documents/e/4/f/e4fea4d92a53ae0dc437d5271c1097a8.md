The prompt diagnosis and treatment of infants with pyloric stenosis require cooperation among several in-hospital medical professions, operating as an interprofessional healthcare team.

Ultrasound is being used much earlier to aid in the diagnosis, and the classic signs of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis are less common. The mean age of presentation is getting significantly younger, and infants are not developing the physical signs or electrolyte abnormalities they were in the past.
