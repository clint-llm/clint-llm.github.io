Major depressive disorder in the pediatric population is a treatable condition. However, it is mostly underdiagnosed and under-treated. The goal of treatment should be to minimize the impact of depression on the child's functioning at home, school, and on social/peer relationships while aiming for a full recovery. This would be better obtained via outpatient treatment with an interprofessional team consisting of a mental health nurse, a psychiatrist, a pediatrician, a psychotherapist, and a case manager. Admission to the inpatient unit should be considered when the depression is severe, or the child's safety cannot be guaranteed. Pediatricians and mental health professionals should always promote and advocate for this population's mental health, increase awareness and aim for decreasing the stigma.
