Upon discharge be sure to provide the patient with written instructions regarding how to prevent and navigate a hypoglycemic episode. Written instructions should reinforce verbal education taught to the patient prior to discharge. Provide in writing, the names of providers, dates, times and locations of follow-up appointments when possible. Emphasize to the patient and family when to contact the medical provider and when to seek immediate medical attention.
