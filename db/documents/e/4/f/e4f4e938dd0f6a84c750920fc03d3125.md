The contraindications to using zoledronate depend on the nature and type of disease being treated.

Hypocalcemia, acute kidney injury, or creatinine clearance (CrCl) less than or equal to 35 mL/minute are contraindications for use in benign bone disease.

Minimal data exist regarding treating solid tumor bone metastasis patients with a CrCl of less than 30 mL/min. Therefore caution is necessary for this patient group.

A history of allergic reaction to zoledronate is also a contraindication. This contraindication applies to all indications of zoledronate use.

Zoledronate is pregnancy category D and should be avoided during pregnancy, and caution is necessary for women of childbearing age.
