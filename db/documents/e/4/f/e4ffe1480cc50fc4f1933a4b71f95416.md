Healthcare workers including the primary care provider and nurse practitioner who have patients with coronary artery disease should refer them to a cardiologist. One option for dealing with localized coronary artery lesions is angioplasty with stenting. The results of angioplasty with stenting rival those obtained with coronary artery bypass surgery for single and double vessel disease. In addition, angioplasty has considerable less morbidity compared to open heart surgery. Many trials have shown that angioplasty with stenting is a viable option for people of all ages, including the presence of diabetes. (Level II) However, all patients who receive a stent also need antiplatelet therapy and life long follow up as recurrence of stenosis is a common complication.
