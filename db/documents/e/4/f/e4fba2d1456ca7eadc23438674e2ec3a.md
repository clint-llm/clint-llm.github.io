As the symptomatology of osteochondritis dissecans of the knee can vary from asymptomatic to vague pain with weight-bearing to the extremes of effusion and mechanical symptoms, the differential diagnosis is broad. For the typical osteochondritis dissecans patient in the pediatric age range experiencing atraumatic knee pain with weight-bearing, the differential would include patellofemoral syndrome, patellar tendonitis, Osgood-Schlatter disease, Sinding-Larsen-Johannson syndrome, fat pad impingement, symptomatic discoid meniscus, and symptomatic synovial plica. For an adult with typical weight-bearing knee pain, the differential would include patellofemoral pain, knee osteoarthritis, chondromalacia, patellar tendonitis, meniscal tear, fat pad impingement, and symptomatic synovial plica. For adults with more severe atraumatic edema as well as mechanical symptoms in the knee, the differential would include a meniscal tear, osteochondral loose body, and neoplasm.
