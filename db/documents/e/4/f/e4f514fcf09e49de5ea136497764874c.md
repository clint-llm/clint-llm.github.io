The diagnosis and management of DIC are complex and challenging. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that possibly consists of a hematologist, surgeon, intensivist, infectious disease consultant, pathologist, and internist. The key is to address the underlying disorderÂ that ultimately led to this condition developing. Consequently, therapies such as antibiotics for severe sepsis, possible delivery for placental abruption, and possible exploratory surgical intervention for trauma represent the mainstays of treatment for DIC. Platelet and plasma transfusions should only be considered in patients with active bleeding or a high risk of bleeding or those patients requiring an invasive procedure. Despite optimal treatment, DIC carries a very high mortality rate. Because DIC affects many organ systems, most survivors have a prolonged recovery period.
