Bone tumors are mostly benign. The most important determinants in imaging of bone tumors are morphology on plain radiograph (well-defined lytic, ill-defined lytic, and sclerotic lesions) and the age of the patient at presentation. Well-defined osteolytic bone tumors and tumor-like lesions have a plethora of differentials in different age groups. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of lytic bone lesions and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the etiology of various types of lytic bone lesions.
- Describe the radiographic exam findings that accompany lytic bone lesions according to type.
- Review the treatment and management of lytic bone lesions according to specific etiology.
- Explain the importance of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance care for patients affected by lytic bone lesions.
