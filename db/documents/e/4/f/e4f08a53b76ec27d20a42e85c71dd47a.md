Any patient hospitalized with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of avian influenza should have an infectious disease consultation to better direct care and minimize complications. While the recommendations presented here are necessary for any patient with suspected avian influenza, an infectious disease consultant may be able to better direct treatment for specific avian influenza strains and manage treatment and patient expectations more appropriately. Additionally, in the United States, it is mandatory to report confirmed cases of avian influenza to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
