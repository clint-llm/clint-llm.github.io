There are a few issues of concern when looking at statistical significance. These issues include choosing the alpha, statistical analysis method, and clinical significance.

Many current research articles specify an alpha of 0.05 for their significance level. It can not be stated strongly enough that there is nothing special, mathematical, or certain about picking an alpha of 0.05. Historically, the originators concluded that for many applications, an alpha of 0.05 or a one in 20 chance of being incorrect was good enough. It is imperative for the researcher to consider what their confidence level should truly be for the research question they are asking. Many times a smaller alpha, say of 0.01, may be more appropriate.

When creating a study, the alpha, or confidence level, should be specified before any intervention or collection of data. It is easy for a researcher to "see what the data shows" then pick an alpha to give a statistically significant result. Such approaches compromise the data and results as the researcher is more likely to be lax on confidence level selection to obtain a result that looks statistically significant.

A second important issue is selecting the correct statistical analysis method. There are numerous methods for obtaining a p-value. The method chosen depends on the type of data, the number of data points, and the question being asked. It is important to consider these questions during the study design so the statistical analysis can be correctly identified before the research. The statistical analysis method can then help determine how to collect the data correctly as well as the number of data points needed. If the wrong statistical method is used, the results may be meaningless as an incorrect p-value would be calculated.
