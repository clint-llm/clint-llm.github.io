PVCs may present at any time and in any patient, thus, it is important for the interprofessional team of clinician and nurse to be aware of them and react to them appropriately. However, it is the ICU or cardiology nurse that will most likely be the first person to observe PVCs on the monitor or ECG strip. For patients without symptoms, the prognosis is excellent. However, asymptomatic patients with an ejection fraction of less than 40% may have a slightly higher risk of developing ventricular arrhythmias and even cardiac arrest. However, in patients with no evidence of heart anomalies, all that is required is reassurance. Recent data seem to suggest that very frequent PVCs may be associated with the development of cardiomyopathy but more research is required before any interventions can be recommended. In patients who suffer a myocardial infarction and develop PVCs, the risk of degeneration into a serious ventricular arrhythmia is very rare. However, if the ectopic beats persist, then the patient should be referred to an electrophysiologist. When clinicians detect PVCs it is important to discuss with a cardiologist their clinical significance. Only through open communication can the outcomes of patients with PVCs be improved.

Overall, the presence of PVCs in young people is a benign finding but in older patients with underlying heart disease, there is a risk of ventricular arrhythmias and cardiac arrest.
