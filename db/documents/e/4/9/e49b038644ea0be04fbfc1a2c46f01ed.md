All disasters, regardless of scope or scale, occur at the local level. Most disasters can be managed at the local level using local resources. When the resources required to manage a disaster exceeds available local resources, the incident commander will contact the state government for support. Large disaster response often evolves from a locally managed event through regional and state responses to a federal response. As more services are made available or brought to the scene of an incident, disaster responders face a variety of challenges. Challenges include communications, resource allocation, leadership, and governance between agencies that may rarely work together.  Disaster management begins with planning and training to best prepare responders to cope with the stress and time-sensitive nature of the situation.  Local responders must establish regular disaster drills which include the participation of all government and private entities that may be involved in a disaster. The incident commanders and the command staff must be aware of regional, state, and federal assets available to assist in large-scale disaster response.
