The cubital fossa is an area of transition between the anatomical arm and the forearm. It is located in a depression on the anterior surface of the elbow joint. It is also called the antecubital fossa because it lies anteriorly to the elbow (Latin cubitus) when in standard anatomical position. The cubital fossa is triangular, and thus has three borders along with an apex which is directed inferiorly. It also has a floor and roof, and it is traversed by structures which make up its contents.

**Borders**

- Lateral border is the medial border of the brachioradialis muscle.

- Medial border is the lateral border of the pronator teres muscle.

- Superior border is an imaginary line between the epicondyles of the humerus.

The floor of the cubital fossa is formed proximally by the brachialis and distally by the supinator muscle. The roof consists of skin and fascia and is reinforced by the bicipital aponeurosis which is a sheet of tendon-like material that arises from the tendon of the biceps brachii.****The bicipital aponeurosis forms a partial protective covering to the medial nerve, brachial artery and ulnar artery. Within the roof runs the median cubital vein, which can be accessed for venipuncture (see clinical significance below).
