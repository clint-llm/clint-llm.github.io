The frequency of breast milk jaundice within the United States is thought to be 20-30% for neonates from 3 to 4 weeks of age whose feeding is predominantly via breastfeeding. About 30-40% of breastfed infants are expected to have bilirubin levels greater than or equal to 5 mg/dL, with about 2-4% of exclusively breastfed infants having bilirubin levels above 10 mg/dL in week 3 of life.
