Wound dressings should create a moist environment to prevent wound desiccation but allows for absorption of additional exudate. In addition, it should allow for airflow, prevent particulate contamination, and be impermeable to bacteria or microbiota.

Several techniques are used to reconstruct or surgically repair wounds, the simplest of which is primary closure. Other techniques are closure via secondary intention, negative pressure wound therapy, and grafting.

**Wound Healing Controversies and the Future**

- Fetal tissue has been shown to heal without scars, but its clinical role has yet to be determined.

- Transforming growth factor and several other cytokines all have a role in healing, but when to add or how much of the cytokine is needed for adequate healing is still being debated.

- Hyperbaric oxygen can promote healing, but the technique and success rate are not well established.

- Even though there are many anecdotal reports on honey and wound healing, controlled studies show that the benefits of honey are marginal at best.

- Finally, medications that can adversely affect healing include anticonvulsants, steroids, antibiotics, angiogenesis inhibitors, and NSAIDs. Drugs known to promote healing include insulin, vitamins, thyroid hormone, and iron.

- The new frontier for wound healing is the use of stem cells, but there are ethical issues regarding the widespread use of this technology.
