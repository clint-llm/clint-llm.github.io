The appendix arises from the midgut. The cecal diverticulum appears at week 6 and is the precursor of the cecum and vermiform appendix. The appendix is histologically visible by 8 weeks of gestation. With the developmental elongation of the colon, the cecum and appendix undergo medial rotation(along with the midgut) and descend into the right lower abdomen.Â As the appendix is pushed ahead of the cecum, it adopts various positions, seemingly at random. During weeks 14 and 15, the mucosa develops lymphoid tissue, lending to its proposed function in immunity.
