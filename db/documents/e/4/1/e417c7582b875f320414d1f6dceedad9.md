Assessing potential difficulties for bag-valve-mask ventilation and laryngoscopy should be completed before any attempt at intubation.

Factors that increase the risk of bag-valve-mask ventilation difficulties include facial hair, obesity, edentulousness, advanced age, and a history of snoring. These factors can be identified with a first-glance assessment by the practitioner. Dentition should also be assessed. While dentures should be removed for intubation, they may need to be left in place for noninvasive airway management.

A systematic pre-intubation airway assessment can be accomplished via several simple, quick methods.

Mouth opening can be assessed at the bedside using fingerbreadths. With the mouth open, the mandibular opening in adults should be at least 4 centimeters or approximately three to four fingerbreadths. The distance between the mentum and the hyoid bone can also be measured and should be three to four fingerbreadths. A small mandible increases the likelihood of tongue obstruction impairing visualization of anatomical structures during intubation. Similarly, a large mandible can elongate the oral axis impairing visualization of the vocal cords.

The patient can also be asked to open their mouth while sitting upright to assess the extent to which the tongue prevents the visualization of the posterior pharynx. The Mallampati classification system helps identify anatomy that may make intubation more challenging. A higher Mallampati score is associated with higher intubation failure rates due to poor visualization of the glottis.

**Mallampati Classification**

The Mallampati classification relates the size of the tongue to the visualization of the oral cavity. The more the tongue obstructs the view of the pharyngeal structures, the more difficult the airway might be.

- Class I: the entire palatal arch, including the bilateral faucial pillars, are visible down to their base

- Class II: the upper part of the faucial pillars and most of the uvula are visible

- Class III: only the hard and soft palates are visible

- Class IV: only the hard palate is visible

**Neck Mobility**

Mobility of the neck also plays a role in airway assessment. The ideal position for intubation is the "sniffing position." The sniffing position requires neck flexion to 35 degrees and head extension to 15 degrees. Neck immobility interferes with aligning the pharyngeal, oral, and laryngeal axes. Neck mobility can be impeded by a cervical collar or structural changes, including a fracture, dislocation, or arthritis. If there is no concern for a cervical spine injury, atlantooccipital extension may be assessed. If there is a concern about cervical spine injury, cervical alignment must be maintained during intubation, which may lead to difficult intubation.

**Upper Lip Bite Test**

Patients can be asked to protrude the lower jaw or bite their upper lip. The upper lip bite test assesses the ability to place the lower incisors over the upper lip. This acts as a predictor of the ability to subluxate the mandible during laryngoscopy. The grading system is as follows:

- Grade 1: the patient can fully cover the upper lip with the lower incisors

- Grade 2: the patient can partially cover the upper lip with the lower incisors

- Grade 3: the patient cannot reach the upper lip with the lower teeth
