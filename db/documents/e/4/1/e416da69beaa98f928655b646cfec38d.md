The first step to treatment is taking care of the physical ailments. Once the patient is medically stable, measures are necessary for proper hospital monitoring and follow-up appointments.

During the emergency department visit or initial encounter, the patient is taken care of by way of pain control, antibiotic prophylaxis for STDs, nutritional services, and sleep improvement strategies. It is essential to monitor the patient’s emotional and psychological wellbeing by ordering a psychiatric consult. These victims are at higher risk of psychosocial disturbances such as PTSD, depression, sexual dysfunction, and chronic substance abuse.

Follow-up psychiatric counseling is suggested, as the victim can experience psychological reactions as well as behavioral and somatic manifestations. This condition is known as rape trauma syndrome and is the immediate post-assault period that can present in up to 16% of patients.

Other monitoring strategies involve following up with an OBGYN or PCP and ensuring any physical complaints are managed appropriately. During these follow-up appointments, the clinician can monitor any lingering infections or pregnancies, and give any appropriate vaccinations. An appointment two weeks after the initial assault should be scheduled to check for STIs, along with a 6-week appointment for repeat pregnancy testing, HIV screening, and hepatitis C. Subsequent appointments at 12 and 24 weeks should be made for follow-up HIV and hepatitis C testing.

If the patient is pregnant at the time of the assault, an OBGYN should monitor the status of the fetus during the mother’s hospital stay. Gynecological trauma and physical abuse may have impacted the pregnancy.

Patients should receive an offer for legal counseling, even if they deny legal consultation at the time of the initial evaluation. Although most patients decide not to press charges, a well-documented account of the assault, as done during a SANE exam, can aid in prosecution.

In patients where drug-facilitation is suspected or confirmed, confirmation of the type of agent used is via a UDS. This process helps identify what type of hospital monitoring will be needed, as well as withdrawal tactics to use. The most common substances used in a drug-facilitated sexual assault are flunitrazepam, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and ketamine, although other agents such as benzodiazepines and opioids are also possibilities.
