Signs and symptoms of MM can mimic those of many other diseases; therefore, a vast array of tests, including invasive and noninvasive tests, are required to reach the diagnosis and determine the stage. The following conditions should be considered during the initial presentation and work-up of the patients with specific features that differentiate them from multiple myeloma.

**Monoclonal Gammopathies of Undetermined Significance (MGUS)**

- Monoclonal protein spike <3 g/dL

- Clonal plasma cells <10% of the bone marrow

- Lack of CRAB features

**Smoldering Multiple Myeloma**

- Monoclonal protein spike >3 g/dL

- Clonal plasma cells >10% of the bone marrow

- Lack of CRAB features

**Waldernstrom Macroglobulinemia**

- Presence of IgM monoclonal protein in the serum

- Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with lymphoid cells in the bone marrow

- End-organ damage (peripheral neuropathy, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, hyperviscosity syndrome)

- Most common genetic abnormality: MYD88 L265P

**Solitary Or Isolated Plasmacytoma**

- Localized mass of monoclonal plasma cells in the bone or extramedullary site vs diffuse infiltration in multiple myeloma

- Absence of CRAB features.

- Bone marrow biopsy results: normal if performedÂ outside of the lesion

**AL Amyloidosis**

- Plasm cell clones in bone marrow: secrete unstable monoclonal kappa and lambda light chains forming amyloid fibrils

- Monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition in various organs of the body like the heart, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract)

- Less than 20% plasma cell infiltration of bone marrow

- Lack of lytic lesions

- Apple green birefringence on congo red staining of the affected tissue
