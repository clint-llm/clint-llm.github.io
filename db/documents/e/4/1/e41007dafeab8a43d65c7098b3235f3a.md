Balanitis is a visual diagnosis, the clinical presentation and appearance of the lesions guide the diagnosis. Additional evaluation may be warranted based upon the history and physical findings. This might include bacterial culture (in the presence of purulent exudate), herpes simplex virus (HSV) testing (in the presence of vesicular or ulcerative lesions), syphilis testing (in the present of an ulcer), testing for scabies, and testing for trichomonas and Mycoplasma genitalium (in the presence of urethritis).

Men with suspected balanitis often complain of penile pain and redness.

Physical examination revealing an inflamed and erythematous glans confirms the diagnosis of balanitis. For men who are uncircumcised, the mobility of the foreskin should be assessed to exclude the complications of phimosis and paraphimosis.  Paraphimosis requires urgent urologic consultation.

Certain features on clinical examination (e.g., white, curd-like exudate) raise suspicion for candidal infection. If available, microscopy can identify budding yeast or pseudohyphae using a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation.
