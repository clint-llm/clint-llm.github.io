Most laxatives are safe when used appropriately and in patients without contraindications.

- Osmotic agents like lactulose can have adverse effects like bloating, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

- Stimulant laxatives are known to cause abdominal pain.

- Cisapride was withdrawn from the market after cardiovascular adverse effects, including prolonged QT interval that increases the risk for Torsades de Pointes.

- Mineral oil can cause aspiration and lipoid pneumonia.

- Osmotic agents like magnesium can cause metabolic disturbances, especially in the presence of renal involvement. Also, magnesium excretion depends on renal function, and its use requires caution in renal impairment.

- Osmotic agents result in volume load and should be used with caution in renal or cardiac dysfunction.

- With prokinetic agents, adverse effects like headache, nausea, and diarrhea have been described.

- Secretagogues like linaclotide can occasionally cause diarrhea.

- Long-term stimulant laxative use has correlated with the loss of haustral folds in the colon; this could indicate neuronal or muscular injury caused by these agents.

- In vitro studies have described stimulant laxatives like senna and bisacodyl as having neoplastic potential, but data is lacking in human studies so far.
