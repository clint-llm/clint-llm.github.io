PLD is a progressive disease, and only a small subset of patients develop severe symptoms. Supportive management is recommended with a patient with mild symptoms, while the patient with severe symptoms can be managed surgically, with liver transplantation being the only curative option. There is a lack of effective medical treatment options available for patients with PLD and are currently under investigation in clinical trials.
