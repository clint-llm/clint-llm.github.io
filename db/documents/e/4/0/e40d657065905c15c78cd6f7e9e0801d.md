Linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD), also known as linear IgA dermatosis or linear IgA disease, is a relatively rare subepidermal vesiculobullous disease that can occur in both adults and children. In children, the disease is known as "chronic bullous disease of childhood" and tends to have a distinct clinical appearance, but the underlying pathogenesis of the disease remains the same. In the adult form of the disease, a drug-induced etiology must be thoroughly considered.
