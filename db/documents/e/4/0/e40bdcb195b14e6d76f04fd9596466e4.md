There are no absolute contraindications to eyelid laceration repair; however, in patients with concurrent globe rupture, the globe should be evaluated and repaired before any lid procedure. Lacerations secondary to heavy contamination or human/animal bites may need minimal necrotic tissue debridement, but a primary repair is often still performed. Nonetheless, contaminated wounds may be left open for delayed repair.

Using local with epinephrine is relatively contraindicated in patients with Raynaud phenomenon, sickle cell disease, arteritis, or severe microvascular disease, but necrosis of the eyelid following lidocaine with epinephrine administration is very rare.
