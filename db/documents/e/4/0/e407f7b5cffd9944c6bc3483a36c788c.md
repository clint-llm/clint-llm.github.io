In addition to the malignant lesions above, other etiologies can present as lacrimal gland fossa lesions. Two major categories for these other causes are inflammatory lesions and benign tumors. Altogether, inflammatory lesions make up the most common cause of lacrimal gland enlargement.

**Inflammatory Lesions**

- Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (IOIS), or orbital pseudotumor

- IgG-4 related disease

- Sarcoidosis

- Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

- Dacryoadenitis

- Sjogren syndrome

- Thyroid eye disease

**Benign Tumors**

- Epithelial

- Pleomorphic adenoma
- Dacryops (lacrimal gland cyst)
- Oncocytoma
- Myoepithelioma
- Cystadenoma
- Warthin tumor

- Lymphoproliferative

- Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (benign lymphoepithelial lesion)

- Mesenchymal

- Capillary or cavernous hemangioma
- Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia
- Granular cell tumor
- Fibrous histiocytoma
- A solitary fibrous tumor (hemangiopericytoma)
- Neurofibroma
- Schwannoma

Some lesions can be found near the superolateral orbit and can be confused for lacrimal gland tumors. They include:

- Epidermoid or dermoid cyst, commonly found at the frontozygomatic suture and may have an intraorbital component

- Prolapsed orbital fat, causing fullness of the lateral upper lid or a mass in the superotemporal fornix

- Dermatolipoma, commonly seen under the superotemporal conjunctiva

- Prolapsed lacrimal gland, giving the appearance that it has been displaced by a mass

Lacrimal gland enlargement can also be seen in amyloidosis. Though rare, amyloid deposition in orbit, including the lacrimal gland, is usually due to a localized disease process rather than associated with systemic amyloidosis.
