Antalgic gait is one of the most common forms of altered gait in patients presenting to the emergency department and primary care offices. It refers to an abnormal pattern of walking secondary to pain that ultimately causes a limp, whereby the stance phase is shortened relative to the swing phase. In a normal, healthy person, gait is a cyclical and symmetric process. However, when an abnormality is present in one of the joints, muscles, or bones of the complex system that regulates gait, this process is disrupted. Finding the source of this disruption is essential to accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of adults presenting with an antalgic gait and explains the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the differential diagnosis of an antalgic gait in adults and the underlying traumatic, infectious, inflammatory, vascular, and neoplastic processes that cause it.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of antalgic gait based on the most likely etiology.
- Outline the management options available for the various causes of antalgic gait.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance diagnosis and treatment of the many causes of antalgic gait in adults and to improve outcomes.
