According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 10% of the world population suffers from asthma, with a 15% increase in disease burden in the United States over the last two decades. Five percent of them are classified as severe asthma.

An estimated 3% to 16% of hospitalized adult asthmatic patients progress to respiratory failure requiring ventilatory support, although the statistics might be lower in children. Afessa et al. have reported a mortality of around 10% in the intensive care unit (ICU) patients admitted with status asthmaticus.

Increasing standardization of low tidal volume ventilation strategies, avoiding prolonged neuromuscular blockade, and assisting control mode ventilation hopefully helped reduce this trend even further over the past decade. In a retrospective review of 280 hospitalizations over a period of 30 years in the University of Texas, Health Science Center, San Antonio, 61.2% of patients required intubation and mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate was about 0.35%.

Multiple observational studies have reported a higher incidence in women, among African Americans, and in subjects with adult-onset asthma, which developed after 17 years.
