Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive following a year of regular unprotected intercourse or donor insemination. This definition is reduced to 6 months for women over 35 or with other known risk factors for infertility.

Environmental toxins are ubiquitous and sometimes implicated in infertility development, either through anatomical abnormalities or endocrinological dysfunction. Based on a National Health and Nutrition Survey from 2003 through 2004, pregnant women in the United States are exposed to 43 or more different potential chemical toxins.

Environmental toxins affect individuals throughout the lifespan, including prenatally, and can have various effects, from increasing cancer risk to ovulatory dysfunction to altered semen quality. This article is a focused review on the specific toxins known to influence fertility and the recommended evaluation, treatment, and prognosis for these patients.
