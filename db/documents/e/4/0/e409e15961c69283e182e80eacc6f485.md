Barium swallow studies should be used in cases of suspected esophageal perforation only after considering the risk of inflammatory mediastinitis. This is not an absolute contraindication and should be weighed against the benefit of obtaining a timely diagnosis. Patients must be capable of swallowing relatively large amounts of contrast without assistance and be able to protect their airway.

Do not administer barium in cases of suspected acute, chemical esophageal injury as there is little useful information to be gained from a contrast swallow study in such cases.
