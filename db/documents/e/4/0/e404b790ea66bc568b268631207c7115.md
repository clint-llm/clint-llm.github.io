Hantavirus is a rare, life-threatening infection characterized by pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and hypotension. It typically results from exposure to mice feces or urine in the 1 to 3 weeks preceding symptom onset and can result in death within days. It is most common in the southwest United States and South America. Hantavirus may be preceded by vague flu-like symptoms and may be associated with hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome (HFRS). This activity describes the clinical features, evaluation, and management of hantavirus infection and highlights the role of the inter-professional team in the management of patients with the condition.
