Analgesic iontophoresis is the administration of analgesic medications via iontophoresis used in the management and treatment of pain. The technique may employ multiple classes of drugs. This activity outlines the indications, action, and contraindications for iontophoresis as a valuable agent in the management of painful conditions. This activity will highlight the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) pertinent for members of the healthcare team and patients in the management of patients with acute or chronic pain and related conditions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action and administration of iontophoretic analgesia.
- Describe the adverse effects and contraindications of iontophoretic analgesia.
- Outline appropriate monitoring and toxicity of iontophoretic analgesia.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance iontophoretic analgesia and improve outcomes.
