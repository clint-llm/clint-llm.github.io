To efficiently assemble a long arm cast, the practitioner should recruit the help of at least one other person. Have an assistant hold the patient's extremity in the desired position of immobilization while the splint is being created and molded. This can help with the accurate placement of materials and minimize impingement of structures that could otherwise need to be adjusted after splint application (e.g., anterior cubital fossa).
