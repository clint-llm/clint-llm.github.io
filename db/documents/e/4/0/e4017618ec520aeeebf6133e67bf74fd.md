Identifying abnormalities related to plasma glucose levels is best done with an interprofessional team that includes experts in the field of internal medicine, emergency medicine, intensivists, medical biochemistry, and laboratory medicine, along with nurses and laboratory technicians.

Clinical correlation of a patientâ€™s plasma glucose levels with his history and other investigations can help the clinician to understand and diagnose the underlying pathology. Precise plasma glucose levels, along with HbA1c values, help the clinician plan and monitor the treatment regimen for the patients individually.
