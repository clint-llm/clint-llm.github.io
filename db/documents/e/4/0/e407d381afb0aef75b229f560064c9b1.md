Broadly speaking, the neck classically divides into two distinct anatomic triangles: anterior and posterior. The anterior neck then divides into four smaller triangles – submental, submandibular, superior carotid, and inferior carotid triangle; the regions of the anterior neck are beyond the scope of this text and will not be discussed. The anatomic definition of the posterior neck uses the following borders: posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid, clavicle, and anterior border of the trapezius. The inferior belly of the omohyoid muscle then divides this posterior triangle into the occipital and supraclavicular triangle, the latter of which will be discussed primarily in this text. The supraclavicular triangle is referred to as the subclavian triangle in some texts.
