Adequate pain medication is critical, as patients often report severe tension headache-like discomfort for the first day or two postoperatively. Ice packs should be placed intermittently around the eyes for the initial 24 hours after surgery. The head dressing is removed on postoperative day 1, at which time showering may resume. Sleeping with the head elevated for one week, avoiding vigorous activity for two weeks after surgery, and a low-dose corticosteroid taper may help lessen bruising and swelling. Patients are asked to return at one week for wound assessment and staple/suture removal. Hair coloring is safe to perform at one month. It is not uncommon that the tine-fixation devices remain palpable out to 5 months or longer. Photographic documentation should occur at the 3-month and 12-month visits.
