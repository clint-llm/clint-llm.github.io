Inhalation of crystalline silicon dioxide causes mineral deposits to form at the level of terminal bronchioles and alveoli. The presence of foreign material results in the activation of alveolar macrophages and also exerts direct toxic effects on the surrounding lung parenchyma. Cellular damage results in the release of inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha), the generation of free radicals, and augmentation of cell-signaling pathways. The different cytokines result in the promotion of fibrosis. A role of tissue mast cells has also been reported. There is also evidence that silica interferes with the ability of macrophages to inhibit the growth of mycobacteria and this effect explains the common association silicosis/tuberculosis. In the acute form of silicosis, a direct toxic effect of alveolar type 2 cells, as well as on macrophages may occur. A role of immunologic factors has long been postulated but not proven in silicosis.
