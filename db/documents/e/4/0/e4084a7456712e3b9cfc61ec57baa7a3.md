In 1925, Austrian ophthalmologist Maximilian Salzmann reported on a nodular degeneration secondary to phlyctenular or trachomatous keratitis.

Nodule formation is most commonly idiopathic but has been associated with inflammation, trauma, and surgery.

Surgical options in refractory cases include manual excision, phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) with or without the use of topical mitomycin-C, and lamellar or penetrating keratoplasty.
