The composition of snake venom from a single species of venomous snake can consist of up to 100 different toxic elements. Local tissue destruction is primarily due to hyaluronidase and proteolytic enzymes in the snake venom, which can lead to local tissue edema, blistering, and tissue necrosis. Phospholipase A2 is a common component of snake venom and causes local tissue damage. This compound has both local effects of the surrounding tissues as well as systemic effects on the vascular system and nerve endings. There are a variety of other proteins and polypeptides with toxic effects, such as neurotoxins and hemotoxins.

Most of the neurotoxic effects are secondary to damage at both the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals of the neuromuscular junction. Presynaptic neurotoxins, such as phospholipase A2, damages the terminal axon, which prevents the release of acetylcholine, causing diffuse paralysis. In contrast, the postsynaptic neurotoxins, such as alpha neurotoxin,Â responds well to antivenom and anticholinesterase administration as the toxin binds directly to the acetylcholine receptor.

There are a wide variety of hemotoxins with effects on the coagulation cascade, platelet activation, and fibrin clot formation. Most of the toxins lead to an increased bleeding tendency secondary to a consumptive coagulopathy and defibrination. There are, however, some hemotoxins that promote clotting and thrombosis.
