Most injuries begin to improve in 24 to 48 hours with conservative treatment. Moderate to severe injuries may require bracing/splinting for a short period (6 to 8 weeks) before surgical evaluation. If surgery is necessary, a return to full activity may take weeks in cases of arthroscopic debridement (average of 6 weeks) but may require three or more months for surgical fixation procedures.
