Resuscitation should not delay while investigating the etiology of undifferentiated shock. Physicians should have a high clinical suspicion for the presence of shock, and an attempt to stratify the severity of the shock should also take place to assess the need for emergent or early interventions. Evaluation of undifferentiated shock should begin with a thorough history and physical examination.

Besides telemetry monitoring, a 12-lead electrocardiogram should be obtained. ECGs might show evidence of acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmias, or provide diagnostic clues suggestive of pericardial effusion or pulmonary embolism.

Laboratory tests in a patient with undifferentiated shock should include a CBC and differential, renal and liver function tests, serum lactate level, cardiac biomarkers, D-dimer level, coagulation profile, type and screen for a possible blood transfusion if appropriate (if concern for hemorrhagic shock), blood and urine cultures, and blood gas analysis. Initial imaging studies recommended in patients with undifferentiated shock and hypotension include chest x-rays to look for the source of infection such as pneumonia, complications of shock such as ARDS, clinical findings supporting the diagnosis of pulmonary edema in cardiogenic shock, widened mediastinum in aortic dissection. CT scans can also assist in unmasking the etiology of shock in appropriate clinical scenarios. Point of care ultrasonography or focused cardiac ultrasound is also a useful bedside diagnostic tool.
