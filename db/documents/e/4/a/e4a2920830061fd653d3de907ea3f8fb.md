Endometrial polyps can have a negative impact on the quality of life and mental health of patients who have a poor understanding of the disease. Patients should be counseled on the disease pathology keeping in mind that terms like “lesion” or “neoplasm” may cause excessive concern for the patient.

Symptoms of abnormal uterine bleeding should be fully evaluated to rule out more serious etiologies, like malignancy. Endometrial polyps may be managed conservatively for low-risk patients or can be treated surgically. Recurrence risks should be discussed, and appropriate candidates may benefit from endometrial ablation and levonorgestrel intrauterine devices to decrease these risks. In cases of surgical management, an anesthesia consult should be considered for high-risk patients. Specialized surgical nurses will be responsible for preparing the patient before and after the procedure, intraoperative positioning, and arranging the correct surgical supplies. Nursing staff can follow up postoperatively to assess treatment success and inform the care team of any concerns.

All healthcare professionals should counsel the patient on the benefits, risks, alternatives, and outcomes of the procedure. Emphasis should be placed on communication and collaboration among team members to deliver safe and patient-centered care.
