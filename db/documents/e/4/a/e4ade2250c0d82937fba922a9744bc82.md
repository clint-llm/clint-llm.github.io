Complications of pancytopenia include an increased risk of infections, life-threatening anemia, and bleeding. Patients presenting with fever will need broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals with pan cultures. Supportive transfusions with packed red blood cells and platelets should be initiated promptly if severe anemia or thrombocytopenia with bleeding is present. Other complications include tumor lysis syndrome seen in patients receiving chemotherapy for substantialÂ tumors like high-grade lymphoma and acute leukemia.
