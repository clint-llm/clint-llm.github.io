Acitretin is frequently used to treat several skin disorders, including acne, psoriasis, lichen planus, and discoid lupus. While the drug is effective, it is crucial for interprofessional healthcare team members, including pharmacists, nurse practitioners, PAs, and primary care clinicians, to know its potential adverse effects. Clinicians should never prescribe the drug to a pregnant female because of the risk of teratogenicity. Also, the FDA has issued several boxed warnings about the risk of hepatitis when combining the agent with alcohol or methotrexate. When prescribing acitretin, the patient must understand the potential adverse effects and the importance of avoiding alcohol.

Given the warnings, it is apparent that an interprofessional team is the best means to manage acitretin therapy. Once the prescriber has decided to give the patient the drug, nursing can counsel on the patient's dosing, administration, and the potential teratogenicity if the patient is female. The pharmacist will verify dosing and perform medication reconciliation, alerting the prescriber of any issues. Nursing can also chart the therapeutic progress of the condition treated, so the prescriber can adjust therapy as needed. Through this interprofessional team paradigm, acitretin can deliver maximal benefit with minimal downside, resulting in better patient outcomes. [Level 5]
