The predominant side effect or reaction associated with both kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty is extravasation of the injected cement, which potentially leads to increased pain and or damage to the underlying nerve root.

Reports have demonstrated that cement embolization to pulmonary vasculature can occur following procedures.Â However, research has yet to document any adverse reactions regardless of radiological evidence of embolization.

Recent studies have shown vertebral cement to be associated with bone necrosis.

Infection is an infrequent complication from both kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. If it occurs, it can be serious.

There has also been an association of new fractures in many randomized control trials after patients received vertebroplasty when compared to controls.
