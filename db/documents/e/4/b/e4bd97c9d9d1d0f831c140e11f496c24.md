The function of strain counterstrain is to correct somatic dysfunction, pain, and tissue texture changes that have resulted in tender-points. A benefit of SCS is that it may be useful for patients that require a gentler osteopathic technique or patientâ€™s who have not responded to other osteopathic techniques. As described above, SCS is a passive, indirect technique.

Facilitated positional release (FPR) also functions as an osteopathic treatment for somatic dysfunction, pain, and tissue texture changes (tender points) in a shorter amount of time than SCS by adding additional compression or distracting force to initiate a quicker cellular response.
