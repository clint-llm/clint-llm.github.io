The practice of open-airway procedural sedation is a prime example of the practice of medicine as a team sport, requiring all those involved to be in sync with one another during all phases of care, operating as a cohesive interprofessional team. The individuals performing the procedure and the sedation, if not the same person, should be in regular communication to provide the highest level of care, as various levels of sedation are required during specific stages of each procedure. Additionally, attentiveness from well-trained ancillary support staff leads to improved workflow and identification of potential perioperative issues that may have gone unnoticed. This interprofessional approach will lead to improved patient outcomes with open-airway procedural sedation.Â [Level 5]
