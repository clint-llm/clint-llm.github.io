All patients are hospitalized one day prior to surgery. Routine blood tests as well as chest radiography are ordered. Informed consent is obtained by surgeons before the operation. Further preparation depends on the kind of surgery. Patients who are prepared for colorectal operation with total mesorectal excision may be asked to take an enema the evening before surgery, to empty the bowels.
