There are a number of contraindications to CO2 laser resurfacing. The presence of active acne lesions may result in infection or abnormal colonization following the procedure. Open wounds or active infection, particularly from herpes simplex virus, should also postpone the procedure until after resolution. Adnexal damage from autoimmune disease, burns, or irradiation can interfere with re-epithelialization, and patients with histories of these conditions may not be candidates for treatment with CO2 lasers. Furthermore, the recent use of oral isotretinoin within the previous 6Â to 12 months may lead to delayed wound healing or undesirable scarring. Lastly, a history of diseases associated with kobnerization phenomenon, including vitiligo and psoriasis, are also contraindications for this therapy.
