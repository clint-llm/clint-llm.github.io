Mid-forehead brow lifts are carried out via incisions located in the center of the forehead. Even with the best closure, some degree of visible scarring is inevitable; patients who will not be able to tolerate this should be provided alternative options.

**Absolute Contraindications**

- Lack of forehead furrows: in these cases, even mild scars will be apparent

- Absolutely refusal to have a visible scar on the forehead

**Relative Contraindications**

- Low anterior hairline

- Female gender: there are usually better ways to address the forehead and the brow position, such as endoscopic or pretrichial approaches

- Young age in male patients, due to lack of transverse forehead rhytides

- Availability of alternative approaches that are likely to succeed with reduced scarring

- Facial paralysis: significant asymmetry in brow position may be better addressed with direct brow lifting or suture suspension techniques due to the mechanical advantage they offer by pulling directly on the brow
