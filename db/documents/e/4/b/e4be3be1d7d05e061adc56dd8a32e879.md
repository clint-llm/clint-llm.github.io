After the intravenous injection of the FDG, imaging of the whole body (skull base to midthigh or vertex to feet) is obtained after an uptake period of 60 to 90 minutes.

FDG is a glucose analog and enters the cell by the same membrane transport system as glucose. After entering the cell, similar to glucose, FDG is phosphorylated by hexokinase to FDG-6-phosphate. Unlike glucose-6-phosphate, FDG-6-phosphate does not undergo further metabolism and is trapped within the cells. Most cancer cells have high glucose metabolism due to overexpression of the glucose transporters, increased hexokinase activity, and low levels of glucose-6-phosphatase. Therefore, cancer cells show increased FDG uptake. The degree of FDG uptake is expressed quantitatively by the Standardized Uptake Value (SUV).

FDG is attached to Fluorine-18, which is a positron-emitting radiotracer. It is produced by a cyclotron and has a half-life of 110 minutes which allows its transport to the PET scanning centers from nuclear pharmacies or nearby cyclotrons. After intravenous injection, the tracer distributes in the body and emits a positron that interacts with a free electron and annihilates, producing two photons of energy of 511 keV at 180 degrees to each other. The PET scanner then detects the photons. The raw data is then processed using advanced algorithms to produce images.
