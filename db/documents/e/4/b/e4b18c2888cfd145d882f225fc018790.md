In critically ill patients, multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) like the NICE-SUGAR  study have compared conventional (less than 180 mg/dl) versus intensive (81 to 108 mg/dl) glucose control with results remarkable for a higher incidence of severe hypoglycemia and increased mortality in patients subjected to intensive glucose control.

Multiple societies have put forth guidelines for optimal glucose management in the perioperative period. For patients undergoing ambulatory surgery, the Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia recommends intraoperative blood glucose (BG) levels less than 180 mg/dl. In critically ill patients, the Society of Critical Care Medicine recommends initiating insulin therapy for BG higher than 150 mg/dl, the American College of Physicians advises against the use of intensive insulin therapy with a BG target of 140 to 200 mg/dl. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons advocates intra-operative blood glucose less than 180 mg/dl and lower than 110 mg/dl in the pre-meal or fasting state. In the non-critically ill hospitalized patients, the Endocrine Society recommends pre-meal glucose targets less than 140 mg/dl and random glucose levels lower than 180 mg/dl while the Joint British Diabetes Societies propose blood glucose levels of 108 to 180 mg/dl in most patients with an acceptable range between 72 to 216 mg/dl. The Endocrine Society also outlines higher target glucose of under 200 mg/dl is acceptable in non-critically ill hospitalized patients with a terminal illness and with limited life expectancy or at high risk for hypoglycemia. American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends a target glucose range of 80 to 180 mg/dl in the perioperative period and 140 to 180 mg/dl for the majority of critically ill and non-critically ill patients.

Although the optimal glycemic target remains unclear, a reasonable goal in the majority of perioperative patients is to maintain blood glucose in the range of 140 to 180 mg/dl with the intent of avoiding both hypoglycemia (under 70 mg/dl) and severe hyperglycemia (over 180 mg/dl).
