It is important to identify white coat hypertension and masked hypertension correctly as over-or under-treatment of hypertension can have significant morbidity and mortality.

**Whitecoat Hypertension**

- Consistently elevated office blood pressure but normal out-of-office blood pressure

**Masked Hypertension**

- Consistently elevated out-of-office blood pressure but normal office blood pressure

**Psuedo-hypertension**

- Result of calcified blood vessels that cause incompressible of the peripheral arteries

- Blood pressure cuff unable to measure the intraluminal blood pressure accurately

- This causes a false elevation of blood pressure reading

- The use of standing blood pressure measurement can help to differentiate pseudo-hypertension from true hypertension

- Patients with poorly controlled blood pressure should be evaluated for pseudo-hypertension prior to being labeled as resistant hypertension
