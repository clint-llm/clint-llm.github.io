Protriptyline, like all TCAs, has multiple adverse effects. Although as effective as SSRIs and SNRIs, TCAs, and MAOs are not first-line treatment due to their side effects. Among the TCAs, protriptyline is the most likely to cause tachycardia, hypotension, anxiety, and agitation, and for this reason, some European countries have discontinued protriptyline use.
