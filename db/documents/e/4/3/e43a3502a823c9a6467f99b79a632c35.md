Acyclovir is an antiviral agent that incorporates itself into viral DNA, preventing further synthesis. ItÂ inhibits DNA synthesis and viral replication after converting to acyclovir triphosphate by viral and cellular enzymes. Acyclovir is a synthetic purine nucleoside analog demonstrating in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity against both herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV-1), 2 (HSV-2), and varicella-zoster virus.

Acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex viruses (HSV) are uncommon in immunocompetent patients (< 1%), except for corneal infections. Acyclovir-resistant HSV is more common in immunocompromised patients, eg, hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.
