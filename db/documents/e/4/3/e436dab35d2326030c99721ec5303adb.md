A thrombus comprises a conglomerate of platelets, red blood cells, vasoconstrictors, and procoagulant anchored to a scaffolding matrix of crisscrossing fibrin fibers. Two distinct types of branching fibrin fibers exist. The dense, thin fibers resist deforming mechanical forces and are poorly dissolve by thrombolytic agents. Thick fibrin fibers are susceptible to external mechanical forces and get dissolved by thrombolytic agents.
