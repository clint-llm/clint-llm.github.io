Primary biliary cholangitis can recur after a liver transplant. The rate of recurrence has been reported in transplant centers from 0% to 35%. Recurrence of primary biliary cholangitis is typically found anywhere from 3 to 6 years after transplant. Tacrolimus-based immunosuppression is thought to be the strongest risk factor for the recurrence of primary biliary cholangitis. The AMA may persist after transplant; so this cannot be accounted for the recurrence of theÂ disease. The diagnosis of primary biliary cholangitis recurrence post-transplant is made histologically.
