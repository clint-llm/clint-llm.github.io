**Veno-venous (VV) ECMO**

- Isolated lung failure unresponsive to ventilatory support

- Hypoxic respiratory failure: PaO2/FiO2 <100mmHg and/or Murray score 3-4. In the pediatric population, the consensus is to use the oxygenation index (OI) instead of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. However, the PALICC guidelines from 2017 do not specify an actual cut-off for ECMO initiation. The overall agreement was to monitor for worsening trends towards severe PARDS ( OI of >16).

- CO2 retention despite mechanical ventilatory support

- Immediate respiratory collapse due to asphyxia, or status asthmaticus.

- Deteriorating patient on the lung transplant list.

**Veno-arterial ECMO (VA) ECMO**

- Cardiogenic shock secondary to myocardial infarction, decompensated heart failure, cardiomyopathy, failure to wean from bypass following cardiac surgery

- Bridge to a ventricular assist device or transplantation
