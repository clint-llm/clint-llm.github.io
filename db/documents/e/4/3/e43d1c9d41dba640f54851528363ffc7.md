Blood vessels are fundamental components of the cardiovascular system, responsible for the dynamic transportation of matter and blood products to every cell in the body. The vascular network begins at the outlets of the heart, courses the entire body, and returns at the major venous inlets of the heart. This complex vascular highway functions to deliver blood cells, nutrients, oxygen, and pharmacological agents to tissue. Just as blood vessels direct material towards the tissue, they also facilitate the removal of cellular byproducts, carbon dioxide, and toxic chemicals from the tissue. Histologically the vasculature system is separated into macro vasculature and microvasculature. The macro vasculature being any vessel observable with the naked eye, and the microvasculature being vessels that are less than 100 microns.
