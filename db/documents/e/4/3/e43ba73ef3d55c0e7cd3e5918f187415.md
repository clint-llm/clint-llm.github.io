In presbyopia contact lenses, both foci are formed simultaneously, so the lens does not have to move. The lens designs are also axially symmetrical, so axial rotation is not a problem. The fitting of the contact lenses can be remembered by the acronym RISONS.

- **R**- Refraction

- **I**- Initial trial of lenses depending on the refraction and fitting number

- **S**- Setting time of a minimum of 15 to 20 minutes

- **O-**Overrefraction, if needed

- **N**- Near assessment

- **S**- Send away after a trial

The patient should undergo an assessment for binocular vision. The fitting recommendation should be followed. The patient should undergo a trial of extended-wear lenses. The balance between near and distance should be maintained. An adequate adaptation time should be allowed to adapt for the patient to have an excellent visual performance. The patients should be carefully screened for single-lens wearers and bifocal lenses. Monovision should be kept as a second option.

The patient should have realistic expectations before starting a trial fitting. The success of the patient depends on understanding the patient's needs, using a wide range of contact lens fitting options, understanding and listening to patient feedback, and the enthusiasm of the treating ophthalmologist or the optometrist.
