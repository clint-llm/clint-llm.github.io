Spinal shock carries very high morbidity. Clinical outcomes are worse if patients do not receive comprehensive care managed by an interprofessional team. An interprofessional team caring for patients with spinal shock should include emergency and trauma teams, neurosurgery, rehabilitation services, as well as anticipatory guidance from case managers, social workers, and spiritual care. The registered nurse plays an important part in the care and education of the patient as well as the family. These patients should be admitted to the ICU and closely monitored. These patients are vulnerable to complications and require deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis, pressure sore prevention, bowel, and bladder management, safety maintenance, anticipatory guidance as well as adequate nutrition.
