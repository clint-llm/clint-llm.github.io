If the degree of angulation is significant, then the healthcare provider needs to perform a closed reduction and immobilization.

Cast immobilization of long bone greenstick fractures should last approximately six weeks.

Although less commonly practiced, greenstick fractures may be treated with splinting if there is only a small amount of angulation and if there is close follow-up with the family or patient.
