A trained provider with a single assistant is adequate for an electric or manual vacuum aspiration. The assistant may collect the aspiration contents or provide ultrasound guidance should the provider so desire. While a well-trained single provider can accomplish this procedure, all providers must be supervised by a second party due to the nature of the exam.

Anesthesia personnel will be required if the patient requires IV sedation or a general anesthetic.
