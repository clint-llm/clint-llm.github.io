Calendar pillboxes offer a feasible, tangible way for the individual, his/her caretaker, or other health care professionals to monitor medication adherence. In Japan, there have been successful attempts to virtually monitor patient medication compliance using a programmed calendar pill organizer. With the use of specially designed pill organizers, physicians were able to determine when the organizer was opened and the number of drugs removed from the organizer.

A digital medicine program (DMP) analyzing the efficacy of digital medicine on Hepatitis C infected patients found higher rates of treatment adherence and sustained virologic response among those using the digital medicine program. This particular DMP was comprised of an oral drug encapsulated with an ingestible sensor, a patch to detect real-time medication consumption, a mobile app for patients to log their information and a health care provider portal for the team to coordinate patient management. If the software detected the patient was not wearing the patch, did not ingest the drug while wearing the patch, or did not consume the correct dose of the drug, the patient and the patient-care team was notified and the provider or a member of the research team reached out to the patient to discuss the noncompliance.

A post-engagement survey showed that many participants felt more involved in their healthcare through the DMP due to the personal mobile app tracking and the ability to connect with their patient-care team through the app.
