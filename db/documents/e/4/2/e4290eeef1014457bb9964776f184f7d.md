X-rays should routinely be performed for a trauma workup. An entire spine, chest film, and pelvis should be done, and any other evident bones involved.

Laboratories should include a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, international normalized ratio, and toxicology. Arterial blood gases are required for intubated patients and those with respiratory distress.

Head computed tomographic (CT) scan should be done for patients with impaired consciousness or history of loss of consciousness, focal neurologic findings, persistent vomiting, seizures, and an abnormal GCS score.

Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not indicated in the acute management of TBI.
