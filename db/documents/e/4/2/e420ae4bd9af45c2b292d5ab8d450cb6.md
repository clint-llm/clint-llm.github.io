Pemphigus herpetiformis usually has an indolent course, and it is less life-threatening than other forms of pemphigus. Some cases, however, may progress into pemphigus vulgaris or pemphigus foliaceous. The small sample sizes limit the evidence base for management of pemphigus herpetiformis. Based on a review of the literature, dapsone and corticosteroids are the drugs mainly prescribed. Pemphigus herpetiformis usually respond well to dapsone which is considered by many authors as the first drug of choice due to its ability to decrease neutrophil migration. Corticosteroids are also frequently reported to be effective in PH, and the daily doses required for complete remission are much lower than those required in pemphigus vulgaris or pemphigus foliaceous. Dapsone and steroids may be given as monotherapy or in combination.Â More intense therapy modalities have been applied in cases of pemphigus herpetiformis evolving to the classical forms of pemphigus in patients with recalcitrant pemphigus herpetiformis, including cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, sulfapyridine, azathioprine, methotrexate, intravenous immunoglobulin, rituximab, and plasmapheresis.
