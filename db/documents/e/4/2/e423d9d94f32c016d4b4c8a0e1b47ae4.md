Steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21, P450c21) is a cytochrome e P-450 enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum. It hydroxylates 17-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol, a precursor of cortisol and also hydroxylates progesterone to deoxycorticosterone, a precursor of aldosterone. Both hormones (cortisol and aldosterone) are deficient in the most-severe, ’salt-wasting’ form of the disease.

Due to the loss of this enzyme function, patients with a 21-hydroxylase deficiency cannot synthesize cortisol efficiently, and as a result, the ACTH levels are high, leading to hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex and overproduction of cortisol precursors. Some of these precursors are used for the synthesis of sex steroids, which may cause signs of androgen excess, including ambiguous genitalia in newborn girls and rapid postnatal growth in both sexes. Aldosterone deficiency may lead to salt wasting with consequent failure to thrive, hypovolemia, and shock.
