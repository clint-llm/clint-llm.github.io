It is estimated that anywhere from 25% to 45% of the adult population suffers from long-term pain, which results in a poor quality of life, loss of productive time, and the constant need to take some pain medication (

Over the past 2 decades, healthcare workers have also been liberally prescribing opioids for the management of pain and this extensive exposure to opioids has also resulted in the development of a wide range of adverse effects of opioids. Some of the common side effects of the opioids include the following:

- Constipation

- Itching

- Respiratory depression

- Sedation

These side effects are well known to healthcare workers. However, one lesser known side effect of opioids is the narcotic bowel syndrome (NBS). The most common opioid-associated gastrointestinal complication is opioid-induced constipation, which presents with nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, bloating, and constipation. NBS, on the other hand, is characterized by frequent or long-standing abdominal pain that is associated with long-term opioid use. The pain is often worsened by increasing doses of opioids or with longer duration of use of these agents.
