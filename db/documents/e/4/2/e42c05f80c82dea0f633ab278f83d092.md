- Patients with PAM typically have a history of swimming, diving, bathing, or playing in warm, generally stagnant freshwater during the previous 1 to 9 days.

- GAE presents as a subacute to chronic disease process with weeks to months of progressive headache, low-grade fevers, visual disturbances, behavioral abnormalities, and focal neurologic deficits.

- Two patterns of clinical presentation have been described with Balamuthia mandrillaris. While some patients present with an initial skin lesion followed by neurologic manifestations in weeks or months, others present with CNS involvement. The skin lesion consists of an asymptomatic nonulcerated plaque, most commonly on the central face or the knee area. Wide resection of the skin may prove to be therapeutic.

- A definitive diagnosis of PAM is made by observation of motile trophozoites on centrifuged CSF wet mount preparation.

- Approximately 11 survivors of PAM have been reported in the literature.
