Patients must be educated on how to avoid transmission with proper hygiene and prevention through vaccination efforts. As more communities worldwide oppose vaccinations, informing the public on the potentially deadly and disabling side effects of not receiving the polio vaccine can make an impact. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative partners with the World Health Organization, US Centers for Disease Control, Rotary International, United Nations Children’s Fund, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to work for a polio-free world. They have laid out a Polio Endgame Strategy with the following key components:

- Routine immunization

- Goal of >80% vaccination of all children in the first year of life
- At least three doses of OPV (or IPV per current CDC recommendations) as part of the national immunization schedule

- Supplementary immunization

- Mass immunization campaigns are known as National Immunization Days
- 2 rounds, 1 month apart from each other
- Immunize all children under 5 regardless of immunization status with two doses of OPV

- Surveillance

- Finding all cases of children with acute flaccid paralysis
- Stool sample analysis transport
- Isolating the virus in laboratories
- Mapping the virus/tracking outbreaks

- Targeted “mop-up” campaigns

- Door-to-door campaigns in targeted areas of known polio infections or suspected areas.
