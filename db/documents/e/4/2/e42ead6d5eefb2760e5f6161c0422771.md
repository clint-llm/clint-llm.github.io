The problem often lies less with determining that the foot is in cavus and rather in adequately diagnosing the underlying etiology of the cavus foot to help determine the optimal treatment for the patient. Pes cavus may be a presentation of a great number of different diseases and conditions that must be differentiated from each other. The clinician should be aware that the majority of patients that present with significant pes cavus have an underlying disorder.

Bearing that in mind, the cavovarus foot must be differentiated from the equinovarus foot, the foot may appear somewhat similar, but the equinovarus foot may result from different causes and will require a different surgical algorithm.
