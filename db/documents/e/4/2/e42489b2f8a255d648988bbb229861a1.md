An interprofessional team that provides a holistic and integrated approach to care can help achieve the best possible outcomes. Based on the type of patient population involved in PNH, different specialist involvement can improve the outcome for the patient. If children are affected, the care should be coordinated by a hematologist and pediatrician. Similarly, if a pregnant patient is involved, then a primary care doctor, gynecologist, and hematologist should have excellent internal communication to provide optimal care. Also, surgery can precipitate PNH, and if a patient ever requires any elective or emergent surgery, the patient’s primary hematologist should be consulted and be involved in the care when the patient is hospitalized.

If a patient is receiving eculizumab treatment, then frequent dosing requirements and breakthrough hemolysis can cause poor quality of life. Patient and family education can help improve the quality of life of the patients. If the family is more supportive and understanding of what the patient is going through, and if the patient can rationalize the difficulties they face during treatment, it can reduce the mental stress on the patient. In a situation where a patient is unable to afford the treatment, then a social worker should be involved in the treatment to help with finding ways to reduce the cost burden.

The patient’s hematologist and primary care physician should aid the patient in a discussion about different options such as continuing with less effective and less costly symptomatic management or allogeneic bone marrow transplant finally, if the patient has multiple comorbidities and expresses a desire to focus on comfort care then palliative care should be involved. The palliative care team, patient, and the family should have a good discussion about the options of care going forward considering the mortality burden on a patient on a case by case basis.
