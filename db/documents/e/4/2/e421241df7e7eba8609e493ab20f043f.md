Peripheral arterial disease is a common condition with a significant burden on patient morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Duplex ultrasound of the peripheral arterial system is an accessible and reliable method of diagnosis, evaluating the extent and severity of the disease and monitoring progression and planning treatment. This activity describes how to perform a complete duplex ultrasound exam of the peripheral arterial system and highlights the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and managing care for patients with arterial disease.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of peripheral arterial disease.
- Explain the different modes of ultrasound and how they are used to interrogate the peripheral arterial system.
- Describe the technique complete duplex ultrasound exam of the lower extremity peripheral arterial system.
- Describe the typical sonographic imaging findings of peripheral arterial disease, aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms, and arteriovenous fistulae.
