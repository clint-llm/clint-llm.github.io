The infraorbital nerve block may be performed by the anesthesiologist, dentist, trauma surgeon, facial surgeon and the emergency department physician. AÂ dedicated nurse must be assigned for monitoring the patient. In addition, resuscitation equipment must be in the room before starting the procedure. The infraorbital procedure is relatively easy and safe but an inadvertent injury to the nerve is not uncommon. After the procedure, the patient must be monitored for 30-45 minutes to ensure that there are no complications.
