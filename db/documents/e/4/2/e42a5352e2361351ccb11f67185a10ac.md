The basis for the treatment of Sheehan syndrome is the lifelong replacement of deficient hormones. Hypothyroidism can be treated with levothyroxine or liothyronine replacement. Cortisol deficiency can be treated by replacement with prednisone or hydrocortisone.Â  Gonadotropin deficiency should be treated with estrogen if the uterus has been removed with a combination of estrogen and progesterone if a uterus is present. Obviously, risks versus benefits must be discussed with that patient in regards to thrombophilia, risks of cancer, myocardial infarction, and others. The growth hormone is probably the most common hormone that needs replacing, and the dosage must be individualized to the patient's need. For patients who develop diabetes insipidus, desmopressin (DDAVP) is the recommended treatment of choice. Referral to an endocrinologist who is familiar with hypopituitarism and the usage of growth hormone is recommended.
