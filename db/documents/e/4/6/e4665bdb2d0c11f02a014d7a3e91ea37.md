PDE3 is an enzyme that regulates vascular smooth muscle contractility as well as cardiac myocyte contractility. PDE 3 also regulates the phenotypic switch in vascular smooth muscle and also regulates the response to stress. PDE 3 interacts with L-type calcium channels and the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump (SERCA2) to modulate cardiac myocyte contractility and relaxation.

PDE 5 is an enzyme found in the smooth muscle of the corpus cavernosum that cleaves and degrades cGMP to 5’GMP. PDE 5 inhibitors and cGMP have similar structures, both bind competitively to PDE 5 and inhibit cGMP hydrolysis, thus enhancing the effects of NO. The erection then prolongs as a result of the increase in cGMP in smooth muscle cells. However, after PDE 5 inhibitor administration, adequate sexual stimulation is still necessary for the erection to occur as PDE 5 inhibitors do not directly affect corpus cavernosum smooth muscle relaxation.
