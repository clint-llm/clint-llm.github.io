HVLA is indicated to treat somatic dysfunction of the thoracic cage, the thoracic vertebrae, and the ribs at the posterior rib angles. Somatic dysfunctions of the ribs are described as either inhalation and exhalation dysfunctions. Acute chest pain is a frequent chief complaint of patients presenting to the emergency department; however, the leading cause of chest pain is musculoskeletal in origin in patients without evidence of acute myocardial ischemia or infarction.

HVLA, solo or in combination with other OMT techniques, is another option when conventional treatment such as pharmaceutical pain medications are either contraindicated or not tolerated well.
