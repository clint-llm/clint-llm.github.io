Radiographic evaluation is an important aspect of the assessment of suspected hamstring injury to determine the nature, extent, and severity of the injury. Plain radiographs are useful to rule out a bony fracture, especially the apophyseal fracture.****Ultrasound and MRI are the diagnostic modalities of choice.****Ultrasound allows dynamic assessment of the injured hamstring muscles, but its sensitivity is increased if the ultrasound is done early after injury. MRI is still the investigation of choice to assess deeper muscle injuries, to evaluate a recurrent injury, and to differentiate new injury from the residual scarring. MR imaging also provides an estimate of the rehabilitation period.****Though it can predict estimated time away from the sport, it cannot identify the risks for reinjury, which needs further study.
