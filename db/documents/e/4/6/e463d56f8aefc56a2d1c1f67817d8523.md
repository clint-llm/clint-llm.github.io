ARDS is a common and serious condition that requires the collaboration of the medical team to diagnose and treat appropriately. Other clinical conditions that mimic ARDS should be treated appropriately. ARDS carries a high mortality and morbidity, and many ongoing randomized clinical trials are investigating new measures to improve mortality and other clinical outcomes in this critical condition. However, safe mechanical ventilation with low-pressure ventilation remains the cornerstone of management.
