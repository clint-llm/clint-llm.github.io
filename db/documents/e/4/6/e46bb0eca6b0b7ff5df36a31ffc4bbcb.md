Anhidrosis is the inability to sweat. It is important to recognize anhidrosis as it can be potentially life-threatening due to heat-related illnesses. There are three main causes of anhidrosis, which are peripheral alterations in the eccrine gland itself, idiopathic, and central or neuropathic disease and/or medication that disrupts neural inputs from the anterior hypothalamus to the gland. This activity reviews the etiology and evaluation of anhidrosis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with anhidrosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of anhidrosis.
- Outline the evaluation of anhidrosis.
- Review the management options available for anhidrosis.
- Describe the interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance care and improve outcomes for patients with anhidrosis.
