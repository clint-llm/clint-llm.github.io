A parathyroid adenoma is part of a spectrum of parathyroid disease that also includes parathyroid hyperplasia and parathyroid carcinoma.

The etiology of a parathyroid adenoma remains unknown for most patients. The most common genetic mutation associated with sporadic adenomas is the cyclin D1/PRAD1 gene. Alteration in the normal function of this gene affects PTH secretion. Approximately 20 to 40% of sporadic adenomas have overexpression of cyclin D1. Regarding environmental factors, some data suggest that a history of radiation therapy predisposes a patient to parathyroid disease later in life. Long-term calcium deficiency may also result in parathyroid disease due to chronic stimulation of PTH.
