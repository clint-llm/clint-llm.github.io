A limited number of studiesÂ investigate the epidemiology of shoulder subluxation because most studies focus more on shoulder dislocations.

For traumatic causes, a study investigating U.S. military academy athletes showed that 84.6% of sport-related shoulder instabilities were shoulder subluxation, and 15.4% were shoulder dislocation. Among the cases with shoulder subluxations, 45.5% experienced the first subluxation event, while the remaining 54.5% had recurrent shoulder subluxation.
