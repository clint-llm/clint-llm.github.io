Pacemakers are implanted in patients with rhythmic cardiac problems. These pacemakers can often malfunction and produce a set of symptoms that require timely assessment and rectification. This activity outlines different ways a pacemaker can malfunction and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing the patient with pacemaker malfunction.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the basic functioning of a pacemaker.
- Outline different ways in which a pacemaker typically malfunctions.
- Review the underlying mechanisms of malfunction of the pacemaker.
- Summarize the importance of the interprofessional team in the management of the patient with pacemaker malfunction and the preoperative assessment of patients with pacemakers.
