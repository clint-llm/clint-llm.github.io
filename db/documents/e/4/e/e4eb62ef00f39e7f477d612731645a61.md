Although medicinal cannabis is another method of treatment for patients with pain, as with any medication, there are adverse effects. A systematic review of 31 clinical studies over 40 years was evaluated, and the most serious effects were relapsing multiple sclerosis, vomiting, and urinary tract infections. One of the most common benign effects was dizziness.

In the long term, medicinal cannabis can lead to cognitive disorders such as depression or schizophrenia, although more high-quality studies are needed to quantify such risks.

There are several routes to administer THC and CBD, including inhalational, oral, oromusocal sprays, and topical.
