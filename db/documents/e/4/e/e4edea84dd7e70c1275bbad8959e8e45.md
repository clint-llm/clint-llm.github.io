The primary treatment for C. psittaci consists of tetracyclines. Tetracycline 500 mg by mouth (PO) 4 times per day or doxycycline 100 mg PO or intravenously (IV) 2 times per day are described as a treatment of choice for 7 to 10 days. Minocycline 100 mg PO or IV 2 times per day may also be effective. Macrolides are second-line agents. Azithromycin 250 to 500 mg PO once daily is favored over erythromycin. Macrolides are the treatment of choice for children.
