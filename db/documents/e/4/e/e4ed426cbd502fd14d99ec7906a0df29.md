A good operating team is required along with pediatric cardiac anesthesiologists, OR nurses, perfusionists running the cardiopulmonary bypass for the procedure to go smoothly. There should be a good handoff between the OR team and the ICU team who receives the patient after the surgery. An interprofessional ICU team of nurses trained in cardiac intensive care, cardiac intensivists, and respiratory therapists is vital in taking good care of the patients post-operatively.
