Unilateral or bilateral agenesis of the seminal vesicles is rare. Unilateral agenesis or cyst formation is often associated with abnormalities from other ipsilateral, mesonephric-derived structures, such as renal agenesis. Bilateral agenesis is commonly associated with bilateral agenesis of the vas deferens. It is often related to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR gene mutation on chromosome 7p, which can result in obstructive azoospermia.
