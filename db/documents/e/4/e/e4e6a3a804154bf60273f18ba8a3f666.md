The risorius muscle is a narrow bundle of muscle fibers that becomes narrower from its origin at the fascia of the lateral cheek over the parotid gland and superficial masseter and platysma muscles, to its insertion onto the skin of the angle of the mouth. There is a risorius muscle located on either side of the lips in most individuals. Like other facial muscles, the risorius has a greater percentage of slow muscle fibers and contains a more intricate configuration of innervation of extrafusal fibers than other skeletal muscles throughout the body. Its location is within the deep portion of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS),
