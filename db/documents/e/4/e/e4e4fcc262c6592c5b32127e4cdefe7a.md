Subclinical hypothyroidism characteristically presents with normal thyroxine (T4) levels and elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. The incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism is estimated to be 3-15% depending on the population studied. Intraindividual variation in TSH levels is minimal, this is secondary to a unique individual setpoint in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This condition correlates with an increased risk of fatal and non-fatal coronary artery disease (CAD) events, congestive heart failure and fatal stroke. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of subclinical hypothyroidism
- Describe the evaluation of a patient with subclinical hypothyroidism
- Summarize the treatment options for subclinical hypothyroidism
- Outline the value of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for those with subclinical hypothyroidism.
