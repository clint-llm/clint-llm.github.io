Cutaneous leiomyomas are rare, benign, smooth muscle tumors that are subcategorized based on the origin of the smooth muscle within the tumor. The most common type of cutaneous leiomyomas, angioleiomyomas, arise from the tunica media of blood vessels. The 2 other subtypes, piloleiomyomas and genital leiomyomas, arise from the arrector pili musculature of the hair follicle and from the smooth muscle found in the scrotum, labia, or nipple, respectively. Although the smooth muscle tumors themselves are benign, patients with multiple cutaneous leiomyomas (piloleiomyomas) may be harboring an underlying genetic mutation which increases their susceptibility to developing renal cell carcinoma. In addition, both the piloleiomyomas and genital leiomyomas may be problematic due to pain or discomfort.
