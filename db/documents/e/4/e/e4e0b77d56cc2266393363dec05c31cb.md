Alphavirus causes Western Equine encephalitis. It is from the Togaviridae family, which includes several viruses that cause other equine encephalitis infections.Â  The virus most closely resembles the Eastern Equine encephalitis virus, which may be a genetic predecessor. The vectors for human transmission are the Culex tarsalis, Culiseta, and Aedes mosquito species. Outbreaks in mules, horses, pheasants, and other birds often accompany human epidemics. Birds serve as amplifying hosts, but no cases of transmission through contact with birds have been reported making them a reservoir but not a vector for infection. There is no aerosolized transmission, but the virus may cross the placenta and be transmitted from mother to fetus. Transmission via infected blood transfusion is unlikely due to low viral loads in most hosts, but possible.
