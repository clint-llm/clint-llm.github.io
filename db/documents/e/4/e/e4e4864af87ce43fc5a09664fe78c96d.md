Tracheal trauma may be penetrating or blunt and acute or subacute. A blow or stab wound to the neck or crush injuries to the upper chest may cause acute traumatic disruption of the trachea, as can subacute insults, such as overinflation of an endotracheal tube (ETT) cuff pressing against the internal tissues of the trachea over time. Blunt trauma to the neck may result in shearing of the trachea, usually within 3 cm of the carina. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of tracheal trauma and highlights the role of interprofessional team members in collaborating to provide well-coordinated care and enhance patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Identify when tracheal trauma should be considered. 
- Review injuries commonly seen in conjunction with tracheal trauma.
- Describe the management options for tracheal trauma. 
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for improving 
coordination and communication to advance the management of tracheal trauma and improve outcomes.
