The high mortality rate of malignant atrophic papulosis is associated with the severe complications arising from systemic organ involvement. The most commonly involved organ systems are the gastrointestinal tract (73%), followed by the central nervous system (64%) and multiple organ systems (64%). The majority of fatalities are due to bowel perforation, cerebral artery thrombosis, or massive cerebral hemorrhage. Peritonitis, meningitis, encephalitis, radiculopathy, and myelitis are also significant causes of patient morbidity and mortality. Other serious complications include pleuritis, pericarditis, diplopia, and ophthalmoplegia.
