Any patient presenting with a retinal pathology should receive treatment from an ophthalmologist and a multidisciplinary team. Slit lamps are commonly available in emergency departments. However, any patient with an ocular problem often presents to the primary physician. The clinician with knowledge of auxiliary lenses for slit lamps can diagnose common ocular diseases and ocular emergencies. Thus interdepartmental communication will ensure better patient management.

The primary physicians can follow up with these patients. The nursing will be the first medical staff to come in contact with the follow-up patients. They can assess treatment progress and report any issues to the primary care clinician. This collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to care can ensure better patient outcomes.
