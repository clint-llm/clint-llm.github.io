**Inflammatory Bowel Disease**

- Brodalumab is contraindicated in patients with Crohn disease. Researchers terminated a randomized, placebo-controlled trial examining the safety and efficacy of brodalumab in patients with Crohn disease due to disproportionate Crohn disease progression in those patients treated with brodalumab: 31% experienced worsening of disease versus 9% in the placebo group. Additionally, though patients with Crohn disease met the exclusion criteria from the psoriasis clinical trials, during one phase 3 study, one patient developed new-onset Crohn disease. If a patient develops Crohn disease while taking brodalumab, they should discontinue therapy.

**Infection**

- Risks and benefits of treatment with brodalumab require thoughtful evaluation before administration in patients with chronic or recurrent infections. If a patient develops a non-resolving infection, the clinician should discontinue the medication.

**Children and Pregnancy**

- Though no contraindication exists, researchers have not investigated the efficacy and safety of brodalumab as a potential treatment in children or pregnant women with psoriasis or breastfed infants of mothers taking brodalumab. However, monoclonal antibodies are generally known to actively be transported through the placenta, especially in the third trimester, and get excreted in modest amounts in breast milk. Risks and benefits to the mother require assessment before initiation or discontinuation of brodalumab.
