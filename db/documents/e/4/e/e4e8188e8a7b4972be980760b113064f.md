Epidural steroid injections treat pain caused by irritation and inflammation of spinal nerve roots. One specific type of pain, known as radicular pain, causes radiation along the dermatome of the affected spinal nerve. Many conditions may irritate the spinal nerve roots, which most commonly presents with low back (lumbar) pain with radiation down the buttocks or legs (e.g., sciatica). Also prevalent are patients with a neck (cervical) pain with radiation to the arms.

The most common cause of spinal nerve root irritation is intervertebral disc pathology. In herniated discs, the center portion of the disc (nucleus pulposus) pushes through the outer layer (annulus fibrosis) placing pressure and ‘pinching’ the adjacent spinal nerve root. This pressure results in pain, weakness, and/or numbness in the distribution of the irritated nerve. Similarly, in degenerative disc disease, the breakdown of intervertebral discs over time may cause the collapse of intervertebral space resulting in compression of spinal nerve roots.

Another common indication for epidural steroid injection is nerve root irritation secondary to spinal stenosis. Spinal stenosis is a condition causing narrowing (stenosis) of the spinal canal or the canals of exiting nerve roots. Spinal stenosis is most commonly caused by arthritis of the vertebral joints (facets) or intervertebral disc pathology as discussed above.

Other conditions in which epidural steroid injections may be indicated are:

- Non-specific radiculitis

- Vertebral bone spurs impinging spinal nerve roots

- Thickening of ligamentum flavum

- Postlaminectomy syndrome

- Facet or nerve root cyst with radicular pain

- Post-herpetic or post-traumatic (including intercostal) neuralgia

- Compression fracture with radicular pain

- Spondylolysis

- Spondylolisthesis

- Scoliosis causing nerve root irritation

One of the systematic reviews published evaluated 70 studies for lumbar epidural steroid injections, evidence for efficacy was good for lumbar disc herniations, fair for spinal stenosis, and poor for failed back surgery syndrome.

While the evidence of efficacy for Epidural steroid injections is strong, the longevity of pain relief is still not great and patients do need other forms of therapy for sustained pain relief.
