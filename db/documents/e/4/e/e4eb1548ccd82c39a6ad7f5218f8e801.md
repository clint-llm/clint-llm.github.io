Various studies have reported the prevalence of accommodative dysfunction in non-strabismic and non-presbyopic populations, but there are few studies on the prevalence of accommodative excess. In a study among South African students prevalence of AE was 2.8% between 13 to 19 years of age.

In a survey of university students, 10.8% of cases had accommodative excess though 32.3% of the subjects had binocular dysfunction.
