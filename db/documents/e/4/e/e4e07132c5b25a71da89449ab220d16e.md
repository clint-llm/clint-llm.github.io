Brain abscess from bacterial causes remains a serious central nervous system issue despite advances in neuroimaging, neurosurgery, better antibiotics, and newer microbiological techniques.

- Neurosurgeon drains the abscess surgically when needed

- Radiologist helps to locate and evaluate the extent of the abscess

- Laboratory technologists determine the type of microorganisms growing in the abscess

- Neurologists monitor the patient for any neurological deficits

- Infectious disease specialist determines the cause and type of antibiotics

- Pharmacist determines the type of antibiotic, management of emesis, fever, and potential drug-drug interactions

- Intensivist monitors the neuro vitals in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting

- The internist monitors the patient for any comorbidity like HIV, SIADH

- Nurses monitor the vitals, assist with the administration of medications, monitoring for any gross neurological deficits, and educating the family on home management of such patients.****

Nevertheless, the appropriate management of a brain abscess does remain controversial. Current evidence-based medicine seems to be lacking in data as to which patients should be managed with medication alone, which antibiotics have the best penetrability in a brain abscess, who should undergo surgery and when, what is the efficacy of antibiotics, what is the ideal surgical approach, and what are the long-term outcomes.

To date, randomized clinical trials in the management of brain abscesses are lacking, primarily because the condition is a medical emergency that needs immediate treatment to prevent morbidity. Despite the lack of data, studies in children with brain abscesses reveal that a combined or interprofessional approach may be the best way to lower the morbidity and mortality of this serious infection.
