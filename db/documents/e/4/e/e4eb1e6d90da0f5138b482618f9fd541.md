To maximize the benefits of Kegel exercises, the patients must exercise the right muscles with sufficient time for training. However, about 30% of women could not contract the pelvic floor muscles correctly based on the study of Zanetti et al.

Several studies compared the effectiveness of supervised Kegel exercises with the unsupervised group. The group undergoing supervised Kegel exercises showed better outcomes of pelvic floor function, including improvement of quality of life, decreasing urine leakage, and higher satisfaction rate.
