Physiologic factors that play a main role in ANUG include psychological stress, poor diet, insufficient sleep, alcohol, tobacco, poor oral hygiene, preexisting gingivitis, and HIV infection. These factors have been shown to impair the host immune response, which facilitates bacterial pathogenicity.Â Psychological stress reduces the gingival microcirculation and salivary flow and increases adrenocortical secretions, which can modify the function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes. This alters the immune response as well as the patient's behavior and mood, resulting in insufficient oral hygiene, malnutrition, and increased tobacco consumption.
