Orbital CDI is a rapid, non-invasive, and easily available modality for imaging of orbital vessels. Trained personnel can view the orbital vasculature changes and corroborate the diagnosis. Early management with a serial follow-up leads to positive visual outcomes. The ophthalmologist, the radiologist, and the nursing staff play an invaluable role in the efficient functioning of the team.
