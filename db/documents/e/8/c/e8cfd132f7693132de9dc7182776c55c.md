Hair growth is cyclical, and follicles undergo corresponding phases of growth (anagen), involution (catagen), and quiescence (telogen).

Loose anagen hair syndrome (LAS) is a condition inherited in autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance or as sporadic cases. It is characterized by non-scarring alopecia with increased hair shedding due to poorly anchored anagen hairs. The disease presents most commonly in female children with diffuse thinning and textural changes characterized as unruly.
