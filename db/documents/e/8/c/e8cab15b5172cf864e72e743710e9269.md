Previously, it was thought that secondary carcinoma was a relatively common phenomenon to occur in nevus sebaceus. However, studies have since suggested that most secondary neoplasms that develop in adulthood have benign origins. Many speculate that the supposed malignant growths that arose in nevus sebaceus were previously misdiagnosed as basal cell carcinoma but were likely trichoblastomas, which can share a very similar histological appearance. The actual incidence of basal cell carcinoma in nevus sebaceus is less than 1%. Trichoblastoma is the most frequently occurring tumor in nevus sebaceus, followed by syringocystadenoma papilliferum. Other common secondary neoplasms include tricholemmoma, sebaceous adenoma, desmoplastic tricholemmoma, apocrine adenoma, and poroma.
