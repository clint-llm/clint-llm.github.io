The most common medical complication in asplenic patients is an overwhelming post-splenectomy infection (OPSI). As noted, asplenic patients are at higher risk of infection with encapsulated microorganisms (e.g., streptococcal pneumonia). According to Kirkineska and colleagues, OPSI results in massive bacteremia caused by encapsulated microorganisms. The primary source of infection is not commonly identified, there is a short prodromal phase, and septic shock occasionally associated with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) can occur.  Up to 60% to 70% mortality rate has been observed in patients with OPSI if not appropriately managed.

In a normal functioning spleen, the red pulp filters blood and removes old red blood cells; it causes phagocytosis of infected erythrocytes which helps to form a defense against intraerythrocytic parasites.

The white pulp of the spleen has both T-cell and B-cell compartments which help with adaptive immunity and antibody production. The spleen provides the largest B cells which help in the humoral immune response.

Because the spleen functions as a reservoir for non-circulation and undifferentiated monocytes, splenectomy causes a lack of this reserve. According to Swirski et al., these undifferentiated monocytes stored in clusters in the red pulp, respond to myocardial injury and help in wound healing.

Apart from its role in immunity, the spleen also has a role in vascular and thrombotic complications. Vascular complications were also observed mostly in patients with hematologic diseases like beta-thalassemia. In a survey done by Taher et al., they found that in patients with asplenia due to beta-thalassemia, the prevalence of thrombotic events was 1.65%.

Due to the risk of thrombosis in patients with asplenia, another complication reported is pulmonary hypertension. According to Hoeper et al., the incidence of pulmonary hypertension in patients with asplenia is 8% to 11.5%, and numbers are even higher in patients with hemoglobinopathies.

Patients also can develop adrenal hemorrhage also known as Waterhouse-Friedrichsen syndrome and purpura fulminans.
