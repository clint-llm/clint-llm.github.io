The histological feature necessary for a diagnosis of VIN is the proliferation of atypical basal cells. The five criteria for atypia are as follows: basal layer involvement, enlarged nuclei, hyperchromasia, pleomorphic cells and increased numbers of mitotic figures.

uVIN proliferation begins at the basal layer and involves partial to the full thickness of the squamous epithelium.

dVIN possesses a high oncogenic potential, and its characteristics are more subtle.

Immunohistochemistry markers can be used to differentiate between uVIN and dVIN. P53 positive and p16 negative supports dVIN while the converse supports uVIN.
