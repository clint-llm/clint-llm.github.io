Since the symptoms are not specific and the differential diagnosis is broad, microbiologic isolation is required to make the diagnosis. M. kansasii rarely represents colonization or environmental contamination. Therefore any isolation of the organism needs to be evaluated for therapy.M. kansasii.

Culture results along with clinical and radiological diagnosis are recommended for accurate diagnosis of M. kansasii. As per the guidelines from ATS (American Thoracic Society) and IDSA (Infectious Disease Society of America) diagnosis of NTM should include a minimal radiological evaluation which includes a chest X-ray (or computed tomography of the chest if there is an absence of cavitation), combined with positive sputum cultures and exclusion of other diagnoses clinically. Cultures are considered positive when two consecutive positive sputum cultures, one positive culture from bronchoscopy specimens, or one positive sputum culture with compatible pathology is present.
