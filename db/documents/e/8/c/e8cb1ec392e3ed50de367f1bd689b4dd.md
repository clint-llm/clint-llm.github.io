Complications of magnesium toxicity can be both systemic and organ-specific, depending on the levels of magnesium concentration in the blood. Minor side effects seen early on in hypermagnesemia include flushed skin, nausea or vomiting, and generalized muscle weakness. However, as magnesium levels increase, the muscle weakness progresses to loss of deep tendon reflexes and, eventually, flaccid paralysis that can cause respiratory compromise. Further complications include those in the cardiovascular system, beginning with hypotension and bradycardia. If magnesium levels remain uncorrected, this can lead to a complete heart block and, subsequently, cardiac arrest.
