Initial treatment should include removal of the leech or leeches, controlling blood loss, and preventing exposure to blood-borne pathogens.

Various methods of leech removal have been utilized including salt, saline, vinegar, turpentine, alcohol, and heat. Chemical methods have also been used including cocaine, lidocaine, and topical anesthetic spray. Of these, saltwater has been shown to be effective in causing the leech to relax and release. Extra caution should be used when removing the leech as to not have reflux of contents back into the bite for risk of infection as well as increased bleeding.

Leech removal often requires unique situational removal techniques based on the location of the leech. A 2-year-old was found to have an intrabdominal leech which had perforated her uterus, and it required exploratory laparotomy for removal. A case report discussed a 24-year-old male with a leech bite in the external ear canal near the tympanic membrane with bleeding from the ear. Lidocaine 2%, then hypertonic saline was placed into the ear without decreased movement of the leech. Next, the glycerin phenique was placed into the ear. The movement of the leech decreased, and the bleeding ceased after 4 hours. After the bleeding had stopped, the leech was removed with alligator forceps. When trying to remove a leech from the vagina of a pediatric patient, normal saline flushed through a small feeding catheter has been reported with success.

After removing the leech, the wound must be cleaned, and bleeding must be stopped. Betadine or topical antibiotic agents can be used to clean the wound. A hemostatic agent or bandage can be used in addition to a pressure dressing to help with hemostasis. Cauterization, local application of tranexamic acid, silver nitrate, suturing of wounds, and tampon use have all be described as methods for achieving hemostasis after a leech bite.

Bacteria of the genus Aeromonas reside within the gut of the leech, and reports of infection after leech therapy have been reported. Prophylactic antibiotics directed at this species are recommended after leech exposure, whether intentional or incidental.
