The five-year survival of primary tracheal cancer depends on the type of tumor. Adenoid cystic carcinomas carry a better prognosis than squamous cell carcinomas, with a significant difference in 5-year survival between both tumors (74% vs. 13%). The favorable prognosis for adenoid cystic carcinomas reflects the slower growth and a more prolonged natural course of this tumor. Early diagnosis and definitive surgical therapy before the local or distant spread of cancer are associated with a favorable prognosis and increased survival. Five-year survival was 4%, 25%, and 47% in distant metastasis, regional disease, and localized cancers, respectively, in an extensive population-based registry.
