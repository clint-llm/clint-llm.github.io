Polycythemia, also called erythrocytosis, refers to increased red blood cell mass, noted on laboratory evaluation as increased hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Polycythemia vera is a subtype of polycythemia and can be associated with the overproduction of more than just the erythrocytic lineage. The clinical significance of erythrocytosis, due to any cause, is related to the associated risk of thrombotic events due to hyperviscosity of blood. Additionally, in cases of polycythemia vera, there is potential for progression to leukemia. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and potential complications of polycythemia vera and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in identifying and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical presenting features of polycythemia.
- Outline the management of polycythemia.
- Review the potential complications of polycythemia.
- Use interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and communication to improve the evaluation and management of patients with polycythemia and optimize outcomes.
