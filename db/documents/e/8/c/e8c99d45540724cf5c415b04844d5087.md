Causes for a prolonged PT include:

- Liver disease

- Liver disease or liver dysfunction leads to a decreased production of most coagulation factors. A decreased production of coagulation factors leads to prolonged PT and physical manifestations that can include petechiae and easy bruising.

- Vitamin K deficiency

- Vitamin K is a necessary component in factors II, VII, IX, and X. A deficiency in vitamin K will lead to a decrease in these factors and prolong PT. Potential causes that can lead to decreased vitamin K levels include malnutrition, prolonged antibiotic use, and impairments with fat absorption.

- Factor deficiency

- Inherited diseases that lead to a decreased production of factors II, V, IX, and X will lead to a prolonged PT.

- Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)

- DIC causes a system-wide activation of coagulation, depleting available coagulation factors leading to an increase in PT.

- VKA therapy

- VKA therapy inhibits factors II, VII, IX, and X and causes a prolonged PT.

- Antiphospholipid antibodies

- Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) characteristically presents with recurrent thromboembolic events and/or pregnancy loss along with detected antiphospholipid antibodies (APA).
