Elevated levels of biliverdin and bilirubin have been shown to decrease the risk of vascular injury due to cytoprotective activity, which lowers the incidence of atherosclerosis in these patients. Biliverdin and bilirubin downregulate the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and demonstrate an antioxidant effect in the damaged blood vessels. This decreases the formation of the tunica intima of blood vessels and blocks neovascularization and angiogenesis. Due to this effect of biliverdin and bilirubin, the hypothesis is that biliverdin may be useful in the prevention of atherosclerosis.

In addition to the cytoprotective activity, biliverdin and bilirubin have demonstrated an anti-inflammatory effect. Biliverdin decreases inflammation by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TLR-4 and by stimulating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10.

In addition to the anti-inflammatory effect of biliverdin, it has also been shown to be protective against insulin resistance â€” elevated levels of biliverdin cause dysregulation of adipogenesis. Biliverdin downregulates the expression of Cd11c and Tnfa, two genes that are responsible for the production of an M1 macrophage and tissue necrosis factor-alpha, a proinflammatory cytokine, respectively. This downregulation due to elevated biliverdin results in decreased fat production and reduced inflammation, thus protecting against insulin resistance in patients indulging in high-fat diets.

Bilirubin and biliverdin have also been shown to be scavengers of hydroxyl peroxide groups showing the antioxidant effects of biliverdin.
