The exact primary histopathological location and nature of the vitelliform material needs further evaluation. A retina specialist is best equipped to manage this disease. Interprofessional coordination with various specialties including ophthalmology and genetics is important in the prognostication, management, and follow up of the disease. Specialty trained nurses in ophthalmology and genetics can improve outcomes by coordination communication between the interprofessional team and by assisting with patient coordination and family education. Pharmacists should review drug treatments, check for drug-drug interactions, and assess compliance. Concerns should be reported to the team. Due to its rarity, this is a difficult disease to evaluate and manage. Outcomes will be improved if an interprofessional team manages the care of these patients. [Level 5]
