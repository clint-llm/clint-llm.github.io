Vascular thrombi are formed in the setting of low flow and shear stress and mainly consist of fibrin strands, red blood cells, and a few platelets. In 1856, Rudolf Virchow, a renowned Berlin scientist and physician recognized these factors due to his extensive work on venous thrombosis.

Rudolf Virchow is one of the first physicians to describe the concept at a cellular level, believing that most conditions, including pathological thrombosis, were caused by cellular pathology.

Virchow sought to explain the causation of pulmonary thromboembolism and theorized that pulmonary arterial embolus arises from peripheral/distant thrombosis. He attempted to explain the mechanism or define the specific conditions necessary to initiate peripheral clotting and how a thrombus may dislodge from a peripheral vein, travel to the right heart, and enter the pulmonary arterial system. The three factors of Virchow's triad include intravascular vessel wall damage, stasis of flow, and the presence of a hypercoagulable state.

In theory, **Virchow's triad**postulates the presence of three factors that predisposes a person to develop vascular thrombosis. These factors include:

- 
**Hypercoagulability of blood**

- 
**Alteration in blood flow in the vessels**

- 
**Vessel wall injury/ Endothelial damage**
