Pernio also referred to as chilblains, is a rare inflammatory condition. The term "chilblains" derives from two Old English words "chill" (cold) and "blegen" (sore). Most commonly, pernio affects acral skin and primarily results as a response to cold, damp conditions. It is typically idiopathic and acute; however, chronic forms have been identified. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of chilblains (pernio) and reviews the role of the healthcare team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors for developing chilblains/pernio.

- Describe the common physical exam findings of a patient presenting with pernio.
- Summarize the management of a patient presenting with chilblains.
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by chilblains.
