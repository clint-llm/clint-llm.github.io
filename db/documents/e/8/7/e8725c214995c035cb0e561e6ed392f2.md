Patients require education that M. furfur is one of a group of common commensal yeasts that normally inhabit human skin but may cause a variety of common dermatologic disorders. These conditions, including SD, PV, and Malassezia folliculitis, are benign and not contagious.

The appearance and symptoms of diseases linked with M. furfur vary widely among patients. For example, PV may present with lesions that appear different colors on patients with lighter or darker skin types and typically worsen in hot and humid conditions. To confirm the diagnosis, a physician will examine a skin scraping specimen under a microscope.

Treatment consists of using topical agents, such as special shampoos or creams, or pills taken by mouth for more extensive involvement. Consistent use of the shampoo may mitigate future occurrences. Physicians may recommend over-the-counter or prescription medications if itching is a significant symptom.
