The vast majority of cases of arachnoid cysts need no treatment. In cases when it has been determined that an arachnoid cyst is causing or is very likely causing symptoms, numerous surgical treatments exist. The surgical approach is often dictated by the location of the cyst and the involvement or lack of involvement of surrounding neurological structures. Surgical excision of the wall is performed with the creation of communication with the subarachnoid space when the lesion is readily amendable.

Rarely, the placement of a cystoperitoneal shunt is done.
