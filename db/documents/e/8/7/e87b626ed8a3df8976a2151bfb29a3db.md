The diagnosis and management of the Kruckenberg tumor are complex and should involve an interprofessional medical team that includes hospice staff, palliative care nurses, a pain specialist, oncologist, surgeon, pathologist, and radiologist. In all cases, this is metastatic disease, and the patients are frail and debilitated. Many patients may benefit from hospice care and pain control. The majority of patients are dead within 12 to 24 months with or without treatment.
