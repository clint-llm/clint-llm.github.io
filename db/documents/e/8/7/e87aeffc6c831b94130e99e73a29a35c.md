Neonatal HIV diagnostics differs from that of adults and older children. It is not appropriate to test for HIV antibodies. The utilization of novel combination antigen/antibody immunoassays to confirm the diagnosis of HIV in neonates is not recommended as positive results confer passive transfer of maternal antibodies. Maternal HIV antibodies persist until 18 months.

Infants are categorized as high or low risk for HIV infection. Neonates born to mothers who received adequate prenatal care and were adherent to their ART and who had undetectable viral loads are considered low risk. On the contrary, neonates are considered high risk if they were born to mothers who lacked prenatal care, had elevated HIV viral loads, and had a new diagnosis of HIV infection while pregnant.

The table below indicates (X) the proposed recommended testing schedule for HIV perinatal exposure.

After a confirmed diagnosis of HIV, additional labs should be ordered including CD4+ T-cell count, CD8+ T-cell count, plasma viral load of RNA, growth/development factors, and HIV-associated conditions, such as anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hepatic transaminitis, etc. Prior to the initiation of ART obtain genetic testing, a baseline CD4 count, plasma viral load, complete blood count (CBC), hepatic function, renal function, comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis, serum lipids, and blood glucose.
