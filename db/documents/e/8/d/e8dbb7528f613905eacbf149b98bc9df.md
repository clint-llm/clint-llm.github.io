Stewart-Treves syndrome is a rare and fatal disease arising from complications of chronic lymphedema. The first report of these findings came in 1948 when Stewart and Treves reported a case series describing 6 patients with lymphangiosarcoma in the setting of chronic lymphedema status post mastectomy. The reported incidence of developing angiosarcoma in patients surviving at least 5 years post radical mastectomy is 0.07% to 0.45%. Although the majority of Stewart-Treves syndrome-related angiosarcomas are a result of post-mastectomy lymphedema, the development of angiosarcoma has been associated with chronic lymphedema of any origin. The specific mechanism between chronic lymphedema and angiosarcoma is unknown. Stewart and Treves postulated the role of a systemic carcinogenic factor responsible for this process. It has also been suggested that a neoplastic transformation occurs in lymphedematous areas during development of collateral circulation. Other theories consist of a malignant transformation due to blockage of lymphatic drainage and impaired antigen presentation, resulting in malignancy avoiding immune surveillance in an “immunologically privileged site.”
