Pedicled and free latissimus transfer takes place in the operating room with sterile technique. Some surgeons prefer to harvest the flap with the patient in a prone position, then flip the patient into a supine position mid-case for flap inset. However, the flap can be successfully harvested with the patient in a lateral decubitus or even supine position with the aid of a padded bump or extra surgical tech to hold the body in a slightly rotated position. The flap can be harvested, transferred, and inset with standard surgical instruments and monopolar electrocautery. If free tissue transfer is performed, a microscope, microsurgical instruments, and a surgeon trained in microvascular surgery are required.
