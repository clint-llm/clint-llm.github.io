Strongyloides stercoralis is prevalent in almost every part of the world except Antarctica. According to one study, this soil-transmitted nematode is estimated to have infected 370 million people globally, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions, where 10 to 40% of the population is affected.

Worldwide and local prevalence of Strongyloides is seriously underestimated because of the low sensitivity of tests and poor reporting in high-incidence countries. It is more frequently found in warm, moist areas and areas with poor sanitary conditions. Some studies have reported incidences as high as 91% in Gabon and 75% in Peru, but the prevalence varies widely depending on the diagnostic methods used.

In developed countries, Strongyloidiasis is more frequently seen in farmers and miners, as well as immigrant populations, tourists, and military personnel returning from high-prevalence areas. In the United States, the highest incidence is in immigrants from Africa and Asia (46% in one study evaluating Sudanese refugees), followed by Central and Latin America.

There is a slight predilection for the male sex. This is thought to be due to increased exposure to the source of infection due to involvement in farming, fieldwork, etc.
