There are several formulations and routes of administration for combinations of levodopa and carbidopa. The basis for dosing is weight, with a ratio of 10:1 or 4:1, levodopa to carbidopa.

- There are formulations of both immediate release and sustained release of carbidopa/levodopa and a combination of carbidopa/levodopa and entacapone, a peripheral inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase.

- Extended-release capsule formations of carbidopa/levodopa are designed with beads that release medication at a constant rate for 4 to 5 hours after administration. The extended-release version has decreased "off-time" in more advanced patients with PD compared to immediate-release formulations.

- An intestinal gel infusion formulation of carbidopa/levodopa is a suspension of levodopa (20 mg/ml) and carbidopa (5 mg/ml) in 2.95% carboxymethylcellulose gel. This administration route is typically performed via a portable pump that runs through a naso-duodenal tube and later through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube following titration of the proper dose. This route of administration is reserved for the most severe cases of PD.

Overall, the variety of routes of administration and drug combinations demonstrate the balance between making the drug fast-acting, long-lasting, stable, and effective at treating the symptoms without causing unnecessary risk or adverse effects to the patient.

Whether given with carbidopa-levodopa or levodopa, the optimal daily dose of carbidopa must be determined by slow titration carefully. Most patients respond to a 1:10 ratio of carbidopa and levodopa, provided the daily dosage of carbidopa is 70 mg or higher. The maximum daily dose of carbidopa should not exceed 200 mg since there isn't adequate clinical experience with larger dosages. If the patient is taking carbidopa-levodopa, the amount of carbidopa in carbidopa-levodopa should be considered when calculating the total amount of carbidopa to be administered each day.

**Patients Receiving Carbidopa-Levodopa Who Require Additional Carbidopa**

Some patients taking carbidopa-levodopa may not have an adequate reduction in nausea and vomiting when the dose of carbidopa is less than 70 mg a day, and the dosage of levodopa is less than 700 mg a day. When these patients take carbidopa-levodopa, 25 mg of carbidopa may be given with the first dose of carbidopa-levodopa daily. Further doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg can be administered daily with each dose of carbidopa-levodopa. Carbidopa may be administered with any dose of carbidopa-levodopa required for optimal therapeutic response. However, the maximum daily dose of carbidopa, given as carbidopa tablets and carbidopa-levodopa, should not exceed 200 mg.

**Patients needing Individual Titration of Carbidopa/Levodopa Dosage**

Although carbidopa/levodopa is the most frequently used method of carbidopa and levodopa administration, a few patients may require an individually titrated dose of these two drugs. Carbidopa should be initiated at a dosage of 25 mg three or four times a day in these patient populations. The two drugs should be given simultaneously, starting with not more than one-fifth (20%) to one-fourth (25%) of the previous or recommended daily dose of levodopa when given without carbidopa. In patients already taking levodopa therapy, at least twelve hours should lapse between the last dose of levodopa and the start of therapy with carbidopa and levodopa. Therefore, the appropriate way to start treatment in these patients is in the morning following a night when the patient has not taken any levodopa for a minimum of twelve hours.

**Dosage Adjustment**

The dose of carbidopa may be adjusted by adding or omitting one-half or one tablet daily. Because both therapeutic response and adverse reaction appear more rapidly with combination therapy than when only levodopa is administered, monitor patients closely during the dose titration period. The occurrence of involuntary movements may require dose reduction. Blepharospasm may be a good early sign of excess dosage in some patients. Current evidence suggests other standard antiparkinsonian medicines may be continued while carbidopa and levodopa are administered. However, the dose of such other standard antiparkinsonian medicines may require adjustment.

**Interruption of Therapy**

Few cases of confusion and hyperpyrexia have been reported with dose reductions and withdrawal of carbidopa-levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa extended-release. Therefore, patients should be observed closely if abrupt reduction or withdrawal of carbidopa/levodopa therapy is required, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptic medicines. If general anesthesia is needed, treatment may be continued as long as the patient is permitted to take fluids and medication orally. The patient should be monitored for symptoms resembling NMS when temporarily interrupted therapy. The usual daily dose may be resumed as soon as the patient can take medication orally.

**Pregnancy Considerations**

There are no well-controlled and adequate human studies conducted on pregnant women. It is reported from post-marketing individual case reports that levodopa can crosse the human placental barrier, enter the fetus, and get metabolized. Carbidopa concentrations in fetal tissue appear to be minimum. The use of carbidopa and levodopa tablets in women of childbearing potential requires that the anticipated benefits of the drug be outweighed against potential hazards to the mother and/or child.

**Lactation Considerations**

Several studies show that levodopa can lower serum prolactin during lactation. However, the prolactin level in mothers with established lactation may not affect their breastfeeding capability. The long-term effects of levodopa administration in breastfeeding women have not been adequately studied. However, some nursing women could successfully breastfeed their infant without apparent adverse effects while using low doses of levodopa/carbidopa for Parkinson's disease. Levodopa has been detected in human milk. Hence, caution should be exercised when carbidopa and levodopa are administered to a breastfeeding woman.

**Pediatric Considerations**

Effectiveness and safety in pediatric patients have not been established yet. Therefore,  carbidopa use in patients under 18 is not recommended.
