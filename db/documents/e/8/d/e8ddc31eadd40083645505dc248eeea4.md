Iatrogenic pneumothorax can be diagnosed clinically. Point-of-care ultrasound has the advantage of being rapid, highly sensitive and specific, and easily repeatable. Suggestive findings include the lack of pleural sliding. A "point sign" (sliding pleural next to non-sliding pleura) is diagnostic. An upright posteroanterior chest radiography has 83% sensitivity.
