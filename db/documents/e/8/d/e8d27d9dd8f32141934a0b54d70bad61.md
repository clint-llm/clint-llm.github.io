Long-term outcomes of the laparoscopic adjusted gastric band procedure are incredibly variable. This method was once one of the most popular weight loss procedures. It accounted for 42.3% of all bariatric surgeries worldwide in 2008.

Surgeons were discouraged from gastric banding due to its poor long-term outcomes and the need for close follow-up for frequent adjustments. It is a low-risk procedure in the perioperative period. However, it is associated with patient frustration and lower compliance rates, leading to poor excess weight loss. Despite this reputation, many publications demonstrate a low risk of reoperation and band removal, ranging from 1.2% to 3.7%, when evaluating long-term data for laparoscopic adjusted gastric banding.
