The mental status examination is a subjective assessment of a patient and may vary significantly between practitioners depending on their level of skill in observation and eliciting responses from the patient.

Several factors can limit the mental status examination. To perform an effective mental status examination, a certain level of trust needs to have been built with the patient to be able to have their cooperation and openness. Some patients are agitated to the point of being unable to answer questions or have to be sedated for safety concerns limiting the ability to perform a mental status examination. If a patient has an intellectual disability, or neurological disorder, observations and answers to questions require interpretation in the context of these conditions. If a patient is not English-fluent, had limited education from a different culture, is lacking in nutrition, has sleep deprivation, or is medically ill, they may not be able to understand everything asked.
