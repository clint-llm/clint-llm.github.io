The three steps in treating dehydration are as follows:

- Correction of fluid deficit; this includes fluid loss

- Maintenance therapy; this involves physiologic requirements of fluid and electrolytes

- Sustained replacement of continuing fluid losses

It is as effective as intravenous fluid in replacing fluid and electrolyte losses and has many advantages. The amount of fluid deficit should depend upon the change in weight (if available) or clinical signs.

The recommended rate is 50 mL to 100 mL/kg over 2 to 4 hours for oral fluids.

An isotonic solution should be administrated for the correction of volume depletion, regardless of the plasma sodium concentration. Frequent and periodic re-evaluation should be performed to ensure appropriate fluid volume is being administered. The fluid balance should be monitored in all children receiving IV fluids. This includes body weight and fluid input and output. In some children, when the physical examination is otherwise unremarkable, Ondansetron may be administered to control vomiting. This can reduce the need for intravenous therapy and hospitalization.

**Rate**

Parental fluid administration includes bolus and maintenance rates. Fluid bolus should be rapidly infused at 10 to 20 mL/kg of isotonic saline (0.9%).

The fluid administration rate is determined by maintenance requirements, estimated fluid deficit, and ongoing fluid losses. The maintenance rate can be calculated using the Holiday-Segar method.

**Tonicity**

Historically hypotonic IV fluids have been administered; however, several cases of morbidity and mortality were reported.

In 2018, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a key action statement that states, “children between twenty-eight days to eighteen years of age requiring maintenance intravascular fluids should receive isotonic solutions with appropriate potassium chloride (KCl) and dextrose.” This can significantly reduce the risk of hyponatremia.”

Care must be taken not to correct hypernatremia rapidly. A free water deficit in children with hypernatremia should be corrected slowly to avoid seizures and cerebral edema. It should be replaced over 48 hours to ensure a slow and gradual fall in the serum sodium concentration. The rapid administration of fluid can cause fluid shifts and a rapid fall in the extracellular fluid sodium concentration resulting in cerebral edema due to a large intracellular shift of fluid.

An update of a Cochrane review in 2018 concluded that the use of starches, dextrans, albumin, or gelatins as opposed to crystalloids has little if any effect on mortality.

**Dextrose**

In children, who are not taking adequate calories orally, 5% dextrose (D5) should be added to maintenance fluids. If hypoglycemia is present, it should be appropriately corrected.
