Staging

The American Joint Committee on Cancer uses the TNM system for staging tumors of the head and neck region by the site. It was recently updated to incorporate the prognostic impact of the presence of extranodal extension. Accordingly, clinically evident extranodal extension upstages the N-stage of a tumor to N3b.

T-stage is classified as follows:

- T0: No evidence of primary tumor

- Tis: Carcinoma in situ

- T1: Tumor 2cm or less with a depth of invasion (DOI) less than or equal to 5mm

- T2: Tumor 2cm or less with DOI more than 5mm OR tumor more than 2cm but less than or equal to 4cm

- T3: Tumor more than 2cm but less than or equal to 4cm with DOI more than 10mm OR tumor more than 4cm with DOI less than or equal to 10mm

- T4a: Tumor more than 4cm with DOI more than 10mm OR invades adjacent structures only (skin of the face, maxillary sinus, cortical bone of maxilla or mandible)

- T4b: Tumor invades masticator space, pterygoid plates, skull base, and/or encases the internal carotid artery.

N-stage or clinical nodal stage is classified as follows:

- N0: No regional nodes metastasis.

- N1: Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node 3cm or less in the greatest dimensionÂ - negative extranodal extension (ENE)

- N2a: Metastasis in a single ipsilateral lymph node more than 3cm but not larger than 6cm in the greatest dimension, negative ENE

- N2b: Metastasis in multiple ipsilateral lymph nodes, none more than 6cm in greatest dimension, negative ENE

- N2c: Metastasis in bilateral or contralateral lymph node(s), none more than 6cm in greatest dimension, negative ENE

- N3a: Metastasis in any lymph node more than 6cm in the greatest dimension, negative ENE

- N3b: Metastasis in a lymph node with clinically overt positive ENE

M-stage is classified as follows:

- MX: Distant metastasis cannot be assessed

- M0: No distant metastasis

- M1: Distant metastasis
