Plantar heel pain is a common problem among adults. It can lead to severe pain which causes significant disability and impairment of activities of daily living. Plantar heel pain can be due to local causes such as plantar fasciitis, referred causes like S1 radiculopathy, or systemic illness like seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA). The most common causes of plantar heel pain are plantar fasciitis, heel fat pad atrophy, calcaneal stress fractures, or entrapment of the tibial nerve, medial calcaneal nerve, or the first branch of the lateral plantar nerve (Baxter's nerve). This activity reviews the causes of plantar heel pain, illustrates a practical approach to identifying its underlying cause and outlines evidence-based management strategies. This activity illustrates the role of the interprofessional team in recognition and management of plantar heel pain.
