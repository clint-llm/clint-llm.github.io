Alexia ranges on a spectrum from very mild reading deficit to a complete inability to comprehend written language often associated with agraphia, the inability to write. The most common cause of alexia is a stroke (embolic or ischemic cerebral vascular accident) affecting the dominant cerebral hemisphere, although it may be caused by other etiologies resulting in a disruption to that area such as lesions, injury, or trauma.
