Pulmonary hypertension, also known as idiopathic pulmonary artery hypertension (IPAH), is a progressive disease that affects the precapillary pulmonary vasculature for which an exact underlying risk factor is unknown. The pulmonary artery pressure is persistently more than 25 mmHg at rest and more than 30 mmHg during exercise. It is a rare but fatal disease that has a high mortality. If left untreated, it may result in increasing back pressures and ultimately right heart failure and death. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension and the importance of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the WHO classification of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.
- Outline the presentation of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.
- Summarize the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.
