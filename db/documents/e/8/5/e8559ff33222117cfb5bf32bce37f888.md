The incidence of PG has been variably estimated, one case per 2000 up to 60,000 pregnancies. It is more frequent in persons with fair skin than dark skin. PG mainly occurs late in pregnancy with 60% of cases occurring between the 28th and the 32nd week of amenorrhea. Multigravidae are more susceptible to develop PG than primigravidae with an earlier onset of symptoms.

PG usually resolves within 2 months after delivery. Nonetheless, it may persist or exacerbate after pregnancy due to a sudden increase in the level of antibodies. Recurrence may occur with subsequent pregnancies, menstruations or treatment with estrogens and progesterone-containing oral contraceptives. Fetal risks observed in PG are low birth weight baby, prematurity, and temporary skin lesions which resolve several weeks after the birth, but there is no increased risk of stillbirth and abortion. This risk may be correlated with disease severity. A postpartum flare-up has been observed.

The association of this disease with hydatidiform mole and choriocarcinoma must not be forgotten.
