Patients older than 60 years old are a growing demographic in the developed world and are at higher risk for traumatic injury.  The definition of "elderly" or "geriatric" is a controversial topic.  Many articles base the definition of "geriatric" at age 65, but for the most part, this does not have a basis in evidence-based medicine.  Age 65 is commonly used as a default; however, evidence supports that a patient's preexisting conditions and comorbidities may be a better predictor of long term complications secondary to trauma.
