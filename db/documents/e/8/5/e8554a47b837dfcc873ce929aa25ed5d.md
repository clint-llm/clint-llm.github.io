Sudden unexpected death in athletes has been primarily viewed as a disease of cardiac etiology.

**Cardiac Etiologies**

**Structural Abnormalities**

- Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)

- Dilated cardiomyopathy

- Coronary artery anomaly

- Left ventricular hypertrophy

- Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease

- Left ventricular noncompaction

- Arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia

- Aortopathy

- Congenital aorticÂ stenosis

- Mitral valve prolapse

**Structurally Normal Heart**

- Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome

- Congenital long QT syndrome

- Acquired long QT syndrome

- Brugada syndrome

- Atrioventricular blocks

- Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia

- Short QT syndrome

- Early repolarisation syndrome

- Idiopathic ventricular fibrillation

- Mixed sodium channel disease

- Stray electric currents created by the athlete's chest muscles

- Environmentally created static electricity

**Other**

- Stimulant use

- Anabolic steroid use

- Commotio cordis

- Aortic rupture

- Myocarditis
