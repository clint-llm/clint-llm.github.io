Warfarin toxicity is quite common and is best managed by an interprofessional team. Clinicians need to educate the patient on the need to closely monitor their diet and dose. Clinicians including pharmacists also have the responsibility of ensuring that the patient is on no other medications that can interact adversely with warfarin. Nursing can also contribute to uncovering risks during patient visits and report concerns to the prescriber or consult with the pharmacist. For patients deemed at high risk for warfarin toxicity, switching to the newer oral anticoagulants may be an option.

Warfarin toxicity usually requires admission and increases the costs of healthcare. The outcomes depend on the presence of bleeding in the brain; those with CNS bleed usually have poor outcomes.
