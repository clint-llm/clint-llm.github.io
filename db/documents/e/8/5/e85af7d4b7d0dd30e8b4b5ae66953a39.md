The accepted definition of an anomaly is a developmental finding that occurs in less than 1% of the population, as opposed to an anatomic or normal variant, which occurs in greater than 1% of the general population.

The frequency of coronary artery anomalies has been defined as 0.78 to 1.3% of the general population (as determined by invasive coronary angiography) but shows a higher incidence of 0.99% to 5.8% on CCTA studies due to the higher sensitivity of CCTA and its broader inclusion criteria compared to invasive angiography.
