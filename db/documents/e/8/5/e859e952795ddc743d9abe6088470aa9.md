Blood supply to the semilunar ganglion comes from the middle meningeal artery, accessory middle meningeal artery, the inferolateral trunk of the internal carotid artery, and the tentorial branch of the superior cerebellar artery. The trigeminal nerve root acquires vascular supply from the superolateral pontine artery, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, inferolateral or posterolateral pontine arteries, superior cerebellar artery, basilar artery, and trigeminocerebellar artery. The motor root and the ophthalmic portion of the sensory root usually receive blood supply from the superolateral pontine artery while the maxillary portion receives blood supply from the superolateral and inferolateral pontine arteries and the mandibular portion of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery. Most of the blood supply to the semilunar ganglion is supplied by the middle meningeal artery and inferolateral trunk of the internal carotid artery.

As discussed previously, the superior petrosal sinus lies in close proximity to Meckel's cave and provides venous drainage of the cavernous sinus. It passes posterolaterally from this point to drain into theÂ junction of the sigmoid and transverse sinuses.
