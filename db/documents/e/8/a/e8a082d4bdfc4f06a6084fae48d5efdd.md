The semilunar valves develop from the endocardial cushions around the 5th week of embryonic development. The aortic valve begins as a swelling of the endocardial cushions.Â The valve then undergoes additional remodeling in the presence of ventricular ejection streams.

Endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells will form the aortic root and aortic valve; this results from the embryological collaboration between the splanchnic mesoderm and the neural crest, deriving from the second heart field.
