Vaginal prolapse includes prolapse of the bladder (cystocele), bowel (rectocele), or uterus. Prolapse occurs when structures of the levator ani are weakened, with the pelvic fascia subsequently becoming overstretched. There are four main support sites; damage to these areas leads to a descend of pelvic organs through the walls of the vagina. According to the anatomical site, cystoceles can be classified as apical, medial, and lateral.

An apical defect is localized in the upper segment of the vagina and is caused by a defect of the endopelvic fascia. They contribute to the development of stress urinary incontinence (SUI) because of the interruption of the urethra-vesical junction.

A medial defect is caused by the separation of the pubocervical fascia from connective tissue around the cervix and damage to uterosacral ligaments. This can present as a large cystocele.

A lateral defect results in vaginal wall separation from the arcus tendinous, causing a reduction of the lateral vaginal sulcus on one or both sides.
