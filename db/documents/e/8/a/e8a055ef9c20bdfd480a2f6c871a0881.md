Mild cases of acalculous cholecystitis are usually only treated for symptoms of biliary colic. Cases of acute cholecystitis can lead to sepsis and shock. The pressurized intraluminal gallbladder bile can be susceptible to bacterial seeding. Antibiotics are usually ineffective due to the increased intraluminal pressure and compromise of the intraluminal blood supply. Eventual perforation will lead to bile peritonitis and contribute to the shock condition. The release of inflammatory byproducts also contributes to shock and susceptibility to sepsis.
