The defective fibrocystin gene manifests early during organ development. It leads to remodeling of the ductal plate during embryogenesis as it matures into a branching biliary tree proximal to the portal vein tracts, and effects enhance over time. On a microscopic level,Â there is dilatation of large bile ducts with marked peri-ductal inflammation, bridging fibrosis, and soft tissue protrusions into the dilated ducts. These dilatations are intra-ductal and in communication with the extra-hepatic tree. This can sometimes be limited to only one lobe; the left lobe is most common. When congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) develops, the microscopic features involve fibrosis and enlarged portal tracts, and hypoplastic portal vein branches with abnormal branching angles.
