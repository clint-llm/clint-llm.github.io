Three-view plain x-ray studies of the cervical spine are the most common studies ordered for evaluation of neck and upper extremity pain. Lateral views may show disc space narrowing. Oblique views may show foraminal narrowing at the level of radicular symptoms. Open mouth views are only necessary if disruption of the atlantoaxial joint is suspected.

Computed tomogram (CT) scanning may be useful in the acute setting for the diagnosis of traumatic injuries resulting in radicular symptoms. Poor visualization of soft tissue makes CT less effective outside of this setting.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging method of choice for evaluating radiculopathies. MRI provides excellent visualization of soft tissue abnormalities including disc herniations and nerve compressions. There is a risk of falsely positive MRI studies as disc herniations and foraminal narrowing, while strongly correlated with radicular symptoms, may not be causative in any individual case.

Electromyography can be useful in confirming the dysfunction of the affected nerve root.

Selective nerve root blocks can be used not only as a treatment adjunct to provide short-term pain relief to patients with radicular pain but also can be effective in confirming nerve root origins of radiated pain.
