The placement of a feeding tube is usually an elective procedure. There may be a few instances where a surgeon will choose to place a feeding tube in concurrent with an emergent procedure if long term tube feeding is anticipated, but this is not widely the case. The patient should, therefore, be medically optimized, anticoagulation held if possible. The anesthesia provider should exam and evaluate the patient prior to the procedure as these patients are usually in-house, allowing any preoperative concerns to be addressed prior to the procedure. The patient should be kept NPO after midnight prior to the procedure. If the patient is receiving feedings via a nasoenteric or oroenteric tube, these tube feedings should be held as well.
