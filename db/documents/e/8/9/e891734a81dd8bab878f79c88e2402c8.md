Long-term outcome studies of binge eating disorder demonstrate that the prognosis of binge eating disorder is better than other eating disorders with a more favorable remission rate. The tendency of binge eating disorder to convert to other eating disorders is very small. Only a few studies have reported increased odds of migration to bulimia nervosa. Depressive symptoms and substance abuse are two significant adverse mental health outcomes of binge eating disorder.

Binge eating disorder in childhood predicts excess weight gain in adolescent and young women. It also independently increased the risk of obesity-related complications, for example, metabolic syndrome.
