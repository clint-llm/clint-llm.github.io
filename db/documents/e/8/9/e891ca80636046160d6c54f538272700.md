Trichinella, the intestinal roundworm that causes trichinosis is primarily seen in raw or insufficiently cooked commercial pork, specifically, domestic and sylvatic swine (Sus scrofa). Other common hosts are synanthropic animals like cats, dogs, brown rats, and armadillos. It can, however, be acquired from wild game as well, particularly meat that has not been frozen or cooked properly. Since 1975, Walrus and bear meat have shown increased associations with trichinosis.
