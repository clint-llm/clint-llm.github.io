Smokeless tobacco keratosis may presents with a non-specific appearance, with hyperkeratotic and/or acanthotic squamous epithelium. Intracellular edema and increased sub-epithelial vascularity may also be noted. Of note, parakeratin chevrons above or within the superficial epithelial layers can generally be visualized. Therefore, histologic examination of these lesions should evaluate for epithelial dysplasia.

Leukoplakia presents with hyperkeratosis, which is a thickened keratin layer, possible acanthosis, and a thickened spinous layer. The diagnosis of leukoplakia is a clinical term only, and a biopsy is required to determine a definitive diagnosis. The biopsy should be collected from the most severe site.

Over 90% of erythroplakia lesions present histopathologically with epithelial dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma. Keratin is typically not produced, and atrophy of the epithelium is generally noted.

Verrucous carcinomas have a deceptively benign histopathologic presentation. These lesions exhibit wide, elongated rete pegs that push into underlying connective tissue and have abundant parakeratin clefts between surface projections. The epithelial cells are not generally dysplastic; however, an intense inflammatory infiltrate is likely to be noted in the submucosa.

Squamous cell carcinoma arises from the dysplastic epithelium. Histologically it presents as cords or islands of malignant epithelial cells penetrating/invading through the basement membrane into the submucosa below. In addition, severe inflammatory cell infiltrates within the submucosa are often noted in response to the invasion.
