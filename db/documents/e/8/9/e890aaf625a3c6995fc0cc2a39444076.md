As stated above, the triangle of auscultation is an important anatomical landmark which allows for prime pulmonary auscultation. Auscultation of breath sounds is part of performing a routine lung examination. If a clinician does not hear equal air entry bilaterally, then it is time to consider conditions leading to airway obstruction such as inhaled foreign objects or a collapsed lung. If auscultation reveals wheezes, then the patient could have an obstructive condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. If rhonchi are heard then the patient could be suffering from COPD, bronchiectasis, pneumonia, bronchitis, or cystic fibrosis. If the examiner hears rales, then fluidÂ is trapped inside the alveoli and could be secondary to heart failure or pulmonary infection. An examiner can encounter all these findings during the pulmonary examination. The triangle of auscultation allows the clinician to listen better to the patient's lungs and guide them to the proper diagnosis.
