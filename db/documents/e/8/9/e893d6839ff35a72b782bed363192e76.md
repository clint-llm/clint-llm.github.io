Adverse reactions are reported to be different in children versus adults. Typically leuprolide is well tolerated in children, but the most common complaint is local pain at the injection site, which occurs in 10% of cases. Other common reactions include weight change, mood changes, skin rash, acne vulgaris, seborrhea, vaginal discharge, vaginal hemorrhage, and vaginitis. Reports also exist of anaphylactic reactions.
