All wounds should be extensively irrigated and the patient’s tetanus status updated if necessary.  Provide appropriate pain management before exploration, irrigation, or debridement of the wounds.  All human bite wounds that pierce the skin should receive amoxicillin-clavulanate prophylaxis for a week, and the patient is given strict wound care precautions.  The patient's TDaP status should be updated if necessary.  Any laceration to the MCP-joint is a closed-fist injury until proven otherwise.  If signs or symptoms of infection in a joint space or tendon sheath are present orthopedics should be consulted for evaluation for surgical washout and inpatient treatment with IV antibiotics.  Repair of lacerations from human bites should follow the same principles as that of other bites and in most cases should be left to heal by secondary intention to prevent providing a more hospitable environment for bacteria to reproduce.
