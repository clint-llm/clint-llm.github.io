In the era of technological advances, a thorough examination of the respiratory system retains its importance in diagnosing disorders of the respiratory system. Auscultation of the chest is among the oldest bedside diagnostic techniques used to assess airflow through airways. It is an easy, safe, non-invasive and cost-effective diagnostic technique. The majority of the manifestations of respiratory disease present with abnormalities of chest examination. Egophony is increased resonance of voice sounds heard when auscultating the lungs. When spoken voices are auscultated over the chest, a nasal quality is imparted to the sound which resembles the bleating of a goat. This activity describes the technique of auscultation and how it can be used to detect various chest pathologies.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the technique of auscultation.
- Describe egophony and its clinical relevance.
- Summarize the chest disorders that can be detected by egophony.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the use of the stethoscope and make diagnosis at the bedside.
