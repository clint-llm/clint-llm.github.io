There are two types of restless legs syndrome, primary restless legs syndrome and secondary restless legs syndrome.

Secondary restless legs syndrome can occur secondary to some disorders including:

- Iron deficiency

- End-stage renal disease

- Diabetes mellitus

- Rheumatic disease

- Venous insufficiency

- Peripheral neuropathy

- Folate or magnesium deficiency

- Amyloidosis

- Lumbosacral radiculopathy

- Fibromyalgia

- Celiac disease

- Medications have been known to cause or exacerbate the symptoms of restless legs syndrome. They include antidopaminergic medications (e.g., neuroleptics), diphenhydramine, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), alcohol, caffeine, lithium, and beta-blockers.

Restless leg syndrome affects close to 1/3rd of pregnant patients, but luckily the symptoms subside in a few weeks after delivery. However, in a long-term, follow-up study, patients who developed RLS during pregnancy demonstrated a 4-fold increased risk of having chronic RLS as opposed to women with no RLS during pregnancy.

RLS has been observed in 25-50% of patients with end-stage renal disease; the symptoms in these patients are typically worse during hemodialysis. One study observed that anxiety, hyperphosphatemia, and coping mechanisms for stress were independently related to RLS in uremic patients undergoing hemodialysis.RLS may resolve after kidney transplantation.
