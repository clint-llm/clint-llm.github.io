The management of a femoral artery aneurysm is by an interprofessional team that includes an interventional cardiologist, radiologist, or a vascular surgeon. Today, minimally invasive procedures are used to close pseudoaneurysms of the femoral artery. but if the patient has atherosclerotic disease, then an open procedure with patch repair may be useful. It is important to communicate with the team on the type of closure planned. Recurrences are rare but may include loss of pulses, hematoma, and infection.
