Multi-faceted approach with vascular trained physicians who are both skilled in minimally invasive procedures and open procedures would undoubtedly enhance the outcome of these patients. Also, appropriate pre-operative workup with physician evaluation from other specialties can also be necessary for improving patient outcomes in populations with co-morbid conditions (particularly, other cardiac, renal, or pulmonary co-morbidities). Radiologists with experience in reading vascular studies are also crucial for helping to determine the extent of disease accurately. Anesthesia is essential intraoperatively for monitoring of blood pressure and treatment of reperfusion hypotension. Specialty-trained nurses play a vital role in post-operative management and monitoring of the patient's hemodynamic status and urine output. They should assist the interprofessional team in coordination of care, patient and family education, and monitoring of the patient's progress; reporting any untoward changes in the patient's condition to the team. All these disciplines need to collaborate to guide cases to optimal outcomes. [Level V]

The TASC II (Inter-Society Consensus for the Management of Peripheral Arterial Disease) recommends that patients be evaluated to undergo endovascular intervention first, if able (Level of Evidence B, Level III). Type A & B lesions in TASC classification are recommended to undergo endovascular therapy (Level of Evidence C, Level V). Whereas low-risk Type D lesions and low-risk surgical patients with Type C lesions are recommended to undergo surgical intervention (Level of Evidence C, Level V).
