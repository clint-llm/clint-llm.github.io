Powassan virus (POW) is an arbovirus within the family of Flaviviruses primarily found in the Northeastern United States, Canada, and Russia.

Neurologic manifestations represent the most severe POW virus infection presentation, and the majority of cases that present requiring medical care are characterized by encephalitis or meningoencephalitis. In neurologic involvement cases, the case fatality rate is estimated to be between 10% to 15%.

Evaluation for POW virus infection should be undertaken in those who present with geographic risk factors and a syndrome consistent with encephalitis or meningoencephalitis.
