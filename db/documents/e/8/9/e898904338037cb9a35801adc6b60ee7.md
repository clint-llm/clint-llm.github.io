Recovery time can be reasonably expected to take 3 to 5 days for most individuals, though swelling and bruising may persist for up to 2 weeks, depending on the extent of surgery (size of implant), among other individual patient factors. Pain is typically mild to moderate; however, over-the-counter analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen 1000 mg every 8 hours as needed for pain) may be supplemented with prescription-strength medication per physician and patient preference. Post-operative antibiotics (with oral flora coverage) may be given for 5 to 7 days and is strongly encouraged if a transoral approach was used. The patient is instructed to eat a soft diet (avoiding biting with the front teeth), keep the head elevated, routinely apply ice to the area, employ good oral hygiene (e.g., salt water rinses before and after meals), and avoid strenuous activity for two weeks — patients follow-up in roughly seven days for wound assessment and suture removal. Photographic documentation may take place at the 3-month visit.
