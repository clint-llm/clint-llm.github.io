Xanthine oxidase is the enzyme required to produce uric acid by the breakdown of purine nucleotides. The uric acid itself, as well as the reactive oxygen species released during the enzymatic reaction, can have detrimental effects on the body. Gout is a common condition that occurs due to elevated uric acid production via this mechanism. As a result, many drugs have been formed to combat gout, by inhibiting xanthine oxidase enzyme activity. Moreover, regulations of this enzyme have proven to be effective for anti-cancer purposes.
