All patients with clinically suspected myocarditis must undergo vigilant monitoring in the hospital for acute decompensation.

- Clinically unstable patients must undergo endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) without delay; for stable patients, one might consider a cardiac MRI.

- Sampling for EMB must be adequate, and it should be supplemented by immunohistochemical staining, HLA typing PCR, and viral genome analysis; inconclusive results delay treatment.

- Etiologic treatment for myocarditis cannot be started without EMB, which differentiates infective from autoimmune causes, and determines whether the patient needs antimicrobial or immunosuppressive therapy.

- Prognostic information plays a vital role in guiding treatment; for example, a patient with fulminant myocarditis may require aggressive interventions like ventricular assist devices or ECMO, because he/she is expected to make a full recovery after the resolution of myocarditis.

- Patients must avoid physical activity until complete resolution of symptoms, or at least until 6 months from the onset because of increased risk of sudden death.

Clinicians, nurses, and pharmacists caring for a patient with myocarditis must work together to provide close monitoring and alert the team when there are signs or symptoms of developing decompensation.
