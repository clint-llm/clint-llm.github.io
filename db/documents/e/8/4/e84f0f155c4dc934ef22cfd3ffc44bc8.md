The basis of burn classification is depth. When examining a burn, there are four components needed to assess depth: appearance, blanching to pressure, pain, and sensation.

**Partial Thickness**

Superficial (first-degree) involves the epidermis of the skin only. It appears pink to red, there are no blisters, and it is dry. It is moderately painful. Superficial burns heal without scarring within 5 to 10 days.

Superficial partial-thickness (second-degree) involves the superficial dermis. It appears red with blisters and is wet. The erythema blanches with pressure. The pain associated with superficial partial-thickness is severe. Healing typically occurs within 3 weeks with minimal scarring.

Deep partial-thickness (second-degree) involves the deeper dermis. It appears yellow or white, is dry, and does not blanch with pressure. There is minimal pain due to a decreased sensation. Healing occurs in 3 to 8 weeks with scarring present.

**Full Thickness**

Third-degree involves the full thickness of skin and subcutaneous structures. It appears white or black/brown. With pressure, no blanching occurs. The burn is leathery and dry. There is minimal to no pain because of decreased sensation. Full-thickness burns heal by contracture and take greater than 8 weeks. Full-thickness burns require skin grafting.

Fourth degree shows charred skin with possible exposed bone.

Fifth degree has charred, white skin, and exposed bone.

Sixth degree has loss of skin with exposed bone.
