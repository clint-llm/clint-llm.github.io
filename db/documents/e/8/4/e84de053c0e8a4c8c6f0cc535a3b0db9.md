Once other causes of cognitive decline are ruled out, polypharmacy triggering a mild cognitive decline in the elderly should be the working diagnosis. After a thorough discussion with the patient and family, the patient's other providers' focus on adjusting medications should be an integral part of managing geriatric cognitive decline related to polypharmacy.

A clear understanding of polypharmacy and its relation to cognitive decline is essential in managing this complex geriatric syndrome. There is no specific treatment for polypharmacy-related cognitive decline.

Deprescribing - Total number of medications taken by patients is the single most important predictor of inappropriate medication use. Deprescribing has been demonstrated as a helpful tool in the optimization of medication management. The goal is to target one drug at a time. First, look for medications that have no valid reason for being used, assess risk versus benefit, and prioritize removing medicines with the lowest help with high risk. Avoid prescribing cascade (when medications are used to treat the side effects of other medications) and new to market medications. If the patient takes over-the-counter herbal or supplement products, assess their efficacy and safety. Always run patients' prescription and over-the-counter medicines, herbal products, and accessories through a point of care interaction checker in an app or online.

Studies have demonstrated that deprescribing is feasible in the clinical setting, especially when it incorporates patient preferences, shared decision making, and an interdisciplinary team. Medication-specific algorithms can facilitate deprescribing in the clinical environment.

Creating a systematic method to address polypharmacy in older patients by properly performing medical reconciliation during every visit, minimizing the use of potentially inappropriate medications, and ensuring appropriate monitoring can help improve long-term outcomes and avoid medication-related adverse events and cognitive decline. Polypharmacy contributes to significant medical and economic burdens on patients and their families, and providers should use patient-focused approaches. Discussing alternative nonpharmacologic methods to treat simple symptoms should be a priority. The goal in managing polypharmacy is to improve and optimize patients' overall function and quality of life.
