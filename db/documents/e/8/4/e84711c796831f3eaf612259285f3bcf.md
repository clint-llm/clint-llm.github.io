The common femoral artery forms as a continuation of the external iliac artery inferior to the level of the inguinal ligament. The common femoral artery is located just medial to the midpoint of the inguinal ligament in the inguinal crease region. The two bony landmarks useful for identifying the inguinal ligament are the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic symphysis. The average common femoral artery measures approximately 4 cm in length and lies just anterior to the femoral head [3]. The average length and diameter of the common femoral artery can be quite variable depending on individual characteristics such as height, weight, sex and body surface area

Distal to the origin of these smaller branches, the common femoral artery bifurcates into the deep femoral (or profunda femoris) and superficial femoral artery.

The superficial femoral artery plays a crucial role inÂ delivering oxygenated blood to the entire lower leg. Before entering the adductor canal, it gives off the descending genicular artery that supplies part of the knee.

The femoral vein courses posterior to the femoral artery through the adductor canal.

The deep femoral artery gives rise to medial and lateral circumflex arteries that supply the femur and hip region before it dives deep into the thigh compartment and terminates as perforating deep tissue branches.
