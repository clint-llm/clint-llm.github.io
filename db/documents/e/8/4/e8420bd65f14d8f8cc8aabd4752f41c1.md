While the Tullio phenomenon cannot be considered a diagnostic tool for a particular disease, which Tullio had hoped for, it can point towards a cochleovestibular or other otologic pathology that warrants further investigation. A detailed history and thorough physical exam can narrow the differential, but additional testing may be required, including an audiogram, tympanogram, stapedial reflexes, fistula test, videonystagmography, electrocochleography, and CT imaging.
