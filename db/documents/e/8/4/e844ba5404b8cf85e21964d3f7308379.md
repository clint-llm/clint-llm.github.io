- The most common form of ocular tuberculosis is from hematogenous spread.

- Ocular TB can involve any part of the eye and can occur with or without evidence of pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB disease.

- The most common ocular TB manifestation is granulomatous uveitis. The most common presentation is posterior uveitis.

- The most typical lesions related to ocular TB are choroidal granulomas, occlusive retinal vasculitis, and multifocal serpiginous-like choroiditis.

- The gold standard for diagnosis is the identification of M. tuberculosis in culture. However, this is rarely possible. PCR of ocular fluid is a recent alternative to cultures but not widely available. Diagnosis, in most cases, is “presumed ocular TB”. Ocular findings must be supported in context with risk factor history, chest radiography findings, and TST or IGRA testing. Negative tests do not rule out ocular TB.

- Treatment of ocular TB is the same as for pulmonary TB, and concomitant steroid therapy is often required.
