The female genitalia, the lower urinary tract, and the surrounding vasculature develop from the same embryologic tissue with similar estrogen receptors. Estrogen receptor alpha is primarily found in the uterus and pituitary gland. The estrogen receptor alpha is present during premenopause and postmenopause. Estrogen receptor beta is primarily found in the ovary. The estrogen receptor beta is present predominately in the premenopausal state, leading to the ovarian failure state experienced in menopause.

Premenopausal vaginal tissues mature in normal estrogen ranges of 30Â to 40 pg/ml, which allows for adequate growth of vaginal epithelium with superficial squamous cells containing glycogen. Lactobacilli spp. utilize the glycogen from the cells and convert it into lactic acid, creating a slightly acidic environment with a pH of 3.5 to 5.0. Free glycogen is also associated with lower pH and higher levels of lactobacillus. In menopause, vaginal tissue is exposed to estrogen less than 20pg/ml resulting in fewer superficial squamous epithelial cells with an increase in parabasal cells. The higher concentration of parabasal cells and reduced Lactobacillus spp. leads to a decrease in lactic acid conversion, producing a higher pH of 5.0 to 7.5 environment. (1,2) The consequence of elevated vaginal pH is a shift in normal flora, Lactobacilli spp., and more susceptible to other pathogens such as Gardnerella, Prevoltella, Atopobium, and Streptococcus.
