The clinicians and social workers working for the IHS face a special challenge. The mistrust of the AIAN community in the IHS and the inability to provide comprehensive services due to chronic underfunding raises innumerable barriers to providing care to the AIAN community.

When approaching a patient from the AIAN community, it is important to pay special attention to their traditions and history. Many patients, especially those living in non-urban areas, use the services of traditional healers. It is important to note this, as a negative approach towards a traditional healer may break the communication with the patient. It is important to note the habits of the patient (like the use of alcohol, tobacco, etc.), occupational history, family history.

As noted above, post-traumatic stress disorder is prevalent in the AIAN community, and the majority of the community reports trauma in one form or the other. The history of trauma, especially in women and children, must be elicited. In addition to this, every opportunity should be used to suggest and promote vaccinations and cancer screening.
