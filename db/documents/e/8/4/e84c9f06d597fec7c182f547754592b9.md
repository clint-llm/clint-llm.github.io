The diagnosis of corneal epithelial microsporidiosis is mainly clinical, and corneal scraping is not done routinely. However, in suspicious cases, corneal scraping helps reach the diagnosis. The scraping on Gram staining shows intra-epithelial gram-positive oval-shaped spores of microsporidia. Corneal button in microsporidial stromal keratitis, when subjected to histopathology, reveals PAS (periodic acid–Schiff)-positive oval-shaped spores measuring 3.5 to 5 micrometer by 2.5 to 3 micrometer.

On electron microscopy, sporoblasts with thick capsules are noted with 11 to 13 coils of filaments.
