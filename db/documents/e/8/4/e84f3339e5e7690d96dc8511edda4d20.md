The medical management of hypoparathyroidism is done by an interprofessional team that consists of an emergency department physician, endocrinologist, surgeon, and primary care provider. In all cases of acute hypocalcemia, intravenous calcium is required if the patient is symptomatic. In chronic cases, lifelong calcium supplements and calcitriol are necessary. All patients with hypoparathyroidism need periodic monitoring of their calcium, phosphorus, renal function, and urine calcium excretion. When treatment is initiated, calcium levels should be checked every few weeks. Once patients are on a stable dose of calcium and calcitriol, the frequency of monitoring can be reduced to every 3 to 6 months.

The absence of PTH reduces the renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Therefore, patients treated for hypoparathyroidism are at risk of urolithiasis or renal and other soft tissue calcifications. These risks can be minimized by titrating therapy to keep the serum calcium level in the low-normal range and avoid hypercalciuria. While most hypoparathyroidism is still treated with calcitriol and calcium, selected patients who are more challenging to control on traditional therapy can be treated with daily subcutaneous injections of recombinant human parathyroid hormone (1-84). Parathyroid hormone replacement can reduce the oral calcium and calcitriol requirements and, in some, eliminate the need to use calcitriol. In addition, it can improve bone turnover and quality of life.
