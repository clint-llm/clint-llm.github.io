Bilateral acoustic neuromas may be a part of neurofibromatosis type 2 occurring due to a defect on chromosome 22q12.2 at the location of the neurofibromin 2 gene which encodes merlin protein. Studies have shown that acoustic neuroma had a causative predisposition mutation. Radiation exposure may predispose a patient to the development of that condition as well.
