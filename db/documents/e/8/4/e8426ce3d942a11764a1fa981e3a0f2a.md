Topical bacitracin is contraindicated in anyone with hypersensitivity to bacitracin and/or any of its drug formulation components. Patients with known hypersensitivity to neomycin may also be sensitive to bacitracin.

Bacitracin application on an infection or wound that is caused by a viral or fungal infection may increase the risk for the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

Topical bacitracin use is recommended only for minor skin injuries and should not be used over larger areas of the body.

Before using topical bacitracin, physician consultation is recommended for serious injuries such as burns, deep wounds, puncture wounds, or animal bites.
