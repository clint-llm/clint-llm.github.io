Due to the cardiotoxic profile of doxorubicin, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be assessed and monitored routinely using an echocardiogram. An LVEF drop of greater than 10% from baseline is considered indicative of cardiotoxicity, and immediate intervention by physicians and the healthcare team is required. An alternative to echocardiogram monitoring is radionuclide ventriculography, such as multi-gated acquisition angiogram (MUGA) or equilibrium radionuclide angiogram (ERNA) scans, although less frequently used.

Obtain baseline complete blood counts (CBC), hepatic enzymes, and tests of hepatic function.
