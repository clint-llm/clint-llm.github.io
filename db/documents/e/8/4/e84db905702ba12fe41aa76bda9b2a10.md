According to the Jehovahâ€™s Witnesses religion, portions of the Bible (including Genesis, Leviticus, and Acts) state that its followers must abstain from receiving blood.

Other patients are unable to accept blood products due to medical reasons. Examples include patients with hemolysis and antibody formation due to transfusion reactions or those with crossmatch incompatibility.

Patients who cannot accept blood transfusions for medical or religious purposes are at increased risk of morbidity and death after acute and unexpected blood loss from conditions including postpartum bleeding, trauma, and intraoperative hemorrhage.
