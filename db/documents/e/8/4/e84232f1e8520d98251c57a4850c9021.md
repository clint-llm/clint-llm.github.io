**Clinical Features**

(A) Movement disorder like features:

- Signs and symptoms resembling parkinsonism, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, hypophonia, hypomimia, mask-like facies, shuffling gait

- Clumsiness

- Fatigability

- Gait dysfunction

- Choreoathetosis

- Dystonia

- Slurred speech

- Muscle cramping

- Pyramidal or cerebellar symptoms (rarely)

(B) Neuropsychiatric features

- Depression

- Apoplexia

- Dementia, mostly fronto-executive type resembling subcortical dementia in Wilson disease and Huntington disease

- Concentration deficits

- Behavioral changes

(C) Other CNS features

- Loss of consciousness

- Tetany

- Seizures

- Spasticity

- Speech impairment

- Myoclonus

- Coma

- Papilledema

- Chronic headache

- Vertigo

- Urinary urgency or incontinence

- Impotence

- Severe hypertension

In a study done by Batla et al., a clinical correlation with genomic abnormalities (genotype-phenotype relationship) was established after reviewing 137 cases. Those with SLC20A2 mutations were more commonly observed to have parkinsonism and involvement of the thalamus and dentate nucleus. Those with PDGFB mutations were observed to have a headache more commonly and cysts in white matter.

**Physical Examination**

- General physical examination

- Complete neurological examination

- Mental health screening

- Memory and cognitive assessment

- Functional outcome measures

- Functional independence measure (FIM)
- Dynamic gait index
- Timed up and go test (TUG)
- Fullerton advanced balance scale (FAB)
