Antacids are available as over-the-counter medications, meaning that patients do not require a prescription to obtain them. These medications only provide symptomatic relief, which may mask an underlying disorder, but lack of awareness in this regard may delay the diagnosis in health conditions like GERD, peptic ulcer, gastric ulcer, and hiatal hernia. This situation results in the improper use of these medications with little to no relief of symptoms. There is a need to educate patients regarding the importance of a correct mode of administration, time of administration, and dosage for the prompt and prolonged relief of symptoms. Although these medications do not cause toxicities in high doses, it is imperative to understand their interaction with other medicines, especially in patientsÂ engaged in polypharmacy.

Nursing can verify drug use on intake and at each exam and report to the treating clinician. Pharmacists will encounter patients in the retail pharmacy and can counsel and educate patients on the advantages and pitfalls of antacid therapy and inform the patient's treating physician if there are any issues (drug-drug interactions, for example). Even a medication as apparently benign as OTC antacids can significantly affect patient health, and the interprofessional team needs to work together and communicate to achieve positive outcomes.
