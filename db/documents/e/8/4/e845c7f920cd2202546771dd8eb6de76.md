Following are major complication of alcoholic liver disease:

- Variceal Hemorrhage: Patient presents with hematemesis or melena. Treatment options include endoscopic band ligation, sclerotherapy, and placement of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement (TIPS). TIPS increases the risk of hepatic encephalopathy.

- Ascites: This is the most common complication of alcoholic liver disease where there is an accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity. The patient usually presents with abdominal swelling and pedal edema. Treatment options are sodium restriction, diuretics, paracentesis, and TIPS.

- Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis(SBP): It is an infection of ascitic fluid without evidence of any other intraabdominal source (e.g. perforated viscus) of infection. The diagnosis is established by positive ascitic fluid bacterial culture or ascitic fluid absolute neutrophil count of >250/mm3. Cefotaxime is preferred antibiotic but ciprofloxacin can be used if the patient is not able toÂ take cefotaxime.

- Hepatorenal syndrome: It is the development of renal failure due to advanced alcoholic liver disease where other causes of renal failure are excluded. It is characterized by a progressive rise in creatinine, low sodium excretion rate, oliguria, benign urinary sediment and absence of proteinuria. Type 1 hepatorenal syndrome is a more serious type with at least two-fold increase in creatinine in less than two weeks. It is associated with a high mortality rate. Type 2 is slower in onset and has a relatively better prognosis. Treatment for critically ill patient includes norepinephrine and albumin. For noncritically ill patient treatment includes midodrine ( oral alpha agonist), octreotide, and albumin. Ultimate treatment is liver transplantation

- Hepatic hydrothorax: It is the presence of pleural effusion and other causes of pleural effusion are excluded. Treatment is diuretics, thoracentesis, and TIPS.

- Hepatopulmonary syndrome: It is characterized by the presence of elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient on room air and evidence of intrapulmonary vascular abnormalities. The patient usually presents with shortness of breath and hypoxia.. There is no treatment option except liver transplantation.

- Hepatic encephalopathy: It characterized by reversible neuropsychiatric abnormalities. Treatment includes lactulose, rifaximin and correction of precipitating factors like infection, GI bleeding, etc.

- Other rare complications are cirrhotic cardiomyopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, portal gastropathy, portopulmonary hypertension, and portal vein thrombosis.
