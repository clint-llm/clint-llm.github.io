For many years, the treatment for VKH was intravenous pulse corticosteroid therapy. Studies indicated that the duration of therapy was linked to the risk of recurrence and further complications from repeat inflammatory episodes. Recurrence in older studies was relatively frequent and occurred within six months of treatment.

Su-Tenon injection of triamcinolone is highly effective in leading to resolution without recurrence of ocular symptoms in up to 78% of patients, as exhibited in a study that followed patients for up to 3 years.

IMT has been utilized as an adjunct to steroids in patients with VKH. IMTs that have shown efficacy include alkylating agents, antimetabolites, and TNF-alpha inhibitors, among others.

Adalimumab has most recently been studied in recalcitrant cases of patients with corticosteroid-related complications and challenging pediatric cases. It has been shown good efficacy in controlling systemic disease with evidence of complete control of inflammation for at least six months in small case studies.

The role of surgery is limited to treating the complications of the disease, such as cataract extraction, surgical therapy to lower the IOP or the treatment of subsequent macular holes.
