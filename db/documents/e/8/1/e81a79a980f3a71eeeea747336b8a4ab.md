The common conditions which could present with similar presentations are urethritis, urinary tract infection, and acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis. A prostate abscess should beÂ strongly suspected if there is a palpable fluctuant mass. Other differential diagnoses are benign prostatic hyperplasia perirectal and perineal abscess, which could mimic a prostatic abscess by being painful and causing local swelling.
