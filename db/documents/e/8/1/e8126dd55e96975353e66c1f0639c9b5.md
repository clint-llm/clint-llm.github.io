CHARGE syndrome is a congenital disorder with an incidence of approximately 1 in 10000 births. It does not have sex-linked expression, so both males and females are equally affected. Most cases are sporadic and not inherited, but mean paternal age appears to be slightly increased. In 2010, a study on 379 patients diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome was conducted, followed by CHD7 mutation testing, and the result proved that 67% of cases were due to a CHD7 mutation.
