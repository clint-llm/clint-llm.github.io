The first evaluation for Angelman syndrome (AS) can be started in the prenatal stage when evaluating a fetus with growth restrictions. Current studies have shown noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPS) technique is highly accurate in the diagnose of AS prenatally.

After birth, when AS suspicion arises, workup should start with methylation studies.

**Methylation Studies**- Normally, the SNRPN exon 1 region/promoter is differentially methylated, that is, the paternal allele is unmethylated, and the maternal allele is methylated. In 80% of patients with AS (consisting deletion, imprinting center defect, and parental disomy) that maternal methylated allele cannot be found.

**FISH**- FISH is done after methylation studies. It detects any deletions in the maternal chromosome 15. If negative, imprinting defects or paternal disomy must be considered. Paternal disomy is confirmed via DNA marker analysis. If negative, imprinting center defects must be considered and can be confirmed by molecular studies.

**DNA Sequencing -**if the patient has a negative methylation study, but the suspicion for AS is high, DNA sequencing can be done. It rules out any mutation in UBE3A, which can be missed in methylation studies. If it is negative other alternative diagnoses must be considered.

**EEG**can show a characteristic pattern of AS and also an epileptic activity, which can help in the diagnosis of AS.

**Polysomnography (Sleep Study)**to diagnose any sleep disorders.
