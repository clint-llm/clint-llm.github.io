Krabbe disease is due to loss of function gene mutation coding for galactosylceramide beta hydrolase (GALC).Â About 200 GALC gene mutations have been identified. Usually, it is challenging to establish the phenotype severity with the genotype, but large deletions like 30 kilobase (kb) gene deletions, truncations, frameshift mutations, and nonsense mutations are associated with severe clinical manifestations.

Approximately 50% of patients with juvenile and adult type are heterozygous for 30kb gene deletion or have mutations leading to reduced GALC enzyme activity.
