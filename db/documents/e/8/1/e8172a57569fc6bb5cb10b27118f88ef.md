**Nursing Care**

Nursing professionals should report any abnormal development of neonates in the newborn nursery as it can help in the early diagnosis of a disease and provide timely intervention. In some cases, the placement of a central venous catheter for exchange transfusion might be indicated. The team responsible for the placement should also be vigilant about catheter-related complications like displacement of the catheter,Â infections, etc.

**Paraclinical Care**

Patients with chronic bilirubin encephalopathy might end up with auditory disabilities, which require speech and hearing rehabilitation.
