Enthesopathies can be separated into two broad categories 1) repetitive mechanical stress and 2) diffuse inflammatory response. Enthesopathies from repetitive mechanical stress can be seen in common sports-related injuries such as lateral and medialÂ epicondylitis, and Achilles and shoulder enthesopathy. Diffuse inflammatory responses that lead to enthesopathies and enthesitis tend to affect multiple entheses. The repetitive local microtrauma allows innate immune cells to invade the local area and cause inflammation triggered by chemokines.
