In some cases, the course of such abnormal ducts may be blinded and not in communication with the skin, which may render the clinical presentation occult.

Congenital lacrimal fistulae classification is based on the origin point of its tract, which may deriveÂ from the common canaliculus, the lacrimal sac, or the nasolacrimal duct.
