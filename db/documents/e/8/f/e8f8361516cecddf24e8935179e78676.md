Coleman proposed that anatomical classification is widely used, subdividing the congenital vertical talus into two types. Type 1 deformity includes dorsal rigid dislocation of the talonavicular joint. Type II deformity includes the features of type 1 along with subluxation or dislocation of the calcaneocuboid joint. One of the milder forms of congenital vertical talus includes oblique talus, which is primarily diagnosed based on clinical and radiographic workup.

This form shows a similar clinical picture as seen in the vertical talus, but the deformities are less rigid here. While performing the plantar flexion in such patients, the navicular bone will reduce, whereas, in patients with vertical talus, the navicular bone is rigidly dislocated.

Ogata and Schoenecker classify it into three groups. Group 1 is idiopathic vertical talus without any associated diagnoses. Group 2 is a vertical talus patient with associated congenital anomalies but no neurological deficit. Group 3 is a vertical talus patient with an associated neurological disorder.

Hamanishi divides the vertical talus into five groups based on its association with: (1) spinal anomalies or neural tube defects, (2) neuromuscular conditions, (3) malformation anomalies, (4) chromosomal aberrations, and (5) idiopathic.
