As Denk had used griseofulvin in his study to create MDB, recent studies have used diethyl-1, 4-dihydro-2, 4, 6-trimethyl-3, 5-pyridine dicarboxylate (DDC).

Before MDB occur, ballooning of hepatocytes occurs first, which are the response of oxidative stress, such as abnormal protein (heat shock proteins) or fat result in water accumulation into the hepatic cytoplasm.

The first mechanism is that epigenetics (acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination of histones) contribute to hepatocyte memory during MDB formation.

The second pathway is the shift from the 26s proteasome to the immunoproteasome. The 26S proteasome plays a part in degradation intracellular (cytosolic, nuclear and membrane) proteins.

The third is the chronic activation of the Toll-like signaling pathways which stimulate proinflammatory and cell growth pathways. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha stimulate TLR receptors, which cause up-regulation of growth factor resulting in the proliferation of MDB forming cells. Drugs as well can create a shift to the formation of the immunoproteasome rather than the 26s proteasome.

DDC stimulates tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression, which in turn activates the toll-like receptor (TLR). Proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma via TLR signaling cause up-regulation of the immunoproteasome and down-regulation of the 26s proteasome which results in undigested proteins and MDB formation.
