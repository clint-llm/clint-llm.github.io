Tracheal disruption may involve tracheal cartilages (most commonly from direct, blunt trauma). Alternatively, tracheal tears or laryngotracheal separation may result from shearing forces in flexion/extension injuries. Chest crush injuries may cause sagittal tears of the membranous portions of the trachea and bronchi, often due to compression of the structures between the manubrium or sternum and vertebral column. See image below.

Injury types include laryngotracheal contusions, lacerations, hematomas, avulsions, and fracture/dislocation of the tracheal cartilages. In rare cases, a complete transaction of the trachea may occur.
