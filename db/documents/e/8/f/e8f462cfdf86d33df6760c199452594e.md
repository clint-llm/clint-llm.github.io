- Despite a relatively simple appearance on radiographs, Bennett fractures are considered unstable.

- In evaluating and treating these fractures positioning the patient with thumb extension (hitchhikers position) should be avoided as this will cause further fracture displacement.

- Favorable long-term outcomes are based upon the degree of anatomic reduction with most patients having less than 1 mm articular surface step off having no residual symptoms.
