Lung scintigraphy evaluates ventilation, perfusion, or both to diagnose various pulmonary conditions. This is most commonly used to diagnose pulmonary embolism in patients who are unable to tolerate contrast. It is also occasionally used to monitor the resolution of the emboli, evaluate pulmonary hypertension, quantify lung perfusion before surgery or after a transplant, and for other pathologies like bronchopleural fistulas and congenital diseases.

For ventilation studies, technetium labeled aerosols, such as diethylenetriamine pentaacetate (DTPA) or occasionally Sulphur colloid, are used. However, this cannot provide information about washout. Xenon – 133 allows the assessment of single breath, equilibrium, and washout phases and is more commonly used. Activity administered usually ranges from 5-20mCi for adults.

Perfusion is assessed by injecting 1-4 mCi of Tc-99m macro-aggregated albumin (MAA).

For scintigraphy, the patients can be scanned standing or sitting, or they may be supine for the ventilation scan, depending on institutional policies. For perfusion scans, the patient is in a supine position for the injection and then preferably imaged standing up, as that minimizes diaphragmatic movement and allows complete expansion of the chest.

A perfusion defect without a ventilation defect, typically wedge-shaped and peripheral, i.e., a ”mismatch” between ventilation and perfusion, raises concern for a pulmonary embolism. Mismatches may occur in the sub-segmental, segmental, or lobar distributions. However, it is important to remember that other causes of altered blood flow, such as blockage by lymphadenopathy, masses, or radiation changes, can also lead to mismatched defects. Thus correlation with anatomical studies is essential.

Many findings confound V/Q scan interpretation. Normal structures like fissures, diaphragm, and mediastinum can give the appearance of perfusion defects. However, if there is any normal perfusion peripheral to the perfusion defect, called the stripe sign, the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism is low.

Positron emission tomography combined with CT scans using F18 labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is commonly used for assessing suspicious pulmonary nodules and known malignancies. Lung nodules can be characterized as potentially benign or malignant, depending on their FDG uptake. In the case of patients with known malignancies, PET-CT allows for staging by assessing areas of uptake in the remainder of the chest and entire body. Providing data about the metabolic activity of a lesion is also useful to plan for interventions such as choosing the most optimal lesion for biopsy.
