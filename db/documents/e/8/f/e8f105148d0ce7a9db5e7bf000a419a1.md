There has been a traditional bias against bacteriostatic antimicrobials for a variety of indications, particularly in more acute settings, due to a misconception that they have clinically slower rates of activity and lose efficacy.

The use of these bacteriostatic agents requires an interprofessional team approach to patient care. The prescribing/ordering clinician will decide which antimicrobial to use; this decision should be in tandem with a board-certified infectious disease pharmacist, in conjunction with the latest antibiogram data - especially in the inpatient setting. The pharmacist should also perform a complete medication reconciliation to rule out potential drug-drug interactions. Nursing will be responsible for administering these drugs in the inpatient setting, and for outpatients, they can still counsel the patient on proper administration. Nursing can also evaluate patient adherence and should be cognizant of potential adverse reactions so they can be reported to the prescriber immediately. This interprofessional team approach will optimize the therapeutic potential for bacteriostatic antimicrobials while limiting drug resistance and adverse events. [Level 5]
