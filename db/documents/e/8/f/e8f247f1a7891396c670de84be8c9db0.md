One mechanism that have been proposed to explain atrioventricular heart block postulate that from the 18 to the 26 weeks of pregnancy auto-antigens type A or B translocate to the cardiomyocyte surface after which maternal autoantibodies bind to the fetal cardiac conduction tissue triggering atrioventricular node fibrosis. Another mechanism that has been postulated is based on mimicry, linking a cross-reaction between L- and T-type calcium channels and autoantibodies that subsequently cause an imbalance with calcium homeostasis, crucial for the propagation of the action potential and conduction in the AV and SA node. AV heart block is often seen if the mother has higher autoantibodies titers. Nevertheless, there is overlapping between affected and unaffected cases that a high titer alone is not indicative of heart involvement. Another maternal factor that has been linked with neonatal lupus cutaneous manifestations is anti-U1 RNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated with U1 spliceosomal RNA) antibodies.
