Evaluation of anterior pituitary function is done by obtaining blood when a high clinical suspicion is evident to diagnose Sheehan syndrome. The hormones that are manufactured in the anterior pituitary gland are the gonadotropins such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). They are affected primarily in a certain order when necrosis occurs, GH first, followed by PRL, FSH, LH, ACTH, and then TSH last.
