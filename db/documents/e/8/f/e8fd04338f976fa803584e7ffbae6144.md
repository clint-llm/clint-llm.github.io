Nasal polyps are benign inflammatory and hyperplastic outgrowths of the sinonasal mucosa. Their most common manifestation is in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). For this reason, the term chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) is frequently used when discussing the topic of nasal polyps. However, they are also associated with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), certain systemic vasculitis, and cystic fibrosis, among others. Polyposis is an end-stage manifestation of uncontrolled allergy, and management of extant polyposis is only the beginning of the process. Once the polyps have been addressed, local and systemic therapy aimed at controlling the underlying allergic etiology must be undertaken, or else they can rapidly recur.
