The forearm muscles originate in the dorsolateral somite cells that form muscles after they migrate to the limb at approximately the fourth week of development. As the limb buds lengthen, the muscles begin to divide into separate functional groups, such as the flexors and extensors. The anterior and posterior pattern of the limb developsÂ by a sonic hedgehog protein, which gets secreted from the zone of polarizing activity.
