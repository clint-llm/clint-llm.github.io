Pediatric hearing loss is a broad category that covers a wide range of pathologies. Early detection and prompt management are essential for the development of normal language and psychosocial functioning, as well as to identify potentially reversible causes or other underlying problems.Â  Hearing is measured in decibels, and the severity of the hearing loss is graded by hearing thresholds. The normal hearing range is 0-20 decibels (dB) which equates to being able to perceive sound quieter than a whisper. Mild hearing loss corresponds to a range of 20-39 dB, moderate 40-69 dB, severe 70-89 dB and profound is greater than 90 dB.

There are three main types of hearing loss; conductive, sensorineural and mixed. The former typically occurs due to a problem transmitting sounds at the level of the external or middle ear. The major cause of conductive hearing loss in children is otitis media with effusion (glue ear). Sensorineural hearing loss results from a disruption of the auditory pathway at any point from the cochlea of the inner ear through to the brainstem, and despite being relatively uncommon in children as a whole, it is the primary cause of permanent hearing loss in the pediatric population. Mixed hearing loss occurs when there are both conductive and sensorineural components.
