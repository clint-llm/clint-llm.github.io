A fetal echogenic bowel is defined as an increased echogenicity of the fetal bowel, which is noted on the prenatal ultrasound. In the third trimester, this can be a normal finding representing meconium in the bowel of the fetus. However, when fetal echogenic bowel is detected in the second trimester, it can be associated with several fetal disorders. This activity reviews the incidence, pathophysiology, and outcomes related to fetal echogenic bowel and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the investigation and management of pregnancies with this finding in the second trimester.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of fetal echogenic bowel.
- Review the diagnostic criteria for fetal echogenic bowel.
- Outline various perinatal conditions associated with fetal echogenic bowel.
- Summarize the prenatal and the postnatal management of fetal echogenic bowel.
