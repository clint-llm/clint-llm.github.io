American Society of Breast Surgeons emphasizes the importance of thorough patient history and uses the following criteria (similar to the NCCN guidelines for genetic risk evaluation).

Criteria for testing in patients **with**a personal history of breast cancer and one or more of the following (from the NCCN and the American Society of Breast Surgeons Consensus Guideline on Hereditary Genetic Testing)

- Age of onset less than or equal to 50

- Triple negative tumor (ER-PR-HER2-) and age less than or equal to 60

- Ashkenazi Jewish heritage and breast cancer at any age

- Two or more primary breast cancer (either asynchronous, synchronous, bilateral, or multicentric)

- A first-degree relative with breast cancer diagnosed at age less than or equal to 50

- Two relatives on the same side of the family with breast cancer and/or pancreatic cancer

- Family or personal history of ovarian cancer, fallopian cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer

- Male breast cancer

- Known mutation carrier in the family

Testing patients who have not been diagnosed with cancer is typically reserved for situations when the affected family member or members cannot be tested. Criteria for testing patients **without **a personal history of breast cancer but with one or more of the following (from the NCCN and American Society of Breast Surgeons Consensus Guideline on Hereditary Genetic Testing)

- A first-degree or second-degree relative with age onset of breast cancer less than or equal to 45

- Ashkenazi Jewish heritage and family history of breast cancer at any age

- Two or more primary breast cancer (either asynchronous, synchronous, bilateral, or multicentric) in a single family member

- Two or more relatives on the same side of the family with breast and/or pancreatic cancer

- Family or personal history of ovarian, fallopian, or primary peritoneal cancer

- Male breast cancer

- Known mutation carrier in the family

In addition to the above criteria, likelihood or risk assessment models such as the BRCAPRO, BOADICEA, Penn II, and IBIS can also be used to determine whether a patient is at an increased risk for carrying BRCA mutations and thus indicate the need for genetic testing or referral to a genetic counselor or breast surgeon. Though these models estimate the risk of developing breast cancer, no particular test or level of risk determines the need for or against BRCA testing.
