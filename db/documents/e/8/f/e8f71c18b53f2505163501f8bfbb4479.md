The overall prognosis and the 5-year survival rate has definitely improved since the advent of nuances in the radiotherapy techniques. This has drastically decreased the mortality and morbidity associated with illness from a reported 5-year survival of 20% to 40% to approximately 70% in the past decade.

Adding the EBV DNA status of the patient to the new (8th edition) makes this system more accurate for the estimation of the prognosis. In addition, other studies show other efficient biomarkers for assessing the prognosis of this tumor, such as miRNA and DNA methylation.
