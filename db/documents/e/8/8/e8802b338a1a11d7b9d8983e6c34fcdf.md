Nasogastric tubes are, as one might surmise from their name, tubes that are inserted through the nares to pass through the posterior oropharynx, down the esophagus, and into the stomach. Dr. Abraham Levin first described their use in 1921. Nasogastric tubes are typically used for decompression of the stomach in the setting of intestinal obstruction or ileus,Â but can also be used to administer nutrition or medication to patients who are unable to tolerate oral intake.
