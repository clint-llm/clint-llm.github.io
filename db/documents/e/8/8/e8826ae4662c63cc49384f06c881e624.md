Vitamin D is labeled as the "sunshine vitamin," as it is produced in the skin during sun exposure. Vitamin D is required to maintain the serum calcium concentration within the normal physiologic range for musculoskeletal health. The Endocrine Society, the National and International Osteoporosis Foundation, and the American Geriatric Society define vitamin D deficiency as the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin (25 OH D) of less than 30 ng/mL. The Endocrine Society recommends a preferred range of 40 to 60 ng/mL. To maintain this level, the Endocrine Society recommends an intake of 400 to 1000 International Units (IU) daily for infants less than one year, 600 to 1000 IU for children and adolescents from 1 to 18 years, and 1500 to 2000 IU for all adults. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, toxicity, and monitoring, of vitamin D so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the physiological role of vitamin D.
- Describe the appropriate dosing of vitamin D for various patient populations.
- Review the appropriate monitoring to ensure proper vitamin D levels.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and coordination among the interprofessional team and how it can enhance patient care with vitamin D to improve patient outcomes where vitamin D supplementation is indicated.
