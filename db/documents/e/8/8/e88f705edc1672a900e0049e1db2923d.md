Nursing, allied health, and other team members need to engage in basic standard-of-care for outpatient post-procedural monitoring and sterile technique during the procedure. This includes basic assistance with set-up and preparation similar to many other outpatient pain management interventional procedures. Antibiotics and light sedation are usually given intravenously, and some of the antibiotics may be mixed with the contrast agent.

Team interventions should include capability and protocols for handling any medical emergency either during or post-procedure.

Post-procedural nursing care, whether it be in a post-procedure area, post-anesthesia care unit, or return to a regular medical floor, is similar to many other pain management procedures such as epidural steroid injection.  This should include vital signs, neurological checks for any new focal weakness, adequate pain control, and observation for potential late reactions to medications. A greater number of these patients may be MRI incompatible due to implanted cardiac devices and henceforth have a higher risk of postprocedure acute cardiac events. There should be a comparatively low threshold in such patients to notify the physician of chest pain, shortness of breath, or any other unusual symptoms that could be an anginal equivalent or otherwise signal of clinical decline.
