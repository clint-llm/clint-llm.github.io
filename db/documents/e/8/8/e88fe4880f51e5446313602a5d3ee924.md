The image acquisition of nuclear medicine is vastly different from CT and MRI. While contrast mediums act upon the imaging signal, injected radiopharmaceuticals are the imaging source and are not acted upon by intravenous mediums.Â Nuclear medicine does utilize CT and MRI imaging for SPECT-CT, PET-CT, and PET-MRI; each may be contrast-enhanced to improve the specificity of selected pathologies.
