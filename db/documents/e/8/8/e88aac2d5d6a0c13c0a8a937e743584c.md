Pneumatization of the articular tubercle is an anatomical variant of TMJ. Consists of bone cavities/air cells in the root of the zygomatic arch and/or in the tubercle or eminence of the temporal bone. These cavities may be present only ipsilaterally or bilaterally. Normally these cavities are reabsorbed during puberty, but it may happen that the reabsorption does not occur. It does not seem that this variability could negatively affect the symptomatology or function of TMJ.
