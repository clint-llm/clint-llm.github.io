# Continuing Education Activity

HIV-2 is an enveloped retrovirus that causes infection in humans, similar to HIV-1. It is endemic to parts of West Africa, but globalization has led to worldwide spread. It is estimated that 1 to 2 million people live with HIV-2, and without treatment, infection invariably leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Given global interconnectedness and immigration from endemic regions, clinicians should become familiar with the differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection and maintain a high index of suspicion for HIV-2 in persons from high-risk regions. This activity outlines the epidemiology, evaluation, diagnostic testing, and treatment options for HIV-2 infection. It further reviews the role interprofessional teams play in improving outcomes for patients with HIV-2.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology/transmission dynamics of HIV-2.
- Identify the common pathophysiologic differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2.
- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with HIV-2 and its distinguishing features.
- Summarize the main treatment strategies by interprofessional and identify key treatment differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2.

# Introduction

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an enveloped retrovirus that can be categorized into two distinct subtypes - human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2). Although both viruses share similar transmission routes and can cause acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), there are important differences between them regarding epidemiology, diagnosis, and management.

Although HIV-2 is less common globally, it is an important cause of disease in many regions. It predominates in West Africa, but globalization has led to a sizeable number of cases in other parts of Africa, Europe, India, and the United States.

The first cases of HIV-2 were detected in the United States in the late 1980s, and currently, about 1% of persons living with HIV in the US are estimated to have HIV-2.

To date, the approach to HIV-2 has largely been extrapolated from studies in HIV-1 though notable differences exist. Its lower prevalence compared to HIV-1 has resulted in a paucity of drug trials or epidemiologic studies to address the current limitations in our understanding of HIV-2 management. However, given its global distribution, clinicians must become familiar with the differences between HIV-1 and HIV-2 while maintaining a high index of suspicion for HIV-2 in persons from endemic regions.

# Etiology

HIV-2 is a viral zoonosis that infects humans similarly to HIV-1. Phylogenetic studies suggest it emerged from sooty mangabey monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in Guinea-Bissau.

The pandemic spread of HIV-2 was catalyzed by colonial wars being fought in Guinea and across West Africa during the 1960s–1970s.

The emergence of HIV-2 in Guinea Bissau, driven by these factors, led to rapid spread into neighboring countries and eventually to distant Portuguese colonies, including Cape Verde, Angola, Mozambique, India, and Brazil. Ultimately this also resulted in significant levels of HIV-2 transmission in Portugal, which currently maintains the highest prevalence of HIV-2 infection in Europe.

# Epidemiology

Worldwide, most HIV infections are caused by HIV-1, and in 2018 an estimated 38 million people were infected globally.

Of the new cases identified, 55% were diagnosed in the Northeast, with an additional 30% being diagnosed in the Southern United States.

Several studies have demonstrated that the demographics of HIV-2 are shifting.

Phylogenetic and modeling studies have attributed up to 30% of the decline in HIV-2 prevalence to competitive exclusion, with the remaining 70% attributable to population-level socio-behavioral interventions.

# Pathophysiology

Compared to HIV-1, infection with HIV-2 is defined by three major differences 1) a longer asymptomatic phase, 2) a slower rate of CD4 decline, 3) and lower plasma viral loads. Given these significant advantages over HIV-1, it has historically been associated with overall lower mortality.

The pathophysiologic differences noted above result in distinctly different natural histories when comparing HIV-1 and HIV-2. Those with HIV-2 have been shown to have half the rate of CD4 decline over time (0.4% vs. 0.9% per year) and, on average, have viral loads that are 28-fold lower after seroconversion.

Data from another HIV-2 cohort quantified median survival more granularly. It was noted that those with HIV-1 had a median survival of 8.2 years compared to 15.6 years among those with HIV-2.

Although the natural history may differ, the transmission of HIV-2 occurs by the same routes as HIV-1, including perinatal, sexual contact, and bloodborne exposure. While the mechanisms of transmission overlap, HIV-2 is a markedly less efficient virus and thus significantly less infectious. Globally, this has resulted in disproportionately fewer cases of HIV-2 and more limited spread in comparison to HIV-1. The comparatively lower efficiency of HIV-2 has been well illustrated in studies examining mother-to-child transmission from the pre-antiretroviral era. Remarkably, perinatal transmission among HIV-2 positive mothers has been notably low at l-2%, whereas in mothers with HIV-1, transmission ranges from 15% to 30%.

Interestingly, dual infection with both HIV-1 and HIV-2 can occur in regions where both viruses circulate widely. It has most commonly been reported in West Africa, where seroprevalence studies estimate dual infection in up to 5-10% of those infected.

# History and Physical

All patients diagnosed with HIV-2 should have a complete medical history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation similar to that of a patient infected with HIV-1. The goal of an initial evaluation is to confirm the diagnosis of HIV-2, screen for and identify any opportunistic infections, provide patients with education and support, and discuss the benefits of antiretroviral therapy. Because of the natural history of undiagnosed HIV-2, clinicians should be aware that patients may present at older ages, represent a different demographic, or have non-traditional risk factors upon diagnosis. Thus, a low threshold should be maintained in sending HIV-2 testing, particularly in patients with epidemiologic risk.

Those with HIV-2 often present with similar clinical symptoms as those with HIV-1, including developing an acute retroviral syndrome or opportunistic infection. All opportunistic infections have been seen in patients with HIV-2, including oral candidiasis, Pneumocystis pneumonia, cytomegalovirus, Kaposi sarcoma, tuberculosis, disseminated mycobacterial infection, toxoplasmosis, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, among others.

Evaluation for co-infection and concurrent opportunistic infection should be methodical and follow the guidelines outlined for HIV-1 infection.

In a study of HIV-2 from The Gambia, the most common AIDS-defining feature at presentation was generalized wasting and pulmonary TB, although these findings may not be globally generalizable. Few studies have compared the frequency of OIs in patients with HIV-1 to those with HIV-2, but some evidence suggests that encephalitis may occur more frequently in those with HIV-2. It remains unclear if this may be related to longer survival times or differences in neurotropism between HIV-1 and HIV-2.

# Evaluation

Historically the diagnosis of HIV-2 has been challenged several issues, including HIV antibody differentiation and the detection of plasma HIV-2 RNA levels. Before the widespread availability of the 4th generation HIV-1/2 antigen-antibody tests, clinicians had to rely on clinical suspicion to determine when HIV-2 specific testing was appropriate. Such scenarios included declining CD4 counts in an HIV-1 patient on appropriate therapy, untreated HIV-positive patients with an undetectable viral load, or those with opportunistic infection from West Africa. Previous immunoassays effectively detected both HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies but did not differentiate between them. Confirmatory western blots were used, but cross-reactivity between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies often resulted in indeterminate results or misdiagnosis as HIV-1.

Many of these limitations have been mitigated by the widespread use of the 4th generation HIV-1/2 antigen-antibody testing, which includes a differentiation assay. Consequently, in 2014 the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) revised its HIV testing algorithm to improve the diagnosis of HIV-2 by including the differentiation assay results.

The testing algorithm was revised in 2018 and should be used by all clinicians when interpreting diagnostic testing results for HIV.

# Treatment / Management

The goals of ART in HIV-2 are similar to those for HIV-1–prevention of transmission, immune restoration, durable viral suppression, and a reduction in morbidity and mortality.

Currently, it is recommended that all patients diagnosed with HIV-2 be started on ART as soon as possible after diagnosis.

The fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide also has no HIV-2 activity and should not be used. These drug resistance patterns result from natural polymorphisms in HIV-2 that result in ineffective or less effective binding to comparable drug target sites in HIV-1.

The initial monitoring of patients with HIV-2 should follow the same recommended guidelines set out for HIV-1 patients except baseline resistance testing. To determine treatment progress, clinicians can follow CD4 counts and HIV-2 viral loads if they are available. However, in patients with undetectable baseline viral loads, treatment failure should be suspected if disease progression or continued CD4 decline occurs.

# Differential Diagnosis

HIV-2 should be considered in those with epidemiologic risk factors or an opportunistic infection. As such, the differential is broad and includes a range of diseases caused by opportunistic and sexually transmitted pathogens.

- HIV-1 infection

- Dual infection with HIV-1 and HIV-2

- Hepatitis B

- Hepatitis C

- Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia

- Toxoplasma gondii encephalitis

- Cryptosporidiosis

- 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis

- Nontuberculous mycobacterial Infection (NTM)

- Bartonellosis

- Syphilis

- Mucocutaneous candidiasis

- Cryptococcosis

- Histoplasmosis

- Coccidioidomycosis

- Aspergillosis

- Cytomegalovirus

- Herpes simplex virus

- Varicella zoster virus

- Human herpesvirus-8/Kaposi sarcoma

- Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)

# Prognosis

There is an overall paucity of data on the prognosis and outcomes of those living with HIV-2, and existing studies have been small. However, HIV-2 cohorts have consistently shown that in patients with CD4 cell counts greater than 500 cells/µL, survival is improved compared to age-matched controls with HIV-1.

Further studies have demonstrated that in those with HIV-2 and advanced disease, mortality rates are similar to patients with HIV-1 when adjusted for CD4 count, age, and demographic factors.

# Complications

The complications from chronic infection with HIV-2 are similar to those in patients with HIV-1. Once patients with HIV-2 have developed advanced immunosuppression with CD4 cell counts less than 200 cells/µL, they are at risk of developing the same types of opportunistic infections seen in HIV-1.Pneumocystis jiroveci and Toxoplasma gondii.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Sexual contact is the primary mode of transmission for HIV-2, and patients at risk should be counseled about safe sexual practices and encouraged to get routine testing. Counseling should be culturally competent, sensitive to issues of sexual identity, and tailored to each patient's risk. If other risk factors are present, including the use of intravenous drugs, specific harm reduction strategies or interventions should be offered to mitigate transmission from contaminated equipment.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should be offered to patients at substantial risk of acquiring HIV infection. Although there are no data specifically addressing PrEP in preventing HIV-2, the antiretrovirals used for PrEP are active against both HIV-1 and HIV-2, and similarly, high levels of efficacy would be expected.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

An interprofessional team approach involving clinicians, mid-level practitioners, specialists, nurses, and pharmacists is essential in managing HIV-2 infection, given it can be complex and lifelong. The clinical care team should involve an infectious disease specialist with expertise in HIV care, social worker, pharmacist, and involve other specialist care if needed. Central to the care team is the patient, and focus should be paid to ensuring the HIV care team provides strong, unified communication, clear disease understanding, and a supportive environment. Providing an interprofessional care team has been shown among HIV-1 patients to improve important outcomes such as virologic suppression and patient retention.

Similar outcomes could be expected for those living with HIV-2, given the significant overlap in clinical services and support required to manage patients successfully. The role of long-acting injectable agents and uptake of telemedicine may present both new opportunities and challenges for multidisciplinary teams caring for those with HIV. However, as HIV clinical care continues to evolve, multidisciplinary teams must continue working synergistically to maximize patient engagement, retention, and virologic suppression.
