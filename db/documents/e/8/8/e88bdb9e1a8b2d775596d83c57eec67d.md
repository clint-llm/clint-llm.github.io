Richter and colleaguesÂ suggested that there are four clinical groups of patients with PDS/PG:

- Inactive pigment dispersion and stable IOP

- Clinically visible active dispersion of pigments and stable IOP

- Active pigment dispersion, progression of glaucoma, high IOP

- Inactive pigment dispersion, progression of glaucoma, and optic nerve head damage

Three clinical stages of PDS/PG have been proposed:

- Asymptomatic pigment dispersion phase that starts in early adulthood: The pigment dispersion is due to multiple precipitating factors including emotional stress, pharmacological mydriasis, and exercise. Though there is pigment release, the TM can filter these, and high IOP is usually not noted.

- The TM meshwork becomes pigmented, and high IOP is seen. The changes of glaucoma, including optic nerve head damage and visual field changes, are noted.

- The pigment clears from the TM with aging, and IOP begins to normalize. The inferior TM is less pigmented than the superior TM (pigment reversal sign).
