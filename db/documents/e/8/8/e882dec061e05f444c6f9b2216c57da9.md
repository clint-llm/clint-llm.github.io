- Hot flashes are the most prevalent vasomotor symptom that presents during perimenopause.

- The only FDA-approved nonhormonal prescription medication to treat hot flashes is low-dose paroxetine of 7.5 mg daily.

- Nonhormonal nonprescription therapies, including black cohosh, red clover isoflavones, soy extract, and Chinese herbs, are not effective.

- The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) found that combined HT raises the risk of breast cancer, venous thromboembolism, stroke, is not cardioprotective, and does not decrease mortality risk.

- The evidence is lacking to support the safety, effectiveness, and superiority of compounded bioidentical hormones over conventional hormone therapy.

- Although some SSRIs and SNRIs are safe and effective in treating hot flashes in patients with breast cancer, caution is necessary when used with tamoxifen. Gabapentin and clonidine can be alternatives in these patients.
