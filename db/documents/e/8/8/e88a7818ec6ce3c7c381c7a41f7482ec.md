**Management of Uncomplicated Animal Bite/Scratch**

As with any traumatic injury, the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation must be evaluated and secured before moving on to treating the injury. Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, the wound should be flushed with copious amounts of sterile water (under local anesthesia if necessary). An x-ray of the affected area should be obtained to evaluate for underlying fracture or retained foreign body. Primary closure of the wound should be done only if necessary, as this increases the risk of developing an infection. If closure is performed, space should be left between sutures to allow for drainage. Tetanus prophylaxis should be given if indicated. Consider rabies prophylaxis for all animal-related injuries.

Prophylactic antibiotics are not currently recommended universally for animal bites or scratches. High-risk patients include those that are immunosuppressed or immunocompromised (i.e., patients with diabetes mellitus, asplenia, or cirrhosis) as well as patients with degenerative joint disease or prosthetic joint replacements. Injuries that are classified as high-risk include any injury to the hand, injuries to the face or genitals, any injury that requires surgical repair or primary closure, deep puncture wounds or lacerations (more common in cat bites), wounds with associated crush injury (more common in dog bites), and wounds that are close to the bone or joint (especially prosthetic joints).

Barring any complications associated with their injuries, these patients are generally safe for discharge home with close follow-up. If antibiotic prophylaxis is given, an oral treatment for 3 to 5 days is sufficient. Specific regimens are discussed below. The patient should be advised to seek re-evaluation for any sign of developing an infection.

**Management of Complicated Infected Injury**

Complications of infected injury include systemic illness (fever, hypotension, tachycardia) and spread to deeper soft tissues. Rapid progression of symptoms may also occur despite oral antibiotic therapy. Parenteral antibiotics should be considered in these patients, as well as in those previously identified as high-risk. If parenteral antibiotics are used, they should be continued until the patient shows clear signs of resolving infection, at which point the transition to an oral regimen for an additional 5-14 days is suggested.

Surgical management may be indicated for deeper soft tissue infections, including wounds with devitalized tissue, evidence of abscess formation, or developing characteristics of necrotizing infection. If debridement is necessary, it should be performed before the initiation of antibiotics so that wound samples can be sent for culture. If possible, wound closure should be avoided following debridement to allow for adequate drainage. In patients that require superficial wound debridement or abscess drainage without other signs of systemic infection, discharge with 5-14 days of oral antibiotics is a reasonable treatment option. The length of the regimen can be extended if the patient shows a slow response. Patients with complicated deep infections, such as osteomyelitis, tenosynovitis, or septic arthritis, may require a prolonged course of antibiotics. Specific regimens are discussed below.

**Management of OtherPasteurella Infection**

There are no changes in the management of respiratory or systemic Pasteurella infection (such as pneumonia, meningitis, endocarditis, bacteremia, etc.) that are specific to the Pasteurella pathogen. These patients should be managed in a manner appropriate to their specific disease process.

**Antibiotic Therapy or Prophylaxis**

The first-line antibiotic for prophylaxis or active local infection is oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. Alternative therapy may include any combination of an antibiotic with anti-Pasteurella activity (such as doxycycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, penicillin V, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin) as well as an anti-anaerobic agent (such as metronidazole or clindamycin) to cover other oral flora.

First-line parenteral antibiotic treatment includes monotherapy with ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, or a carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, ertapenem). Ceftriaxone or a fluoroquinolone plus an anti-anaerobic agent (such as metronidazole or clindamycin) is also acceptable.

Antibiotic regimens should always be targeted based on cultures and sensitivities when appropriate.

Antibiotics that have been shown to have inadequate anti-Pasteurella activity (including cephalexin, dicloxacillin, and erythromycin) should be avoided.
