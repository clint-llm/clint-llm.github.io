Variations in the aortic arch and its branches are not rare. Rarely, the left common carotid artery may originate from the right-sided brachiocephalic artery rather than the aortic arch. In other individuals, the left common carotid and the brachiocephalic artery may have a common origin. In even rare cases, the brachiocephalic artery may give rise to all 3 branches.
