Lab studies will most likely reveal the following:

Serum uric acid: normal is less than 6.8 mg/dL

Twenty-four--hour urine uric acid collection should be less than 600 mg/day for an adult male on a purine-free diet. A level above this implies elevated uric acid production.

Consider complete blood count (CBC), CMP, lipid profile, calcium, and phosphate levels. These laboratory studies are to assess for underlying disease leading to elevated uric acid but are adjunct studies.

Consider joint x-rays to evaluate joint swelling; however, x-rays are not necessary for the diagnosis of gout.

Renal ultrasounds are indicated in patients with uric acid nephrolithiasis.

Procedures

Consider joint aspiration to evaluate for uric acid crystals, and look for negatively birefringent under polarized microscopy.

Routine screening for hyperuricemia is not recommended.
