The ascending palatine artery branches off of the facial artery and anastomoses with the tonsillar artery, ascending pharyngeal artery, and descending palatine artery. The artery goes on to supply the eustachian tube, palatine tonsils, and the soft palate; palatoglossus, palatopharyngeus, tensor veli palatini, musculus uvulae, and the levator veli palatini.
