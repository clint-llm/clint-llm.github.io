A timely diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE) is crucial because of the high associated mortality and morbidity, which may be prevented with early treatment. Patients should be made aware of the signs and symptoms of VTE and PE since the incidence of recurrent thromboembolism is high. It is important to note that 30% of untreated patients withÂ pulmonary embolism die, while only 8% die after timely therapy.
