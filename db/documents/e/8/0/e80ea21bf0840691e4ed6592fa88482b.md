Piezogenic pedal papules are small papular herniations of subcutaneous tissue and adipose on the heel that occur only upon standing or with the application of pressure. On exam, piezogenic pedal papules present with firm, yellowish to skin-colored papules that protrude from the lateral, posterior, or medial aspects of the heel and become more prominent in full weight bearing position and, by definition, resolve when the patient removes weight. Typically, lesions are painless, occur bilaterally, and do not require treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of piezogenic pedal papules and illustrates the importance of a united interprofessional approach to management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the typical presentation of piezogenic pedal papules.
- Describe the etiology of piezogenic pedal papules.
- Describe the epidemiology of piezogenic pedal papules.
- Describe the need for a united, interprofessional team approach to improve outcomes for patients with symptomatic piezogenic pedal papules.
