**Adverse Reactions**

- Transient local pain at the injection site is the most common adverse reaction. This may be decreased by administering IV lidocaine before propofol bolus.

- Hypotension

- Myoclonus

- Occasionally has been seen to cause EKG changes (QT interval prolongation). This is rarely clinically significant.

- Discolored urine (a green tint); this adverse event is exceedingly rare

**Pregnancy**

Propofol is safe for use in pregnancy but will cross the placenta and may be associated with neonatal CNS and respiratory depression. It is the drug of choice for induction of general anesthesia in the stable obstetric patient and the lowest risk class of all of the induction agents currently used.

Propofol was formerly listed as a Category B drug for use in pregnancy. However, in late 2014 the FDA removed the lettering system to denote the degree of potential harm in pregnancy or lactation and moved to a more descriptive system based on the individual effects of pharmacologic agents.

**Drug Interactions**

Propofol may potentiate other medications that cause CNS or respiratory depression and a decrease in blood pressure. Caution is advised when using other agents that may prolong the QT interval. Propofol has weak CYP3A4 inhibitory effects but is unlikely to be of clinical concern.
