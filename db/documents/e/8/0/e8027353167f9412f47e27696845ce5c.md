Short bowel syndrome (SBS) in adults is defined as less than 180 to 200 centimeters of remaining small bowel (normal length 275 to 850 cm) leading to the need for nutritional and fluid supplements. Patients present with signs and symptoms of malabsorption such as weight loss, diarrhea, steatorrhea, dehydration, malnutrition, and electrolyte imbalance. Patients are managed using either lifelong parenteral nutrition or intestinal transplantation. This activity illustrates the assessment and management of short bowel syndrome and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving outcomes in those with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the findings expected in short bowel syndrome.
- Summarize the expected signs and symptoms of short bowel syndrome.
- Outline the treatment of short bowel syndrome.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to educate the patients on the possible need for lifelong parenteral nutrition, which will enhance the delivery of care for those with short bowel syndrome.
