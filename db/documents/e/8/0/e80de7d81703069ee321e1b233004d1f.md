Vascular reperfusion injury is a phenomenon that is in most cases unavoidable. Whenever an organ faces an ischemic insult the first line of management is either pharmacological thrombolytic therapy or mechanical revascularization. During this, it is crucial for the attending physician to have an inter-disciplinary approach and involve the nursing staff, pharmacists, and other specialties such as the vascular team in order to be able to reach an early diagnosis of the ischemic reperfusion injury. The patients should alwaysÂ receive education regarding the signs and symptoms of ischemic injuries so that they report to hospitals earlier.

Time is of the essence as it determines if there has been reversible or irreversible cellular damage. The greater the damage to cells and membranes during ischemia greater are the chances for an ischemic reperfusion injury to occur. Patients should also be counseled beforehand regarding the probability of this injury occurring and the fact that multiple strategies can be employed to lessen the damage but since multiple pathways are involved in the pathophysiology, treatment has its limitations. In conclusion, it is the hope that early detection and strategies like episodic revascularisation and conditioning will lessen the damage.
