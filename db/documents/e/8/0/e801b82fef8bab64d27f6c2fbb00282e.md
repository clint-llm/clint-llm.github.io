Tinea capitis can is treatable with systemic antifungal medications. Often the drug of choice is griseofulvin. The treatment is for 4 to 8 weeks. Topical treatment is not recommended, as it is ineffective.

Azole antifungal medications like itraconazole and fluconazole are also alternative treatment options. Specific presentations like kerion need anti-inflammatory treatments like systemic steroids for a short period to help to reduce the inflammatory response and also consequently lower the risk of permanent alopecia. This steroid therapy is in addition to oral antifungal treatment. Allylamines are a great option orally, like terbinafine.

Antifungal shampoos can be part of the treatment plan and often help in preventing spread, but this is not the mainstay of treatment and will usually not cure tinea capitis. Creams may also help in preventing the spread of tinea capitis but typically will not cure this condition.
