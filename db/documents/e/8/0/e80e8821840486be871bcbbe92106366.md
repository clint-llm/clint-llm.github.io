Consent: LP requires written and informed consent. Health care proxy can provide consent if the patient is not able to give the consent. In emergency settings, the referring physician deems it a medical necessity and includes it in the charts. Pre-procedure patient assessment: The physician should make a checklist containing indications, contraindications, and patient's medical and mental status, appropriate written and informed consent by the patient or health care proxy. The checklist should also include the patient's weight, positioning, prior attempts, pregnancy, allergies, medications, hardware in the lumbar spine or previous surgery, infection in the back. It is vital to ensure the need for sedation, availability of a fluoroscopy table and procedure room, amount of CSF removed. Prior confirmation of privileges and authorization with the referring provider for the admission requirement in the hospital or emergency settings to treat any potential complications.

The procedure requires a high-quality fluoroscopic imaging facility. It should consist of a tilt table with a suitable support device and a capacity of 30 degrees of angulation in the downward head direction if a myelogram is also part of the procedure. It is crucial to ensure if the patient can fit on the fluoroscopy table before scheduling. If the patient's weight exceeds the capacity of the table, the table may not tilt or move, leading to the failure of the hydraulics mechanism. It is vital to ascertain the availability of necessary materials and personnel to treat adverse reactions and complications.

A brain MRI or CT head imaging within the last 30 days usually excludes a mass, mass effect, or hydrocephalus. If prior imaging is not available, obtain a brain MRI or head CT. LP can potentially cause cerebral herniation by lowering the intracranial pressure. A physician or physician assistant should perform a physical examination. Any prior imaging of the lumbar spine, such as CT, MRI, or radiographs, is also essential to review.

Assessment from the previous spine imaging helps decide the optimum puncture level of the procedure. Recent surgical scar or nearby infection precludes LP at that site. Prior spine imaging avoids spinal stenosis levels, which can cause more pain. Prior lumbar spine imaging helps estimate the skin to thecal sac distance, though generally decreases cranially. If lumbar processes are not palpable, then the regular 3.5-inch needle may not be sufficient. To estimate the appropriate needle length approximately predicts the skin-canal disease (inches) = 0.077 x BMI + 0.88.
