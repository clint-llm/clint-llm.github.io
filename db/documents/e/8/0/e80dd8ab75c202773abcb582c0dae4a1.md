Microcystic adnexal carcinoma frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma. These patients may note a long history of a papule or plaque on the head and neck. Physical examination of the skin may reveal tumor presence; however, accurate diagnosis depends on proper biopsy technique with a raised index of suspicion. While a dermatologist is almost always involved in the care of patients with microcystic adnexal carcinoma, it is important to consult with an interprofessional team of specialists that include a Mohs surgeon, an otolaryngologist, and possibly a radiologist. Nurses are also vital members of the interprofessional group as they will assist with the education of the patient and family. In the postoperative period for pain and wound infection, the pharmacist will ensure the patient is on the right analgesics and antibiotics. The radiologist plays a vital role in determining the extent of involvement, perineural invasion, and presence of intraorbital tumors. Clinical practice guidelines have been established in dermatology literature developed following an exhaustive review of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals to determine appropriate management based upon current evidence.
