The events of posttraumatic accumulation of fluid (cerebral edema), the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and histopathological changes were studied in mice model studies. Researchers have discovered significant neuronal cell death in some areas of the left hippocampus following a closed-head injury. Immunohistochemistry using multiple antibodies to the amyloid precursor protein and/or amyloid precursor protein-like proteins showed a novel axonal degeneration in the striatum, corpus callosum, and injured cortex. Histological evaluation of injured brains illustrated anÂ expansion of the cortical cavity, enlargement of the lateral ventricles, deformation of the hippocampus, and thalamic calcifications.
