Abnormal labor progression is associated with multiple poor maternal and fetal outcomes, thus active management is imperative to avoid adverse outcomes for mom and baby. Most labor and delivery units will have an established protocol for the administration of oxytocin for augmentation of inadequate labor, which entails the administration of the proper medication and dosage, as well as criteria for an incremental increase as clinically warranted. These protocols also include monitoring maternal and fetal status for adverse events. With a second stage of labor prolongation or arrest, operative vaginal delivery with either forceps or vacuum may be an option to expedite delivery for appropriate maternal and fetal candidates and with a skilled delivery attendant. Cesarean delivery may be needed in some cases of labor prolongation and arrest, especially those occurring in the active phase of stage 1 of labor. For a prolonged third stage of labor, manual extraction of the placenta may be required.

**Protracted First Stage**

**Latent Phase**

- This phase can be prolonged for many hours and even days, hence the decision to admit the patient to the hospital depends on various factors, including the status of the cervix, the emotional state of the patient, associated complications, tolerance to pain, and the distance from the hospital. Therefore, it is imperative to discuss the options of admission versus continued outpatient management of the latent phase of labor.

- Therapeutic rest may be considered if desired. Morphine may be administered at a dose of 5 to 10 mg intramuscularly and intravenously simultaneously, with a maximum total dose of 20 mg. Alternatively, intramuscular morphine sulfate and promethazine may be utilized.

- Oxytocin and amniotomy may be helpful in treating prolonged latent phase

**Active Phase**

- For women in the active phase of the first stage, oxytocin may be administered and an amniotomy may be performed.

- If there has been no cervical change after four hours of adequate (>200 Montevideo units) uterine contractions or six hours without adequate uterine contractions, it is advisable to proceed with cesarean delivery.

- However, if labor is still progressing, either slowly or normally, oxytocin administration is continued.

**Protracted Second Stage**

- Oxytocin augmentation is begun for minimal (ie, <1 cm) or absent descent after 60 to 90 minutes of pushing and less frequent uterine contractions.

- In the absence of epidural anesthesia, nulliparous women can push for at least three hours and multiparous women for at least two hours before considering operative intervention. As long as the fetus continues to descend and/or rotate to a favorable position for spontaneous vaginal delivery and the fetal heart rate pattern is reassuring, any form of operative intervention should be delayed.

- Manual rotation of the fetus from occiput posterior presentation to occiput anterior presentation can be attempted if needed in a protracted second stage.

- In women who have epidural anesthesia, an additional hour of pushing may be allowed before considering operative intervention.
