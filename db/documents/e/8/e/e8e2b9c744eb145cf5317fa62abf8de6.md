Measurement of spasticity has traditionally been through the use of the modified Ashworth scale. Despite its popularity, the Modified Ashworth Scale is not without its critics, with most of that criticism focused around its poor inter and intra-rater reliability.

While being a popular method of assessing spasticity, it has been subject to criticism because of its inability to differentiate between the many factors that can contribute toward resistance to passive stretch.Â  Other methods have been proposed and used, including the Modified Tardieu Scale, Wartenberg Pendulum Test, Clinical Gait Analysis, Penn Spasm Frequency Scale, Visual Analog Scale, and Spinal Cord Assessment Tool for Spasticity, but all have had their limitations.

A study in 2012 by Numanoglu et al. looked at spasticity in 37 children with cerebral palsy and found "low-average" intraobserver reliability with the Modified Ashworth Scale, but "average-excellent" score in intraobserver interobserver reliability for the Modified Tardieu Scale.

While the modified Ashworth scale is not an inadequate tool for measuring spasticity, it may not be entirely psychometrically sound. The tests familiarity among spinal cord injury clinicians may not be good enough reason to continue using this assessment tool, given the advancements in rehabilitation science. Validity should not be sacrificed at the expense of familiarity.
