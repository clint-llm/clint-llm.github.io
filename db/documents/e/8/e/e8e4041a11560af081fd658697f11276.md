The management of coral snake bites is with an interprofessional team that consists of an emergency department physician, poison control, internist, intensivist, toxicologist, and ICU nurses. These patients need admission and close monitoring as life-threatening complications of coral snake bites are related to respiratory muscle weakness and the need for ventilatory support. Although significant envenomation is uncommon due to the coral snakeâ€™s less-aggressive behavior and difficult mechanism of delivery, the potential of life-threatening respiratory insufficiency delay of up to 13 hours warrants very close observation after a reported exposure. While limited in supply and difficult to obtain and transport, coral snake antivenom should be given to all patients bitten by coral snakes regardless of symptoms. The outcomes in patients treated with antivenom are excellent but if there is a delay in treatment, then fatalities are known to occur.
