Less than 1% - 2% of angioedema cases are characterized as either HAE or AAE, with HAE having been noted to be about ten times more common than AAE. While the prevalence of AAE is difficult to estimate due to its rarity and potential lack of recognition, some estimate it to be between 1:100,000 and 1:500,000. Specific triggers include trauma, medical procedures, emotional stress, menstruation, oral contraceptives, infections, and drugs, although flare-ups are unpredictable.

Other specific notable factors include more than 90% of patients developing AAE after 40 years of age, and that those suffering from AAE exacerbations have abdominal pain less than 50% of the time as compared to those with HAE having abdominal more than 80% of the time.
