The biggest complication with diabetic macular edema is a progressive, irreversible loss of vision; however, various treatment modalities are also associated with complications. Laser photocoagulation is associated with: subretinal fibrosis and scarring, decreased visual acuity and paracentral scotoma, as well as choroidal neovascular membranes. Intravitreal injections are associated with an increased risk of endophthalmitis (vitreous infection), hemorrhage, an increased frequency of cataracts, increased intraocular pressure (a glaucoma risk factor), as well as a risk of retinal tears. Vitrectomy is a major surgical operation and is thus associated with significant risks as well, including vitreous hemorrhage, retinal tears, endophthalmitis, increased intraocular pressure, and a greater risk of cataract formation.
