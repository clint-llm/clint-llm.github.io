Complications of this condition, as well as from the postoperative course, appear below.

A chronic pars defect or non-fusion is a possible evolution after the non-operative treatment as the potential for healing decreases. This condition can be asymptomatic or produce chronic low back pain.

Another possible evolution from a spondylolysis is the slippage of the lower vertebral body (spondylolisthesis). This problem can be associated with low back pain and neurologic symptoms.

Complications derived from surgical treatment are:

- Neurologic deficit: L5 deficit resulting in motor weakness has been mentioned with a prevalence of 30% in cases of high-grade spondylolisthesis after reduction; most cases are transitory and resolve completely.

- Isthmus non-union: Represents a failure in the consolidation process. It is more common in patients with progressive or terminal stages.

- Progression of slippage

- Hardware failure
