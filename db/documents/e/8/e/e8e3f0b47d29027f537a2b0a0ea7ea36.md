Many foot disorders affecting the arches are caused by improper shoe size, high heel shoes, arthropathy of the foot, or altered foot alignment.

**Hammertoe**

Hammertoe refers to hyperextension at the metatarsophalangeal joint and hyperflexion at the proximal interphalangeal joints. While in claw toe, there is hyperextension at the metatarsophalangeal joint and hyperflexion at the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. They are usually associated with improper size or high heel shoes or hallux valgus. It occurs due to muscular imbalance between extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, commonly involving extensor hallucis longus, flexor hallucis longus, and the peroneus longus.

**Hallux Valgus / Bunion**

Hallux valgus or bunion is characterized by lateral deviation of the great toe and medial deviation of the head of the first metatarsal, which leads to prominence on the medial side of the base of the great toe. It is frequently seen in women and is associated with high heels or tight shoes. Hallux valgus deformity complex includes metatarsus primus varus, hallux valgus, and metatarsosesamoid dissociation.

It occurs due to muscular imbalance and laxity of ligaments around the first metatarsophalangeal joint. Alignment of the first metatarsal is maintained by medially abductor hallucis and laterally by peroneus longus, assisted by collateral ligaments. These are also important factors in maintaining the arches of the foot.

**Hallux Varus**

Medial deviation of the great toe at the first metatarsophalangeal joint is called hallux varus.

**Hallux Limitus/Rigidus**

A limited or absent range of motion occurs at the first metatarsophalangeal joint refers to hallux limitus or rigidus.

**Tailor Bunion / Bunionette**

Bunionette refers to prominence on the lateral side of the head of the fifth metatarsal, which leads to medial deviation of the little toe. Because the tailor uses the cross-legged position, which predisposes to this condition, it is also known as a tailor bunion.

Tailor bunion is of three types. In type 1, thickened and enlarged head of the fifth metatarsal on the lateral surface; in type 2, increased curvature on the lateral side and normal intermetatarsal angle between the fourth and fifth metatarsal. In contrast, in type 3, an increase in the same intermetatarsal angle. Due to continuous irritation, a bursa can form, which may ulcerate later on.

**March Fracture / Stress Fracture**

The March fracture caused by repetitive stress due to abnormal load on healthy bone leads to microdamage and fracture later. It commonly occurs in sports persons or army soldiers due to increased physical activity after rest. It usually involves the neck of the second metatarsal because it is more fixed in position.

**Skew-foot**

Skew-foot manifested clinically as dorsolateral swelling or bump on the lateral and intermediate cuneiform bones and is associated with subluxation of the first tarsometatarsal joint. It is associated with angular medial concavity and convexity on the lateral side, giving rise to z-shape alignment.

**Metatarsus Adductus**

In this condition, metatarsals are adducted at the tarsometatarsal joint. Thus the fifth metatarsal near the base is prominent, and convexity is seen on the lateral side, while medial side concavity is seen without any dorsolateral bump. It is described as transverse foot deformity.

**Metatarsalgia**

Pain along the region of the head of the metatarsal is called metatarsalgia. It is of three types, iatrogenic, primary, and secondary. Primary metatarsalgia occurs because of anatomical abnormalities of the metatarsals associated with pes cavus or hallux valgus. Secondary metatarsalgia is caused by indirect pressure or load on the anterior part of the foot. While iatrogenic one occurs as a consequence of foot surgery, e.g., osteotomy of the metatarsal may follow malunion or avascular necrosis, leading to metatarsalgia.

**Morton (interdigital) Neuroma**

Entrapment of plantar digital nerves with perineural fibrosis is seen in Morton neuroma. It commonly affects women and predominantly involvesÂ third web space digital nerve. Entrapment occurs between the intermetatarsal ligaments.
