The cranial nerves are twelve pairs of nerves that travel outside the skull via foramina to innervate various structures. Cranial nerve (CN) XI is also known as the accessory nerve. According to the morphology of the cranial root of the accessory nerve, it is made of the union of two to four short filaments, making the cranial roots of the accessory nerve, then two to nine rootlets join the spinal root to form the nerve. The cranial roots of CN XI could be considered part of the vagus nerve when factoring in the function of the two nerves. Both the cranial roots of the accessory nerve and the vagus nerve originate from the nucleus ambiguus and dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve and travel to the laryngeal muscles, supplying the motor fibers.

As the accessory nerve travels down and away from the brain, the cranial and spinal pieces of the nerve come together to form the spinal accessory nerve (SAN). The spinal accessory nerve is formed by the fusion of cranial and spinal contributions within the skull base. It exits the skull through the jugular foramen adjacent to the vagus nerve.
