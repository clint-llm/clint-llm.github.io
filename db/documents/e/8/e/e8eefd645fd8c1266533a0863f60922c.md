Differential diagnosis remains broad as dyslipidemia and xanthomas can be present in other forms of:

- Combined hyperlipidemia - elevated levels of ApoB with increases in both LDL and VLDL secondary to overproduction.

- Nephrotic Syndrome-will causes an increase in the production of all cholesterol variants.

- Hepatic Lipase Deficiency- deficiency in hepatic lipase activity which is required for conversion of IDL to LDL. HDL is usually elevated as hepatic lipase manages the metabolism of HDL.

- Polygenic hypercholesterolemia

- Metabolic syndrome

- LPL deficiency

- Hypothyroidism

- Familial hypertriglyceridemia

Evaluation of causes of xanthomas and xanthelasmas is essential.

FD can also be mistaken for familial hypercholesterolemia. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic lipid disorder where the LDL receptors are defective that leads to increased LDL in the peripheral circulation. Usually, in patients with FD, LDL cholesterol is low. However, sometimes they can be falsely elevated when the Friedwalds formula is used to calculate LDL-C.Â The Friedewald formula subtracts the cholesterol content in HDL and VLDL from the total cholesterol to estimate the fasting plasma concentration of LDL-C. Cholesterol in VLDL is estimated by dividing the total TG concentration by 5. However, in FD, the cholesterol content in VLDL particles and remnants is increased, with the result that the Friedewald formula underestimates cholesterol in VLDL and overestimates cholesterol in LDL.
