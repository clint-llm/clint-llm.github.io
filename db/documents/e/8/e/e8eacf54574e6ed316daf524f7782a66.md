Clinically, purse-lip breathing when done correctly, can be beneficial in individuals suffering from dyspnea and air trapping. With proper teaching and coaching the technique can be easily taught by a trained professional. The benefits of purse-lip breathing may extend beyond its effects on the relief of carbon dioxide retention and improvement in oxygenation. Patients in mild respiratory distress may be able to regain control of their respiration through the technique. It is also an excellent tool for relaxation.

Purse lip breathing commonly helps patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). With these patients, purse-lip breathing may not be a voluntary action, but rather a compensatory mechanism to help splint open the airways.
