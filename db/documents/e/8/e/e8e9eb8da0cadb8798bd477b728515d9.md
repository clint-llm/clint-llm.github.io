An essential adjunct to POCUS training is establishing opportunities for continuing medical education (CME).  Common forms of CME include other external workshops, participation in a local or national conference that corresponds to POCUS, and self-directed learning. As with other forms of CME, self-directed asynchronous learning depends on the learners' commitment and time to improve and reinforce techniques and skills gained in the workshops and the classroom setting.  As POCUS continues to evolve, a wide array of literature and an online library of images are now available for self-directed learning, which may also supplement didactics.

As the novice sonographer becomes experienced, technical skill and clinical integration are vital to sustaining POCUS competency. If possible, the sonographer needs to engage in workshop activities, self-directed learning, and simulation to continue improving the skills acquired and learning new applications; this can be done as frequently as needed or annually.
