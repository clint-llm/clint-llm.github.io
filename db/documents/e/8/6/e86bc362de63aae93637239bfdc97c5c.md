A 3-phase bone scan is a powerful tool within the nuclear medicine diagnostic toolkit. When properly indicated, it can help to differentiate between cellulitis and osteomyelitis, assist in the diagnosis of complex regional pain syndrome, evaluate inflammatory arthritides, assist with the evaluation of hardware loosening versus infection, as well as the evaluation of maturity of foci of heterotopic ossification. Clinicians should be familiar with the indications for a 3-phase scan and pre-procedure preparation of the patient.
