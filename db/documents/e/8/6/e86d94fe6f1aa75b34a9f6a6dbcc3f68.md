Almost all tissue stains are performed on tissue that has been removed from the body.  However, in rare instances, very specialize stains called vital stains can work on tissue remaining in the body.  These stains are used for the identification of specific types of tissue and identification of abnormal tissue, so a subsequent biopsy can be more accurate in obtaining abnormal tissue.
