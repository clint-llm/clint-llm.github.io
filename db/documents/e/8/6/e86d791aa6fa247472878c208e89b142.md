Patients must consult a urologist whenever they detect any hematuria, abdominal mass, or flank pain. The interprofessional team should ensure that the patients are well informed about renal cancer. Patients should be informed about educational websites to help them better understand this malignant neoplasm, its outcome, and its treatment. Patient education helps in the deterrence of the processes that can cause renal cancer. Specialty-trained nurses often do this. For instance, advise the patient to stop smoking since renal cancer is linked to tobacco.
