The diagnosis of NSCLC is usually suspected once the patient is found to have a pulmonary nodule on a chest radiograph after they present with intrathoracic symptoms. Based on the intrathoracic symptoms and the potential chest radiograph findings, the differential diagnosis can, therefore, include:

- Bronchogenic carcinoma (adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma)

- Metastatic disease from the breast, head/neck, melanoma, colon, kidney, germ cell tumor, sarcoma

- Pulmonary carcinoid

- Extranodal lymphoma

- Plasmacytoma or schwannoma

- Benign neoplasms such as fibroma, neurofibroma, lipoma, hamartoma, leiomyoma, angioma

- Vascular phenomena such as hematoma, pulmonary infarct, arteriovenous malformation

- Bronchogenic cyst

- Inflammatory findings such as sarcoidosis, rheumatoid nodule, granulomatosis with polyangiitis

- Infectious granuloma (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, tuberculosis, atypical mycobacteria, cryptococcus, blastomycosis)

- Bacterial abscess

- Aspergillus

- Pseudotumor

- Mucoid impaction
