On histopathology, lesions show a wedge-shaped area of the ischemic dermis with a sparse perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates at the edge of the ischemic area. There is also an atrophic and slightly hyperkeratotic overlying epidermis. Within the dermis, edema and mucin deposition may be found in earlier lesions, whereas sclerosis is often present in later lesions.
