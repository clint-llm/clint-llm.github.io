As superficial migratory thrombophlebitis is associated with other systemic disorders, it is important to obtain a detailed history to identify symptoms and signs of an underlying disorder.

Ask for a history of hypertension, smoking and cannabis ab, travel history, personal and family history of cancer, hypercoagulable disorders, and autoimmune disorders.

To evaluate the migratory nature, ask if the patient has similar prior episodes and the location of the involved vein.

**Clinical presentation**

Patients with superficial thrombophlebitis present with pain, erythema, and induration along the course of a superficial vein. A nodular-cord, due to thrombus within the affected vein, is often palpable. A fever might be present.

Evaluate for signs and symptoms of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in high-risk patients such as patients older than 60 years, male sex, presence of systemic infection, bilateral superficial vein thromboses, and absence of varicose veins.

Mondor disease is superficial thrombophlebitis of the epigastric, thoracoepigastric, or lateral thoracic veins, presenting as painful indurated erythematous cords.
