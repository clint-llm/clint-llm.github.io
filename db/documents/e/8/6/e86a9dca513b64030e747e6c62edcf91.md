There is ample documentation regarding anatomic variations of peripheral and spinal nerves in the medical literature.  Most common variants involve motor neural plexuses, where roots from multiple spinal nerves coalesce into trunks with numerous branches and outflow tracts.  Anomalies in the brachial and lumbosacral plexuses often present as bifurcations, early splits, or complete absences of minor branches.  These differences become particularly important in cases that require the use of a local anesthetic.
