The placenta is the means of communication between mom and fetus. The placental membrane is where the exchange of substances happens between mother and fetus. This exchange is essential for the transfer of gases, electrolytes, hormones, maternal antibodies, fetal waste, and nutrition such as water, amino acids, glucose, vitamins, and free fatty acids. Fetal waste includes urea, uric acid, and bilirubin. Alpha-fetoprotein and other proteins also get exchanged. These transfers are beneficial to the fetus, but many harmful substances can pass through the placental membrane such as certain drugs, live vaccines, carbon monoxide, anti-Rh antibodies, and several infectious agents (“ToRCHes” infections).

Due to its multiple nutritional properties, many mammals besides humans, have the habit of eating the expelled placenta after giving birth.
