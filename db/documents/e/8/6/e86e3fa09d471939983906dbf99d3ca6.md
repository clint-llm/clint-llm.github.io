Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) is performed because millions of people are affected by overactive bladder and are refractory to behavioral modifications or pharmacotherapy. Indications for SNM include urinary retention, urgency frequency, urge incontinence, and fecal incontinence. This activity describes sacral neuromodulation and reviews the interprofessional team's role in evaluating and treating patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for sacral neuromodulation therapy.
- Describe the proposed mechanism of action for the various indications of sacral neuromodulation.
- Summarize the proper lead placement and neurostimulator implantation technique.
- Review some interprofessional team strategies that can create an environment leading to better patient outcomes.
