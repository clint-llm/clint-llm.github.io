Diagnosis is clinical or histological. The correct diagnosis was seen in only 12.5% to 55.5% of cases. There is low diagnostic accuracy because providers are unaware of the tumor and because pilomatrixoma mimics other lesions. Imaging is generally not performed. If imaging is necessary, x-ray, computed tomography, or ultrasound can be done to rule out vascular or lymphatic malignancies. Ultrasound can be used to distinguish heterogeneous echotexture, calcifications, hypoechoic rim, and posterior shadowing. Ultrasound can help correctly diagnose lesions preoperatively in 76% of cases compared to 33% when the diagnosis was made clinically.
