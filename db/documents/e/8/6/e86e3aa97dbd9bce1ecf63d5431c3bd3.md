One of the mainstays for diabetic macular edema treatment has historically involved laser photocoagulation, it has been shown to improve visual acuity in a small percentage of patients. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (EDTRS) provides the guidelines for treatment via laser photocoagulation. Leaking microaneurysms are directly treated, while a combination of focal laser photocoagulation and scatter laser photocoagulation are described as the treatment for DME in certain instances of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Although macular laster photocoagulation is a major treatment modality for clinically significant macular edema, it is not curative, and many cases are refractive to the laser therapies. Vitrectomies have been shown to improve DME; however, the science behind this is unclear. With the onset of new research, the clinical guidelines have changed, and current first-line therapy involves anti-VEGF therapy. Other treatment modalities include subthreshold micropulse photocoagulation diode and intravitreal steroid injections.
