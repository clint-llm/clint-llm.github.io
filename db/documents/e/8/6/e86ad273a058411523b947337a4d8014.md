Complications of videostroboscopy parallel those of any form of nasolaryngoscopy. Epistaxis, discomfort, gagging, vomiting, sneezing, coughing, and vagal episodes are the most common. There are no additional risks conferred to nasolaryngoscopy by the addition of stroboscopy; videostroboscopy is overall a very safe procedure.
