The Ottawa ankle rules have been demonstrated to be accurate in predicting which patients with ankle injuries require x-rays to exclude fractures in both adult and children older than five years.

The Ottawa ankle rules suggest ankle radiographs should be obtained in the setting of pain in the malleolar region and any of the following:

- Tenderness over the posterior edge of the distal 6 cm or tip of the lateral malleolus

- Tenderness over the posterior edge of the distal 6 cm or tip of the medial malleolus

-  Inability to bear weight immediately after the injury and for four steps at the time of evaluation.

A foot series is indicated in patients with midfoot pain and any of the following:

- Tenderness of the base of the fifth metatarsal

- Tenderness over the navicular bone

- Inability to bear weight immediately after the injury and for four steps at the time of evaluation

These rules should not be used in the presence of a distracting injury, intoxication, conditions causing diminished lower extremity sensation, and those with head injury or other conditions that would make cooperation difficult. The Ottawa ankle rules have been found to have only moderate specificity but a high sensitivity for ankle fractures. Less than 2% of those in whom no imaging was recommended by these rules have been found to have a fracture.

A typical ankle x-ray series would include anteroposterior, lateral, and mortise views. Standard views with a foot series include anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views.
