- Orbital abscess

- Cavernous sinus thrombosis

Intracranial complications can also occur.Â  These include the development of a subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma, meningitis, or a subdural empyema (the latter comes with a high mortality rate). Pott puffy tumor is a subperiosteal abscess of the frontal bone, usually associated with osteomyelitis. Both complications typically arise from frontal sinus infections, via hematogenous spread through the valveless diploic vein system.

Acute fungal sinusitis can occur in a noninvasive and invasive form.
