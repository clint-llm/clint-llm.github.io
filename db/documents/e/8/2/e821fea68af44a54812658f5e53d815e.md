Sensorineural hearing loss is best done with an interprofessional that includes audiology nurses. Over the years HBO has been recommended for the treatment of sensorineural loss but clinicians should be aware that the data are heterogeneous and there still remains some question about its real benefits. When to undertake HBO therapy for sensorineural loss is still being debated but some experts suggest it should be early in the course.

The outcomes-based on small case series seems to suggest that some patients with sensorineural loss do have a positive outcome, but this is not a universal finding.
