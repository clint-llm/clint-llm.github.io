Frontotemporal dementia is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of intellectual functions, such as memory problems, impaired abstract thinking, reasoning, and executive function, that are severe enough to hamper activities of daily living. The clinical manifestations include behavior changes, dietary changes, loss of empathy, apathy, and executive function. Memory is intact earlier in the disease course. This activity reviews the evaluation, treatment, and management of frontotemporal dementia, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of frontotemporal dementia.
- Describe the evaluation of frontotemporal lobe dementia.
- Outline the management options available for frontotemporal lobe dementia.
- Summarize the importance of coordination and communication amongst the interprofessional team to enhance the care of patients with frontotemporal dementia.
