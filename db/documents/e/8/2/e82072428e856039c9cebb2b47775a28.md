Patients should be educated to keep a check on their disease by following an appropriate treatment plan and adopting healthy living habits.

- **Avoid excess iron.**Unless the doctor recommends otherwise, patients should avoid multivitamins or other supplements that contain iron.

- **Eat a healthy diet.**Eating a balanced diet that contains plenty of nutritious foods can help the patient feel better and boost energy. Doctors sometimes also recommend taking a folic acid supplement to help make new red blood cells.

- **Avoid infections.**Patients should try maximally to protect themselves from infections, especially following a splenectomy. An annual flu shot, meningitis, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vaccines are recommended to prevent infections.

Patients should also receive education about the hereditary nature of the disease. If both parents have thalassemia minor, there is a 1/4th chance that they will have a child with thalassemia major. If one parent has beta-thalassemia minor and the other parent has some form of beta-globin gene defect, i.e., sickle cell defect, they should also be counseled about the possibility of disease transfer to their children. Patients with thalassemias should understand that their disease is not due to iron deficiency and that iron supplements will not cure the anemia; in fact, it will lead to more iron buildup if they are already receiving blood transfusions.
