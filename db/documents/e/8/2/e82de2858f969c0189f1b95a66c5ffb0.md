Rotational vertebral artery syndrome, or colloquially "bow hunter syndrome," is a rare cause of vertebrobasilar insufficiency.Â In patients with bow hunter syndrome, rotation of the head and neck can lead to compression of the vertebral artery at the atlantoaxial or subaxial levels in the spine. The name "bow hunter syndrome" is derived from a patient who developed Wallenberg syndrome (a lateral medullary infarction) during archery practice due to poor circulation with his head turned for extended periods.

Understanding the anatomy of the vertebral artery is critical to the pathogenesis of bow hunter syndrome. The vertebral arteries originate from the subclavian arteries. They generally enter deep into the transverse process of C6 in most cases (C7 in 7.5% of cases) and ascend through the transverse foramen of each cervical vertebrae. After ascending through the transverse foramen of the atlas (C1), the vertebral arteries travel along the posterior arch of C1 and into the suboccipital triangle where they enter the foramen magnum.
