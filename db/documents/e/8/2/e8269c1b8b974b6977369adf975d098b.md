Infrequently, a range of benign and malignant conditions can affect the seminal vesicles such as stones, cysts, infection, abscess, and tumors. Infectious manifestations are more common in countries where tuberculosis and schistosomiasis are endemic. Physical examination of the seminal vesicles can be difficult, but occasionally, seminal vesicle pathology is palpable during the digital rectal exam. Urinalysis may reveal non-visible haematuria or the presence of leukocytes. Measuring fructose levels from a semen sample can provide a direct measure of seminal vesicle function. If fructose is absent, then bilateral agenesis or obstruction should be suspected.

Imaging of the seminal vesicles is achievable through a number of modalities. Trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) is commonly the initial investigation of choice, allowing for both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. CT and MRI also allow imaging of the seminal vesicles and their bordering pelvic organs.

The proximity of the seminal vesicles to the prostate gland makes it a crucial adjacent structure in the staging and subsequent management of prostate cancer. The vast majority of malignant involvement of the seminal vesicles represents invasion from primary prostate cancer (pT3b).

Rarely, primary carcinoma of the seminal vesicle can present, but its histological diagnosis can be challenging to make. Most commonly, this takes the form of adenocarcinoma. However, rarer tumors such as lymphoma, sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and neuroendocrine carcinoma are also possible.
