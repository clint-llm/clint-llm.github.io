Complications associated with AKA can occur with delayed diagnosis or under-resuscitation and failure to end ketogenesis. These include hypovolemic shock and cardiac arrest. It is essential to manage other electrolyte disturbances and alcohol withdrawal to prevent seizures and the dreaded delirium tremens. Often patients with chronic alcohol abuse disorder will have non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, which may become evident as pulmonary edema on fluid resuscitation to treat AKA. Adequate and frequent clinical as well as biochemical monitoring is required to identify these potential complications early and prevent the morbidity associated with this condition.
