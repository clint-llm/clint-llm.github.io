After ingestion of E. coli O157: H7, the bacteria bind to the intestinal mucosa and begin releasing Shiga toxin. The toxin, in turn, disrupts protein synthesis in the epithelial cells lining intestinal mucosa, leading to cell death, sloughing of the mucosa, and eventual bloody diarrhea. Â Following exposure to the Shiga toxin, diarrhea, often the hemorrhagic variety, develops three days after exposure to the contaminated food specimen. After three days of diarrheal symptoms, diarrhea will become bloody in approximately 90% of affected patients. Hemorrhagic diarrheal symptoms will often resolve after seven days, with 85% of patients having a spontaneous resolution; the remainder 15%, often children, will develop systemic manifestations, most often HUS. Chronic colonization with the post-symptomatic shedding of E. coli O157: H7 may continue to occur, leading to a persistent risk of transmission and re-infection.
