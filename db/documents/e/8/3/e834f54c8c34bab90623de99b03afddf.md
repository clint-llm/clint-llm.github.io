The provision of anesthesia to the insertion site is by injecting a local anesthetic under ultrasound guidance along the track of proposed needle insertion. A skin wheal is raised to ensure adequate cutaneous anesthesia. A monopolar needle is inserted under ultrasound guidance up to 0.5cm to 1cm from the target nerve. An electrical stimulator is attached to the needle to deliver a test stimulation. Inducing uncomfortable local sensations is associated with superficial needle placement, and distal discomfort or muscle contractions are associated with too deep of needle placement. Readjustment of the stimulator needle continues until muscle contractions and discomfort are no longer present. The monopolar needle then gets withdrawn and the introducer needle pre-loaded with the stimulator lead is placed in the same location. The needle is then removed over the stimulator lead. Once the needle is withdrawn, the lead can be attached to a stimulator, and a surface electrode is placed on the ipsilateral limb. Appropriate placement results in comfortable sensations in the desired region without muscle contraction via the electrical stimulation. Upon confirmation of placement, the lead is secured in place with a sterile dressing.
