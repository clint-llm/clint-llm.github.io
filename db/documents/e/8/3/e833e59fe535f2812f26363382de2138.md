The frequency and severity of abortion complications depend on gestational age at the time of the abortion and the method of abortion.

Complications based on gestational age are as follows:

- Eight weeks and under - Less than 1%

- 8-12 weeks - 1.5-2%

- 12-13 weeks - 3-6%

- 2nd trimester - Up to 50%

The estimated abortion complication rate for all healthcare sources is about 2% for medication abortion, 1.3% for first-trimester aspiration abortion, and 1.5% for second-trimester or later abortions

In the United States, mortality rates per 100,000 abortions are as follows: fewer than 8 weeks - 0.5%; 11-12 weeks - 2%; 16-20 weeks - 14%; and more than 21 weeks - 18%.

In the United States, mortality from septic abortion rapidly declined after the legalization of abortions. Death now occurs in fewer than 1 per 100,000 abortions. The risk of death from septic abortion increases with the progression of gestation.

Curiously, one study reports that women aged 30–39 years were more likely to have a complication after an abortion compared with women ages 20–24 years, and Hispanic women were significantly less likely to have a complication compared with white women.
