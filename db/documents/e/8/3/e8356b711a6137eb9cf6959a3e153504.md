Pearly papules on the penis are best managed by an interprofessional team that includes nurses and pharmacists.

Because of the benign nature of pearly penile papules, as well as their possible resolution with age, treatment is not indicated. However, some patients feel distressed or have important cosmetic concerns. Furthermore, about half of males who are reassured of the benign nature of their pearly penile papules want to remove them. Some of them may use inappropriately over-the-counter topicals for common warts, which may cause injuries and scarring. Clinicians should educate patients that most treatments are likely to cause more harm than good. If patients persist, a urology consult should be sought for treatment options.
