Sleep disturbances decreased energy, and some mood changes can normally occur in the peripartum period. These can be differentiated from postpartum blues by assessing if the mood and activity levels are normal peripartum-related changes or determining if the symptoms cause impairment or distress in the individual’s life.

Postpartum blues requires differentiation from postpartum depression or, in concordance with the new DSM-5, a depressive disorder with peripartum onset. In the latter case, symptoms must meet the criteria for a depressive episode, and mood disturbances must persist beyond two weeks. According to the DSM-5, the criteria for a depressive disorder include depressed mood, anhedonia, weight or appetite changes, sleep disturbances or insomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty concentrating, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. The diagnosis for depressive disorder with a peripartum onset uses the same diagnostic criteria but with the added criteria that symptoms must occur in the context of pregnancy or within four weeks after delivery.
