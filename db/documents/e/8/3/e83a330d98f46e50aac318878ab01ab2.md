Arterial cannulation is freqently done in an ICU setting for monitoring of blood pressure. Anyone who performs arterial cannulation MUST be fully aware of the anatomy and potential complications. While arterial cannulation is only done by physicians, the care of patients is by ICU nurses. The insertion site must be monitored for bleeding, hematoma and signs of infection. In addition, the distal pulses in the extremity must be monitored. In general arterial lines should be discontinued as soon as hemodynamic stability is obtained.
