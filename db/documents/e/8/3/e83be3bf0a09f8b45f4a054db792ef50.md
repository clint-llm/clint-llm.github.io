Limited data are available on zonisamide overdose, and there are no cases reported thus far for monotoxicity with zonisamide. When acute or chronic zonisamide toxicity is suspected, immediate medical attention should be sought, and poison control should be contacted. The plasma concentration of zonisamide should be measured. Patients should be monitored closely and symptomatically treated. Overdose symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, somnolence, central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, and polyuria.
