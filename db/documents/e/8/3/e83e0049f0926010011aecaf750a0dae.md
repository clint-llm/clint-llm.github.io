Hantavirus infections occur worldwide with HCPS caused by hantaviruses of the New World and HFRS caused by hantaviruses of the Old World. Endemics and epidemics of HCPS are associated with increased rodent populations. Sin Nombre virus is responsible for most cases of HCPS in the US and Canada. 728 cases of hantavirus disease have been reported in the US between 1993 and 2017. 95% of cases occurred in states west of the Mississippi River with most cases occurring in New Mexico and Colorado. 63% of those infected were males and the mean age of infection was 38 years.

HCPS cases have also been described in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Paraguay, Panama, Uruguay, and Venezuela. People who get infected include those who live or work in rural areas, which is similar to the pattern seen in North America. Interestingly, Andes virus is the only hantavirus that can cause person-to-person transmission.
