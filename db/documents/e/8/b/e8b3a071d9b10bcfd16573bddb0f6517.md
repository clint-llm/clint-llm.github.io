The clinical hallmark of MFS is a triad presentation of acute ophthalmoplegia, areflexia, and ataxia in the setting of a preceding bacterial or viral illness. Distal paresthesia with or without weakness is also present. Symptoms on an average peak in four weeks or less, with supporting ancillary criteria as described by Brighton for GBS by Fokke C et al. in 2014. Other associated symptoms include diplopia or blurred vision, dysarthria, dizziness, and extremity tingling. Cranial nerve involvement is typical, resulting in facial, oculomotor, or bulbar weakness, which may extend to the limbs. Physical examination findings include typical findings for GBS like facial paresis, distal hyporeflexia without signs of upper motor neuron dysfunction, and loss of light and vibratory sensation in the distal extremities. Autonomic dysfunction such as hypertension, hypotension, or cardiac arrhythmia presents in advanced untreated GBS/MFS. Interestingly, the corneal reflex can be impaired.
