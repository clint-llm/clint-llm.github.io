Glucose is an essential source of energy for the fetus and neonate. The brain growth of the fetus exclusively depends upon glucose. In the early postnatal period, glucose homeostasis occurs via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The critical regulatory mechanisms of glucose homeostasis are sluggish in the initial days, particularly among preterm neonates. The mechanisms of neonatal hyperglycemia are multifactorial. The risk of hyperglycemia increases with the severity of the accompanying illness. The most common cause is high exogenous glucose infusion rates in preterm infants who are already at risk for hyperglycemia due to the following reasons,

- decreased ability to suppress endogenous glucose production,

- decreased insulin response to glucose, and

- limited glycogen and fat stores.
