Minimizing or avoiding the dust mite allergens leads to fewer allergic reactions. However, house dust mite allergy leads to a decreased quality of life in the long run. This can be explained by the following:

- Increased school and work absenteeism

- Decreased concentration leading to poor work performance

- Driving performance, as well as cognitive functions of individuals with a long duration of work, is markedly impaired

- Treatment of allergic symptoms in asthmatics is a substantial economic burden on families

- Disturbed personal relationships

- Decreased daily productivity

- Inability to participate in recreational activities and sports

The cost-benefit analysis demonstrates that immunotherapy is more cost-effective in the long term as compared with symptomatic treatment.
