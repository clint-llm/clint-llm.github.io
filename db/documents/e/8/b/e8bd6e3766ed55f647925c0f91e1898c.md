The focus of rehabilitation should be a return to previous activity levels.  Range-of-motion exercise and isometric and isotonic strength-training exercises should be included as part of recovery. During the progression of rehabilitation, a succession of proprioceptive training should be incorporated, followed by sports specific activities to prepare the athlete to return to competition

Following surgery, the operative extremity is placed in a well-padded splint with the foot in a neutral or slightly everted position.  The patient will remain non-weight bearing until directed otherwise by his surgeon. Sutures remain intact for 2-3 weeks following the procedure, and at that time the surgeon may initiate a gentle range of motion exercises to promote venous circulation. The patient will then be placed in a short leg walking cast or boot and allowed to transition to full protected weight-bearing over the next 2-4 weeks. Next, the patient will be transitioned to an ankle support orthosis and begin formal physical therapy.

The postoperative protocol will likely vary from depending on the surgeon and based on the procedure required and any adjunctive procedures performed in addition to ankle stabilization.
