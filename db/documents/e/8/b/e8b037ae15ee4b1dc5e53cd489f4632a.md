In human embryology, weeks six through eight are characterized by the growth and differentiation of tissues into organs.  This process is known as organogenesis and occurs from weeks three through eight; the embryonic period. During week three, the process of gastrulation occurs, which establishes three distinct cell layers; the mesoderm, endoderm, and ectoderm.  These are the primary germ cell layers from which organs arise during organogenesis.

In particular:

- The endoderm forms organs of the gastrointestinal and respiratory systems, as well as the thymus, parathyroid, bladder, and urethra.

- The ectoderm is responsible for the development of the skin and skin appendages, the nervous system, and portions of sensory organs.

- The mesoderm forms the circulatory system and blood, lymphatic system, bone, cartilage, muscles, and many internal organs. For example, the kidney, spleen, ureters, and adrenal cortex are all derived from mesoderm.

At the end of week eight, organ systems have developed and are ready for further maturation. By week nine, the fetal period begins and involves the growth and differentiation of anatomical structures. The fetal period lasts until birth.
