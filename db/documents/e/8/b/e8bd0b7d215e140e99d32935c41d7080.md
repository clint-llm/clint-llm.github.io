**Definition of Outcomes**

- Complete remission: Proteinuria <0.3 g/d or 300 mg/g on spot UPCR.

- Partial remission: >50% reduction of proteinuria from baseline or between 0.3 and 3.5 g/d, with relatively stable eGFR.

- Relapse: Recurrence of >3.5 g/d of proteinuria after remission.

- ESKD: GFR<15 ml/min or requirement for dialysis/transplant.

**Rule of One-thirds**

- Spontaneous remission in one-third of the patients with conservative management only.

- One-third have symptomatic proteinuria without progressing into renal failure and might benefit from immunosuppressive therapies.

- The remaining one-third are refractory to treatment and require dialysis due to ESKD. These should be evaluated for renal transplantation.

**Risk Factors for Poor Prognosis**

- Male gender, White race

- Old age

- Hypertension on presentation

- Massive proteinuria (>8 g/day) for 6 months

- Elevated creatinine or acute kidney injury at the time of presentation

- Extensive tubulointerstitialÂ fibrosis on biopsy
