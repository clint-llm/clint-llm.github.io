Treatment and prevention of liver cirrhosis are best done by an interprofessional team that includes a hepatologist, gastroenterologist, liver surgeon, pathologist infectious disease specialist, nurse practitioner, primary care provider, and an internist. All healthcare workers should follow patients with liver dysfunction from any cause because it can quickly become irreversible. Liver cirrhosis is associated with many systemic complications that can cause death. A liver transplant is not always an option because of the shortage of donors.
