Biopsy specimens from tufted hair folliculitis lesions demonstrate scarring fibrosis in the upper dermis, resulting in a convergence of the follicular infundibula (the upper portion of the hair follicle) into a single channel. The lower portions of the hair follicle, including the bulb, are not affected by the scarring process and remain separate. As seen in folliculitis decalvans, a perifollicular neutrophilic inflammatory infiltrate is often observed in tufted hair folliculitis. In some other cases, the inflammatory infiltrate is mixed, containing, in addition to neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasmocytes.
