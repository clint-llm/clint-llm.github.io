Because of their low rates of infection, peripherally inserted central catheters are indicated in patients that require IV therapy for lengths of time that range from weeks to months.

Specific indications for fluoroscopic PICC line placement include:

- Intravenous infusion of irritant medications (chemotherapy)

- Total parental nutrition (TPN)

- Long term administration of medications (antibiotics)

- Monitoring of interventions (central venous pressure and repeat blood sampling)

- Patients with poor peripheral access (reducing the number of needle punctures to the skin)

- Multiple blood transfusions

- Aberrant central venous anatomy
