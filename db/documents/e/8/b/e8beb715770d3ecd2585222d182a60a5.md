Patients with anterior nosebleeds can be discharged if the bleeding is controlled and hemodynamic stability is observed for at least one hour in the emergency department (ED), as well as having all predisposing factors medically optimized. Follow up with an otolaryngologist or their primary physician should occur in one week and they should begin nasal saline three times daily. If non-biodegradable packing is used, patients should return to the ED or ENT for packing removal in three to five days. If a patient, including pediatric patients, require posterior packing, admission is required to monitor for complications, particularly cardiac arrhythmias.  All anticoagulants should ideally be discontinued but must be reversed or withheld to achieve the lowest dose acceptable if discontinuation is not possible.

Application of topical saline sprays or ointments to the nasal mucosa to ensure moisturization of the nasal mucosa can help to prevent recurrent epistaxis. Patients should also be advised to avoid hot foods, strenuous activity, blowing nose, or digital manipulation of the nose on discharge.
