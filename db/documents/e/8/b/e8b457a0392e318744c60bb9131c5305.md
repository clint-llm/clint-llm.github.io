Glucagonomas are neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreatic islets that secrete glucagon. Glucagonoma syndrome occurs due to the effects of elevated glucagon levels secreted by the tumor. The first case was described in 1942 by Becker et al. in a 45-year-old woman presenting with widespread dermatitis, weight loss, glossitis, and abnormal glucose tolerance associated with an islet cell neoplasm of the pancreas on autopsy specimen. In 1966, McGavran and colleagues identified the classic symptoms of mild diabetes and dermatitis along with elevated glucagon levels related to a metastatic alpha cell tumor of the pancreatic islets. This activity highlights the clinical presentation, evaluation, and management of glucagonomas and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the symptoms of glucagonomas.
- Describe laboratory tests and imaging studies used to diagnose glucagonomas.
- Explain the management and requisite follow up for glucagonomas.
- Outline the significance of a well-integrated, interprofessional approach to the medical and surgical management of glucagonomas.
