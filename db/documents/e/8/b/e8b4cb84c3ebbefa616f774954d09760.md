**X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (Bruton Disease)**

It is seen in boys. It is due to a failure of pre-B cells to differentiate into mature B lymphocytes as caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes for a tyrosine kinase protein needed for further differentiation.

**Transient Hypogammaglobulinemia of Newborn**

It is a physiological reaction of the body after the maternal antibody disappearance about 4 to 6 months of age. The child is susceptible to recurrent infections similar to those seen in X-linked agammaglobulinemia. Once the child's immune system matures and makes an antibody, this problem is corrected.

**Selective Ig Immunodeficiencies (IgA Selective Deficiency)**

Normally, antibodies switch from IgM to other classes, including IgG and IgA. Sometimes there is malfunctioning in heavy-chain gene switching and causes this problem.

**Super IgM Syndrome**

In this disease, the gene encoding the CD40 ligand on T cells is anomalous. That creates that B and T-lymphocyte cooperation in the immune response be compromised. The failure to interact with CD40 results in an inability of the B cell to switch from the production of IgM to the other classes of antibodies.

**Common Variable Immunodeficiency Disorder**

It expresses in the second or third decade of life or later. It has an unknown etiology.
