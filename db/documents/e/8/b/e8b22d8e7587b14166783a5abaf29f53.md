Diphenhydramine, which is available as an over-the-counter medication, is a first-generation antihistamine that is used in a variety of conditions to treat and prevent dystonias, insomnia, pruritis, urticaria, vertigo, and motion sickness. It also possesses local anesthetic properties for patients with allergies to other, more commonly used local anesthetics; however, this is an off-label use of the medication. Additional off-label use is for the treatment of oral mucositis.
