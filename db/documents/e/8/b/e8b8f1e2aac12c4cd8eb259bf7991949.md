- Rabies is rarely a concern due to the broad vaccination program in domesticated animals and the fact that the patient usually knows the animal. Depending on the local prevalence of the disease, one may be able to defer rabies prophylaxis for dog and cat bites.

- If the status of the animal is unknown, rabies prophylaxis may be deferred if the animal is in custody and may be observed or has an evaluation for rabies.  Most commonly, rabies originates in bat and skunk populations.

- Any bite or suspected bite from a bat should require rabies prophylaxis.  Rabies prophylaxis initiation in the ED requires the rabies vaccine provided in a distant site from the injury with as much of the required rabies immune globulin being given local to the wound.

- Further rabies vaccine doses are necessary on days three, seven, and fourteen.

- Immunocompromised individuals with cat bites or scratches should be covered with TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or rifampin as prophylaxis against cat-scratch disease.

- Sepsis from Capnocytophaga is covered by standard prophylaxis in dog bites in immunocompromised individuals.

- Bites from K-9 officers should be treated similarly to the above with the additional documentation that the officers will require.
