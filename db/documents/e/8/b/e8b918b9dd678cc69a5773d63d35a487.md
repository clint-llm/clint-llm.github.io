Characteristic histopathologic findings distinguish epidermolytic hyperkeratosis from other congenital ichthyoses. Prominent features on histology include dense orthohyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis, coarse keratohyaline granules and cytolysis of the suprabasal and granular layers. Keratinocytes demonstrate marked intracellular vacuolar degeneration and dense clumps of keratin intermediate filaments. Varying degrees of dyskeratosis and a mild perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate also occur. Electron microscopy shows clumped keratin intermediate filaments at the suprabasal layer, and immunohistochemistry shows defects in keratins 1 or 10.
