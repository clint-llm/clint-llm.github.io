Some contraindications for the Fontan Completion are historic. Some of these contraindications have been modified with variations on the surgical technique, and include:

- Pulmonary artery hypoplasia

- Left ventricular dysfunction and significant mitralÂ regurgitation

- High pulmonary vascular resistance

Elevated pulmonary artery pressures have been identified as leading to less favorable surgical outcomes after Fontan.
