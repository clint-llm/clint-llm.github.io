As the name implies, current waste anesthetic gas disposal (WAGD) systems are designed to collect and dispose of volatile anesthetics that have been exhaled or that have escaped from the patient’s breathing circuit into the operating or procedural suite.  Nitrous oxide and the halogenated agents do not undergo significant biotransformation; nitrous oxide simply gets transported as an unbound dissolved gas, and the other fluorinated compounds are largely redistributed and ultimately expired, experiencing minimal hepatic or renal metabolism.  Current evidence suggests that over 90% of these agents are eliminated from the body unchanged; this reinforces the concept of requiring a system to scavenge volatile anesthetics for their appropriate reuse or disposal.

In the United States, The Joint Commission (TJC) mandates that anesthetic delivery systems must have active scavenging methods.  Systems exist in active and passive forms and can either be open or closed, not unlike methods of gas delivery to the patient.  As with any system, points of failure exist and merit careful consideration to mitigate the risk and degree of exposure to personnel and the environment.  Although safety mechanisms are designed into the anesthesia machine and the hospital infrastructure, responsible behavioral practices by a diligent anesthesia provider are irreplaceable.
