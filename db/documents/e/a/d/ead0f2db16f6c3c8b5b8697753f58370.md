There are twelve thoracic vertebrae in the spine, designated as T1-T12.

Each thoracic vertebra has six facets to allow for articulation with the ribs.

Lastly, T12 articulates with the lumbar spine at the level of L1. The thoracic vertebrae have several muscular attachments, including erector spinae, interspinales, intertransversarii, latissimus dorsi, multifidus, rhomboid major and minor, rotatores, semispinalis, serratus posterior superior and inferior, splenius capitis and cervicis, and trapezius.

SCS and FPR use the bodyâ€™s intrinsic ability to relax. SCS involves neuromuscular activity between a muscle agonist and antagonist called the Proprioceptive Theory.

FPR is similar to SCS. The physiology behind FPR involves altering increased gamma motor neuron activity that affects the muscle spindle.
