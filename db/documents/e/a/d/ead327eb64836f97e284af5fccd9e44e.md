Bowel necrosis is the widespread cellular death of any part of the GI tract below the stomach. It is due to the body’s inability to meet the metabolic demands of the tissue. The cells, starved of oxygen, switch to anaerobic metabolism which does not provide enough energy to maintain the electrochemical gradient and hydrostatic equilibrium resulting in swelling and rupturing of cells. Physiologically, this results in bowel edema and breakdown of the immunological barrier permitting bacteria to invade the dying tissue. Once inside the bowel tissue, they begin to produce proinflammatory mediators resulting in further damage and edema. Initially, cells furthest from the blood supply die first, and as time passes, the entire thickness of the bowel wall dies and becomes necrotic. Bacteria, toxins, and breakdown products return to systemic circulation resulting in systemic inflammation and sepsis.

This cascade is usually precipitated by a low-flow state such as an acute embolic, thrombotic, inflammatory, or obstructive event.
