Because of a lack of universally accepted definition for lumbar spinal stenosis, the exact epidemiology is difficult to determine. In an ancillary Framingham study, where test subjects underwent a CT scan to determine the central diameter of lumbar spinal canals, absolute lumbar spinal stenosis was defined as a diameter of less than 10 mm. The prevalence of acquired lumbar spinal stenosis was 19.4% for the population aged between 60 and 69 years.  In a  Japanese population-based study where subjects completed a symptoms questionnaire to predict lumbar stenosis, the research showed that incidence increased with age, with 1.7 to 2.2% between ages 40 and 49, and 10.3% to 11.2% between ages of 70 to 79.
