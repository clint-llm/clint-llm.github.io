- Neutropenic enterocolitis is a life-threatening condition.

- This condition should be in the differential diagnosis of severe neutropenic patients with abdominal pain and fever.

- CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis helps with the diagnosis along with clinical presentation.

- Conservative management is preferred initially.

- Prompt initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotics is essential in suspected patients.

- Surgical treatment is avoided due to neutropenia and thrombocytopenia but considered when complications arise.
