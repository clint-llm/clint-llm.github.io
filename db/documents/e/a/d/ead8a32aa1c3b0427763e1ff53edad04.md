Symptom duration is typically five to six months as the ossified lesion matures. The severity of the pathology will dictate the treatment plan. Mild and moderate cases are usually managed conservatively with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, corticosteroid injections, and range-of-motion exercises. Severe refractory cases, however, are considered candidates for surgical excision of medial collateral ligament calcifications. A study by Kulowski and Riebel showed a high variance in surgical outcomes, with a high recurrence rate, while data from Pellegrini and an updated Kulowski study showed quite the opposite. Additionally, surgical studies have warned that excision of larger lesions can lead to ligamentous defects requiring surgical reconstruction.
