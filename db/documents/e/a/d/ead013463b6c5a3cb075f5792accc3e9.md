Brain death occurs as a result of an acute catastrophic brain injury. Abrupt loss of cerebral perfusion occurs if a concomitant elevation of intracranial pressure is more than mean arterial pressure (cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) = mean arterial pressure (MAP) - intracranial pressure (ICP). This process was studied by monitoring brain tissue oxygenation in patients with brain death and can occur via two different mechanisms:

- Extracranial brain injury, as seen in patients following cardiopulmonary arrest with delayed resuscitation, resulting in prolonged cessation of cerebral blood flow. The resultant anoxia leads to neuronal damage, resulting in cellular membrane pump failure, disturbed osmoregulation, and, ultimately, severe brain edema. As a result of the confined space of the skull, ICP increases, compromising cerebral perfusion and resulting in further neuronal injury.

- Intracranial brain injury, as seen in TBI and intracerebral hemorrhage, can cause an elevation in ICP and the resulting impairment of brain oxygenation, as mentioned above.
