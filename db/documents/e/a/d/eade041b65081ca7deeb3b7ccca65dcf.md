Due to the genetic contributions to the disease, detailed personal and family histories should be collected during the initial visit. Many presentations such as dark urine can be asymptomatic and easily missed or forgotten.

Dark urine is the earliest and only manifestation of the disorder in the pediatric population, so it continues to be one of the most heavily utilized presentations in the workup and diagnosis of the disorder.

Ochronosis commonly presents in the third to fifth decades of life. Presentations include scleral and ear cartilage pigmentation, tendon thickening and tears, ligament tears, muscle tears, joint and bursal effusions, kidney stones, prostate stones, aortic dilatation, cardiac valve calcification and regurgitation, and coronary artery calcification.

Ochronotic osteoarthropathy occurs when ochronosis is located within the hyaline articular cartilage of joints. Osteoarthropathy is the most common symptomatic complaint and is considered the most incapacitating consequence of the disorder.

Symptoms involving the eyes can be very beneficial in the workup and diagnosis of the disorder. Some degree of ocular involvement is believed to be present in 67 to 70% of patients with alkaptonuria, but they often go undetected as visual acuity is usually not impacted. Yellow-brown or blue-black pigment deposition in different eye parts creates the different ocular signs of alkaptonuria (Figure 2). Although vision is typically not affected by hyperpigmentation, complications resulting from pigment deposition can be sight-threatening.

The most common ocular sign is secondary to pigment deposition in the sclera, creating symmetric scleral pigmentation as seen in 83% of patients. Studies have found that pigment selectively deposits primarily in locations of the sclera with preexisting degeneration or insertion of ocular tendons.

Another standard (75%) ocular finding that is considered pathognomonic for the disease is the appearance of “oil-drops,” resulting from pigment deposited with a spot-like appearance in the limbus. Pigment deposition in the conjunctiva creates “vermiform” or “tube-like” conjunctival hyperpigmentation. This finding is often accompanied by increased conjunctival vessel diameter due to dilated vasculature supplying areas of pigmentation.

Other less common ocular signs include pigment deposition that narrows the chamber angle, such as through obstruction of trabecular meshwork or fibrosis in the periphery. This deposition location can lead to elevated intraocular pressure and glaucoma.

A few select cases have reported consequences of ocular ochronosis to include acute anterior uveitis, central vein occlusion, and macular epiretinal membrane. Still, the association of these complications to the disease has not yet been established.

Gross and slit-lamp examinations can be used to visualize ochronotic hyperpigmentation in the sclera, limbus, and conjunctiva. Further testing using a tonometer, keratometer, or corneal topographer may be indicated if concerns for related complications such as glaucoma and astigmatism.
