Obtaining a thorough history in a patient with possible BPI is necessary to identify the injury mechanism, associated fractures, and other concomitant trauma to the neck, shoulder, and chest cage. Careful inspection of the patient can provide important clues to the extent of the injury. Considerable bruising and swelling may indicate deep trauma with possible vascular injury, which can be confirmed by evaluating the radial, ulnar, and brachial pulses. A detailed neurologic examination is warranted to ascertain the location of the lesion. Paralysis of the paraspinal muscles may indicate injury at the cervical level of the foramen. Firing of the latissimus dorsi muscle (innervated by the thoracodorsal nerve, a branch of the posterior cord) and pectoralis major muscle (sternal and clavicular heads innervated by the medial and lateral pectoralis nerves, respectively from the medial and lateral cords) should be evaluated to determine whether the lesion is proximal or distal to the cord level.
