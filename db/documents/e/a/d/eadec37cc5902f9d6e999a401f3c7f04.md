Synovial sarcoma is a mesenchymal tumor that presents mainly in adolescents and adults younger than 30. It is a relatively rare tumor, with 800 to 1000 cases reported annually. Synovial sarcoma is defined by the translocation between chromosome X and 18, which leads to the expression of SS18:SSX fusion proteins. This activity reviews the presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and role of interprofessional teams in managing patients diagnosed with synovial sarcoma.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical presentation, evaluation, and pathological findings of synovial sarcoma.
- Review the treatment options available for synovial sarcoma.
- Summarize the latest clinical trials exploring treatment options for synovial sarcoma.
- Explain the role of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to treat patients diagnosed with synovial sarcoma and improve outcomes.
