Empty sella syndrome (ESS), also known as arachnoidocele, is a disorder in which the subarachnoid space herniates into the sella turcica, causing compression and flattening of the pituitary gland and stretching of the pituitary stalk. Over the years, the term empty sell was adapted further by radiologists observing a similar phenomenon in CTs and MRIs of the brain. Regarding pathophysiology and etiology, empty sella syndrome (ESS) subdivides into two categories: primary empty sella syndrome (PES) and secondary empty sella syndrome (SES). This activity articulates how to properly evaluate this condition and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for patients with this empty sella syndrome.

**Objectives:**
- Review the causes of empty sella syndrome.
- Describe the history and physical exam of a patient with empty sella syndrome.
- Summarize the treatment of empty sella syndrome.
- Outline the importance of enhancing care coordination among the interprofessional team to ensure proper evaluation and management of empty sella syndrome.
