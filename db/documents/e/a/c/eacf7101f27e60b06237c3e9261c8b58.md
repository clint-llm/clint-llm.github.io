The liver has a central and critical biochemical role in the metabolism, digestion, detoxification, and elimination of substances from the body.

Most major plasma proteins (except immunoglobulins [Igs] and the von Willebrand factor) are mainly or exclusively synthesized in the liver. The liver responds to multiple hormonal and neural stimuli to regulate blood glucose concentrations.

The liver is also the primary site of metabolism of both endogenous substances and exogenous compounds (e.g., drugs and toxins). This process, known as biotransformation, converts lipophilic substances to hydrophilic ones for subsequent elimination.

As a large organ, the liver shares with many other organs the ability to perform its functions with extensive reserve capacity. Individuals with liver disease often maintain normal function despite extensive liver damage. In such cases, liver disease may be recognized only using tests that detect injury.

This review focuses on the significance of the hepatic enzyme ALT in assessing hepatic injury and malfunction. ALT is aggregated primarily in the cytosol of hepatocytes and consists of 496 amino acids, and has a half-life of approximately 47 hours.

Therefore, the elevation of serum ALT concentration is a sensitive but not specific measure of hepatocellular injury, as the degree of elevation can not determine the exact cause.
