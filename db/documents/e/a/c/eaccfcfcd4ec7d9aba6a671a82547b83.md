The management of carbamazepine toxicity is with an interprofessional team that consists of an emergency department physician, nephrologist, poison control staff, nurse practitioner, hematologist, and an intensivist. Treatment ranges from physiological clearance, use of activated charcoal, or extracorporeal therapy such as hemodialysis or plasmapheresis. Due to the risk of death in 13% of cases with significant toxicity, an aggressive treatment plan is required that includes hemoperfusion (HP), hemodialysis (HD), intravenous lipid emulsion (ILE), and multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC). Specialty trained nurses are involved in triage, administering treatments, and monitoring patients. They provide feedback to the team, thereby improving communication and outcomes. Toxicology pharmacists review medications prescribed, drug-drug interactions, and provide patient and family education.

The outcomes for most patients with carbamazepine toxicity are good if the patient is managed soon after the overdose. In all cases of an intentional overdose, the patient should be referred to a mental health counselor prior to discharge.
