Urinary catheterization is a common clinical intervention to ensure adequate urinary drainage when patients cannot void effectively. When a urinary catheter cannot easily be placed, a thorough understanding of anatomic considerations that may impact catheter placement and fundamental working knowledge of various Foley catheterization techniques can aid physicians and other healthcare professionals in successfully enabling urinary bladder decompression. This activity reviews anatomic and clinical considerations when encountering difficult catheterizations and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and managing difficult urinary catheterizations to improve the care for men and women undergoing Foley placement.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the contraindications to urinary instrumentation in difficult foley catheterization.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique regarding difficult foley catheterization.
- Review the techniques to assess and treat patients who are difficult to catheterize.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve care for difficult foley catheterization and improve outcomes.
