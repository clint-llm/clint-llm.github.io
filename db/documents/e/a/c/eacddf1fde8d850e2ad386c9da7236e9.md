**Lactase Activity**

Lactase is necessary for the digestion of the disaccharide lactose. Most persons have a genetically programmed decline in lactase activity after weaning. It is sometimes useful to determine lactase activity, including patients with chronic diarrhea and excessive bloating without an alternative etiology. Practically, lactase deficiency is diagnosable via hydrogen breath testing after a lactose load. However, such testing cannot be performed on all patients, and sometimes the breath test is considered to be not indicative of lactase deficiency. In these latter cases, lactase, which is an enzyme located on the small bowel surface, can be measured in specialized labs on endoscopic mucosal biopsy specimens or more easily with a rapid grosser assay performed at endoscopy on the specimen.

**Celiac Disease**

Celiac disease or gluten-sensitive enteropathy is largely undiagnosed and estimated to occur in about 1% of the global population.

Genetically susceptible subjects have a hypersensitivity to the gluten peptide found in wheat, barley, and rye products. The hypersensitivity can result in gross or microscopic small intestinal inflammation. The duodenum is a prime area since it first encounters the gluten emanating after gastric digestion. Endoscopic features include diminished size and number of duodenal folds, scalloping, fissuring, and a mosaic pattern have also been described. However, sometimes endoscopic findings are subtle or not present.

Typical duodenal microscopic features are increased lymphocytes in the mucosa, duodenal villus atrophy, and prominent crypts. Multiple duodenal biopsies are obtained since the inflammation is often patchy. There are available sensitive and specific serologies for celiac disease, but most authorities require a duodenal biopsy for diagnosis and monitoring.

**Giardiasis**

Giardiasis is a global parasitic scourge especially prevalent in parts of Russia and presents in those drinking unprocessed water such as mountaineers and travelers. Infected subjects may be asymptomatic or complain of intermittent bloating and watery diarrhea. It is usually diagnosed by stool studies, but occasionally the trophozoites are noted on the duodenal surface. Savvy pathologists in endemic areas can readily diagnose this with appropriate staining.

**Immunocompromised Hosts**

Immunocompromised hosts include those with immunodeficiencies such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, including checkpoint inhibitors, and organ transplant recipients on medications to prevent rejection. There are a plethora of microorganisms that can cause infections in the subjects that sometimes are detectable on duodenal biopsies including viruses (cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, etc.,), parasites (cryptosporidium, Giardia, strongyloidiasis, etc.,), fungi (microsporidia) and bacteria (mycobacteria).

**Whipple Disease**

The gram-positive bacterium Tropheryma whipplei is the etiologic agent of Whipple disease, which potentially affects multiple systems, including the small intestine, central nervous system, heart, skin, and joints.

Cardiac involvement includes valvular fibrosis resembling rheumatic heart disease. Typical duodenal pathology includes prominent foamy macrophages with PAS-positive inclusions. Electron microscopy with polymerase-chain reaction analysis and identification of the infecting organisms is necessary for the diagnosis. Prolonged antibiotic therapy, starting with parenteral agents, is required.

**Crohn Disease**

Crohn disease is a relatively common inflammatory disease with both genetic and environmental causation that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Upper gastrointestinal Crohn disease is less common than ileal or colonic involvement but can occur solely or with involvement elsewhere.

**Systemic Disease**

Systemic diseases with abnormal tissue infiltration often have duodenal involvement and thus can be diagnosed by duodenal biopsy. Both myeloma-associated (AL) and secondary (AA) amyloidosis can be diagnosed by duodenal biopsies.

Duodenal eosinophilia has been controversially linked to irritable bowel syndrome and is also present in parasitic infestation and the eosinophilic infiltrative disorders, including eosinophilic gastroenteritis.

**Neoplasms**

Duodenal adenocarcinoma is less common than gastric or colon carcinoma and associated with a poor prognosis. It is commonplace for the more prevalent pancreatic malignancies to invade into and obstruct the duodenum. The duodenum has an excellent blood supply and is thus an area for remote metastases. These include melanoma, lung cancer, colon cancer, squamous cancer, and less commonly breast-cancer.

Duodenal biopsies obtained at endoscopy are performed either in a directed manner towards pathological areas or randomly to detect or monitor the disease, including particularly celiac disease. Malabsorptive, infectious, inflammatory, rheumatologic, infiltrative, and neoplastic diseases are diagnosable via the biopsies.
