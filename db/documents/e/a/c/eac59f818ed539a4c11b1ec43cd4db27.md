The subjectivity of hyperacusis has given rise to several definitions in the literature, the simplest of which separates the presentation into four categories: loudness, annoyance, pain, and fear.

Phonophobia and misophonia present similarly (and indeed the terms are often used synonymously), however, an important distinction must be made between these conditions. Hyperacusis is sound sensitivity arising from within the auditory system, and therefore can be triggered by any generic, low-intensity sound.

A full neurotological examination is essential in detecting any associated or underlying causes of hyperacusis, some of which are reversible.

**Hyperacusis vs. Tinnitus**

Hyperacusis is almost exclusively bilateral and rarely intermittent and not commonly associated with somatic modulation. Percept is vivid and salient and the impact of self-help is unknown.

Tinnitus is often unilateral and intermittent and associated with somatic modulation. Percept can be formless or primitive and self-help can be effective.
