Acute intermittent porphyria is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by a deficiency of hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS). It presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, and seizures. Treatment for acute attacks is intravenous heme. Definitive treatment is an orthotopic liver transplant. This activity gives an overview of the etiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, management, and treatment of the disease by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of acute intermittent porphyria.
- Review the evaluation of acute intermittent porphyria.
- Outline the management approaches and therapeutic options available for acute intermittent porphyria.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance early diagnosis and management of acute intermittent porphyria and improve outcomes.
