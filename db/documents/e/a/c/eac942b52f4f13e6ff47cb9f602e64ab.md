Gastric varices are commonly encountered in cirrhotic patients as a result of portal hypertension. However, gastric varices can occur in patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertension and are considered distinct with a different etiology, pathophysiology, and management strategy compared to gastric varices secondary to portal hypertension.
