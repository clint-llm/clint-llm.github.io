The use of IVL is presently limited to calcified plaque modification within the innate coronary and peripheral arterial vasculature; however, growing evidence suggests that the device may also be beneficial for facilitating interventions of the major aortic arch vasculature and distal abdominal aorta and iliofemoral vasculature for facilitating large bore access and therapies such as transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR).
