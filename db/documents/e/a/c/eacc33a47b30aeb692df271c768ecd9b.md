Flap transfer for defect closure is contraindicated when the defect can be safely, aesthetically, and effectively closed primarily or with a skin graft, when there is an active infection in the wound, and when there is residual malignancy after oncologic resection. Flap transfer may proceed once the infection hasÂ resolved and/or the margins have been cleared. In palliative care cases, positive oncological margins may not necessarily contraindicate flap transfer.
