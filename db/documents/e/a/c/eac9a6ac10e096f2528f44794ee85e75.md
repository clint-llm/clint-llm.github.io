Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder that is primarily caused by a homozygous mutation of 985A→G in the ACADM gene in roughly 80% of clinically symptomatic patients. Other gene mutations result in MCAD deficiency, but nearly 18% of affected patients will carry at least one allele with 985A→G mutation.
