According to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), oxygenation, ventilation, and circulation should be continuously monitored during the performance of a regional anesthetic. The patient's condition may rapidly deteriorate with the provision of any type of anesthesia. Accordingly, qualified anesthesia personnel should be continuously present and prepared to escalate care should untoward clinical events occur.

During the performance of a block with chloroprocaine, oxygenation must be continuously assessed. The pulse oximeter is the most commonly used method to quantitatively assess the adequacy of oxygenation.

During the performance of a regional block with minimal or no sedation, the adequacy of ventilation can be assessed by observation of chest excursion, mask fogging, and auscultation of breath sounds.Â  In July 2011, the ASA changed its recommendation to assess ventilation during moderate or deep sedation.

Circulation should be continuously evaluated during the performance of a block with chloroprocaine. The electrical activity of the heart should be continuously assessed with an electrocardiogram. In addition, arterial blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored at 5-minute intervals or more frequently.

The temperature should be assessed whenever clinically meaningful changes in body temperature are expected. Due to the short duration of procedures that involve chloroprocaine administration, temperature monitoring is usually not required while blocks are being performed.
