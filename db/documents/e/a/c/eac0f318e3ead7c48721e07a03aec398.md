Once the post-abortion complication has been managed, the interprofessional team including the nurse practitioner should:

- Educate the patient on proper contraceptive measures as a means of birth control, to avoid unwanted pregnancies. The patient should be urged to remain compliant with antibiotic therapy if the abortion was septic.

- Educate the patient to pay more attention to nutrition (iron-containing diet) to prevent anemia.

- Encourage adequate fluid intake to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance in the body.

- Avoid exertion and heavy exercises and promote rest for 2 weeks.

- AvoidÂ long travels.

- Avoid drinking alcohol for at least 48 hours as it may increase the risk of heavy bleeding.
