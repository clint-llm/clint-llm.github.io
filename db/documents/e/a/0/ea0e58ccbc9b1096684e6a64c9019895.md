The management of tooth fractures is challenging, and to derive good outcomes, the treatment goals have to be defined from the begging. Because of the potential risk of complications derived from the tooth fractures, such as pulp necrosis, root resorption, and periapical abscesses, appropriate and regular follow-up appointments are recommended. More complex cases, like crown-root fractures, require an interprofessional approach involving endodontics, restorative dentistry, and periodontics. This is mostly due to the sublingual location of the line of the fracture in such cases.
