Dental extractions are routine dental treatments offered by a range of practitioners with varying degrees of experience in oral surgery and various clinical settings. While modern dentistry focuses on patients maintaining their dentition for as long as possible, dental extractions are still commonly performed. Therefore, it is crucial that all practitioners performing dental extractions are aware of the basic principles of this treatment to perform these procedures safely and effectively.

This article focuses on non-surgical dental extractions to allow discussion of these basic principles. The non-surgical removal of a tooth relies on the progressive expansion of the bony socket within which a tooth sits, creating sufficient mobilization of the tooth, ultimately allowing for the tooth to be removed from the jaw. Dental extractions are not without risk, and all clinical and patient factors which impact this risk must be considered and discussed with the patient during the consent process.

An overall understanding of relevant anatomy, extraction techniques, and perioperative factors is key to effective clinical care.
