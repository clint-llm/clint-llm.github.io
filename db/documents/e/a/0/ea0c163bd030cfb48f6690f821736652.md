Preparing for catheterization begins with a thorough clinical and urological history to understand the catheter placement indications and ascertain the cause for difficulty obtaining urethral access to the bladder. The location of any urethral obstruction (fossa navicularis, meatus, bulbous urethra) can be estimated from the prior failed catheterization attempts. The physician should review the indications for the urinary catheter to ascertain if it is absolutely necessary. (A Foley catheter can often be avoided in patients who can void spontaneously, empty their bladders well, and are being catheterized only to monitor fluid output.)

If appropriate, the patient should be treated with pain medication to minimize discomfort during instrumentation. The bed should be elevated to a height comfortable for the physician, and the patient should be on the same side of the bed as the provider. Additional hospital staff should be available to aid in exposure in obese patients, and adequate light should be available. A Trendelenberg position can sometimes be helpful, especially in morbidly obese females.

Additional attention is required for poorly mobile or recently postoperative patients to ensure safe positioning and adequate urethral exposure. Ensure adequate lighting is available. If space allows, set up a sterile table for instruments and catheter kits to ensure the aseptic technique is maintained. Additional considerations may include using a bed with stirrups to appropriately position the patient's legs or a bed with the ability to allow Trendelenburg positioning for easier direct visualization. Ensure adequate supplies, such as additional catheters, wires, angiocaths, sterile drapes, lubricant, and instruments, are available when a difficult catheterization is anticipated.
