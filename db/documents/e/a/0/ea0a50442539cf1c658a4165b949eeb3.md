he radial forearm free flap (RFFF) has gained tremendous popularity since its introduction in 1978 as a reconstructive option. This flap's relative ease of harvest, pliable tissue, and reliable anatomy make it a reconstructive workhorse most commonly for defects of the hypopharynx, oral cavity, total pharyngoesophagus, and scalp. This activity reviews and explains the role of the reconstructive surgeon in evaluating and treating patients who undergo radial forearm tissue transfer reconstruction of the head and neck.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of radial forearm tissue transfer for head and neck reconstruction.
- Review the preparation and technique regarding radial forearm tissue transfer for head and neck reconstruction.
- Outline common potential complications of radial forearm tissue transfer for head and neck reconstruction.
- Describe the importance of preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative decision making by the reconstructive surgical team to ensure the appropriate selection of candidates for radial forearm tissue transfer and to enhance overall management.
