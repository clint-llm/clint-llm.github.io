Botulinum antitoxin, also known as botulism antitoxin, is comprised of antibodies or antibody antigen-binding fragments that block the neurotoxin produced by the bacterial species Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum toxin causes botulism, a paralytic syndrome classically characterized by symptoms of descending symmetric muscle weakness. Symptoms can include blurry vision, inability to speak or swallow, and weakness in the bilateral upper extremities with progression to the chest and lower extremities. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of botulism antitoxin, pertinent for interprofessional team members for the treatment of patients with botulism poisoning.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the mechanism of action of botulism antitoxin.
- Describe the potential adverse effects of botulism antitoxin.
- Review the indication(s) for the therapeutic use of botulism antitoxin.
- Discuss interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the treatment of botulism poisoning and improve outcomes when using botulinum antitoxin.
