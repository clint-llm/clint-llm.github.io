The clinician should obtain a complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and urine analysis. The WBC and CRP will generally be elevated, but the diagnosis cannot be ruled out even if they are within normal limits. The urinalysis is helpful to rule out a urinary tract infection. However, these laboratory studies will not help the clinician delineate between diagnoses of appendicitis, intussusception, or mesenteric adenitis.

Imaging

Abdominal ultrasonography is the gold standard for the diagnosis of mesenteric adenitis. Ultrasound that shows enlarged, hypoechoic mesenteric lymph nodes and the absence of a thickened blind-ending tubular structure (inflamed appendix) is diagnostic of mesenteric adenitis. The current radiological definition defines mesenteric adenitis as at least one abnormally enlarged lymph node measuring 8 mm or more in its short-axis diameter.

Lymph node enlargement can also present in acute appendicitis and perforated appendicitis, adding to the difficulty of correctly diagnosing the disease process; however, the lymph nodes tend to be less enlarged and numerous in cases of appendicitis. Recently, the use of superb microvascular imaging Doppler ultrasound has been studied in the pediatric population for achieving a diagnosis of mesenteric lymphadenitis.  This new technique of Doppler ultrasound has proven to show low-velocity blood flow with better image resolution when compared to color Doppler flow imaging.

A recent retrospective study compared the use of superb microvascular imaging (SMI) in addition to ultrasound with ultrasound alone in the pediatric patient population diagnosed with mesenteric lymphadenitis. The authors demonstrated increased sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy with the addition of SMI to ultrasound compared to ultrasound alone, 81.5% v. 63%, 76.7% v. 66.7%, and 78.9% v. 64.9%, respectively.
