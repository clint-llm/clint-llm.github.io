The treatment and management of follicular thyroid carcinoma depend on the stage at presentation. Follicular thyroid carcinoma with minimally invasive characteristics is treated with thyroid lobectomy and isthmectomy

For patients with metastasis to bones and soft tissues, either radiotherapy or chemotherapy, or both are indicated after the total thyroidectomy. Chemotherapy that has been reported to control tumor progression and prolong progression-free survival includes tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as sorafenib, lenvatinib, vandetanib, and cabozantinib.
