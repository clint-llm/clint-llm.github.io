A primary winged scapula results from an injury to the nerve, changes in the scapula bone itself, or periscapular soft tissue abnormalities. Remember, the serratus anterior muscle attaches to the medial aspect of the scapula and attaches it to the rib cage. If it loses innervation by the long thoracic nerve, it can no longer provide stability to the scapula, leading to medial scapular winging. Again, lateral scapular winging is due to damage to the trapezius or rhomboid muscles. The scapula will move laterally due to unopposed muscle strength attributed to the trapezium or rhomboid paralysis or weakness. The trapezius is solely innervated by the spinal accessory nerve, which crosses the posterior cervical triangle superficially, where it can be damaged during occipital lymph node biopsy. The dorsal scapular nerve innervates the rhomboid muscles.

A secondary winged scapula occurs due to glenohumeral and subacromial conditions and should resolve after addressing the pathological condition causing the winging. A winged scapula caused by trauma is uncommon.

Irrespective of the cause of winging of the scapula, the condition is disabling and can affect the function of the ipsilateral shoulder and arm. Also, winging of the scapula also leads to significant cosmetic deformity.
