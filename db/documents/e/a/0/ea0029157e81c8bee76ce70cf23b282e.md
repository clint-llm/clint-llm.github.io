By the time a patient requires hospitalization, transformation into the second stage of the disease (cardiopulmonary compromise or hemorrhagic fever with renal insufficiency) has already developed. A cough and vomiting may dominate the clinical presentation at this point. Orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea will likely all be present. The first significant abnormal laboratory test, which is also the most useful, is platelet count.Â  Thrombocytopenia or decreasing platelet count warrants admission to the hospital for further evaluation.

Hematuria has been noted as a marker of kidney injury but has not been correlated with thrombocytopenia.
