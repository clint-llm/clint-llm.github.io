As part of any patient evaluation, all interprofessional healthcare team members need to assess the state of social relationships in the patient's life. As outlined above, deleterious physical effects can manifest from stressful situations and relationships. The lack of social support to help navigate these situations can prove very debilitating to a patient's health. The interprofessional team needs to document these situations and share the data with the rest of the team so interventions can more effectively address the patient's issues and concerns, resulting in better outcomes.
