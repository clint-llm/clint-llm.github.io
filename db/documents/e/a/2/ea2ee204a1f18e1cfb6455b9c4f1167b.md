Early identification, especially in drug-induced leukocytoclastic vasculitis, is crucial and patients should be educated about this potential adverse effect of the medications before initiating the medication.  Patients with idiopathic cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis usually carry a favorable prognosis, however, if there is a secondary etiology, close follow-up is needed and patients should be educated about the importance of compliance and regular monitoring.  Further, patients should be educated about the course of the leukocytoclastic vasculitis as it may take several weeks to months for it to resolve.
