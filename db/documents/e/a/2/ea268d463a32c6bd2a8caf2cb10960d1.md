Preoperative preparation of the patients involves optimization and management of comorbidities, which may include cessation of medications such as anticoagulants or antiplatelets. A period of fasting is advisable, as appropriate. All patients undergoing orchidectomy should be offered testicular prosthesis and should have a discussion about this in the preoperative clinic.

Patients who are concerned about fertility should also be offered sperm banking, especially those who may require adjuvant care such as radiation or chemotherapy, which may affect the contralateral testis. A detailed written informed consent is obtained before surgery and is best obtained in the clinic before the day of surgery. On the day of surgery, the patient should have a re-examination, and the side marked clearly with a permanent marker.
