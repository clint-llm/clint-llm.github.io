Febrile seizures occur with a fever higher than 38 C or 100.4 F and no other seizure-provoking etiologies such as described above. The highest fever necessary to cause febrile seizures is specific to the individual as each child's threshold convulsive temperature varies. While the degree of the fever is ultimately the most significant factor in febrile seizures, these seizures often occur as the patient's temperature is rising. In fact, a febrile seizure may be the first sign that a child is ill, with the presence of a fever greater than 38 degrees discovered shortly after that. There is no specific cause of fever that is more likely to cause febrile seizures. Any fever of adequate height may cause a febrile seizure.
