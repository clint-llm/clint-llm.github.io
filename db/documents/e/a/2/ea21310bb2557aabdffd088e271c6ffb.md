Running along the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the internal jugular vein (IJV) provides deoxygenated blood directly to the right atrium (RA). Although there is a functional valve bordering the superior vena cava (SVC) and RA, this valve does not appear to hinder the phasic flow of blood to the RA. Therefore, the pulsations that can be observed at the level of the IJV can provide valuable insight into the hemodynamics of blood at the level of the RA.
