The disease is endemic in 31 sub-Saharan African countries, the Arabian peninsula, and a small locality in Latin America that stretches across the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and Brazil. About 90% of the disease occurs in sub-Saharan Africa.

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that at least 25 million people are infected worldwide, and another 90 million are at risk, with more than 99% of them in Africa. Vision loss is estimated to affect 1.15 million population.

Worldwide ongoing mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin has significantly reduced the burden of infection and associated ocular disease.****In a risk factors assessment study in Ethiopia, the male gender, a distance less than 2 km from the riverbank, noncompliance to ivermectin therapy, and age of above 35 years were all associated with a higher prevalence of onchocerciasis.
