The indications to undergo bariatric surgery, are based on body mass index (BMI) as well as the presence of comorbidity. Patients with a BMI of 40 kg/m2 or greater without coexisting medical problems, and for whom bariatric surgery would not carry an excessive risk, should be candidates for one of the surgeries mentioned above.

Patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2 and 1 or more severe obesity-related comorbidities, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), GERD, asthma, venous stasis disease, severe urinary incontinence, debilitating arthritis, or considerably impaired quality of life, would also qualify as surgical candidates. Patients with BMI OF 30 to 34.9 kg/m2 with diabetes or metabolic syndrome also may undergo weight loss surgery, although there is a lack of sufficient data to demonstrate long-term benefits in such patients.
