Alternative methods have been developed to assess a patient’s pubertal development. The Pubertal Development Scale (PDS) is a questionnaire that covers typical changes manifested throughout puberty (e.g., growth spurt, body hair growth, voice deepening, etc.) and asks patients to answer whether they’ve experienced these changes or not. Features not assessed with SMR can be evaluated through this system. Additionally, the PDS assesses a patient’s understanding of their progression through puberty.

Picture-Based Interview about Puberty (PBIP) is a measure of pubertal development that relies on a conversation between clinician and patient. With the assistance of a set script and photographs, clinicians discuss changes in the adolescent body with the patient, after which the patient reports their assessment of their pubertal stage.
