Physical therapists, orthotists, and prosthetists must all monitor and communicate any issues related to a prosthetic limb. Interprofessional communication is vital to make sure each team member is informed when issues arise, such as a poor-fitting prosthesis or functional limitations of the patient, and the issues are addressed via a multidisciplinary approach.
