Inflammatory arthritis includes a group of arthritis accompanied by joint pain, swelling, warmth, and tenderness in the joints, and morning stiffness that lasts for an hour. Because most of the inflammatory forms of arthritis are systemic, symptoms related to inflammation may occur in other parts of the body, including skin rashes, eye inflammation, hair loss, dry mouth, and fever. The increased number of cells and inflammatory substances within the joint can irritate it, in turn, wearing down the cartilage and swelling of the synovium. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of inflammatory arthritis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the various forms of inflammatory arthritis.
- Outline the components of a proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with inflammatory arthritis, including any indicated imaging studies.
- Summarize the treatment options available for the various forms of inflammatory arthritis.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of the various inflammatory arthritides and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
