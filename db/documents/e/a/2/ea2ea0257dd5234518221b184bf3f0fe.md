Duodenal atresia presents early in life as vomiting, usually occurring within the first 24 to 38 hours of life after the first feeding, and progressively worsens if not treated. Sometimes the vomiting may be projectile, which, like pylorospasm and gastroesophageal reflux, may simulate hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.
