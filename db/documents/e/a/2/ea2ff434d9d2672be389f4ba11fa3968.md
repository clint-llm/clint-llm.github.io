Montelukast is relatively well-tolerated and generally safe.

Allergic granulomatous angiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) may also correlate with the use of montelukast, although there is not yet an established causal relationship.

Zafirlukast is generally well tolerated, and associated adverse events are minimal.
