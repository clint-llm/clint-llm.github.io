- Solitary fibrous tumors of the pleura are rare entities and are typically benign. About 20% of SFTPs are malignant.

- These tumors are frequently asymptomatic and usually manifest clinically when the tumors are large. The most common symptoms are atypical pulmonary symptoms like cough and dyspnea. Paraneoplastic syndromes such as Doege-Potter syndrome and Pierre-Marie Bamberg syndrome occur in approximately 5% of cases.

- Differentiating benign and malignant forms of SFTPs can be difficult. Some clinical and histological features indicative of malignancy include a high mitotic index, large tumor size ( diameter greater than 10cm), tumor necrosis, calcifications, cellular atypia, pleural effusion, and paraneoplastic syndromes.

- Histopathologic evaluation is needed for definitive diagnosis, and immunohistochemistry aids in differentiating SFTPs from other similar clinical entities, such as mesotheliomas.

- Complete resection of the tumor with negative surgical margins (R0) is the only treatment modality with curative intent.
