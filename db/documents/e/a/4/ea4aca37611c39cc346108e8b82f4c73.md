The etiology of polymyalgia rheumatica is not well understood.

Familial aggregation of PMR has suggested a genetic predisposition.

There were reports of increased incidence of PMR along with GCA during epidemics of mycoplasma pneumonia and parvovirus B19 in Denmark suggesting a possible role of infection in etiopathogenesis.

There are also reports of an association between PMR and diverticulitis, which could suggest a role of a change in microbiota and chronic bowel inflammation in the immunopathogenesis of the disease.

A case series of previously healthy subjects developing GCA/PMR after influenza vaccination also exists.
