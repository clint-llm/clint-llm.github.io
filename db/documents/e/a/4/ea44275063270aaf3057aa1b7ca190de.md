Optimizing the timing for RVOT intervention remains challenging. Standard TPVI criteria are currently similar to those used for surgical pulmonary valve replacement (PVR). The criteria focus on RV volumetric data, RV systolic function, significant TR, significant RVOT obstruction, arrhythmias, QRS interval, and potentially other residual intracardiac defects. TPVI is generally indicated with one of the following criteria in asymptomatic patients with moderate to severe PR:

(1) Significant RV dilation: right ventricular end-diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) > 150 ml/m2, or right ventricular end-systolic volume index (RVESVI) > 80 ml/m2

(2) RV systolic dysfunction: RV ejection fraction (RVEF) < 45%

(3) Persistent atrial or ventricular arrhythmias

(4) RVOT obstruction: RV systolic pressure (RVSP) > 2/3 systemic or > 80 mm Hg

(5) Progressive TR

(6) Symptomatic patients with moderate to severe PR and significant pulmonary stenosis with RVSP > 60 mm Hg.

Class IIa recommendation (Level of evidence: B) for TPVI was assigned by the American Heart Association, American Academy of Pediatrics and Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions for patients with moderate to severe PR or PS with an RV to PA conduit with or without symptoms.

The presence of symptomatic severe PR and/or PS constitutes a class I indication.

The guidelines recommended by various societies depend on the following risk factors to recommend the intervention of pulmonary valve: (1) age at initial repair, (2) electrophysiological markers, and (3) hemodynamic consequences related to severe PR.
