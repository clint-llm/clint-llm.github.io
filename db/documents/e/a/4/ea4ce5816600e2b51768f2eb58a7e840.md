Age-related changes include a decrease in hair distribution and pigment of the hair. A decreased amount of subcutaneous fat leads to decreased volume of the mons pubis, labia majora, and labia minora. There may be fissuring or other signs of friction of the external genitalia or at the introitus. Inflammation may occur, resulting in erythematous patches, with or without petechia or friable tissue.

Collection of pH, vaginal swabs for the Vaginal Maturation Index, and cultures are obtained before the speculum exam. The exam reveals hypoestrogenic tissue with decreased secretions and elasticity, resulting in the introitus's narrowing and more susceptible to friction. Vaginal tissue will be pale pink with diminished vaginal secretions.

pH greater than 5.0 or decreased Follicular stimulating hormone is consistent with lower estrogen states. The pH of vaginal secretions should be obtained before the speculum exam.

Vaginal maturation index (VMI) is the proportional relationship between the superficial, intermediate, and parabasal cells of the vaginal tissue. A decrease in estrogen is associated with an increase in parabasal cells resulting in lower VMI. The hypoestrogenic state is noted as a VMI of 0 to 49, however, the hyperestrogenic state is noted as a VMI 65 to 100.
