LHON is a genetic disease with variable clinical presentations due to the effect of the type of mutation, environment, and exposure to toxins. In the asymptomatic or carrier stage patients should be encouraged to have a healthy diet with vitamin supplementation (B1, B2, and B12). They should absolutely avoid binge drinking and exposure to any tobacco products as these increase energy demands on the mitochondrial and can cause worsening of visual function.

Once the disease is in the symptomatic phase, oral administration of a quinone analog (idebedone) and vitamin supplementation can improve the chances of visual recovery, though there is no larger trial to prove that.

Once a patient has been diagnosed as having LHON other family members can be given genetic counseling and testing whether they inherit the proband or not.
