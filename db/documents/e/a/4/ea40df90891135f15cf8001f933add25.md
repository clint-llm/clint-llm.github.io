A thorough understanding of the physics principles outlined above cannot be understated as it is vital to the study of hyperbaric and undersea medicine. Physics provides a foundation for understanding the environmental stressors in a hyperbaric environment and the underlying mechanisms for many injuries encountered. Undersea and hyperbaric clinicians must be able to use their knowledge of physics and gas laws to appropriately diagnose and manage undersea and hyperbaric injuries and illnesses. For example, both inner ear barotrauma and inner ear DCS may offer similar clinical presentations however only the inner ear DCS requires treatment in a recompression chamber. In fact, not only is HBOT not indicated for inner ear barotrauma, it may worsen the condition. It is essential for a treating clinician to be able to recognize emergent hyperbaric indications, and to choose the most appropriate treatment modality.
