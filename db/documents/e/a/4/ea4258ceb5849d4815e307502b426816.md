Due to advances in several medical subspecialties such as pediatric cardiology and pediatric cardiac surgery, the prevalence of congenital heart disease has increased to 1 in 150 in adulthood, in which about half have undergone surgery in childhood. A significant proportion of patients will need re-intervention in adulthood.

The etiology of conduit dysfunction over time is multifactorial and can depend on the patient's age, the defect, tissue type, intervention type, and the material employed. Furthermore, homograft valve deterioration can cause significant RVOT dysfunction, pulmonary regurgitation (PR), and pulmonary stenosis (PS), with about half of the patients requiring re-intervention.
