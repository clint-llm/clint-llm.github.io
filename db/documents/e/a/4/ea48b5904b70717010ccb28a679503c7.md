A thorough maternal and perinatal history and physical examination guide in identifying the potential etiology. As the reno-vascular or renal parenchymal disorders account for the majority of cases of NH, the initial investigations pertain to this system and include urine analysis, blood urea nitrogen level, and serum values of creatinine, electrolytes, and calcium. The urine should be tested for vanillyl mandelic acid and homovanillic acid. Â The initial workup should also include the aortic and renal ultrasonography with a doppler study.

Further investigation is guided by history and clinical suspicion and should include the following:

- Thyroid function tests, serum cortisol levels, serum aldosterone, and plasma renin activity, plasma and urine catecholamines and metanephrines, serum 11 dexoycortisol, and 11 deoxycorticosterone. Urinary 17-hydroxysteroid and 17-ketosteroid

- Additional studies, such as chest radiograph (BPD, congestive heart failure), echocardiogram, voiding cystourethrogram, captopril renal scintigraphy, dimercaptosuccinic acid renal scan, computed tomographic angiography to evaluate renal artery and the aorta, abdominal MRI, head ultrasonography to rule out intraventricular hemorrhage.
