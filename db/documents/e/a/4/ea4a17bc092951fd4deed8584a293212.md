Hydrocephalus is most common in infancy secondary to congenital malformations and from intraventricular hemorrhage in premature babies. Late in life, it presents another peak due to NPH cases. The overall global prevalence of hydrocephalus is approximately 85 per 100,000 individuals with a significant difference between different age groups; 88 per 100,000 for the pediatric population and 11 per 100,000 in adults.

The prevalence in the elderly population is much higher, somewhere around 175 per 100,000, and more than 400 per 100,000 for those more than 80 years old due to the high incidence of NPH later in life. Africa and South America have higher hydrocephalus prevalence.
