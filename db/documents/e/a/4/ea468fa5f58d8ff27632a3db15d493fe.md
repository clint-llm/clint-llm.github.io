Few studies have investigated the true prevalence and incidence of mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms. Mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms mostly affect females, particularly middle-aged women [48 +/- 15 years (84% < 60 y)], as shown in a retrospective study that identified the disease in 95% of women. A recently published study indicated an incidence rate of 2.4% and a prevalence rate of 2.6%, although other retrospective trials reported a prevalence rate as high as 17.5%. Mucinous cystic pancreatic neoplasms are mostly (93%) located in the body or tail of the pancreas. Median size was 5 cm (61% > or = 5 cm)
