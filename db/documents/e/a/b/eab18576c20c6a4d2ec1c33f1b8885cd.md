The interscalne block is a frequently performed procedure by the anethesia nurse, anesthesiologist nurse and the pain specialist. Howver, all those who perform this block must be fully aware of the potential complications and have resuscitative equipment in the room. The patient must be monitored by a dedicated nurse during the procedure. When done well, the interscalene block does allow for surgery on the arm without the need for general anesthesia.
