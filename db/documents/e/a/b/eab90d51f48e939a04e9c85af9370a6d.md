Parathyroid hormone plays a vital role in calcium and phosphorus metabolism by acting in the kidneys, intestine, and bone. Normally secreted in response to low blood calcium, PTH works to increase calcium absorption in the distal tubules and inhibit phosphate resorption. It also increases body calcium by indirectly stimulating osteoclasts, which results in bone resorption. Finally, PTH enhances intestinal absorption of calcium by increasing the activation of vitamin D. Pathological overproduction of PTH will cause inappropriate elevations in calcium with depletion of phosphate. It is derangements in these 2 elements that account for most of the symptoms classically seen in parathyroid disease.
