Botulinum toxin is stored in powder form and must be refrigerated (except for incobotulinumtoxinA), with most manufacturers recommending temperatures between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius for up to 36 months before reconstitution.

Most manufacturers recommend preservative-free saline for reconstitution and use within 24 hours if refrigerated. However, a recent expert consensus statement based on randomized controlled trials has stated that reconstitution with bacteriostatic/preserved saline may reduce discomfort with injections. A reconstituted vial may be refrigerated or refrozen for at least 4 weeks without significant risk of contamination or decreased effectiveness.

To reconstitute the lyophilized form of the toxin in physiologic saline, the provider must plan out the desired concentration in units/mL.

- 2.5 mL of 0.9% normal saline to a vial of 100 units, creating a dilutional concentration of 4 units of toxin in every 0.1 mL of the reconstituted mixture.

- 2 mL of 0.9% normal saline to a vial of 100 units, creating a dilutional concentration of 5 units of toxin in every 0.1 mL of the reconstituted mixture.

- 1 mL of 0.9% normal saline to vials of 100 units, creating a dilutional concentration of 10 units of toxin in every 0.1 mL of the reconstituted mixture.

A suggested dilution range for abobotulinumtoxinA is 0.6 to 2.5 mL of saline in 300 units of toxin.

Using a 20 gauge needle, the desired amount of 0.9% normal saline can be drawn up and inserted into the vacuum-sealed vial. The vial should be gently swirled around, avoiding any shaking movements. Once mixed, the fluid can be drawn up into a 1 mL syringe. Typically, a 30 or 31 gauge 0.5-inch needle is used for injection. When using an insulin syringe with an attached 31 gauge needle, the vial stopper should be removed to avoid blunting the needle tip.

To reduce the chance of post-procedural bruising, patients should avoid supplements and medications known to increase bruising during the days before and after the procedure. These include ginkgo biloba, vitamin E, garlic, alcohol, aspirin, NSAIDs, blood thinners, and SSRIs.

Application of pre-injection topical anesthesia is a safe option with a significant reduction in pain scores.
