Dentoalveolar trauma injuries are caused by an external impact on the teeth, palate, mandible, maxilla, and gingiva. These injuries can result in anything from a tooth contusion to a total dislocation of the tooth from its socket, known as tooth avulsion. A significant amount of force is usually necessary for the avulsion of teeth, and other injuries to surrounding structures should be suspected. This activity reviews the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of tooth avulsion and highlights the role of team-based interprofessional care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of tooth avulsion.
- Review the treatment regime for an avulsed tooth.
- Explain the pathophysiology and histopathology of an avulsed tooth.
- Summarize the complications usually associated with tooth avulsion.
