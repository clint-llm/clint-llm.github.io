Most patients undergo an extensive gastrointestinal (GI) disease workup for more common causes of postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss, such as peptic ulcers, cholecystitis, and malignancy, which delays the diagnosis of CMI. Demonstrating the stenosis or occlusion of the primary mesenteric vessels via vascular imaging is required for the diagnosis of CMI. CT angiography (CTA) is the preferred initial, non-invasive modality, as it identifies or excludes atherosclerotic stenosis of the mesenteric vessels while simultaneously ruling out other abdominal etiologies. In the outpatient setting, duplex ultrasonography is a reasonable screening modality, with peak systolic velocities greater than 275 cm/second and 200 cm/second indicating greater than 70% stenosis of the spinal muscular artery and celiac artery, respectively. Arterial digital subtracted angiography (DSA) is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of CMI if the results of noninvasive imaging are equivocal, and it is used to plan therapeutic interventions.
