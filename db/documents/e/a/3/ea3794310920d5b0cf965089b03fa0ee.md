Hyperkalemia is the most common and life-threatening adverse effect of potassium administration and can develop rapidly.

Gastrointestinal side effects commonly occur with enteral preparations, such as nausea, emesis, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.

Extravasation, local irritation, and phlebitis may occur due to improper dilution of intravenous preparations or administration through a peripheral vein.

Hypersensitivity reactions occur from the use of potassium iodide as well as chronic iodine poisoning (iodism).
