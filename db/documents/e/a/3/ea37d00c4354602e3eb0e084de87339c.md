Treatment options for the underlying diagnosis of dysphonia may include speech and language therapy, medical management, surgery, and/or a combination of the above.

Generally, steroids and antibiotics are not given for dysphonia with unclear etiology.

Speech and language therapy is typically the first-line treatment option for patients with dysphonia who do not otherwise meet indications for surgical intervention (e.g., no suspicion of malignancy and/or vocal cord immobility identified on laryngoscopy or video stroboscopy examination). Speech therapy is often successful and still the first line, even when patients present with benign vocal fold nodules.

Surgery is an option for patients with benign vocal fold lesions that do not respond to speech therapy. Meanwhile, patients who present with laryngeal dystonias may require interventions such as botulinum toxin injections, which have shown benefit in patients with disorders such as laryngeal dystonia/spasmodic dysphonia.

Patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancer may require chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, or a combination of these modalities, depending on the stage of their presentation.
