Early diagnosis and complete avoidance of inciting antigen results in total recovery of lung function in the majority of patients. Presence of pulmonary fibrosis portends a poor prognosis with a median survival of 3 to 5 years. Other factors such as older age, greater exposure, delayed diagnosis, cigarette smoking, the absence of lymphocytosis on BAL fluid, recurrent acute exacerbations, and pulmonary arterial hypertension have been associated with worse outcomes.
