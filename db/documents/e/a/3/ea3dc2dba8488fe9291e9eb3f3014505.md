Computed tomographic (CT) scan with three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is the principal imaging modality for evaluating craniosynostosis.

The findings in unilateral coronal synostosis are a shallow ipsilateral anterior cranial fossa, contralateral frontal bossing, and an elevated roof and lateral wall of the ipsilateral orbit called the "harlequin eye" sign. The findings of unilateral lambdoid synostosis are ipsilateral occipitoparietal flattening, contralateral frontal and occipitoparietal bossing,  a unilateral small posterior cranium, and a tilted skull base. There is an ipsilateral deviation of the posterior fossa in the endocranial skull base view of unilateral lambdoid synostosis. Morphometric analysis of the skull base with the help of 3D CT can differentiate the three causes of plagiocephaly.

Lambdoid synostosis can cause crowding of the posterior fossa and herniation of the caudal part of the cerebellum into the foramen magnum resulting in Chiari malformation.

Anthropometric measurements help to assess the severity of plagiocephaly.
