Anaphylaxis is an acute, life-threatening hypersensitivity disorder, defined as a generalized, rapidly evolving, multi-systemic allergic reaction. Anaphylactic reactions were classified as IgE-mediated responses, while anaphylactoid reactions as IgE-independent events. Physical presentations of anaphylaxis range from mild skin flushing and pruritus to severe respiratory symptoms. This activity describes the evaluation and treatment of anaphylaxis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the common inciting sources in the etiology of anaphylaxis.
- Describe the IgE-mediated immune response in the pathophysiology of anaphylaxis.
- Summarize the clinical criteria used in the evaluation of anaphylaxis.
- Outline the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes in patients with anaphylaxis.
