The secretion of the parathyroid hormone is inversely related to the concentration of ionized calcium in the extracellular fluid. The activity of the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), a G-protein coupled receptor, is affected by changes in the concentration of calcium. As the calcium concentration in the extracellular fluid increases, this receptor is activated, and parathyroid cells decrease the secretion of parathyroid hormone. Conversely, the activity of the CaSR decreases, and parathyroid hormone secretion increases as calcium levels decline.

Parathyroid hormone activates the PTH receptor, another G-protein coupled receptor, increasing the resorption of calcium and phosphorus from bone, enhancing the distal tubular reabsorption of calcium, and decreasing the renal tubular reabsorption of phosphorus. Furthermore, the parathyroid hormone plays an essential role in vitamin D metabolism, activating the vitamin D 1-alpha hydroxylase, which increases the renal synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D. Deficient PTH results in hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, while alkaline phosphatase, a marker of bone formation, is normal.
