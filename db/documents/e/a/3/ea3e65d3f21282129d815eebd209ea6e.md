Lab tests such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein should be checked. If these are elevated, there is a high likelihood that the patient has osteomyelitis. MRI is the gold standard for imaging osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis often does not show up on plain film radiographs. A bone biopsy should be obtained for culture-directed antibiotics to be ordered. an interprofessional team consisting of a surgeon, infectious disease specialist, and wound and hyperbaric medicine specialist is often needed to manage these patients effectively.
