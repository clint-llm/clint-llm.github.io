There are multiple etiologies for status epilepticus.

- Central nervous system (CNS) infections (meningitis, encephalitis, and intracranial abscess)

- Metabolic abnormalities (hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, and inborn errors of metabolism in children)

- Cerebrovascular accidents

- Head trauma (with or without intracranial bleed)

- Drug toxicity

- Drug withdrawal syndromes (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates)

- Hypoxia

- Hypertensive emergency

- Autoimmune disorders

Chronic processes that may result in status epilepticus include pre-existing epilepsy with breakthrough seizures or non-compliance with anti-epileptic drugs, ethanol withdrawal, CNS tumors, and remote CNS pathology (e.g., traumatic brain injury, stroke).

Acute processes account for most cases of status epilepticus in adults. Febrile status epilepticus is the most common cause in pediatric patients. CNS infections and inborn errors of metabolism are also common etiologies in children. The majority of pediatric patients with the first presentation of status epilepticus have no previous history of seizures.
