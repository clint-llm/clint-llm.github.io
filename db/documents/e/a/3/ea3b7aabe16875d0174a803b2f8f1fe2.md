Prevention of COVID-19 is feasible with appropriate day-to-day practices like social distancing, avoiding crowded areas, hand hygiene, proper mask etiquette, complete vaccination, and booster doses as appropriate.

Hand hygiene practices have been shown to reduce the spread of COVID-19 effectively.
