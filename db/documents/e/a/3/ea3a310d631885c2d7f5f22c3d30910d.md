Although monoclonal antibodies are generally well-tolerated, administration of monoclonal antibodies, in general, is associated with the risk of immune-mediated reactions that include anaphylaxis, serum sickness, and antibody generation. Besides these reactions, the adverse effects of monoclonal antibodies are also related to their specific targets. The adverse effects of antiviral monoclonal antibodies used in COVID-19 are unknown, mainly due to the limited availability of published literature. Safety data from clinical trials evaluating monoclonal antibodies reported are summarized below.

- The most frequently reported adverse effects with the use of combination therapy of bamlanivimab and etesevimab were nausea and diarrhea. Other adverse events such as infusion-related immediate hypersensitivity reactions manifesting as pruritus, flushing, rash, and facial swelling were also noted with the combination therapy of bamlanivimab and etesevimab.

- A low incidence of serious adverse events and infusion-related or hypersensitivity reactions were observed with CAS/IMDEV.

- The most frequently reported adverse effects with the use of sotrovimab include infusion-related hypersensitivity reactions, rash, andÂ diarrhea.
