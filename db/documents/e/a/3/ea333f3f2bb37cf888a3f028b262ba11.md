An interprofessional approach to neurosarcoidosis is recommended.

Cases of neurosarcoidosis require an interprofessional effort because the disorder has diverse presentations and has no specific test to make a diagnosis. Given the systemic involvement associated with neurosarcoidosis, a variety of specialists should be consulted such as rheumatology, endocrinology, and pulmonology. Neurosurgery may be consulted as well for resection of CNS masses. However, biopsy/excision procedures that involve the CNS can be associated with severe consequences, and remain a treatment of last choice. Thus, resection should be deferred, unless the mass continues to enlarge after immunosuppression. For cases with hydrocephalus, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be placed, albeit the risk of infection. Patients on prolonged steroids may benefit from a dietician consult to manage weight gain and to develop an exercise program and reduce bone loss. All patients started on corticosteroids need to be monitored for adverse effects by the pharmacist. As soon as symptoms subside, rapid tapering of the drug is recommended.
