The treatment of tibial neuropathy depends on the severity of symptoms and nerve damage. Physical therapy is a key component of treatment for all cases of tibial neuropathy. A physical therapy treatment plan may consist of strengthening the tibial nerve innervated muscles. Nerve gliding exercises, kinesiology taping, electrical stimulation, and therapeutic ultrasound are just a few of the modalities that can aid with tibial neuropathy.

Gait analysis can help identify contributing factors such as overpronation of the foot, which may place more tension on the tibial nerve. A medial heel insert can be placed in the shoe for cases of hyperpronation. Oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can help with pain and inflammation. Gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and amitriptyline are frequently used medications for neuropathic pain. An ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection into the tarsal tunnel or another area of compression can be beneficial for symptoms.

Surgical intervention is indicated for more severe or refractory cases, particularly when muscle atrophy or severe weakness is present, as this is indicative of axonal nerve damage. The precise surgical technique varies based on the location of tibial nerve entrapment. Generally, it involves the release of the flexor retinaculum and fascia into the foot to release the medial and lateral plantar nerves.
