A patient with persistent cervical pain may present with a variety of symptoms and complaints. Without direct knowledge of the existence of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT), these patients often turn to unnecessary and aggressive management options. While cervical strain-counterstrain (SCS) may be a popular technique utilized among several osteopathic physicians, it is rarely used elsewhere. Therefore, osteopaths should educate allopathic physicians and healthcare providers as a whole on the benefits of OMT, so they feel more inclined to refer patients to a specialist when necessary. Through the use of interprofessional communication, osteopathic clinicians can prevent unsatisfied outcomes and enhance the care of their patients.
