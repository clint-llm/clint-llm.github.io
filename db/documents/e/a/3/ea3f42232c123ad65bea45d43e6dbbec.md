The petrous part of the temporal bone and the occipital bone derives from paraxial mesoderm. Both develop via endochondral ossification. As aging and development occur, the bones ossify and form rigid fibrous joints called sutures. Importantly, the joining of these two bones helps create various foramina for vital structures, including the jugular foramen. In rare cases, a persistent primitive artery can cause an abnormal anastomosisÂ between the internal carotid artery and basilar artery.
