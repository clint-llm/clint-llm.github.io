Abdominal pain and uterine tenderness associated with fever are nonspecific signs. Women with fever, pain, and tenderness during labor must be evaluated for other common infections such as appendicitis, urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, and pneumonia. Additional ancillary testing and examination must be thoroughly reviewed before making a final diagnosis.
