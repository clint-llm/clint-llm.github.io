Apocrine hidrocystoma is a benign cystic lesion that typically occurs on the face. The diagnosis may be suspected from certain clinical characteristics, but the formal diagnosis is based on histological examination. Management of apocrine hidrocystoma mainly involves surgical excision; however, other treatments such as electrodesiccation, carbon dioxide laser vaporization, botulinum toxin A, and trichloroacetic acid can be tried in multiple lesions, as in the treatment of eccrine hidrocystomas.

Lesions grow gradually and do not tend to resolve after attaining full size. They rarely recur after surgical excision. Cysts may cause esthetic burden and psychological distress in patients; however, cysts are usually asymptomatic. No malignant transformation of apocrine hidrocystoma has been reported to date.
