Acute arthritis, particularly monoarthropathy, is a common acute presentation. In regards to the ankle, there is not always a clear etiology for the monoarthropathy by clinical examination alone. To enhance the clinical findings, ankle arthrocentesis can be employed. This activity illustrates the performance of ankle arthrocentesis and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients who undergo ankle arthrocentesis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures, indications, and contraindications of performing ankle arthrocentesis.
- Describe the equipment, personnel, preparation, and technique in regards to performing ankle arthrocentesis.
- Review the potential complications and clinical significance of performing ankle arthrocentesis.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the performance of ankle arthrocentesis and improve outcomes.
