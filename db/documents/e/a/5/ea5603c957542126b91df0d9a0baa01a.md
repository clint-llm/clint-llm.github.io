Ketoconazole is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease due to its association with hepatotoxicity, which can be fatal. It is contraindicated in adrenal insufficiency because high doses of ketoconazole inhibit adrenocortical function.

Ketoconazole is contraindicated in patients taking benzodiazepines because it can increase plasma concentrations and lead to sedation. Ketoconazole should never be administered to patients on antiarrhythmic drugs, cisapride, pimozide, quinidine, and ranolazine because it can cause QT prolongation and torsade de pointes.
