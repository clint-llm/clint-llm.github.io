**General**

Uroflowmetry assesses flow pattern, flow curve shape, maximum urinary flow (Qmax), voided volume (VV), voiding time (VT), PVR volume (PVR). A minimum of 150ml is required to provide an accurate assessment in men

The normal abdominal and vesical resting pressures are as follows

- Supine: 0 to 18 cm H2O

- Sitting: 15 to 40 cm H2O

- Standing: 20 to 50 cm H2O

The detrusor pressure (Pdet) is calculated by subtracting abdominal pressure (Pabd) from vesical pressure (Pves). Pdet = Pves - Pabd

Resting detrusor pressure: between -5 and +5 cm H2O

The detrusor pressure reached during maximum urinary flow (PdetQmax) is a crucial measurement in the assessment of bladder function during pressure-flow studies.

Bladder compliance (C) is the change of bladder volume (ΔV) divided by the change in detrusor pressure (ΔPdet) during filling cystometry. C = ΔV / ΔPdet.

- Non-neurogenic bladders 
- Normal compliance: >40 ml/cm H20
- Low compliance: <30 ml/cm H2O

- Neurogenic bladders 
- Normal compliance: >30 ml/cm H2O
- Low compliance: <10 ml/cm H2O

Straining can be seen in the form of temporary increases in vesical and abdominal pressure, lasting more than 2 seconds, usually in response to anatomical or function BOO.

**Female**

Bladder capacity: 300 to 500 ml.

Flow rate:

- 14 to 45 years: 18mL/s

- 46 to 65 years: 15mL/s

Abdominal leak point pressure (ALPP)

Valsalva leak point pressure (VLPP)

- <60 cm H2O: ISD

- 60 to 90 cm H2O: equivocal

- >90 cm H2O: urethral hypermobility

Maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP)

- <20 cm H2O: suggests ISD

Bladder outlet obstruction index for female (BOOIf): BOOIf = PdetQmax - 2.2 * Qmax

- <0: <10% probability of BOO

- >5: 50% probability of BOO

- >18: >90% probability of BOO

**Male**

Bladder capacity: 300 to 600 ml

Flow rate:

- 14 to 45 years: 21mL/s

- 46 to 65 years: 12mL/s

Qmax in men

- <10 ml/s: likely obstructed

- 10 to 15 ml/s: equivocal

- >15 ml/s: likely unobstructed

Bladder outlet obstruction index (BOOI) for male: BOOI = PdetQmax - 2 * Qmax

- <20: Unobstructed

- 20 to 40: Equivocal

- >40: Obstructed

Bladder contractility index (BCI): BCI = PdetQmax + 5 * Qmax

- >150: Strong

- 100 to 150: Normal

- <100: Weak

Bladder voiding efficiency (BVE): BE = VV / (VV+PVR) * 100%

- 100%: Normal

- <90%: indicative of DU

- >90%: indicative of BOO
