The initial evaluation requires a CT head to discern supratentorial and infratentorial abnormalities such as tumors with vasogenic edema causing mass effect, epidural, subdural, or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Central herniation results in complete obliteration of peri-mesencephalic and peri-medullary cisterns with or without small hemorrhages in the midline, paramedian and ventral regions in the tegmentum of the upper pons and midbrain. In some cases, the posterior cerebral artery may be kinked at the tentorial edge resulting in occipital infarction. Necessary laboratory investigations include serum sodium, arterial blood gases, and a basic metabolic profile.
