Performing EBUS and EBUS-TBNA requires an experienced multi-disciplinary team, and team experience is correlated with higher sample sensitivities and patient outcomes (CEBM evidence level 2a). ROSE of EBUS-TBNA samples by cytology staff is a beneficial addition to this team. It allows for fewer needle passes and real-time feedback on samples which improves sensitivity (CEBM evidence level 2a). Endoscopy nursing staff have a valuable role in EBUS and are an essential part of the multi-disciplinary team, enhancing the patient experience and post-procedural care.
