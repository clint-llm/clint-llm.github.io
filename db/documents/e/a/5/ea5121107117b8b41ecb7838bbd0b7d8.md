The biliary ducts originate embryologically from the foregut. Early in the fourth week of development, the hepatic diverticulum arises from the endodermal epithelium of the ventral foregut. The hepatic diverticulum serves as the anlage for the liver, extrahepatic ducts, gallbladder, and ventral pancreas. The hepatic diverticulum is divided into two buds, the cranial bud, and the caudal bud. The intrahepatic bile ducts develop from the cranial bud, whereas the extrahepatic biliary tree develops from the caudal bud. Notably, the hepatic diverticulum must recanalize to form the ducts. Hepatoblasts differentiate into the cholangiocytes that line the intrahepatic bile ducts.
