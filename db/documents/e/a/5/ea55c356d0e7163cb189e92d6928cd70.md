The contraindications to working in the field of compressed air are similar to those of a commercial diver.  The diving industry follows the medical health requirements of the Association of Diving Contractors International (ADCI) and the medical evaluations as structured by the Diving Medical Advisory Committee (DMAC). Diver and CAW health examinations should be performed by physicians that have experience in diving medicine and compressed air work, are certified, or board certified in Undersea & Hyperbaric Medicine and preferably have completed a course recognized by the Dive Medical Advisory Committee (DMAC) with the title Medical Examiner of Divers.
