Dietary guidelines

- Total fat should make up less than 30% of energy intake

- Saturate fats should make up less than 7% of total calories

- Carbohydrates should make up 60% of the total calories

Exercise may not lower LCL-C but aerobic exercise may improve insulin sensitivity, lower triglyceride levels and increase HDL.
