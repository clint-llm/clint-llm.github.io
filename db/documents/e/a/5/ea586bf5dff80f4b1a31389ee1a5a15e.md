Ataxia is the absence of voluntary muscle coordination and loss control of movement that affects gait stability, eye movement, and speech. Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a progressive neurodegenerative inherited (autosomal dominant) heterogeneous disease that mainly affects the cerebellum. SCA is a subset of hereditary cerebellar ataxia and is a rare disease. This activity will review the presentation, evaluation, and treatment of this condition by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of spinocerebellar ataxia medical conditions and emergencies.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of spinocerebellar ataxia.
- Outline the management options available for spinocerebellar ataxia.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the care of spinocerebellar ataxia and improve outcomes.
