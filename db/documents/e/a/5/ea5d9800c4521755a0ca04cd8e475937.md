Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is a disorder with systemic manifestations that primarily affect heart, skeletal muscle, eyes, skin, bone, and liver. Failure to diagnose Graves' disease in a timely manner can predispose thyroid storm which carries high morbidity and mortality. Clinicians ought to be aware of systemic manifestations of Graves' disease and the different modalities available for treatment. Early diagnosis and management of Graves' disease can also prevent severe cardiac complications such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and high output cardiac failure. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of Graves' disease and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in reducing morbidity and improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of Graves' disease.
- Describe the proper evaluation of Graves' disease.
- Summarize the treatment options for Graves' disease.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination to improve outcomes for patients with Graves' disease.
