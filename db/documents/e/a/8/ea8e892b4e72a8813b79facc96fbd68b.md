The initial treatment of thoracic discogenic syndrome is usually conservative (nonoperational) since some disc herniations have been reported to stabilize/regress with time, especially in younger patients. Conservative management includes rest, anti-inflammatory drugs, and physical therapy

Surgical intervention is considered as a last resort for the treatment of symptomatic thoracic disc herniations with patients unresponsive to conservative treatment. Surgery will allow for the removal of the ossified disc decompressing the region and relieving pressure on the nerve or spinal cord. Despite advances in thoracic disc herniation surgery, there are still about 20% to 30% complications associated with it
