Immediately after birth, the umbilicus becomes colonized with many different types of bacteria. Gram-positive cocci are present within hours, followed shortly by the presence of many enteric microorganisms. The devitalized tissues of the umbilical stump promote the rapid growth of these bacteria, and the thrombosed blood vessels allow entry into the bloodstream, potentially leading to systemic infection.
