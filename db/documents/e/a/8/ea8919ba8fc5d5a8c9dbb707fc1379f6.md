Imaging should be performed to both diagnose the thyroglossal duct cyst and evaluate for the presence of healthy thyroid tissue. If normal thyroid tissue in the inferior neck is absent, the patient and/or parents should receive counseling on the possibility of lifelong thyroid replacement therapy after surgery.

Ultrasound is the ideal initial imaging choice. Ultrasound is readily available, inexpensive, and noninvasive. It does not require ionizing radiation or sedation, which is important in treating children. CT scans and MRI can be used to evaluate thyroglossal duct cysts and the presence of normal thyroid tissue, but ultrasound alone in usually sufficient.

Some surgeons advocate for routine thyroid function testing preoperatively. This may be helpful if ectopic thyroid tissue is expected, but the literature does not support routine lab work for uncomplicated thyroglossal duct cysts.
