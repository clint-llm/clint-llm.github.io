An abnormally elevated PSA in a grey zone (4-10 ng/mL) warrants a repeat PSA and a DRE. Patients whose repeat PSA and DRE are normal may keep in routine follow-ups. However, if the repeat PSA is elevated and a prostate malignancy is suspected, biomarkers aid in the decision regarding continuing observation vs. proceeding to a biopsy. Various biomarkers like PHI,4K score, PCA3, ExoDx Intelliscore, and Select MDx help make this decision.

Biomarkers may be used alone or as a variable in risk analysis calculators. For example, if a biopsy was already performed with a negative result, biomarkers can assist in deciding when or if to repeat the biopsy.

According to the NCCN recommendations, if the initial biopsy is reported as atypia, suspicious for cancer, or High-Grade Prostatic Intraepithelial Neoplasia (high-grade PIN), biomarkers that improve the specificity of screening - including free PSA, 4K score, PHI, PCA3, Exo Dx Prostate score, and My prostate score 2, may be considered. Alternatively, this subset of patients may proceed with a mpMRI if no prior prostatic MRI is available.

Most urinary biomarker assays are performed after prostatic manipulation. However, a DRE is not recommended for the ExoDxEPI score. Studies have shown that DRE can enrich urinary biomarkers and enhance yield—the first void after DRE is obtained and analyzed. Following the prostate massage, the first 10 to 50 mL of urine that is voided are centrifuged at 1,000 to 2,000 rotations per minute to produce precipitates of urine that may contain prostate cancer cells and prostate cancer cell fragments, as well as DNA, RNA, and proteins produced from these cells. Free proteins, DNA, RNA, other tiny molecules, and exosomes can all be detected in the supernatants.

Exosome precipitation occurs as a result of further ultracentrifugation of the supernatant. The ExoDx Intelliscore is far more patient-friendly than other biomarkers, as it does not require a digital rectal exam or prostatic massage. Unlike other urine-based tests for prostate cancer, it is available as a kit for home usage that patients can mail directly back to the diagnostic laboratory.
