Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease is an X-linked recessive disease that occurs due to a mutation at the level of the PLP1 gene that is located on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq22). Mutations can be of various types, including duplication, missense, and deletion, the details of which and clinical effects will be described in the pathophysiology section. The mutations, in general, lead to decreased or absent myelin production.
