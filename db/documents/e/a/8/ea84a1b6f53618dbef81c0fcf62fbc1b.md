Myopia has emerged as a new public health issue. Preventing, managing, and halting the progression of myopia has always been a matter of concern. In recent times pharmaceutical management of myopia has been widely studied. ATOM-1 was a large randomized controlled trial (RCT) performed to evaluate the role of atropine 1% in preventing the progression of childhood myopia.

Four hundred children aged 6 to 12 years with 1 to 6 D myopia were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either atropine or a placebo. After two years, myopia in atropine-treated eyes regressed by 0.3 Diopter (D) ±0.50 D. Conversely, progression was noted in the placebo group -0.76 D +/- 0.44 D.

Though the study provided strong evidence of atropine being a practical option for preventing myopia progression, numerous side effects like blurring of near vision, photophobia, glare, and systemic side effects were noted to occur with 1% atropine. This further led to the investigation of the efficacy of low-dose atropine 0.5%, 0.1%, and 0.01% in controlling myopia progression (ATOM-2).

Atropine 0.01% was found to be a safe and effective option, as it caused minimal pupillary dilation and minimally affected accommodation with similar efficacy. However, in a recent study on a low concentration of atropine for myopia progression, the effectiveness of 0.05% atropine was found to be double that of atropine 0.01% over two years.

Cooper vision Mi sight daily use soft lenses have been recently approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are designed to reduce myopia progression by decreasing peripheral retinal hyperopic defocus.

Optometrists are essential in managing these cases through early detection and regular follow-ups. Patients with signs of progressive myopia should be educated about modern treatment options to control the further progression of refractive errors. Counselors are vital in educating parents or caretakers about lifestyle modifications to help prevent myopia progression.

All these various professionals need to function as an interprofessional team to optimize patient care when managing childhood myopia and monitoring ocular development.
