An individual with Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome classically presents with (1) ocular disturbances which may include diplopia, painless vision loss, or strabismus, (2) gait abnormalities that include a wide-based, short-stepped gait and an inability to stand or ambulate without assistance, and (3) mental status changes that include apathy, a paucity of speech, and indifference to the environment. However, patients commonly do not present with this full triad. As the disorder progresses, other symptoms that may develop include agitation, anger, hallucinations, and confabulations.
