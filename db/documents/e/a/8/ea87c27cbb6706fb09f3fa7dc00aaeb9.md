Spinal shock is a result of severe spinal cord injury. Spinal shock refers to the muscle weakness and reflex loss seen after spinal cord injury. This "shock" can make the spinal cord appear completely functionless. Loss of reflexes below the lesion, loss of muscle use below the injury, loss of anal sphincter tone, loss of bowel and bladder control, as well as persistent penile erection (priapism) can be seen in spinal shock. Spinal cord injury can be associated with spinal fractures, dislocations, tearing of ligaments, rotational distraction, and tearing of the disc space. If the spinal shock is not associated with significant spinal column injury, the prognosis is more favorable. The overall treatment of patients with significant spinal shock and injury presents a challenge. AggressiveÂ medical management and nursing care can reduce spinal shock effects on the overall functionality of the patient. This chapter review is designed to provide a concise introduction to the care of these patients.
