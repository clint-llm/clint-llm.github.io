Although the standard of care for mitral valve (MV) pathology due to degenerative changes is surgical repair, patient outcomes depend on multiple factors including pre-operative status, the severity of mitral regurgitation (MR), the technique of repair and surgeon and center experience. If MV repair is carried out in a timely fashion, the operative risk is low, and life expectancy is close to that of similar sex-aged matched controls. In high-risk patients, the choice amongst surgical, percutaneous, and conservative approaches can be challenging but should have as its basis patient comorbidities and surgical expertise. Mitral valve repair (MVr) surgery has some advantages over mitral valve replacement (MVR), although patient-specific factors must be taken into consideration. Of note, close to 50% of patients with severe mitral valve pathology are not candidates for surgical intervention due to age or other comorbidities.

Up to 2 to 3% of adults in the United States are afflicted with degenerative mitral valve disease.
