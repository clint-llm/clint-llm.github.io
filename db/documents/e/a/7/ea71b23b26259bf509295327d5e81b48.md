This procedure is rapidly evolving as technology changes. Due to the radiologic equipment, the procedure routinely uses radiologists and radiologic personnel during the infusion of the cells. Transplant surgeons historically drove islet cell therapy, but now interventional radiologists are positioned in an important role for both clinical performance and research. Interventional radiologists and their team can share some of the roles and responsibilities of transplant surgeons and their technologists. Personnel typically required to perform the procedure may include, but are not limited to:

- Transplant surgeon

- Surgical technologist

- Radiologist

- anesthesiologist/C.R.N.A

- Nurse
