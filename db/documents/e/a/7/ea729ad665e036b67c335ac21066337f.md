Grossly a colloid cyst is a unilocular round structure filled with a viscous material. Microscopically the cell wall is unicellular and typically composed of columnar epithelium, which may or may not be ciliated. The cyst contents are typically void of living cells and composed of desquamated ghost cells and filamentous material. The mucin stains are positive for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS). The epithelial cyst wall stains positive for keratin and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA).
