Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are predominantly found in the pleura of the lower lobes likely due to increased pulmonary blood flow. Bosher and colleagues reviewed the pathologic anatomy in 350 patients with PAVMs and found that 75% had unilateral disease, whereas 36% had bilateral disease.

PAVM consists of thin-walled vascular channels that are built by elastic fibers and remnants of smooth muscle cells. The intima can be thickened and partly covered by mural thrombi.

Although the etiology of PAVM is unknown, recent discoveries in genetic mutations of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasias have shown relevance in the potential causes. Mutations in the endoglin (ENG) gene, activin receptor-like-kinase-1 (ACVRLI/ALK1) gene, and SMAD4 gene have all been associated with inheritance of HHT. These proteins are components involved in transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathways. Vascular abnormalities seen in PAVM are thought to arise from mutations in these proteins and the resultant imbalances in response to angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth factor and defective vascular repair.

There have been numerous proposed theories on the pathogenesis of these lesions. Anabtawi and colleagues hypothesized that lesions were the result of incomplete resorption of the vascular septae that separate arterial and venous plexuses during fetal development.
