Due to the portable nature of POCT, the reagents, tests, and samples are often exposed to conditions that may differ from those in a traditional laboratory setting. Humidity, temperature, time to testing, and oxygen content can fluctuate more in the POCT setting than in the conventional laboratory environment. Most interfering factors with POCT occur before the test is run (pre-analytical phase).

Errors in the pre-analytical phase can occur during patient identification and in the specimen's identification, collection, handling, processing, transport, and storage. These errors may include hemolysis, clotting, underfilling or overfilling a specimen container, improperly securing specimen containers before transport, prolonged tourniquet time, and changes in the sample concentration (eg, during aliquoting).

Notably, the detection of hemolysis in POCT using whole blood samples (including fingerstick tests) is challenging.

Other interfering factors may be directly related to the patient's physical state. For instance, elevated biotin intake (eg, from vitamin supplementation) can interfere with certain immunoassays, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) POCT.

Hemolysis, icterus, and lipemia may result in inaccurate or incalculable results. Potassium measurements are susceptible to this error. Testing in conventional laboratories often includes a step to determine the serum index in addition to testing for a specific analyte.

Collectively, these indices are often referred to as hemoglobin (H), lipemia (L), and icterus (I), or HIL, indices.

Ways to resolve these errors vary based on the devices used and MIFU; in some cases, dilution can resolve sample errors related to excess bilirubin, and ultracentrifugation can help fix errors related to excess lipids. Patients with reduced or compromised peripheral circulation, as seen in patients with sepsis, shock, or diabetic ketoacidosis, may have inadequate capillary blood samples.
