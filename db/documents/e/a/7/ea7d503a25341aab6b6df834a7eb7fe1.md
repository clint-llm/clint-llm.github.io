The following are the FDA and non-FDA indications for sotalol:

- Premature ventricular contractions-sotalol has been superior to placebo for suppressing premature ventricular contractions.

- Hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia.

- Pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation-less effective.

- Maintaining sinus rhythm- especially in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

- Postoperative atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.

- Supraventricular tachycardia- especially when administered intravenously.

- Transplacental isolated sotalol or in conjunction with digoxin to treat fetal SVT and atrial fibrillation with 85% complete or partial resolution.

There is no difference between sotalol and amiodarone when it comes to the pharmacological conversion of atrial fibrillation.
