Initial physical assessment of a collapsed athlete will include ABCDE screening (airway, breathing, circulation, disability, and exposure). If ABCs are verified, a brief history may be conducted to evaluate for altered mental status. Vital signs, including a core rectal temperature, are essential for differentiating underlying etiologies, especially hyperthermia.
