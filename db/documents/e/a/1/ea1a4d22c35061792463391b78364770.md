Diverticular disease is classified based on whether it is uncomplicated diverticulosis or it has been complicated by diverticulitis. A summary is given below;

- Type 0: Asymptomatic diverticulosis

- Type I: Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis

- Type II: Acute complicated diverticulitis

- Type III: Chronic diverticular disease

Complicated diverticular disease is further classified using the Hinchey classification system, which is largely based on CT findings.

- Stage 1: Phlegmon (1a) or diverticulitis with pericolic or mesenteric abscess (1b)

- Stage 2: Diverticulitis with walled-off pelvic abscess

- Stage 3: Diverticulitis with generalized purulent peritonitis

- Stage 4: Diverticulitis with generalized fecal peritonitis
