**Thermoregulatory Impairment**

**Hypothermia
**

- Hypothermia, defined as a drop in core body temperature below 35 C (95 F), results in initial/mild impairment in the body's thermoregulatory capacity. More significant impairment occurs with increasing severity of hypothermia; severe hypothermia is defined as core body temperature dropping below 28 C (82.4 F)

- Core body temperature below 29.4 C (85 F) impairs the ability of the hypothalamus to regulate body temperature is lost

- Part of the reason for this diminished regulation is that the rate of chemical heat production in each cell is depressed almost 2-fold for each 10 F decrease in body temperature.

- Extreme symptoms indicative of severe hypothermia include mental status changes, slurred speech, unconsciousness, ventricular arrhythmias, and gross motor skill impairment. The end-stage presentation includes central nervous system (CNS) depression (coma), which ultimately suppresses all thermoregulatory function of the body (including the ability to "shiver").

**Heat Illness Spectrum
**

- Excessive core body temperature presents along with a clinical spectrum, with heat stroke presenting as an emergent clinical condition defined by a core body temperature exceeding 40 C (104 F)

- Other conditions along the heat illness spectrum include:

- Heat edema
- Heat syncope
- Heat-associated cramping
- Heat exhaustion
