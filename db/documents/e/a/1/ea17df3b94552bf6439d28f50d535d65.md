In-utero, diagnosis of fetal chromosomal aneuploidy can be made by performing cytogenetic analysis of fetal cells, typically obtained through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. The fetal chromosomal complement is analyzed by performing a karyotype test, counting the chromosomes, and analyzing under light microscopy, all while looking for abnormalities in chromosomal number or structure. Many prenatal screening tests exist to help provide an age-adjusted risk of fetal chromosomal aneuploidy through analysis of various markers or cell-free fetal DNA in maternal serum.

With in vitro fertilization (IVF), testing can also be performed prior to implantation through preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), polar body diagnosis (PBD), or blastomere biopsy. PGD is a technique used to identify normal embryos that will be implanted into the mother, though technologically demanding and with additional expense compared to prenatal diagnosis. PBD can detect maternally derived aneuploidies and is relatively quick to perform when compared to PGD. Lastly, a blastomere biopsy can be obtained prior to implantation for genetic analysis. However, blastomere biopsy places the developing embryo at greater risk and therefore is not currently a recommended standard of practice.
