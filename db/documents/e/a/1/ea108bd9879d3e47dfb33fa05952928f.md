The olfactory system is the most primitive of the human special senses and is very closely connected to the limbic system, the seat of emotion.

The olfactory epithelium is located at the apex of the nasal cavity, along both the upper septum and the superior turbinate, as well as the roof of the nose. Olfaction has many roles, including recognition of danger and identification of edible food, and is responsible for a significant proportion of the human sense of taste; taste buds on the tongue can only differentiate among sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami (savory) flavors, but the human sense of smell can differentiate as many as 1 trillion odorants.

Compared to other sensory systems, the olfactory system, including the olfactory epithelium and parts of the olfactory bulb, is unique in that it can adapt and regenerate.
