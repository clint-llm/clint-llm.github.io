The superior petrosal sinus is especially clinically relevant when involved in conditions such as carotid-cavernous fistulas and dural arteriovenous fistula malformations (AVFMs). AVFMs are abnormal connections between meningeal arteries and dural sinuses. Arteriovenous fistula malformations can classify into three categories: Type I, II, and III. To clarify, this classification system differs from the method used to classify the drainage pattern of the superior petrosal venous complex into the superior petrosal sinus. Type I AVFMs drain directly into meningeal veins or dural venous sinuses. Type II AVFMs are Type I AVFMs, but additionally, this type has retrograde drainage into subarachnoid veins due to high pressure. In contrast, Type III AVFMs do not have meningeal or dural venous sinus drainage and drain solely into subarachnoid granulations.

Arteriovenous fistula malformations involving the superior petrosal sinus are definitively treatable with either surgery or endovascular therapy.

Another therapy for superior petrosal sinus AVFM is gamma knife radiosurgery. However, gamma knife-induced closure of the fistula requires up to three years. As a result, gamma knife radiosurgery is not a viable therapy in high-grade AVFMs but may be an option in low-grade AVFMs. Unfortunately, superior petrosal sinus AVFMs are typically high-grade.
