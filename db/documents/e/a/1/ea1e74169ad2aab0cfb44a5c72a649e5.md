The diagnostic laboratory team is essential for evaluating cases of macrocytosis. Hematology staff plays an important role in theÂ processing and analysis of peripheral blood smears. The successful management of macrocytic anemia may require an interprofessional team effort involving primary care, gastroenterology, surgery, endocrinology, rheumatology, nephrology, hematology, and/or oncology. Specialists in nutrition, speech pathology, and addiction or social services may be important in managing vulnerable patient populations susceptible to malnutrition and excessive alcohol consumption.
