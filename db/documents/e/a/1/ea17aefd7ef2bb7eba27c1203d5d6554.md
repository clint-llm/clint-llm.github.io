If used, HBO treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after the injury. Three treatments in the first 24 hours is suggested, and twice daily after that. Sessions are 90 minutes in length at 2.0 ATA to 2.4 ATA and should be continued for 20 to 30 sessions, although the number of treatments depends on the clinical extent of the injury and response to treatment. Patients are monitored in the chamber with blood pressure (BP) cuffs approved to use in monoplace chambers. Ventilator support may be given in the chamber, which is common in patients with who sustained an inhalation injury. Fluid management is crucial in burn patients and needs to be initiated before HBO therapyÂ is started. Several liters of fluid may be needed in the acute phase of the injury, and pumps may be needed to overcome the chamber pressure during HBO treatments.
