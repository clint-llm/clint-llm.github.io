The blood supply of the hand takes the form of the superficial and deep palmar arches, which is an anastomotic landmark formed from the ulnar and radial artery rami at the level of the wrist. These arches give off palmar digital arteries that feed the hand's individual digits, nerves, and muscles. The ulnar aspect of the arch follows with the course of the superficial ulnar nerve, discussed below, separate from it at the level of the bifurcation of this nerve. Branches of the median nerve follow the path of their respective palmar arteries.
