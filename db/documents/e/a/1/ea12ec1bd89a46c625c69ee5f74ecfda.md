In the emergency department, nasal packing for anterior epistaxis is contraindicatedÂ in the setting of basilar skull fractures and significant facial or nasal bone fractures. Hemodynamic instability requiring emergency blood transfusion and airway compromise requiring intubation are relative contraindications. However, once stabilized, anterior nasal packing is permissible in patients with anterior epistaxis.
