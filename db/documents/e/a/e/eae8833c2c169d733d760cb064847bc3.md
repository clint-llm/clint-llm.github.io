The eradication of lymphatic filariasis can lower the incidence rate of tropical pulmonary eosinophilia. The WHO recommends an elimination strategy for lymphatic filariasis by interrupting the transmission cycle. This strategy includes the administration of ivermectin with DEC or albendazole annually to the people of endemic regions. Since adult worms remain viable for years, the drug should be given for 4 to 6 years. The mosquito control strategy is also used to eliminate the vector causing lymphatic filariasis.

It is crucial to diagnose and treat TPE in the early stage. Chronic TPE can result in pulmonary fibrosis and, subsequently, chronic respiratory failure even after the treatment with DEC. Patients with early diagnosis respond dramatically to DEC.
