Endotracheal intubation is an essential skill performed by multiple medical specialists to secure a patient’s airway as well as provide oxygenation and ventilation. There are multiple techniques available, including the visualization of the vocal cords with a laryngoscope or video laryngoscope, direct placement of the endotracheal tube into the trachea via cricothyrotomy, and fiberoptic visualization of the vocal cords via the nasal or oral route. This section will focus on intubations in the emergency department using direct and video laryngoscopy.
