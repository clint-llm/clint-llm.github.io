Erythema and edematous papules occur within a few minutes after exposure to sunlight, on sun-exposed areas, and even on areas covered with thin and white clothing that allows the solar radiation to reach the underlying skin. Usually, covered skin reacts more severely to the sun when it is exposed. The face and hand skin seem more tolerant to sun radiation. The rash is associated with a sensation of itching or burning. Periorbital and/or mucosal angioedema may also be observed. Dermographism may be noticed in some patients. Systemic symptoms such as nausea, wheezing, dyspnea, or syncope are not uncommon, especially if large areas of the skin are exposed to sunlight during a long period. However, even if systemic symptoms are present, anaphylactic shock rarely occurs in solar urticaria. The cutaneous symptoms resolve in 75% of cases within an hour following the interruption of sun exposure and more within 24 hours. The severity and the duration of the symptoms are also related to the intensity of light.
