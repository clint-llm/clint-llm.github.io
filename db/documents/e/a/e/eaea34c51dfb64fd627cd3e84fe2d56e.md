**Further Evaluation**

When systolic hypertension is suspected based on reliable measurements, perform a further evaluation to determine the following.

- Presence or absence of cardiovascular risk factors

- The extent of the end-organ damage

- Identifiable causes of hypertension

- Concomitant clinical conditions affecting prognosis and treatment

**Routine Laboratory and Clinical Investigation**

These tests should be performed to evaluate cardiovascular risk and concomitant diseases.

- 12-lead electrocardiographic (left ventricular hypertrophy features, atrial dilation, and arrhythmias)

- Lipid panels (calculate 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk)

- Serum creatinine (with an estimation of GFR)

- Serum electrolytes (sodium and potassium)

- Thyroid-stimulating hormone

- Urine analysis (proteinuria)

- Urine microalbuminuria

**Additional Tests**

Perform the following tests based on the relevant history, physical examination, and routine laboratory findings.

- Hemoglobin A1c

- Serum uric acid

- Ankle-brachial index

- Renal ultrasound and renal Doppler ultrasonography

- Quantitative proteinuria (urine protein to creatinine ratio, 24-hour urine protein)

- Echocardiogram (patient with heart failure)

- Specific tests to search for secondary causes of hypertension (plasma free metanephrines, 24-hour urinary cortisol, aldosterone-renin ratio)
