Clinical presentation can classify into four major categories.

- Constrictive rings

- Limb defects

- Neural or spine defects

- Craniofacial defects

Constriction rings and limb or digital amputation are the most common findings, present in at least 80 percent of cases. The amniotic bands may be present, confined to the skin or soft tissue, and may extend deep into the tissue. If constriction results in amputation in-utero, then the amputated part is usually resorbed and not visible following birth.

Limb defects include constriction ring of an extremity with swelling of distal part, absence of distal portions of one or more fingers and toes, especially the central digits, contractures, or fracture. Lower extremities are affected more commonly than upper, and the thumb is usually spared due to the protection of the palm in-utero.

While atypical, craniofacial abnormalities, such as encephalocele, facial clefts, and cleft lip/cleft palate may be present. Spinal defects and scoliosis have also been known to occur with ABS.
