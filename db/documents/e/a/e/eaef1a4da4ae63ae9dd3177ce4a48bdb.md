Plain radiographs are the standard of care to diagnose Boxer’s fractures and determine a degree of angulation. Anteroposterior, lateral, and oblique views should be obtained. The lateral view should be used to measure the degree of angulation of the shaft of the metacarpal as compared to the mid-point of the fracture fragment.

Recent literature suggests that bedside ultrasound may also be used to make an initial diagnosis of a Boxer’s fracture

CT is generally not used for the diagnosis of metacarpal fractures; however occult fractures may be detected via CT in patients for whom there is a high degree of clinical suspicion for fracture and negative plain radiographs
