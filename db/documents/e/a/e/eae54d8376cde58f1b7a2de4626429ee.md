The main areas of concern regarding the adverse side effects of cyclophosphamide are associated with bladder and gonadal toxicity. Common adverse side effects reported in several studies and clinical trials involving the use of cyclophosphamide include hemorrhagic cystitis, amenorrhea, myelosuppression, alopecia, and spells of nausea and vomiting.

Cyclophosphamide can cause myelosuppression leading to the development of sepsis and septic shock. Antibiotic therapy and additional surveillance may be warranted at the discretion of the treatment team.There are also reports of cardiotoxicity, pulmonary toxicity, veno-occlusive liver disease, and secondary malignancies in some cases of cyclophosphamide use. Myocarditis, pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure are possible risks. Higher dosages of cyclophosphamide are associated with a greater incidence of these side effects and increased mortality.

The alkylating effects of cyclophosphamide may also affect the processes of oogenesis and spermatogenesis, leading to sterility in both sexes. The risk of sterility of time and dose-dependent and is irreversible in some patients. Sterility may manifest as amenorrhea in women and testicular atrophy in men. Patients should receive adequate education on the risks of infertility before initiation of cyclophosphamide therapy.
