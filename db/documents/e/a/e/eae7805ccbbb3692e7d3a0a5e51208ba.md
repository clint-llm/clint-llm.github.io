The beginning stages of nail growth becomes evident around eight weeks of gestational age. The nail primordium beginsÂ as a transverse ridge on the distal dorsal surface of the digit. As the week progress, the ridge extends proximally and becomes invaginated beneath the developing proximal nail fold. The outline is evident by 16 weeks gestational age. The matrix is a band of the highly proliferative epithelium in which production of the proximal nail plate occurs. There is less proliferation activity distally to create a convex curve of the plate. By month 5, the nail plate has completely covered the nail bed.
