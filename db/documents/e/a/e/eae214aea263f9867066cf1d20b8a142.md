Excessive doses of ACE inhibitors are usually well-tolerated, but they can cause hypotension, drop-in GFR, and electrolyte derangements. In addition, sinceÂ ACE inhibitors block aldosterone, they can cause hyperkalemia and hyponatremia.

If the patient presents within 1 hour of ingestion and is awake and able to protect their airway, activated charcoal can be given. If they remain asymptomatic for 6 hours of observation, they can be considered medically stable for either discharge or referral to psychiatry.

For those with hypotension, fluids should be the first line of therapy. There is no antidote for ACE inhibitor poisoning. Naloxone has been used in captopril overdoses in the past with some success and can be a choice if intravenous fluids are not successful. Also, vasopressors are an option for the treatment of hypotension.
