The history of occupation is crucial for both diagnosis and management. History of exposure to asbestosis helps to exclude other chronic interstitial lung diseases. Usually, there is a history of 10 to 20 years of exposure to asbestos and progressively worsening dyspnea. Cough with sputum and wheezing are unusual, though, if present, are mainly associated with smoking. The patient may complain of chest discomfort due to heart failure following pulmonary hypertension. The severity of the disease depends on the duration and intensity of exposure and whether the patient has direct occupational contact with asbestos. History of smoking and dyspnea on exertion are important, and nonproductive cough is quite common. History of loss of appetite and weight, hemoptysis indicates the suspicion of lung tumors. Gradual onset of localized pain or breathlessness and then radiating to the shoulder may be evident in pleural involvement.

Physical examination reveals clubbing in 32% to 42%, asbestos warts, reduced chest expansion due to restrictive lung disease (38%). Bibasilar rales are best auscultated at lower lateral and basal areas.
