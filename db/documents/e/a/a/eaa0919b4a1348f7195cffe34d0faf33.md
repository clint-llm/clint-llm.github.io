Prognosis depends on etiology. While some transient common peroneal nerve neuropathies often improve or resolve over time with nonsurgical measures, common peroneal nerve palsy following traumatic knee dislocations results in inferior outcomes with a poor prognosis long-term recovery of nerve function.

Prognosis has been described extensively in patients who experience common peroneal nerve injury following total knee arthroplasty. In one particular study, 62% of patients had a maximal neurologic recovery, and 38% had complete recovery at 12 months.
