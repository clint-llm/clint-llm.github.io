Propofol is an intravenous anesthetic used for procedural sedation, during monitored anesthesia care, or as an induction agent for general anesthesia. It may be administered as a bolus or an infusion, or some combination of the two. Propofol is prepared in a lipid emulsion which gives it the characteristic milky white appearance. Strict aseptic technique must be used when drawing up propofol as the emulsion can support microbial growth. It has both approved and off-label uses. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, important adverse effects, contraindications, monitoring, and toxicity of propofol, so providers can direct patient anesthesia where it is indicated, as part of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of propofol.
- Summarize the approved and off-label indications for using propofol.
- Review the appropriate monitoring and toxicity of propofol.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance propofol where it is indicated and improve patient outcomes.
