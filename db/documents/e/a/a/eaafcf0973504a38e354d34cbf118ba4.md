The extent of the ablative surgery will dictate the choices available for reconstruction to some extent.

The contralateral breast and the abdomen must be examined before determining the reconstructive approach.

The volume, fall, and projection of the contralateral breast are of utmost importance when planning reconstruction, as recreating a symmetric breast is the overall goal. Breast reconstruction can be combined with contralateral mammoplasty to balance the symmetry between the reconstructed and native breasts.

If autologous tissue reconstruction is planned, a careful abdominal examination is required. Prior open abdominal surgery may have resulted in incisions that disrupt the blood supply to one or more potential reconstructive flaps. In addition, the abdomen must be assessed for any incisional, umbilical, or ventral hernias. These are all relative contraindications to abdominal-based flap reconstruction. The degree of subcutaneous adiposity should be noted, as a moderate degree is desirable for many reconstructive flaps. If insufficient subcutaneous adiposity exists,Â adequate volume may not be achievable in the reconstruction. Contrarily, the survival rate of flaps constructed from a morbidly obese abdomen is diminished. In both instances, non-abdominally based reconstructive flaps, such as latissimus dorsi flaps, or implant-based reconstruction may be offered.
