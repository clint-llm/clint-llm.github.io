Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (SOVA) is an abnormal dilatation of the aortic root located between the aortic valve annulus and the sinotubular junction. This occurs as a consequence of the weakness of the elastic lamina at the junction of the aortic media and the annulus fibrosis. The function of the normal sinuses is to prevent occlusion of the coronary artery ostia during systole when the aortic valve opens. The normal sinus diameter is less than 4.0 cm for men and 3.6 cm for women. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm can be either congenital or acquired. They are usually isolated, rare case reports describe aneurysm of two to three sinuses. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm rupture is a potentially fatal complication of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm and should prompt urgent referral to a cardiothoracic surgeon for consideration of repair.
