The body of the sternum is usually longer and thicker in males and shorter and thinner in females. This can be used to assist in the determination of biological sex in skeletal remains.

Bifid ribs occur when the anterior portion of a rib splits into 2 before reaching the sternum. The corresponding musculature, blood vessels, and nerves also bifurcate. Bifid ribs are usually unilateral and asymptomatic.
