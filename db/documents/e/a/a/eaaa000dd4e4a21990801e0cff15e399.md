A thorough patient history and physical exam are important in the diagnosis and evaluation of any disease, and for filoviruses, special care must be taken with regards to travel history, exposure history, and sick contacts. Obtaining the type, duration, and onset of symptoms is necessary. Generalized symptoms include prodromal fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, and unexplained hemorrhage.  Symptoms generally appear 2 to 21 days after contact (average 8 to 10 days) and are commonly mistaken for flu or malaria. Hemorrhagic symptoms can vary and occur in approximately 30 to 50% of patients and often include mucosal bleeding, particularly involving the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts.
