The incidence of tonsillar herniation is not documented, as it is a physiological response to a variety of underlying pathological processes. The most common cause is traumatic brain injury (TBI), but other causes include intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The incidence of TBI worldwide is estimated to be 69 million individuals each year.
