Syrinx cavities may take a variety of forms. Some persons may have a single cavity but others may have a second cavity as well. Syrinx cavities may be multiloculated with tissue septations seen on imaging and pathologic specimens. Syrinx cavities are not composed of pure CSF but contain varying amounts of cellular elements and debris. Chronic syrinx cavities may show surrounding gliosis. Syrinx cavities have traditionally been believed to dissect under pressure through intramedullary tissue.
