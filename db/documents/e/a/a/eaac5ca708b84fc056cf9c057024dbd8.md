Reactions to bedbug bites are self-limited; once the patient is removed from the infested environment or the colony of bedbugs is exterminated, the biting stops. When patients have an intolerable pruritic reaction to the bites, symptomatic treatment is warranted. Over-the-counter systemic antihistamines and topical antipruritic creams are often effective. If the eruptions are significant enough, mild-to-moderate corticosteroid creams may be required. Antihistamines and topical therapy are used to provide symptomatic relief and reduce the risk of bacterial superinfection or cellulitis from repeated scratching.
