Appropriate initial management by an interprofessional healthcare team of clinicians, specialists, nurses, and physical therapists, can make a significant difference in the long-term outcomes for patients who suffer from these fractures. Antibiotics should be administered for open fractures as quickly as possible, and a thorough neurovascular and soft tissue assessment should be completed. If compartment syndrome is suspected, surgical consultation should be made immediately. An urgent closed reduction should then be performed, and medical clearance for surgery should be obtained when indicated. The importance of follow-up should be stressed, and detailed follow-up information should be provided to the patient. If the patient requires physical therapy, they must comply with their rehabilitation regimen to achieve maximum recovery.

All care team members must engage in open communication with each other, particularly if any complications develop. Nurses are crucial resources in this effort, helping coordinate activities and referrals between specialists, the surgeon, and therapists. Thorough and updated record-keeping is also part of this communication strategy so all team members can access the latest patient status. This interprofessional team paradigm will yield the best patient results with the fewest adverse events. [Level 5]
