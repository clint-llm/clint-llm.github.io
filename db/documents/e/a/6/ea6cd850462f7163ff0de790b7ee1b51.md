Knowledge of the corticospinal tract is of the utmost importance in many clinical scenarios. Preservation and recovery of the corticospinal tract are necessary for the recovery of impaired motor function following a brain injury.

Damage to the corticospinal tract has correlations with neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Both autoimmune diseases involve an inflammatory process that causes extensive damage to neurologic structures involved in the corticospinal tract resulting in extensive neurologic disability, including optic neuritis and transverse myelitis.

Compromise of the corticospinal tract during development presents may present as a tract that is completely absent, hypoplastic, or malformed. Disorders with the absence of corticospinal tracts include anencephaly, where there is a failure of the rostral neural tube to close; congenital aqueduct stenosis with a narrowing of the cerebral aqueduct; and microcephaly, which is a defect in proliferation. Underdeveloped corticospinal tracts present in lissencephaly, a defect in migration leading to absent gyration, Walker-Warburg syndrome, migration deficiencies yielding cerebro-ocular dysplasia with muscular atrophy; holoprosencephaly, and the failure of the brain hemispheres to separate. Corticospinal tract malformations usually involve diffuse brain malformation and are most often associated with an abnormal trajectory of the pathway.
