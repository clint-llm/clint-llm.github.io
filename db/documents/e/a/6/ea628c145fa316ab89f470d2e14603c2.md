The history and physical examination provide the backbone for the diagnosis of this condition. Since this condition represents underlying pathophysiology involving the nail bed's vasculature, a biopsy is not recommended. Laboratory tests should be obtained as guided by patient history. Even though the number of possible etiologies continues to grow, the most important and commonly obtained test is likely serum albumin levels (levels <2.2 g/100 mL are most often associated). Other measures assessing for malnutrition could be considered, including total serum protein, serum chemistries, complete blood count, and urinalysis. For patients undergoing chemotherapy, blood levels of the therapeutic agent used can be obtained to assess for toxicity. Imaging studies are not needed.
