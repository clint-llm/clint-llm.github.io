The bipedicled free TRAM flap is a Mathes and Nahai type 3 muscle flap with a dual supply consisting of the deep superior epigastric and deep inferior epigastric arteries.

Muscle harvest has been described using the classification system ranging from MS0 to MS3. MS0 represents a flap which consists of removing the entire width of the rectus abdominis muscle. MS1 divides the muscle into medial and lateral, which refers to the segment of muscle preserved. MS2 flaps maintain the lateral and medial parts of the muscle, and only a strip of tissue is removed from the middle portion of the muscle.

Another variation is the stacked flap in which two single pedicle TRAM flaps can be utilized to reconstruct one breast. Stacked flaps are useful for radical mastectomy defects, patients with a long thorax, meager abdominal donor tissue, breasts which are large without significant ptosis or women who want the reconstruction to be larger than their original breast size.
