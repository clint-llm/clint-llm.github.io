The indications for obtaining an INR value are:

- Bleeding diathesis in patients with coagulation factors deficiency (fibrinogen and factors II, V, VII, or X, or a combined deficiency) in the extrinsic pathway

- Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

- Baseline sample collection before starting anticoagulation

- Monitoring the efficacy and safety while the patients are on warfarin due to clinical conditions with an increased risk of thrombosis such as mechanical heart valves, persistent atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease

- Test for liver synthetic function and to calculate the model for end-stage liver diseases (MELD) score in end-stage liver disease

INR monitoring is most commonly required for the patients who are on warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist. The dose of warfarin is adapted based on INR scores so that it remains in the therapeutic range to prevent thrombosis from subtherapeutic INR or hemorrhagic complications from supratherapeutic INR. The anticoagulant effect of warfarin indicated by an INR in the target range also guides us when to discontinue heparin.
