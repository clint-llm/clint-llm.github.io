Complete blood count may show leukocytosis and anemia, inflammatory markers such as ESR and C-reactive protein are usually elevated, as are urea and serum creatinine. Urinalysis shows modest proteinuria (1 to 4 g/d), microscopic hematuria, RBCs, and RBC and WBC casts. Rarely, urine findings may be minimal, and an absence of active urine sediment does not exclude a diagnosis of RPGN.

The immunologic evaluation may show normal complement levels (C3 and C4) except in type 2 RPGN where these are decreased. Circulating anti-GBM antibodies are detected in the plasma of patients with RPGN type 1, but this finding is neither 100% sensitive nor 100% specific. Anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCAs), typically myeloperoxidase (MPO)–ANCA which was previously known as perinuclear ANCA (p-ANCA) is observed in 80% to 90% of patients with RPGN type 3 (pauci-immune), but neither MPO-ANCA nor PR3-ANCA is 100% specific for type 3. Antinuclear antibody is usually negative unless lupus-related, and serum cryoglobulin levels may be elevated in cryoglobulinemias.

- Imaging studies: Abdominal ultrasound is used to assess renal and echogenicity and to exclude obstruction.

-  Renal biopsy is usually required to diagnose RPGN types 1, 2, and 3.
