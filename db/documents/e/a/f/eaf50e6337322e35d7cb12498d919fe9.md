Laboratory workup will show leukocytosis. In LFT abnormalities, the most common is elevated alkaline phosphatase and direct bilirubin which is consistent with a cholangitis pattern. The hepatic synthetic function is usually preserved.

Findings across different imaging modalities are the same. Ultrasonography is usually the first test and shows saccular dilatations of intrahepatic ducts. CT abdomen also shows a dysmorphic liver with gross dilatations and sometimes, a characteristic "central dot sign," which is a dark cystic dilatation around a central bright spot marking the portal tract. Intrahepatic bile duct canaliculi may also be seen. Cholangiography with either ERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) or MRCP (magnetic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) shows non-obstructing cystic dilations that communicate with the biliary tree. The advantage of ERCP is that of therapeutic removal of an impacted stone using sphincterotomy and balloon sweep.

Liver biopsy is rarely done and, when performed, the indication usually is to look for evidence of associated hepatic fibrosis.
