The superior cervical ganglia are typically present at cervical vertebral levels one and two (C1 and C2). However, they have been found between the cervical vertebral levels one through five. (C1-C5).

Branches coming off of the superior cervical ganglia include the:

- Pharyngeal branch

- The communicating branch of the cervical nerve

- The internal carotid branch

- The communicating branch of the pharyngeal mucosa

- The communicating branch of the vagus nerve

- The communicating branch of the superior laryngeal nerve

- The laryngeal branch

- The communicating branch of the internal jugular vein

There are reports of up to seven different types of branch combinations coming off of the superior cervical ganglia.

It is crucial to recognize that these are common variants of branches coming off of the superior cervical ganglia as damaging these may lead to consequences such as the development of Horner syndrome as described later in this activity.
