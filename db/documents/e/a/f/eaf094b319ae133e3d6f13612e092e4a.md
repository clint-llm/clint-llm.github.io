- LC continues to be a diagnostic challenge due to limited and varying sensitivities of diagnostic modalities used. Symptoms may be ignored initially in sick patients with metastatic disease, leading to a delay in diagnosis.

- Prognosis remains poor despite advances in therapies due to limited evidence from studies and variable/limited response to treatment which is limited by toxicity.

- Understanding the molecular mechanisms of metastasis to the brain may help find/evaluate better, focused therapies targeting tumor-specific molecular markers across different tumor types.
