Given the essential nature of adequate oxygenation and ventilation to patient survival, there are no absolute contraindications, but there may be relative contraindications to some techniques in certain clinical contexts. Advanced maneuvers such as intubation should only be performed by adequately trained providers and if the potential benefits in that clinical context outweigh the risks. Airway manipulation should be minimized in certain scenarios when aggressive prehospital interventions may lead to sudden deterioration, such as suspected epiglottitis in children, or where a patient has risk factors for difficult intubation and basic maneuvers are proving sufficient.
