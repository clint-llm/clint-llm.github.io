The collaboration between surgery and interventional radiology has allowed patients to undergo spleen salvage who once would have been managed by laparotomy and splenectomy. As is noted above, spleen salvage has increasingly been the goal of management in splenic trauma, with a focus on promoting infectious disease outcomes and avoidance of the potential complications of the laparotomy procedure itself, which can occur even if laparotomy is done when indicated and under the best of preoperative circumstances, which is not necessarily always the case during emergency splenectomies. Interprofessional investigations are ongoing regarding which splenic trauma patients are best served by laparotomy, selective embolization by interventional radiology, or simply observing the patient until adequate healing had occurred to allow the return to outpatient management. Emergency department, critical care, and operative nurses are part of the interprofessional team.
