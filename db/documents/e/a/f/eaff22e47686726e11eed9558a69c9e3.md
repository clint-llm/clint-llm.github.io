Negative prognostic factors include non-seminomatous germ cell tumors, increased age, lung metastasis, and elevated tumor markers(AFP, B-hCG, LDH). Mediastinal seminomatous germ cell tumors had a 5-year survival of 72% to 100%, compared to 48% to 65% in non-seminomatous germ cell tumor patients. The most favorable outcome for non-seminomatous malignancy was noted in young patients (under 29 years of age) with normal B-hCG levels. Nonpulmonary visceral metastasis is associated with a poorer prognosis. In seminomatous tumors without pulmonary involvement, the 5-year survival rate is more than 90%.

According to the recent update from the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group, LDH greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal was associated with adverse prognosis in patients with seminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumors.
