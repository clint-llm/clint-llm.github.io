**Heat Loss in the Newborn**

Minimizing heat loss in the newborn is central to reducing morbidity and mortality in the neonatal period and is one of the most critical strategies for the optimal development of the infant. Several characteristics of newborn physiology contribute to their increased risk of heat loss. The smaller the size of an infant, the larger the surface area-to-body mass ratio which promotes greater heat loss via conduction. Newborns also have less subcutaneous fat to provide insulation and more body water content. The blood flow in newborns is also altered resulting in peripheral cyanosis. Finally, newborns are unable to activate their muscles to shiver and must rely on the non-shivering thermogenesis in brown fat.

The most significant heat loss occurs immediately after birth. The greatest source of heat loss at birth is when the amniotic fluid evaporates from the skin. Conductive heat loss occurs when the baby gets placed on a cooler surface like a scale or table. The baby can reflexively curl in the fetal position to reduce the surface area in contact with the cooler surface to minimize heat loss. Air flow through the room cases convective heat loss. Radiation is the most significant source of heat loss after birth and throughout the rest of development. If proper measures are not taken to mitigate heat loss immediately after birth, the temperature of the newborn could drop by 2 to 4 degrees C within the first 20 minutes.
