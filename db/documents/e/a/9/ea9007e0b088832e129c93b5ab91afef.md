Skin exposure to freezing conditions causes frostbite. Prolonged duration and lower temperatures increase the likelihood and the extent of the injury. Certain pre-existing conditions may worsen tissue injury because of frostbite, including peripheral vascular disease, malnutrition, Raynaud's disease, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, etc. A unifying pattern among these conditions is poor impaired internal organ insulation or dysfunctional vasculature.

Risk factors for frostbite include:

- Winter season

- No or inadequate shelter from the cold

- High wind chill factor

- Exposure at a high altitude

- Prolonged duration of exposure

- Prolonged exposure to a wet condition

- Altered mental status

- Alcohol or drug abuse

- Malnutrition

- Immobilization

- Extremes of age

- Homeless

- Presence of medical disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, stroke or arthritis

- Smoker
