A pudendal nerve block can serve as a diagnostic method to reveal underlying pudendal neuralgia and is performed primarily with local anesthetics for testing. Patients who report significant pain relief are candidates for pudendal nerve block performed with corticosteroids and local anesthetic combinations for possible long-term pain relief. The effect of the block is variable and reported from weeks to months. Pudendal nerve block testing should be considered in all pelvic pain patients who do not respond to initial therapy.

Compared to general anesthesia or neuraxial anesthetic methods, pudendal nerve blocks have been shown to achieve a high level of pain control, and patients require fewer systemic analgesics.

However, due to patient discomfort associated with the local injections, the perceived risk of injuring critical structures, and a lack of sufficient training in urology and gynecology residency programs, pudendal nerve blocks are underused, especially in male patients.
