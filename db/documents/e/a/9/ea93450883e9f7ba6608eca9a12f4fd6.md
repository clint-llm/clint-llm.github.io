May-Thurner syndrome remains undetectable or clinically silent in the majority of patients. Multiple cadaveric studies on unselected subjects have shown a much higher prevalence than the actual thrombosis events reported in the alive patients. However, in patients with left-sided iliofemoral thrombosis, the prevalence of MTS has been consistently reported to be quite high. Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a common complication of MTS.
