Bipedicled TRAM flaps are generally indicated for acquired unilateral breast defects in patients with a limited amount of abdominal tissue, which is resistant to the options of contralateral breast reduction or the placement of an implant underneath a TRAM flap. In some cases, flap tissue beyond the described areas of perfusion is required for volume and projection, and by providing a second vascular pedicle, the perfusion can be enhanced.
