Most cases of acute pyelonephritis are uncomplicated and do not require consultations. More complicated cases of acute pyelonephritis may require consults such as urology, obstetrics and gynecology, and infectious disease. Urology is usually consulted for patients with urethral obstruction, urogenital abnormalities, or the first episode of pyelonephritis in an infant. Obstetrics and gynecology would be consulted for a pregnant patient with acute pyelonephritis. Infectious disease can be consulted for patients that are immunocompromised, have resistant pathogens, or have blood cultures that areÂ positive for more than 48 hours.
