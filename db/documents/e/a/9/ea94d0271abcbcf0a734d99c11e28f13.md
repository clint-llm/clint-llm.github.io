Cancer is one of the leading causes of death, next only to heart disease in the United States. Cancer screening is the modality for prevention and early recognition of cancer. As per the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention), new cancer cases that are expected in 2020 will be more than 1.8 million, with 606,520 cancer deaths. Fortunately, some of the cancers, for instance, colon, lung, cervical, breast cancer, can be detected with screening, which helps in delaying or even halting the progression of cancer.

Due to significant lag time in the malignant transformation; Screening provides an opportunity to detect premalignant lesions, early intervention in the carcinogenic process, and delay the course of cancer.

Healthy People Initiative (HPI) is a US program that develops and tracks health objectives for the nation. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a chosen data source for setting and assessing several HPI targets in cancer.
