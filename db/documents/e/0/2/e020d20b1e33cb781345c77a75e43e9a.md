For patients that have developed AKI, there are several things they should be advised to preserve renal function, including avoiding nephrotoxic agents. NSAIDs are known to cause interstitial nephritis, which can lead to the development of AKI or the worsening of existing AKI. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are known to affect renal autoregulation, although the avoidance of these mediations in the perioperative period is currently a topic of debate.
