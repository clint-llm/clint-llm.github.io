Various theories have been proposed for the possible pathogenesis of Cameron lesions, with mechanical trauma caused by constant rubbing of mucosal folds at the constriction level of the diaphragm being the most likely cause. It has been postulated that different forces act at the neck of the gastric sac during breathing, including the upward sliding movement of the stomach, negative intrathoracic pressure causing outward and upward force, and impinging force by the crura during gastric sliding through the diaphragm.

Other mechanisms include gastric acid injury, focal ischemia due to diaphragmatic pressure on the herniated sac, and gut wall edema due to venous obstruction leading to vascular stasis.

Cameron lesions have not been shown to have a positive correlation with NSAID use, Helicobacter pylori infection, or the absence of PPI usage. Though, binge drinking in some studies has been related to the Cameron lesions.
