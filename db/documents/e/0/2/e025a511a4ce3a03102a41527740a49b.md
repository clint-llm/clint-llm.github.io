Clinical presentation of hypocarbia depends on the duration, severity, and underlying cause of the illness. Since the underlying mechanism behind all the etiologies of hypocapnia is hyperventilation, many patients present with a complaint of shortness of breath. The exact history and physical exam findings are highly variable as many pathologies induce respiratory change. These may include acute onset dyspnea, fever, chills, peripheral edema, orthopnea, weakness, chest pain, wheezing, hemoptysis, trauma, history of central line catheter, recent surgery, history of thromboembolic disease, history of asthma, history of COPD, acute focal neurological signs, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, tinnitus, or weight loss.

Cerebral vasoconstriction secondary to hypocarbia may present with neurological symptoms such as dizziness, confusion, seizures, and syncope. However, these symptoms only manifest in the absence of hypoxemia.

Hyperventilation may also lead to painful tingling in the hands and feet, numbness, and sweating of the hands.

Hypocarbia also hampers vitamin D metabolism leading to hypovitaminosis D, which may present as fibromyalgias and tetany.

Depending on the etiology, physical exam findings may vary significantly.

Tachypnea is a frequent finding at presentation, as many patients with hyperventilation syndrome are anxious and tachycardic. The only difference between acute and chronic hypocarbia is that in an acute setting, patients tend to have chest wall movements and increased breathing rate. In contrast, in chronic states, these findings may not be apparent.

There may be positive Trousseau, and Chvostek signs secondary to respiratory alkalosis, which causes decreased serum calcium due to a shift of calcium from the blood to albumin, which has become more negative in the alkalotic state.

Several pulmonary diseases often present with hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis. In such instances, the physical findings on chest examination would depend on the underlying pathology. For example, coarse crackles in pneumonia, wheezes, and rhonchi in asthma, or fine crackles in left ventricular failure and interstitial lung diseases.
