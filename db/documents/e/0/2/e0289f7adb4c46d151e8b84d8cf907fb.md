Although the exact cause of alimentary tract duplications is not known, these are believed to occur due to embryological aberrations between 4th to 8th weeks of gestation. Multiple theories have been put forward to explain its etiopathogenesis. The split notochord theory is based on the abnormal separation of the growing notochord from the endodermal cells. This theory is mostly cited to explain the occurrence of vertebral anomalies associated with duplication cysts.

The recanalization theory postulates that errors in the recanalization of the gut are responsible for the occurrence of these cysts.

The partial or abortive twinning theory explains the occurrence of these duplication cysts is due to incomplete twinning of the alimentary tract.
