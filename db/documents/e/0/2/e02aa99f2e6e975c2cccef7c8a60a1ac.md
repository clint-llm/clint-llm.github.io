As with other approved PD-1/PD-L1-targeted therapies, the use of atezolizumab can be associated with immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs), which can be severe or fatal and involve any organ system manifesting as described below.

**Infusion-related Reactions**

- Anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity

**Immune-mediated Colitis**

- Immune-mediated colitis is characterized by signs and symptoms of diarrhea or increased ostomy output, colitis, and or perforation. All other etiologies of diarrhea and colitis should be excluded, including endoscopic evaluation. Based on the clinical and endoscopic severity, immune-mediated colitis is classified into four different grades:

- **Grade 1**: < 4 stools per day or mild increase in ostomy output compared to baseline
- **Grade 2**:  4 to 6 stools per day or moderate increase in ostomy output compared to baseline (compared with baseline) and/or colitis symptoms
- **Grade 3**: ≥7 stools per day or severe increase in ostomy output compared to baseline with colitis
- **Grade 4**: Severe colitis resulting in bowel perforation requiring urgent surgical intervention

**Immune-mediated Cutaneous Adverse Effects**

- Immune-mediated cutaneous adverse reactions are common and manifest as itching, maculopapular rash, lichenoid reactions, vitiligo, and pruritus.

- Based on the clinical severity and percentage of involvement of the body surface area, they are classified into four grades:

- **Grade 1**: asymptomatic with macules/papules involving <10% of the body surface area
- **Grade 2**: macules/papules involving 10% to 30% of the body surface area with or without symptoms
- **Grade 3**: macules/papules involving >30% of the body surface area with or without symptoms
- **Grade 4**: Severe cutaneous reactions such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, TEN, and bullous dermatitis covering >30% of BSA and requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission.

**Immune-mediated Endocrinopathies**

- Immune-mediated endocrinopathies can present with signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, thyroiditis, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, and diabetes, either alone related to one endocrine organ or in combination.

**Immune-mediated Hepatitis**

- Immune-Mediated Hepatitis typically manifests with elevation in liver function tests.

- Based on the severity of liver test abnormalities and hepatic dysfunction, immune-mediated hepatitis is classified into four types:

- **Grade 1**: Elevation of AST/ALT < 3 times the upper limit of normal(ULN) and/or total bilirubin <1.5 times ULN
- **Grade 2**: Elevation of AST/ALT 3 to 5 times ULN and/or total bilirubin >1.5 to ≤ 3 times ULN
- **Grade 3**: Elevation of AST/ALT AST/ALT > 5 to 20 times ULN and/or total bilirubin 3–10x ULN
- **Grade 4**: AST/ALT > 20x ULN, and/or total bilirubin >10x ULN associated with signs and symptoms of liver dysfunction.

**Immune-mediated Pneumonitis or Interstitial Lung Disease**

- Immune-Mediated pneumonitis is characterized by nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and radiological abnormalities of the lung.

- Based on clinical severity and radiological involvement, immune-mediated pneumonitis is classified into four different types: 

- **Grade 1**: asymptomatic and limited to <25% involvement of the lung parenchyma or one lobe of the lung
- **Grade 2**: moderate symptoms and involvement of 25 to 50% of the lung parenchyma or more than one lobe of the lung
- **Grade 3**: severe symptoms and involvement of >50% of the lung parenchyma or all lung lobes
- **Grade 4**: acute respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation.

**Immune-mediated Renal Dysfunction and Nephritis**

- Immune-mediated renal dysfunction  typically manifests with increased creatinine levels and is graded into four types of severity based on the renal function: 

- **Grade 1**: An increase in creatinine level >0.3 mg/dL or 1.5 to 2.0 times compared to a baseline value
- **Grade 2**: An increase in creatinine level 2 to 3 times compared to a baseline value
- **Grade 3**: An increase in creatinine level  >4.0 mg/dL or >3 times compared to a baseline value
- **Grade 4**: Worsening renal function requiring hemodialysis)

**Immune-mediated Neurological Toxicities******

The incidence of immune-mediated neurological toxicity is 1 % and is characterized by clinical symptoms of polyneuropathy, facial nerve palsy, aseptic meningitis, transverse myelitis, myasthenia gravis, Guillain Barre syndrome(GBS), or posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy.

Other common adverse reactions that occurred with atezolizumab as a single agent in clinical trials participants include:

- Musculoskeletal (back pain, neck pain)

- Metabolism (decreased appetite, hyperglycemia, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypermagnesemia, hypophosphatemia)

- Dermatologic (pruritus, rash)

- Respiratory (cough, dyspnea)

- General (fatigue, pyrexia, asthenia)

- Gastrointestinal (abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea)

- Endocrine (hypothyroidism)

- Infectious (pneumonia, urinary tract infection)

- Blood/lymphatic (anemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia)

- Hepatobiliary (elevated liver function tests)

- Renal (increase serum creatinine)
