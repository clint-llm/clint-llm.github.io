The main preparation for the Fontan procedure is making sure the patient adequately meets the criteria for surgery.

- Patient age between 4 to 15 years old

- No arrhythmia (only sinus rhythm present)

- Normal drainage of the vena cava

- Normal right atrial (RA) volume

- Low pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), less than 15 mm Hg

- Low pulmonary resistance (less than 4 Woods Units * m2)

- Adequate pulmonary artery (PA) size (PA to aorta ratio greater than 0.75)

- Normal ventricular function, greater than 55%

- Absent atrioventricular valve regurgitation

- Normal pulmonary artery anatomy

Once it is determined that the patient meets the allotted criteria, a series of tests should be done prior to surgery, including electrocardiography, transthoracic echocardiogram, pulmonary assessment, and right heart catheterization. Successful Fontan physiology is ultimately dependent upon low pulmonary vascular resistance and preserved ventricular function.
