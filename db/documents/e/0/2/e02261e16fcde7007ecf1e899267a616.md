Nystagmus, in some patients, can be asymptomatic. However, in most, nystagmus causes vertigo, oscillopsia, blurred vision, or abnormal head positioning. Vertigo is the primary symptom and occurs most commonly with vestibular problems. Oscillopsia, which is a sensation of the environment moving back and forth, depends on the type of nystagmus present but can be continuous, intermittent, or gaze-evoked.
