The presentation of Primary carnitine deficiency is variable between patients in terms of severity.

Hyperammonemia occurs due to reduced expression of enzymes involved in the urea cycle and noted during acute metabolic decompensation.

Less frequently, adults with PCD may have no or mild symptoms (e.g. fatigue) but sudden cardiac death remains a risk in asymptomatic adults.
