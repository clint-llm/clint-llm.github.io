Horseshoe perianal abscesses are uncommon. They are abscesses that surround the entire anus. These abscesses are typically drained through an incision, and drainage is performed posterior to the anus. It is helpful to place counter incisions at the anterior extent of the abscess to ensure adequate drainage. Penrose may be placed through these incisions to aid in continued drainage and prevent premature closure. These drains are left in place for 2 to 3 weeks and then removed in the post-operative office visit.

Prompt follow-up with surgical services is advisable to monitor wound healing. Inadequate drainage may result in the reformation of an abscess, which may require repeat incision and drainage. If not promptly diagnosed and treated, perianal abscesses may lead to several other sequelae, including fistula in ano, perianal sepsis, or necrotizing soft tissue infection of the anus and surrounding buttock. If a fistula in ano is detected, patients will need operative drainage, fistulotomy, or seton placement, which may have a risk of incontinence. Necrotizing soft tissue infection treatment goals are debridement of all non-viable tissue and may requireÂ colostomy for diversion of stool during healing. If not adequately treated, necrotizing soft tissue infection may have mortality as high as 50%.
