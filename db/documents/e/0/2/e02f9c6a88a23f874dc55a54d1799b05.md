Abnormalities of the locus coeruleus have implications as contributing to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative processes. Individuals suffering from neuropsychiatric processes may be affected due to abnormal norepinephrine regulation leading to the formation of clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic attacks, and anxiety. When norepinephrine becomes elevated, there is an increase in anxiety and mania. Depression may be apparent when norepinephrine decreases. The degeneration of neurons in the locus coeruleus has been postulated as contributing to Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. In studies performed on mice, researchers induced the degeneration of locus coeruleus neurons, which resulted in increased deposits of amyloid-beta protein in the brain. Amyloid-beta protein is a component of amyloid plaques. Amyloid plaques are involved in the pathology of Alzheimer disease.
