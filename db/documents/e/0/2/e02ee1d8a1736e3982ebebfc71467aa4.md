The virus infects retinal cells and causes necrosis to occur. As necrosis occurs from virally induced cytolysis and arteriolar and choriocapillaris occlusion, the necrotic cells slough into the vitreous chamber exposing large areas devoid of retinal cells.

In the acute phase, virus particles induce an inflammatory event, and this creates a response that damages the retinal cells. Inflammation of the arterioles leads to vaso-occlusive events furthering rapid necrosis of the retinal tissue. In the late phase, contractile membranes may form in the vitreous and on the surface of the damaged retina. Retinal necrosis causes multiple breaks in a pattern of the sieve and breaks at the margin of the normal and necrotic/inflamed retina. This may lead to retinal detachment. Retinal detachment may occur in up to 75% of eyes with ARN within 3 months of the onset of symptoms.
