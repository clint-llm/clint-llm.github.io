Congenital iris ectropion is attributed to a developmental arrest late in gestation, which leads to retention of the primordial endothelium over parts of the iris. There is a high insertion of the iris over the posterior trabecular meshwork due to incomplete regression of uveal tissue. The retention of the primordial tissue leads to a smooth cryptless anterior iris surface.

An animal (cat) model of iris ectropion demonstrated the role of ischemia of the posterior segment. Lensectomy, vitrectomy, transection, and cautery of branch retinal vein consistently produced ectropion uveae and iris neovascularization. A cellular membrane with vessels developed on the anterior surface of the iris. Sphincter muscle and pigment epithelium of the iris was also pulled to the anterior surface. The contractile nature of the membrane was supported by this finding.
