- Pott puffy tumorÂ is a forehead swelling due to frontal bone osteomyelitis with associated subperiosteal abscess.

- PPT is a rare complication of sinusitis, but can also occur due to trauma.

- PPT is most commonly seen in the pediatric and young adolescent populations due to the pneumatization process and venous drainage.

- The most common pathogen is polymicrobial (Streptococci, anaerobes, and Staphylococci).

- The most common presentation is forehead swelling, fever, rhinorrhea, and headache.

- Increased intracranial pressure symptoms should raise concerns for the presence of intracranial complications.

- Once suspected, broad-spectrum IV antibiotics, IV hydration, analgesia, and imaging studies should be done.

- Head CT with contrast is the initial imaging performed, but brain MRI is preferred to evaluate intracranial involvement if available.

- Brain MRI is preferred during follow up as there is no radiation exposure.

- Specialists consultation, especially otolaryngology and neurosurgery, are crucial for management.

- The best management is a combination of surgical intervention and prolonged IV antibiotics.

- Rapid recognition, imaging, and treatment are crucial for optimal outcomes.
