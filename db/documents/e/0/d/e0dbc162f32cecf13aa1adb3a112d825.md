The main complication following treatment is the risk of recurrence of the lesion, which is high for all types of surgery but particularly pronounced for local excision. The recurrence rate appears to be higher in patients with bilateral multiple lesions and family history. Other potential surgical complications include issues related to the wound, such as dehiscence and painful scarring, as well as nerve entrapment. In subtotal fasciectomy, a loss of height of the medial longitudinal arch has also been reported.
