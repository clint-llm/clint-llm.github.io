In the NETT trial, patient cohorts were analyzed for operative mortality and cardiopulmonary morbidity. The subanalysis found that cardiopulmonary morbidity remained high at approximately 5.5%. Major pulmonary and cardiovascular complications were also relatively high, occurring in 20% to 30% of patients (out of 511) who were considered a non-high-risk subset of LVRS patients. Naunheim et al. found that patients with non-upper-lobe-predominant emphysema were one of the factors associated with increased mortality.

Some other complications include:

- Air leak

- Major cardiovascular complications, including arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolus

- Hypoxia

- Infections, including pneumonia

- Major pulmonary complications including respiratory failure requiring reintubation, prolonged intubation, or tracheostomy

Air leak is one of the most common complications following LVRS, with the NETT trial patients estimating 90% in the 30-day postoperative period. However, only 12% of patients had an air leak greater than 30 days. It was concluded that not having an air leak post-operatively was not associated with the specific surgical technique.
