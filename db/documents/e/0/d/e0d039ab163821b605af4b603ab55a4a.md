The sphenopalatine ganglion is an effective target for treating cluster headaches using anesthetic blocks, RFA, or neurostimulation. Additionally, there is growing evidence supporting the use of SPG RFA to manage several other conditions, including myofascial pain, post-herpetic neuralgia, post-traumatic headache, cluster headache, and pain originating from the temporomandibular joint as well as various head and neck cancers. However, most of these studies were performed with small sample sizes and a short duration of follow-up. Further controlled studies are warranted to produce consistent results and confirm these findings.
