Intervertebral discs serve a number of vital functions in the realms of structural support and locomotion.

Within the disc itself, the separate components serve different purposes. The NP serves to distribute hydraulic pressure throughout the intervertebral disc. The NP can disperse the forces placed on one aspect of a vertebral body to the entire structure by virtue of its high water content. A hypothetical solid NP, in contrast, would transmit a force placed on one aspect of a vertebral body directly to the corresponding aspect of the inferior vertebral body, thus increasing the risk of trauma. The AF serves, for one, to encircle the NP as a “cage” to provide structure to the gelatinous form. The aforementioned “radial-ply” configuration allows for increased resistance to the compressive forces exerted upon it by the NP. Given the general rostral-caudal direction of the fibers, the AF also resists torsion, flexion, and extension movements of the spine.

Holistically, the discs first allow for the spine to be both a supportive yet flexible structure. They provide separation and connectivity between vertebrae and counteract forces that act to lengthen or compress the spine or affect it in a torsional or shear manner. They also sufficiently separate the vertebrae to allow spinal nerves to exit the intervertebral foramina.

Similar to the flexibility created by the intervertebral discs, they also have a protective effect on vertebrae. This “shock-absorbing” feature distributes forces throughout the spine – lessening the load on any one vertebra, thus reducing the risk of fracture and degenerative changes.
