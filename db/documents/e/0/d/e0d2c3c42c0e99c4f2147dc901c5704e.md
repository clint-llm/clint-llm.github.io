The examination should include a thorough inspection of the affected arm as well as the ipsilateral clavicle. The entire arm should be palpated to assess for tenderness of the bones and joints. The diagnosis of radial head subluxation can typically be made clinically. Imaging should be performed if there is suspicion for fracture, elbow dislocation, or if edema or deformity are present on exam.  Imaging is also indicated if the mechanism did not involve the typical axial traction of the arm or nonaccidental trauma is a concern. Radiographs are typically normal in radial head subluxation, but the displacement of the radiocapitellar line may be seen on plain film x-rays.
