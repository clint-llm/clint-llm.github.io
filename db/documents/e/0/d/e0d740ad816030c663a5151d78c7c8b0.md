Zoster characteristically presents with a prodrome of fever, malaise, and excruciating burning pain followed by the outbreak of vesicles that appear in one to three crops over three to five days. Lesions are distributed unilaterally within a single dermatome.

Clinically, lesions start as closely grouped erythematous papules which, rapidly become vesicles on an erythematous and edematous base and may occur in continuous or interrupted bands in one, two, or more contiguous dermatomes unilaterally. Dermatomes commonly involved are thoracic (53%), cervical (20%), and trigeminal (15%) including ophthalmic and lumbosacral (11%).

The three phases of the infection include:

- Preeruptive stage presents with abnormal skin sensations or pain within the dermatome affected. this phase appears at least 48 hours prior to any obvious lesions. At the same time, the individual may experience headaches, general malaise, and photophobia.

- The acute eruptive phase is marked by the vesicles and the symptoms seen in the pre-eruptive phase. The lesions initially start as macules and quickly transform into painful vesicles. The vesicles often rupture, ulcerate and eventually crust over. Patients are most infectious in this stage until the lesion dry out. Pain is severe during this phase and often unresponsive to traditional pain medications. The phase may last 2-4 weeks but the pain may continue.

- Chronic infection is characterized by recurrent pain that lasts more than 4 weeks. Besides the pain, patients experience paresthesias, shock-like sensations, and dysesthesias. The pain is disabling and may last 12 months or longer.

Shingles oticus is also known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II. It is due to the spreading of the virus from the facial nerve to the vestibulocochlear nerve which involves the ear and causes hearing loss and vertigo (rotational dizziness).

Zoster may occur in the mouth if the maxillary or mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve is affected. Clinically, it presents with vesicles or erosions occurring over the mucous membrane of the upper jaw (palate, gums of the upper teeth) or the lower jaw (tongue or gums of the lower teeth). Oral involvement may occur alone or in combination with the lesions on the skin over the cutaneous distribution of the same trigeminal branch.

Due to the close relationship of blood vessels to nerves, the virus can spread to involve the blood vessels compromising the blood supply, and causing ischemic necrosis. Complications such as osteonecrosis, tooth loss, periodontitis, pulp calcification, pulp necrosis, periapical lesions, and tooth developmental anomalies can occur due to it.

The ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve is the most commonly involved branch which causes ophthalmic zoster. The skin of the forehead, upper eyelid, and orbit of the eye may be involved. It is seen in approximately 10% to 25% of cases presenting with features of, keratitis, uveitis, and optic nerve palsies. Complications in the form of chronic ocular inflammation, loss of vision, and debilitating pain can occur.

The involvement of the CNS is not uncommon. since the virus resides in the sensory root ganglia, it can affect any part of the brain causing cranial nerve palsies, muscular weakness, diaphragmatic paralysis, neurogenic bladder, Guillain Barre syndrome, and myelitis. In severe cases, patients may develop encephalitis.

Complications of herpes zoster include secondary bacterial infection, post-herpetic neuralgia, scarring, nerve palsy, and encephalitis in the case with disseminated zoster.

- Disseminated zoster is defined as more than twenty skin lesions developing outside the primarily affected area or dermatomes directly adjacent to it. Besides the skin, other organs may also be affected, causing hepatitis or encephalitis making this condition potentially lethal.

- Post-herpetic neuralgia is the persistence of pain after a month of onset of herpes zoster. It is the commonest side effect seen in elderly patients with involvement of the ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve.

- Complications like cranial neuropathies, polyneuritis, myelitis, aseptic meningitis, or partial facial paralysis occur due to the involvement of the nervous system.

During pregnancy, varicella may lead to infection in the fetus and complications in the newborn, but chronic infection or reactivation, in other words, herpes zoster, is not associated with fetal infection.

Zoster sine herpete is an entity with a pain in the involved dermatome without any skin lesions.
