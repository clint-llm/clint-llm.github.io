There are numerous causes of abnormal posturing including supratentorial and infratentorial lesions, alongside more diffuse pathologies such as metabolic and infective causes:

**Supratentorial Lesions**

- Abscess

- Extra-axial hematoma: subdural and extradural

- Hydrocephalus

- Intracerebral hemorrhage

- Raised intracranial pressure

- Traumatic brain injury including diffuse axonal injury

- Tumor

**Infratentorial Lesion**

- Abscess

- Hydrocephalus

- Infarct: brainstem or bilateral diencephalic

- Intracerebral hemorrhage: cerebellar or brainstem

- Traumatic brain injury including diffuse axonal injury

- Tumor

**Diffuse and Metabolic**

- Cerebral malaria

- Electrolyte abnormalities: hyponatremia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia

- Encephalitis

- Hepatic encephalopathy

- Hypoxic brain injury

- Hypoglycemia

- Lead poisoning

- Meningitis

- Reye syndrome

In patients with preexisting structural lesions of the central nervous system, episodes of decerebrate posturing can occur in response to numerous physiological factors including, but not exclusive to, fever, hypoxia; metabolic disturbance; sensory irritation; hypoglycemia; and meningeal irritation.
