Trained office or hospital staff such as a medical assistant or nurse can outfit the patient with the external receiver and coach the patient through the capsule ingestion process. After the external receiver captures the transmitted images, they are then downloaded onto a computer. A gastroenterologist competent in evaluating endoscopy then evaluates and documents the findings of the capsule endoscopy in a report. The average time it takesÂ to generate a report is 30 to 120 minutes for small bowel capsules and 5 to 15 minutes for esophageal capsules.
