Effective treatment of patients with WS requires interprofessional communication and collaboration to improve patient outcomes. Healthcare providers, including physicians, specialists, and pediatric nurses, should monitor children with WS for associated endocrine and neurodevelopmental abnormalities by obtaining weight, BMI, calcium, TSH, CMP, hearing screen, and vision screen at baseline and routinely during treatment.
