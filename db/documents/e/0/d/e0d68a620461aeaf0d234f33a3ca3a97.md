Lisfranc ligament injury can be difficult to diagnose, especially if there is no obvious fracture. One of the ways to evaluate for Lisfranc injury involves a fluoroscopic stress exam. Indications are midfoot pain after injury with possible associated plantar ecchymosis or swelling. There also must not be an obvious widening of the first and second metatarsal space and no obvious fracture or displacement.

Intraoperative fluoroscopic imaging is helpful for the evaluation of reduction of hallux valgus deformity. Elliot et al. showed that intraoperative fluoroscopy reliably represented the post-operative weight-bearing radiographs. Gutteck et al. also found that intraoperative fluoro during correction of hallux valgus showed similar correction of intermetatarsal angles and hallux valgus angles compared to post-op imaging at 8 weeks and 3 months. This means intra-operative fluoroscopic imaging can reliably provide a view of final correction, allowing for any corrections to be made during surgery. It is necessary to view a lateral of the foot post hallux valgus correction to make sure the first ray is not dorsiflexed as this could lead to post-op pain and metatarsalgia.

Another use of fluoroscopy in foot pathology is the localization of pain. This can be done with a diagnostic injection of local anesthetic and steroid. You inject at the area of presumed pathology or point of maximal pain and use the post-injection clinical findings to confirm and document precise locations of the injections.

Plantar plate tear of the first MTP joint also called turf toe when acutely traumatic, is a condition that can be diagnosed with fluoroscopy.  Patients can present with great toe MTP stiffness, pain, swelling, usually after an axial load with the MTP joint in dorsiflexion.
