The hip joint and its abductor mechanism behave like a class 1 lever with the effort and the load on either side of the fulcrum.

Any pathology of the fulcrum, load, effort, or the lever which binds all three will lead to a positive Trendelenburg gait.

Failure of the fulcrum presents in the following conditions:

- Osteonecrosis of hip

- Legg-Calve-Perthes disease

- Developmental dysplasia of the hip

- Chronically dislocated hips secondary to trauma

- Chronically dislocated hips secondary to infections like tuberculosis of theÂ hip

Failure of the lever is a feature in the following conditions:

- Greater trochanteric avulsion

- Non-union of the neck of the femur

- Coxa Vara

Failure of effort presents in the following conditions:

- Poliomyelitis

- L5 radiculopathy

- Superior gluteal nerve damage

- Gluteus medius and minimus tendinitis

- Gluteus medius and minimus abscess

- Post total hip arthroplasty
