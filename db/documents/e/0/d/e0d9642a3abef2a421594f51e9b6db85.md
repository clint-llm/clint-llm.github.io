Following surgical intervention, about 60% to 70% of the patients report symptom relief. Symptom relief has been reported to be immediate in some instances. In others, it may take up to a few months for the resolution of the pain. The presence of postexertional pain has been shown to be correlated with symptomatic improvement after surgery while the presence of emesis and unprovoked pain preoperatively has been shown to be associated with suboptimal surgical outcomes postoperatively. Patients who have a good response to a diagnostic celiac plexus block preoperatively also seem to report better symptom relief following surgical intervention. The presence of atherosclerotic risk factors may predict poorer outcomes postoperatively.
