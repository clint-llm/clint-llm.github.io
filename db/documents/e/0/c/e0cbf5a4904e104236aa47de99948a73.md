Presentation of multivessel disease is variable and dependent on theÂ severity of the underlying disease, presence of comorbid conditions which may alter the typical presentation, and acuity of disease. Patients with stable multivessel disease may present with exertional chest pain or shortness of breath with radiation to the left arm and neck. The chest pain is termed "typical" chest pain when three of the following are present and "atypical" when two of the following are present: chest pain worsened by emotional or physical stress, chest pain relieved by rest and nitroglycerin, substernal chest pain, pressure or discomfort. Patients may also have associated nausea, diaphoresis, and lightheadedness. Patients of older age, particularly women and those with diabetes, may present atypically with frequent complaints of epigastric discomfort and associated nausea and vomiting. Acute thrombosis will typically present with crushing substernal chest pain not relieved by rest and temporarily relieved by nitroglycerin. Acute myocardial infarction should be ruled out in all patients presenting with chest pain, considering that the diagnosis represents a time-sensitive, potentially life-saving medical emergency.
