Education plays a significant role in caring for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It begins from the diagnosis and continues throughout the patient's disease course. It must be carried out as a multidisciplinary approach, including all the healthcare workers the patient encounters. The importance of proper education is especially highlighted in patients diagnosed at an early stage and without active disease. In these patients, evidence-based research supports observation and no intervention.

Providing the appropriate and necessary education to the patient, family members, or caregivers as to why observation is the ideal course at that moment can create a very frustrating situation for those seeking immediate intervention. Additionally, it is also vital to discuss opportunities such as clinical trials. In some circumstances, even though observation is the recommendation, some patients can still be eligible for clinical trials.

Lastly,Â it is essential for physicians caring for patients with CLL to keep up-to-date on available clinical trials, research, and updates in management recommendations. Although this is, in general, a necessary medical concept, it is particularly significant for CLL given ongoing investigations, evolving guidelines, and medication availability.
