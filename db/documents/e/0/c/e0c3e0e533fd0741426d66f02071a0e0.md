Patients who have symptoms of numbness, paresthesias, pain, or weakness of the upper extremity should be evaluated by a clinician for evaluation to determine the source of their symptoms and to identify an appropriate treatment plan going forward. Acute processes may need early surgical intervention, but most presentations warrant a trial of non-operative intervention.
