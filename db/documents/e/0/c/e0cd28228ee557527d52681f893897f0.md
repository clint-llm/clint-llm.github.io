The exact cause of giant cell arteritis is unknown. Inflammation of medium-large-sized arteries originating from the arch of the aorta is the hallmark of the disease. GCA is characterized by innate and adaptive immune system dysregulation, and the pathophysiology is thought to involve the body's inappropriate response to vascular endothelial injury. GCA is characterized by a predominant Th-1 immune-mediated response with significant expression of IFN-Gamma. A Th-17 immune response has been identified recently, which responds better to glucocorticoids.

The initial insult to the endothelium (injury, trauma, infection, drug, autoantigen) results in activation of the dendritic cells residing in the adventitia. The activated dendritic cells release chemokines attracting CD4+ helper T cells and macrophages into the arterial wall. The activated dendritic cells also release IL-6 and IL-18, which activate the T-cells and promote IFN-gamma release from the T-cells. The IFN-gamma release from T-cells promotes inflammation, macrophage activation, and granuloma formation. The activated macrophages release matrix metalloproteinase and oxygen free radicals causing endothelial damage and disruption of the internal elastic lamina. They also secrete nitric oxide in the intima and unite to form syncytia, leading to "giant cell" formation. The macrophages also contribute to systemic inflammation by releasing IL-1 and IL-6.
