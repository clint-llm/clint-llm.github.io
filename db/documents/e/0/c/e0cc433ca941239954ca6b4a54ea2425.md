The presenting signs and symptoms can be vague and nonspecific; therefore, one needs to have a high index of suspicion to avoid misdiagnosis. The incidence of CO poisoning is higher during cold weather months when there is also a higher incidence of viral gastroenteritis infections, and many of the symptoms can overlap. Common symptoms of CO toxicity are malaise, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and headache. More severe cases can result in impaired cognitive function, loss of consciousness, seizures, and coma. It is important to suspect a loss of consciousness if the patient is unable to give a history of recent events. The classic “cherry red” lips and skin appearance associated with CO poisoning is insensitive and often not present. Cardiac toxicity can present with chest pain, myocardial ischemia, ventricular arrhythmia, acute congestive heart failure, and often profound metabolic lactic acidosis. Anyone with smoke inhalation, unexplained loss of consciousness, or coma should have the diagnosis of CO poisoning entertained. If the patient is conscious, it is helpful to test cognitive function with a mini-mental status exam. Dysdiadochokinesis (difficulty with rapid alternating movements) is impaired with CO poisoning and is a quick means of assessing cerebellar function. It is reasonable to assume that if the patient has cerebellar dysfunction from CO poisoning, the rest of the brain function will probably be impaired.
