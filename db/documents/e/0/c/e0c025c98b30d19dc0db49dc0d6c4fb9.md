Heyde syndrome is typically a disease of the elderly population, diagnosed most often in patients greater than 65 years of age. At present, there is little data available on the actual prevalence of the syndrome, although the most prominent findings of Heyde syndrome (gastrointestinal bleeding in the setting of aortic valve stenosis) commonly present in the general population, and the prevalence of these conditions increases with age. Because of this, Heyde syndrome is likely underdiagnosed and underreported.

Aortic stenosis is prevalent in approximately 7.5% of persons 75 years of age or older.
