The drug elimination half-life for 5 mg of zolpidem was found to be 2.6 hours. Respectively, the elimination for patients given 10 mg of zolpidem is 2.5 hours, ranging between 1.4 to 3.8 hours. Zolpidem undergoes a linear kinetics pattern when the dose range is between 5 mg and 20 mg. The drug was also found to be mostly bound to protein and remained unchanged in concentration subsequently extracted through the renal system.

This drug has a high potential for overuse and daily dependence. Patients with a few weeks of drug use have a low behavioral dependency on zolpidem. Patients who used zolpidem in higher single doses or had a history of drug abuse should be monitored carefully when using zolpidem or any other hypnotic. Patients experience anterograde amnesia after drug administration if plasma concentrations are high at the time of the stimulus. This is attributed to either inattention or consolidation of the memory process.
