Priapism is a disorder in which the penis maintains a prolonged erection in the absence of appropriate stimulation. Three broad categories exist for this disease: ischemic, nonischemic, and recurrent ischemic. Ischemic causes of priapism are a true emergency and require prompt intervention to prevent damage to the penis, which can progress to erectile dysfunction and permanent impotence. Emergent management of this disease is directed toward achieving detumescence. This activity reviews the pathophysiology of priapism and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the presentation of priapism.
- Describe the pathophysiology of priapism.
- Summarize the treatment for priapism.
- Review the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve patient outcomes affected by priapism.
