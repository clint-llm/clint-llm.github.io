The current understanding of coronary artery embryology posits that coronary arteries stem from the epicardial atrioventricular and interventricular grooves with its proximal section merging into the aortic valve sinuses during fetal development. The vascular connection from the atrioventricular valve and the interventricular valve to the aortic valve sinuses gives rise to the right coronary artery and the LMCA. The connection only occurs after the aortopulmonary rotation has been completed. This phenomenon explains the proximity of the vascular connection from the atrioventricular and interventricular grooves to the aortic root since coronary arteries have to pierce through a sinus wall late in the cardiac development and do so via the shortest route possible.
