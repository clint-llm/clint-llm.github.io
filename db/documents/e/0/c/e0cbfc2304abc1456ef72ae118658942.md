Acute nickel inhalation sequelae include pneumonitis, myocarditis, altered mental status, and profound weakness. Symptoms may remain for several months after the initial evaluation and management. Chronic inhalational exposure can lead to cancer within the respiratory tract, emphysema, and pulmonary eosinophilia, requiring further management and monitoring.

In 1990, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified all nickel compounds, except metallic nickel, as carcinogenic to humans.
