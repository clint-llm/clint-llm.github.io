The exact mechanism of tumor spread is still unknown. The tumor is thought to spread via 1 of the three mechanisms:

- The lymphatic system

- The hematogenous system

- The transcoelomic pathway

Hematogenous and lymphatic pathway means the tumor spreads through blood vessels or lymphatic channels. The transcoelomic pathway means the actual cancer cells directly spread through the abdominal route to adjacent organs. Given the tumor is diagnosed at an advanced age, it is believed that the tumor metastasizes through mixed pathways. Although the lymphatic route is favored over the vascular and, lastly, peritoneal.

The lymphatic route is believed to be the most likely route of cancer spread with several supporting evidence:

- Microscopically, the hilum and cortex have demonstrated lymphatic permeation.

- Many cases have been reported where the primary tumor is confined to mucosa and submucosa. Given the rich lymphatic network in the gastrointestinal mucosa and submucosa, the only logical explanation is that the tumor spread through this pathway.

- The risk of metastasis is higher with an increased number of positive metastatic lymph nodes.

- Lack of involvement of the peritoneum without any evidence of seedings, adhesion, or tumor infiltrates favors other pathways as opposed to the transcoelomic route.
