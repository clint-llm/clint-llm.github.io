Throughout pregnancy, it is typical for a patient to undergo changes in various organ systems, such as cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, and more, in response to a growing fetus. Factors that lead to changes in these organ systems include, but are not limited to, changes in hormone levels, fetus size, and the physiologic requirements of the gravida and fetus, with the majority of physiologic changes returning to normal in the postpartum period. It should be noted that many of these changes are more pronounced in multiparous patients. This article will discuss the various physiologic changes in the gravida associated with each organ system and the clinical significance of these changes.
