Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are the most commonly indicated medications in the treatment of cardiovascular and renal diseases, including heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, diabetes, and hypertension.

**Hypertension**

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors effectively lower the mean arterial blood pressure as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure both in hypertensive and normotensive subjects.

**Heart Failure**

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) improve heart failure by decreasing afterload, preload, and systolic wall stress, which results in increased cardiac output without any increase in heart rate.

**Post Myocardial Infarction**

Over the last few decades, several prospective, randomized trials have studied the effect of ACE inhibitors on mortality after myocardial infarction (MI).

**Diabetes**

The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system and increased glomerular capillary pressure have been reported to increase the progression of renal dysfunction due to diabetes mellitus related nephropathy.

**Nephrotic Syndrome or Proteinuria**

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been reported to decrease glomerular capillary pressure by decreasing arterial pressure and selectively dilating efferent arterioles.

**Chronic Kidney Disease**

ACE inhibitors or ARBs are the first-line drugs in managing chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. The use of ACEI or ARB has been proven to have a superior effect compared to placebo treatment on decreasing proteinuria and slowing kidney disease progression. The efficacy of ACEI and ARB is comparable.

**Glomerular Disease and Post-transplant Glomerulonephritis**\

The use of ACE inhibitors or ARB is the mainstay of treatment in patients with glomerular diseases. It slows down the decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria.
