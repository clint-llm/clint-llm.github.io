Pilomatrixoma, or calcifying epithelioma of Malherbe, are benign tumors of the hair follicle matrix. Most healthcare professionals usually will not encounter this lesion but they need to know when to refer the patient to the dermatologist. These tumor cells can differentiate into hair matrix, hair cortex, follicular infundibulum, outer root sheath, and hair bulge. It commonly occurs in the pediatric patient on the hair-bearing areas of the head and neck but can also involve the extremities and trunk. On the head, the preauricular region is most commonly involved. The tumors only occur in hair-bearing areas. Case studies report the tumor occurring in other areas of the body including the periocular and on the scrotum and vulva. Unless the lesion is symptomatic, no treatment is required. All malignant lesions require excision.
