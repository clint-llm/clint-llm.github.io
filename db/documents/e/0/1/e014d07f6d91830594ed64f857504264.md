Each red blood cell only lives for about 120 days. In that short time, it must deliver oxygen from the lungs to the peripheral tissues to assist in metabolic processes such as ATP synthesis, and it must collect the generated carbon dioxide from the periphery and return it to the lungs for elimination from the body. The deoxygenated blood that arrives at the lungs contains hemoglobin with ferrous heme (Fe) with an affinity for oxygen. Upon arrival to the deoxygenated tissues, the decreased partial pressure of oxygen and low pH cause the heme to lose its affinity for the oxygen, delivering it to the tissue. Carbon dioxide is then taken into the cell and combined with water to form bicarbonate and hydrogen via carbonic anhydrase. Most of the carbon dioxide will travel back to the lungs in the form of bicarbonate and be exhaled.
