High grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) encompasses the entities previously termed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)2, CIN3, moderate and severe dysplasia and carcinoma in situ. HSIL is a squamous cell abnormality associated with human papillomavirus (HPV). Though not all HSIL will progress to cancer, HSIL is considered to be a precancerous lesion and therefore is usually treated aggressively. This activity reviews the evaluation of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and the role of the interprofessional team in managing this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the cause of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.
- Describe the histologic criteria for high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.
- Summarize the treatment of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.
- Explain the key role that the interprofessional team plays in communicating and collaborating to facilitate prompt evaluation and management of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and thereby enhance outcomes for affected patients.
