Nipah virus infection is a highly lethal infection that adequate preventive measures can prevent. The diagnosis may be made based on RT-PCR in the clinical context of encephalitis or an ARDS-like picture. There are no effective treatment options available at present. Nipah virus has pandemic potential, and further research is warranted into its epidemiology and therapeutic options.
