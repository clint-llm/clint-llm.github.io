Other diseases of choroid and retina can closely mimic CSCR. They are ARMD (age-related macular degeneration), IPCV, and optic disc pit associated maculopathy. ARMD is seen in patients above 50 years. Chronic CSCR can develop secondary CNVM on follow up or after laser photocoagulation.

OCT angiography is helpful in delineating the neovascular complex of ARMD. EDI OCT shows thicker choroid in CSCR and thin to normal choroid in ARMD. IPCV produces serous macular detachment and RPE changes similar to CSCR. The polyp and branching vascular network are characteristic findings on ICGA. OCT typically shows serosanguinous or notched PED.

Optic disc pit causes serous macular detachment at the macula. On careful slit-lamp biomicroscopy, focal excavation can be seen on the temporal part of the optic disc. Retinal schisis is commonly observed in optic disc pit, while these changes are infrequently seen only in chronic CSCR. The sub-internal limiting membrane cavity after the resolution of sub-internal limiting membrane hemorrhage (including after Valsalva retinopathy) may simulate CSCR on cursory examination.
