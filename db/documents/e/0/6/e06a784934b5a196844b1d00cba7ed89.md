The differential diagnoses are other mature T-cell malignancies, including peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), mycosis fungoides and SÃ©zary syndrome. In some cases, the presence of Reed Sternberg-like cells (RS) in peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) may lead to a misdiagnosis of lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma.
