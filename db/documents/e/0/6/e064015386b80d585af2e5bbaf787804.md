Educating the patient about the nature of the disease and its consequences is essential in the management plan, avoid wearing tight collar clothing and minimizing pressure application near the sinus node (i.e., while shaving) is helpful.

It is also mandatory to avoid actions that need full consciousness (driving, running heavy machinery, and performing sea activities i.e., diving or swimming). For driving, it depends on each state's laws, and physicians must report concerning these laws. However, the patient can retain these activities if proper treatment is achieved (pacemaker placement which can eliminate the cardioinhibitoryÂ CSH subtype, in this case, the patient can drive after one week of the pacemaker placement), for the vasodepressor subtype stabilizing the blood pressure might help in returning to the previous activities.
