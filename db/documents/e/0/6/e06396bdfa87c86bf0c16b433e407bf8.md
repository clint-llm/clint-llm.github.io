Due to the underlying etiology of shoulder impingement syndrome, complications that may arise predominantly result from structural damage within the subacromial space, altered biomechanics, or avoidance of use with subsequent atrophy. Potential pathologies that may result include rotator cuff tendonitis or tear, bicipital tendonitis or tear, or adhesive capsulitis.
