Epstein Barr virus is a herpesvirus with double-stranded DNA enclosed by proteins. The envelope of the virus has glycoproteins, which are important for attachment and entry into the host cells (B cells and epithelial cells). EBV targets B cells by utilizing their molecular machinery to replicate the viral genome. The virus causes B cells to differentiate into memory B cells, which then can move into the circulatory system, or become latent until a trigger causes reactivation.

The transmission of the Epstein Barr virus occurs in several ways, such as deep kissing or food-sharing. Increased levels of viral DNA are found in salivary secretions after the initial infection. Children can be infected after eating food that has already been chewed by an EBV infected individual.
