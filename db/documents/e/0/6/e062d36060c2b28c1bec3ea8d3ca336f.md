Ornithine transcarbamylase is an enzyme in the urea cycle, and lack of it can lead to toxic levels of ammonia.  Although OTC deficiency is the most common of the urea cycle disorders, it is a rare disease. Signs and symptoms of OTC deficiency present earlier in males since the genetic code for this enzyme is on the X-chromosome. Symptoms are variable, initially vague, and present later in life for females. Early recognition and treatment can prevent severe or lethal outcomes.
