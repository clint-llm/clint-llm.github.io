Furosemide is a loop diuretic that has been in use for decades. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved furosemide to treat conditions with volume overload and edema secondary to congestive heart failure exacerbation, liver failure, or renal failure, including the nephrotic syndrome. However, clinicians must be aware of updates related to the indications and administration of furosemide to ensure safe practices and minimize adverse effects. This activity reviews updates on the recommended use of furosemide, the mechanism of action, indications, contraindications, adverse effects, toxicity, and other key factors (e.g., off-label uses, dosing, pharmacokinetics, monitoring, relevant interactions) profile. It highlights the interprofessional team's role in caring for patients on furosemide therapy.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of furosemide.
- Describe the contraindications to the use of furosemide.
- Outline the monitoring necessary for patients on furosemide.
- Explain how healthy collaboration and communication between interprofessional team members can optimize the use of furosemide and minimize adverse effects, thereby improving patient outcomes.
