When it comes to foreign body detection, plain film radiography is the initial imaging modality of choice due to its ability to detect most foreign bodies quickly and cheaply with relatively low radiation exposure. Objects denser than soft tissue will absorb more rays, and therefore, appear in greater contrast to the surrounding areas. Due to increased density objects such as metal, glass, and gravel are considered radiopaque, and multi-view, X-ray imaging is highly sensitive and specific when looking for these objects in soft tissues. However, gravel and graphite in or near bone may be difficult to identify due to the objects having a similar density as the bone. Radiography is also less effective for identifying radiolucent objects such as wood, plastic, and organics (such as thorns or spines) in soft tissue due to matching densities. One case review found physicians missed 75 out of 200 foreign bodies, of which 58 were radiolucent. The objectâ€™s size also limits radiographic accuracy, and glass, in particular, becomes difficult to locate when under 1 mm. If clinical suspicion remains high despite negative, plain film radiography, other modalities should merit consideration.
