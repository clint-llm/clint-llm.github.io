A study of workers in a beryllium facility found that people developed CBD when exposed to above 0.2 mcg/m3

The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) in 2005 issued a recommendation to reduce the threshold limit value (TLV) by 100 fold from 2 to 0.02 mcg/m3 over a 15 minute period. Although ACGIH carries no legal force as OSHA does, it is important to note the recommendation. Beryllium exposure is difficult to control in an industrial work environment, so methods that reduce the possibility of airborne and surface contamination are needed. These include minimal use of beryllium and beryllium-containing alloys and employee education about the possible hazards when the dust or fumes of beryllium are encountered in the workplace.
