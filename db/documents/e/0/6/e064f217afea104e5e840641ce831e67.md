Orbital vascular anomalies (OVAs) account for approximately 10% of all orbital pathologies.

The rationale behind the existing gender-specific differences amongst the vascular anomalies is unclear. For example, infantile hemangioma (IH) is five times more common in females than males, whereas congenital hemangioma (CH) affects both genders equally. Prematurity, low birth weight, and positive family history are the other predisposing factors of IH.

Cavernous venous malformations (CVMs), the most common orbital benign lesions of adulthood, are more frequently seen in middle-aged females (20Â to 40 years). On the other hand, distensible orbital venous malformations do not have any gender predilection.
