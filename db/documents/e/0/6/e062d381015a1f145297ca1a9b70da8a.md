Radiation esophagitis may develop in the acute stage of therapy or the chronic stage of therapy. Patients with severe esophagitis are at a higher risk of developing long-term complications, and clinicians must be able to recognize severe life-threatening complications such as ulcerations, perforations, fistula, and strictures. Additionally, cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis must be ruled out in these patients.
