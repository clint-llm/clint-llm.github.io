The main function of the SA node is to act as the normal pacemaker of the heart. It initiates an action potential that results in an electrical impulse traveling through the heartâ€™s electrical conduction system to cause myocardial contraction. Unlike atrial and ventricular cells, pacemaker cells in the sinus node do not have a resting phase. Instead, these cells have pacemaker potential, in which they begin to depolarize automatically after an action potential ends.

Sinus node dysfunction can result from ischemia or necrosis of pacemaker cells due to a decrease in arterial blood secondary to worsening coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction. In such cases, the SA node will not function properly and can result in a condition known as sick sinus syndrome. Without normal sinus node function or blockage of the sinus node impulse, other myocytes with automaticity, or an ectopic focus, will become the new pacemaker.
