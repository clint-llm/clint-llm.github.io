**Hyper-coagulation.**The hemostatic cascade is meant to control hemorrhage and be a protective mechanism. At times, this process is triggered inadvertently while the blood is within the lumen of the blood vessel and without any bleeding.

**Hypo-coagulation.**When there is any defect in the functionality of any component of this hemostatic cascade, it can lead to ineffective hemostasis and inability to control hemorrhage; this can lead to severe blood loss, hemorrhage and also complications that can hence ensue due to the inhibited blood supply to vital organs. Some of the examples include Von Willebrand disease, hemophilia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, deficiency of the clotting factors, platelet disorders, collagen vascular disorders, etc.

**Iatrogenic Coagulopathy.**Medicine is currently in the era of widespread use of antiplatelet agents like aspirin, clopidogrel, ticagrelor and anticoagulants like warfarin, heparin, low molecular weight heparin, rivaroxaban, apixaban, dabigatran, fondaparinux amongst others for various commonly encountered clinical conditions like cardiac stenting/ percutaneous coronary intervention, atrial fibrillation, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and many more. The way these medications affect the functionality of the various components of clotting cascade can help patients with their clinical conditions. However, it can lead to bleeding/thrombosis in cases of inappropriate dosage, non-compliance, medication interactions, and result in significant morbidity and mortality.
