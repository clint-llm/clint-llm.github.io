In many societies, formula feeding is becoming more prominent, and breast milk has become the least preferred choice.

It is important to note that breast milk is not sufficient and nutritional supplementation is sometimes needed for low birth weight and preterm infants as elaborated below:

- VLBW infants require vitamin D supplements at a dose ranging from 400 IU to 1000 IU per day until 6 months of age.

- VLBW infants who are fed breast milk require daily calcium (120–140 mg/kg per day) and phosphorus (60–90 mg/kg per day) supplementation during the first month of life.

- VLBW infants who are fed breast milk require 2–4 mg/kg per day iron supplementation initiating at 2 weeks until 6 months of age.

- Infants born before 35 weeks gestation and are fed breast milk require iron supplementation of 0.2 mL/kg per dose 12-hourly starting at four weeks of life until six months of age.

- An infant born at less than 37 weeks requires Vitamine D supplementation(OsteVit-D) of 0.1 mL daily until 12 months of age.

The World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend pasteurized human donor milk for preterm infants if the mother's breast milk has not 'come in'. In the case of anemia, the infant can have direct iron supplementation, or the mother's diet can be fortified with iron-rich foods.
