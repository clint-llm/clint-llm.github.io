Echocardiographic hemodynamic parameter determination is a crucial step in valvular disease diagnosis and severity determination. Echocardiography can further be utilized to determine the various hemodynamic principles and their link to basic fluid mechanics principles. This activity reviews the basic hemodynamics of echocardiography and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with various cardiac pathologies, most notably valvular defects.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the basic hemodynamic parameters used in echocardiography.
- Describe the appropriate echocardiographic methods for the assessment of hemodynamics. 
- Understand basic concepts of cardiac valvular function and flow dynamics.
- Discuss the interprofessional team strategies used to improve patient care with the use of echocardiographic hemodynamic assessment.
