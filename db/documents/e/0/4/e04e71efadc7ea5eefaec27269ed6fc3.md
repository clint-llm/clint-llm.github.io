Important methods of evaluation include radiographic methods such as CT, ultrasound, and MRI. These can indicate which structures within the body the mass arises and give a picture of the complexity of the mass and its relationship to surrounding structures. If a pleural effusion is present, aspiration of the fluid with chemical, microbiological, and cytopathologic analysis is vital to consider. These studies can lend diagnostic clues as to the cause of the effusion. Ultimately, resection of the mass will need to undergo gross and histopathologic examination for definitive diagnosis. Molecular analysis is also becoming increasingly useful to guide the diagnosis.
