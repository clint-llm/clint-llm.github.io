The underlying defect is a mutation in the LYST or the CHS1 gene. This gene is responsible for the regulation of lysosomal trafficking and the synthesis, fusion, and transport of cytoplasmic granules. It is located on the long arm of chromosome 1 [1q42-43]. Around 40 different mutations have been discovered, including nonsense and missense mutations and deletions and insertions.
