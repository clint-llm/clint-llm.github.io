Post-acute coronary syndrome patients are strongly encouraged to participate in cardiac rehabilitation. Patients should undergo functional testing before starting a supervised exercise program. Patients are often seen as an outpatient 4 to 6 weeks post ACS for further assessment and risk stratification, primarily with a functional assessment with an exercise stress test, before resuming normal activity without restrictions. Additionally, on occasions, patients are further assessed with vasodilator myocardial perfusion imaging before initial hospital discharge to evaluate the need for complete revascularization if diffuse disease was present on target vessel revascularization.
