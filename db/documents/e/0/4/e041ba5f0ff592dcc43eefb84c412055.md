The prognosis for patients with traumatic facial paralysis depends entirely on the severity of the injury and, for severe injuries, the effectiveness of the repair. Because of the wide array of traumatic etiologies of facial paralysis, providing objective estimates of functional recovery is challenging due to the small sample sizes reported in the literature. Nevertheless, results of timely nerve repair are encouraging, with a 2013 study indicating that most patients will recover at least 90% of their smile symmetry, 60% will recover eye closure without requiring eyelid weight placement, and 40% will recover brow elevation.

Several authors report that patients with incomplete paralysis from temporal bone fractures have a 100% chance of recovery to normal. Patients with delayed but complete paralysis have nearly as good a prognosis.

Patients who suffer transection injuries to the main trunk of the facial nerve but do not undergo repair are likely to persist with House-Brackmann grade VI flaccid paralysis in the long term. When the injury in question occurs in a distal branch of the facial nerve rather than in the main trunk, the prognosis is better because the functional deficit is less significant, as is the potential for developing synkinesis. For very distal injuries occurring medial to the lateral canthus of the eye, the likelihood of good recovery is high because of the extensive network of redundant small nerve fibers in that region. Ultimately, regardless of whether operative management is required or not, patients and physicians alike must exercise patience because recovery from nerve injury is slow due to the axonal regrowth rate of approximately 1 mm/day, and the results of a nerve repair or even spontaneous recovery are often not apparent for 6Â to 12 months.
