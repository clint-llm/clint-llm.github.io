Overdose with acarbose will not cause hypoglycemia but may increase GI adverse effects. Patients should not have food or beverages that contain carbohydrates for 4 to 6 hours if an overdose occurs.

If a patient experiences hypoglycemia while taking acarbose in combination with other antidiabetic medications, the patient should receive instructions to use glucose (gel, tablets, etc.) as acarbose will prevent the breakdown of sucrose (table sugar) and delay glucose absorption; therefore, failing to correct hypoglycemia quickly. Severe hypoglycemia may require intravenous glucose or intramuscular glucagon administration.
