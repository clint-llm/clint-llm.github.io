When there is a transfusion reaction with acute dyspnea from respiratory distress, acute pulmonary edema with diffuse bilateral infiltrates in the chest x-ray, transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) is in the differential diagnosis. TACO is also a clinical diagnosis with similar clinical pictures as TRALI. However, there are distinct features that separate two syndromes. TACO can present with fever and hypotension. Even though normal fluid balance does not rule out TACO, it can happen to patients who have high fluid intake before the transfusion. Due to volume overload, patients with TACO can have distended neck veins and already reduced ejection fraction (EF) from heart failure with reduced EF. Pulmonary artery occlusion pressures could be 18 mmHg or greater, secondary to cardiogenic pulmonary edema with elevated brain natriuretic peptide. Because of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, TACO has transudate fluids which are low in plasma proteins.
