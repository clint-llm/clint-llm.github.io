Wound healing has three overlapping phases which are inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling.

**Inflammation**

This phase includes hemostasis and inflammation. An injury to the skin immediately initiates clotting cascades which provide a temporary fibrin blood clot plug to the injury site.

Neutrophils are recruited to the wounded area within the first 24 hours and stay for 2 to 5 days.

**Proliferation**

The following proliferative phase is characterized by granulation tissue formation and vascular network restoration.

On the other hand, epithelization also begins after wounding which is stimulated by inflammatory cytokines and different growth factors.

The last step of the proliferation phase is the granulation tissue formation.

**Remodeling**

Remodeling is the last phase of the wound healing, begins from day 21 and continues up to 1 year.

Additionally, wound contraction begins. TGF-beta1 stimulates the fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts.

Finally, angiogenic responses cease, the blood flow diminishes. Acute metabolic activity in the wound ends. These processes provide a full closure for injured tissue sites and restoration of the mechanical strength of the wound.
