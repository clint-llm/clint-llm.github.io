Electron microscopy (EM) has been widely used for diagnosing many common and uncommon diseases in nephrology, including minimal change disease, hereditary nephritis, fibrillary glomerulonephritis, and certain classes of lupus nephritis. This is one of the few medical disciplines in which EM has an active role in clinical practice, and findings from EM are necessary to make the final diagnosis. Therefore, it is generally recommended for renal biopsies to preserve a piece of specimen in an appropriate fixative for EM examination.
