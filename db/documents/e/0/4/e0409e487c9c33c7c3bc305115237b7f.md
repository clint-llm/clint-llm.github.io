Hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola has no known etiology. However, some reported cases seem drug-induced, especially due to estrogens (for prostatic cancer), spironolactone, and certain anticancer medications, such as vemurafenib. No viral DNA is found within skin lesions of hyperkeratosis of the nipple and areola.
