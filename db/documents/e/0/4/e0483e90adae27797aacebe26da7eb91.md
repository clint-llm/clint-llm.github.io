GLP-1 receptor agonists are an effective therapeutic choice for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. There is robust evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses that show that GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce HbA1c levels, aid weight loss, and improve cardiovascular outcomes.

An interprofessional team comprised of a primary care physician, an endocrinologist, a pharmacist, a diabetes educator, nursing staff, and a dietician should be utilized when treating T2DM and obese patients with a GLP-1 receptor agonist. Communication between these healthcare providers is the utmost priority. After reviewing the medication reconciliation and laboratory results, they should use a patient-centered holistic, interprofessional approach regarding who would benefit from a GLP-1 receptor agonist and work as a team in monitoring therapy to optimize patient outcomes.

The use of GLP-1 receptor agonists may be limited due to their gastrointestinal side effects, subcutaneous injection route of administration, and cost. Education should be provided by nurses and clinicians by demonstrating how to administer the drug properly and safely. This will help with compliance rates and adherence to the regimen and overall improve patient satisfaction. Pharmacists can contribute by counseling patients on adverse effects, monitoring parameters, appropriate usage, drug interactions, and therapy goals with GLP-1 analogs, and advising them to report any concerns to the office. Pharmacists can also assist in navigating insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs to arrive at the optimal agent and means of access, which can be facilitated by working with patient assistance programs, especially for patients for whom medication cost is a major concern.

If a patient is experiencing gastrointestinal adverse effects following dose titration, the patient should be asked to verify the dose and the time of symptom onset.

Routine follow-ups should be instituted by the healthcare practice for monitoring weight, kidney function, complete blood count, and blood glucose levels. A diabetic educator and a dietician can stress the addition of diet and exercise while taking this medication for maximum treatment benefit. Dieticians also play a pivotal role by recommending smaller meals, eating more slowly, and avoiding fatty foods.Cost can be a major barrier as these medications are expensive. A discussion should be initiated between patient and physician to discuss cost-effectiveness and provide financial assistance if needed. A comprehensive interprofessional healthcare team can improve outcomes and quality of life for patients with type 2 diabetes. It can minimize adverse events, and it is important to support these patients to reach their personalized treatment goals to benefit their health. [Level 5]

The comparison of GLP-1 receptor agonists has demonstrated that all of them effectively reduce HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, the agents vary within the class based on efficacy, safety, adverse effect profile, cardiovascular and renal effects, adherence, and persistence. When selecting a GLP-1 receptor agonist for a patient, a multidisciplinary healthcare team must consider all the clinical evidence available, as well as individual patient factors like preference, cost, accessibility, and convenience.

Regarding the greatest reduction of HbA1c, long-acting agents seem superior to short-acting agents, with semaglutide having the greatest reduction. The least reduction was with exenatide extended-release. However, it was still more effective at lowering the HbA1C than short-acting agents. For weight loss, the long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists produced more significant weight loss than the short-acting formulations. Semaglutide was noted to cause the greatest weight reduction. The most gastrointestinal adverse effects were seen with short-acting agents and subcutaneous semaglutide, and the least side effects were seen with exenatide ER.

Patient satisfaction, adherence, and persistence were seen more with long-acting agents, likely due to their less frequent dosing of once-weekly injections compared to once-daily or twice-daily of the short-acting agents. All of these comparative factors should play an integral role in the healthcare provider’s decision to choose a GLP-1 receptor agonist.
