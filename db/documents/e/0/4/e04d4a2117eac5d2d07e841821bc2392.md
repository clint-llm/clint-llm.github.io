The clinician must always approach a new breast mass from an interprofessional approach as the causes are diverse, and such a variety of teams carry out the investigations and treatments. The links between primary care and specialty and subspecialty teams must be clearly defined, with an established protocol for clear and effective communication between the two.

A triple assessment clinic is an excellent example of a multidisciplinary clinic, as physicians or specialist nurses, clinical pathologists and radiographers, sonographers, and radiologists are involved in the process. In this setting, interprofessional communication is not just encouraged but necessary to reach a consensus on the most likely diagnosis.

In breast cancer, multidisciplinary or interprofessional care is the gold standard. It has proven to significantly reduce mortality from breast cancer and all causes over a 5-year period.
