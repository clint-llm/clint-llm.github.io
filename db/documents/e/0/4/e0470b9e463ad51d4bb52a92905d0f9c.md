An aortoenteric fistula develops when part of the aortic wall erodes into the adjacent intestinal tract. When communication forms, massive volumes of blood can travel into the GI system leading to hypotension, vomiting of blood, shock, and death. Treatment may be performed through a large open incision in the abdomen with the direct repair of this fistulous tract or endoscopically. An endograft is used to cover the defect in the aortic wall. Regardless of the repair employed, AEFs carry a high degree of mortality, with many patients dying before they are ever diagnosed.

A one-time screening ultrasound of the abdominal aorta should be performed on all males aged 65 to 75 who have ever smoked in their lives to rule out the presence of an AAA. Those patients with a history of aortic repair or other prior aortic pathology must undergo regular screening appointments with their vascular surgeon and primary care physician.
