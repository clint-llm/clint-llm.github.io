It is vital to consider nerve compressive syndromes that occur proximal to the level of the hand and wrist. Additionally, consideration for local anatomic factors is necessary. General considerations are listed below along with differentials specific to each syndrome discussed

**Carpal Tunnel Syndrome:**

- Anterior interosseous compressive neuropathy

- Flexor tendonitis

- Pronator syndrome

- Wrist osteoarthritis

**General considerations:**

- Brachial plexopathy

- Cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy

- Compartment syndrome

- Fibromyalgia

- Motor neuron disease, e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis

- Thoracic outlet syndrome

- Vasculitis and Raynaud phenomenon

- Vitamin deficiency

**Ulnar Tunnel Syndrome:**

- Cubital tunnel syndrome

- Extensor carpi ulnaris tendonitis

- The hook of hamate fracture

- The triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear

**Wartenberg’s syndrome**

- De Quervain tenosynovitis

- Intersection syndrome

- Lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve neuritis
