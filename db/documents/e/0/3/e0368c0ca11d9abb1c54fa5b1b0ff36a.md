The workup for hypertensive heart disease should focus on evaluating for possible end-organ damage, assessing for other cardiovascular risk factors, and evaluating for possible secondary causes of hypertension if suggested by clinical features or physical exam. Patients should undergo evaluation for the presence of renal disease with baseline creatinine, diabetes, and glycemic control, hyperlipidemia, pulmonary disease, and other comorbid conditions. Obese male patients are at high risk for sleep apnea and should be screened using STOP-BANG and referred for evaluation of sleep apnea if warranted. All patients should be assessed with a 10-year cardiovascular risk calculator to calculate their cardiovascular risk and determine the level of intervention needed.

- EKG is the recommendation for initial evaluation of hypertensive heart disease - it may demonstrate ventricular hypertrophy, left axis deviation, or conduction abnormalities

- EKGs have high specificity (75 to 95%) but low sensitivity (25 to 61%)

- Basic metabolic panel - sodium, potassium, calcium, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine

- Lipid Panel

- CBC

- Urinalysis with consideration for checking the urine protein albumin ratio

- TSH especially in the setting of atrial fibrillation

An echocardiogram is not recommended for the routine evaluation of hypertension as the presence of LVH does not change management. An echocardiogram should be considered in patients presenting with symptoms of heart failure, evaluation of young patients under 18, or patients presenting with chronic, uncontrolled hypertension.
