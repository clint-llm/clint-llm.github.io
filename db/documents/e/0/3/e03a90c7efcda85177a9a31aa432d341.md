The disease typically is delayed 6 to 8 weeks after Group A B-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. It does not occur after skin infections. SD is more prevalent in females than males (3:1). It is largely a childhood disease with most affected patients between the ages of five and 18 years. It is almost never reported in children less than five years old, and the peak age is eight to nine years old. Adult onset of SD is uncommon, and most adult cases usually are secondary to recurrence following childhood illness. The incidence is higher in developing countries due to beta-hemolytic streptococci infection and inadequate treatment of streptococci infection which is exacerbated by overcrowding and poor hygienic conditions. Chorea gravidarum (CG) is a pregnancy-related variant. Most cases are a recurrence of SD and are considered due to the hormonal changes of pregnancy, but it also can be precipitated by the use of oral contraceptives. Symptoms often resolve quickly immediately after delivery.
