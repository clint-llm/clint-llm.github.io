The release of aldosterone from the adrenal glands is regulated via the renin-angiotensin II-aldosterone system. This system is initially activated via a decrease in the mean arterial blood pressure to increase the blood pressure. The decrease in blood pressure is initially sensed within the afferent arterioles of the kidney. Prorenin is then released by mechanoreceptors and is converted to renin by the juxtaglomerular cells (JG cells). The JG cells can also release renin after sympathetic stimulation of their beta one receptor. Renin is the enzyme that converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I then is converted to angiotensin II in the lungs and kidneys by angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE). Angiotensin II is an octapeptide that is activated by type-1, G protein-coupled angiotensin II receptors. These receptors have different functions depending on the types of cells that contain the receptor. However, it has five primary functions that include: increasing aldosterone, increasing sodium-hydrogen exchange within the proximal renal tubule, increasing thirst drive within the hypothalamus, increasing antidiuretic hormone, and acting on G protein-coupled receptors that activate IP3/Ca2+ second messenger systems within arterioles to cause vasoconstriction. Aldosterone then undergoes its actions within the kidney.
