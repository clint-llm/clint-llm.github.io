The primary issue of concern regarding the DNA structure is variations and mutations in DNA structure as proteins encoded by the mutated DNA generally have altered structure and function, adversely impacting the survival of the cell or organism. Mutations in DNA structure can take many forms, such as large or small insertions or deletions of base pairs or inversions and insertions of whole DNA segments between or within chromosomes.
