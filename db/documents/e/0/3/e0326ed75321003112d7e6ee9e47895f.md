Suctioning is a lifesaving procedure requiring timely and precise methodology. If done appropriately with caution, it decreases the risk of infection, pooling of secretions, and prolonged hypoxia.

Suctioning of the airways should be performed by skilled personnel with appropriate preparation. Suctioning has both therapeutic and diagnostic benefits. It is important to gather appropriate equipment prior to suctioning and have adequate knowledge of the airway anatomy, the airway adjuncts in use, and the equipment available.

Suctioning of the airway should be performed with adequate care to avoid injuries, trauma, bleeding, prolonged hypoxia, and bradycardia. Preparation is the key, and the personnel should be aware of the complications and corrective measures. Suction, oxygen, pharmacy, equipment, and adequate medications are absolute prerequisites to obtaining and maintaining a successful patent airway.
