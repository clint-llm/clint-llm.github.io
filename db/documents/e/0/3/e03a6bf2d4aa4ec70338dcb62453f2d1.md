Blood supply to the palmar interossei comes from the palmar metacarpal arteries and drains into the palmar metacarpal veins. The palmar metacarpal arteries derive from the deep palmar arch, which is comprised of the terminal portion of the radial artery and the deep branch of the ulnar artery. Furthermore, anastomosesÂ are present between the palmar metacarpal arteries and the common palmar digital arteries that stem from the superficial palmar arch.

The first dorsal interosseous muscle is supplied by the first dorsal metacarpal artery, which arises directly from the radial artery. The second, third, and fourth dorsal interossei receive blood supply from the second, third, and fourth dorsal metacarpal arteries; these vessels arise from the dorsal carpal arch. All dorsal metacarpal arteries bifurcate into their respective dorsal digital arteries and anastomose with the common palmar digital arteries.

Lymphatic drainage of the upper limbs is divided into superficial and deep lymphatic drainage. Lymphatic plexuses of the skin of the palm and dorsum of the hand ascend with the cephalic and basilic veins towards the axillary and cubital lymph nodes, respectively. Deep lymphatic vessels follow the primary deep veins and eventually terminate in the humeral lymph nodes.
