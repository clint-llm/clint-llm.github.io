Further research is required to elucidate the actual mechanism of arcus formation; the current theories are fairly unsubstantiated, and more research could be done to elucidate the relationship between arcus and systemic diseases further. The relationship between underlying lipid disease and arcus should be further elucidated to make further recommendations. The relationship between unilateral arcus and carotid vascular disease should also be studied further.
