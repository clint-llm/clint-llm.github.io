As they are the most common surface receptors, it is understandable that they are involved in a wide variety of physiological roles. GPCRs are involved in sight, taste, smell, behavioral, and mood regulation, and regulation of the immune system. Even though the signaling molecules, types of GPCR, and mechanisms of action may be different for all these roles, all of them involve certain extracellular signals that are converted into a cellular response. For example, mood regulation is affected by GPCRs because these receptors in the mammalian brain can bind to different neurotransmitters and create different physiological responses. Some of the molecules that can bind to GPCRs in the brain and lead to different moods are dopamine, serotonin, and GABA.
