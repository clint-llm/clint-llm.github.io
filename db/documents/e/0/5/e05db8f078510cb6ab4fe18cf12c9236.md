**Simple Allergic Conjunctivitis:**Most cases are secondary to simple allergen exposure on the ocular surface.

**Vernal Keratoconjunctivitis:**Exact etiology is not well understood, but some combination of climateÂ and allergen is believed to be responsible.

**Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis:**Etiology is not clear but appears to be a combination of allergen exposure, atopic dermatitis (more than 90% of cases), and\or genetic predisposition.

**Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis:**Allergen exposure and subsequent response secondary to the ocular foreign body either harboring allergens on its surface or injuring ocular structures that facilitate allergen infiltration. It can be seen with many different ocular foreign bodies (e.g., contact lenses, prostheses, cyanoacrylate glue, sutures).
