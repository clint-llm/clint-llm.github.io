The patient may recall trauma to the finger, but often no inciting source is identified.Â  The patient may describe that they first noticed erythema of the finger tip, which later became edematous and painful. The pain may be mild at first but rapidly progress to severe and throbbing.

The presenting symptoms include tissue tension, throbbing pain, edema, and erythema of the fingertip pulp at the distal phalanx. Typically, the edema will not extend proximally to the distal phalanx due to the compartments defined by the septae. The pain is often severe and worse in the dependent position. Spontaneous drainage may occur due to the pressure in the fingertip which may result in temporary relief. However, if not properly incised and drained, the abscess will reform.
