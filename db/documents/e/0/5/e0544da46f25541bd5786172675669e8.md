Nurses in various settings are in a unique position to discuss tobacco use with patients. Preventing children and adolescents from initial tobacco use is imperitive.  Admission assessments include assessment of tobacco use; and every smoker should be asked if they wish to quit, then referred to services to aid in cessation.  Apps and quitlines should be encouraged.   Nurses should practice health education with every encounter with each tobacco user, discussing health implications and aids to assist in cessation.
