Histologically, IBM is characterized by atrophic muscle fibers, infiltration of non-necrotic myofibers by mononuclear cells in an endomysial and perivascular pattern, rimmed vacuoles, and congophilic inclusions that may be intravacuolar or extravacuolar.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I is upregulated on immunostaining.

Rimmed vacuoles which are vacuolar degeneration stained positive by Gomori Trichrome stain are the hallmark histological feature of IBM. Cytoplasmic inclusions of beta-amyloid are visualized using Congo red and polarised light. Tubulofilamnetous inclusions seen by electron microscopy is also a feature of IBM. Increased number of cytochrome c oxidase negative fibers is also observed in a large number of IBM patients.
