The rupture of an intracerebral aneurysm most commonly causes subarachnoid hemorrhage. The incidence of SAH is anywhere from 9 to 15 people per 100,000 in the United States with rates that vary by geography. Risk factors include hypertension, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, some sympathomimetic drugs, and some genetic causes that increase the risk of a cerebral aneurysm.
