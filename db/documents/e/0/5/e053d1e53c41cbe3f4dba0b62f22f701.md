The****stylohyoid muscle (musculus stylohyoideus in Latin) is one of the suprahyoid muscles of the neck that stretches between the base of the skull and the hyoid bone. The stylohyoid is paired and narrow muscle in close proximity to the digastric muscle, extending along the superior border of its posterior belly.

Despite its narrow shape, the stylohyoid muscle plays a role in various functions. It participates in chewing, swallowing, and phonetics when working with the other suprahyoid muscles (stylohyoid, digastric, mylohyoid, and geniohyoid). It contributes to the fixation of the hyoid bone when working the other suprahyoid and infrahyoid muscles.
