The goal of treatment is to correct the underlying causative pathophysiology. All current treatment strategies are directed toward improving CSF flow dynamics.

In patients with Chiari malformation 1, craniocervical decompression is the best way forward.

In the patients with post-inflammatory arachnoid scarring and post-traumatic syringomyelia, the operative procedure is directed toward reconstituting spinal subarachnoid CSF flow by arachnoid scar membrane resection, microsurgical lysis of arachnoid adherences, and dural reconstruction.

Shunts are indicated for idiopathic syringomyelia and patients that have not responded to other treatment. Most commonly used is syringosubarachnoid shunt (SSAS). If this fails syringoperitoneal shunt (SPS) may be used. While there are studies that claim to have better outcomes with SSAS as compared to foramen magnum decompression,
