Diabetes has become a global health problem. It has been increasing due to sedentary lifestyles and dietary habits. Though food fortification has revolutionized the dietary system, lack of self-care and decreased physical activity have a perversive role in the increase in the prevalence of obesity and associated health concerns. Awareness and health education have an important role in the prevention of obesity and diabetes than just medications alone. People should be encouraged to increase physical activity and consume fresh, balanced nutrition.

Preconception glucose monitoring must be done in every high-risk population. Mothers with pre-existing diabetes should be made aware of the adverse effects of high glucose levels on fetal development. Even mothers without prior diabetes have chances of hyperglycemia during gestation called gestational diabetes. Regular follow-up of pregnancies affected by diabetes is required to closely monitor the fetal status.
