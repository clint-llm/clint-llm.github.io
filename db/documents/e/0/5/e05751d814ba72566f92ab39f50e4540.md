Exenatide is FDA-indicated to improve glycemic control in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when used as an adjunct to diet and exercise. It is not recommended as first-line therapy to treat diabetes. However, clinical trials have shown Exenatide to be both safe and effective when used as monotherapy or in combination with other diabetic medications.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the therapeutic mechanism of action of exenatide.
- Discuss exenatide's place in a diabetic therapy regimen, including administration and dosing options.
- Review the adverse event profile of exenatide.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance diabetes management and improve outcomes using a GLP-1 receptor agonist like exenatide.
