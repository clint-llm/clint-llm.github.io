The etiology of most psychiatric conditions involves various degrees and types of biological, psychological, and social contributors. Although psychological factors particularly impact the development of anxiety disorders, there are multiple biological components to pathological anxiety. The study of inheritance patterns has revealed a general familial aggregation among major anxiety disorders.

Behavioral scientists have contributed significantly to uncovering the psychological mechanisms contributing to anxiety, specifically separation anxiety. Conditioned responses of learned fear are more significant among anxiety-disordered individuals compared to controls, with an explanation of 2 likely mechanisms: first, there is greater excitatory conditioning to danger cues, and second, there is impaired inhibitory conditioning to safety signals.

Attachment theory describes a child's requirement to develop a relationship with a caregiver for normal social and emotional development. In attachment theory, there are 4 main attachment styles: secure attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, disorganized attachment, and anxious-ambivalent attachment. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is the most common attachment style for those with SAD. A common symptom of anxious-ambivalent attachment is anxiety when the caregiver is absent and limited relief when the caregiver reappears.

Evolutionarily, normal separation anxiety likely provided survival benefits given the human species' altriciality.

Parenting behaviors implicate cross-generational influences on the development of childhood anxiety. These parenting behavioral systems include vicarious learning, social referencing, and modeling of parental anxiety. Further, overly protective and overly critical parenting styles, parental response to child anxiety, and family accommodation of a child's anxiety all contribute to the conditioning and development of childhood anxiety.
