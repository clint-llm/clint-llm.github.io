Refractory shock manifests as end-organ dysfunction. The physical exam should focus on assessing the extent of organ dysfunction. The central nervous system manifests as altered sensorium, the cardiovascular system manifests as low blood pressure and pump failure, the kidney manifests as oliguria/anuria, the gut manifests as ileus or ischemia, the respiratory system manifests as hyperventilation/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and skin with a decreased capillary refill.

Delivery of oxygen can be assessed subjectively through dyspnea, capillary refill, mental status (using the Glasgow Coma Scale), and urine output, and objectively through lactate level, mixed venous saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure.
