Twin births account for approximately 3% of live births and 97% of multiple bouts in the United States. In the absence of assisted reproductive technology, dizygotic twins are far more common than monozygotic twins and account for 70% of all twin gestations. Whereas the instance of dizygotic twins is variable in different populations, the prevalence of monozygotic twinning is globally constant at 3 to 5 per thousand births. Except for post-term pregnancy and fetal macrosomia, pregnancy-related risks are exaggerated. Preterm birth is a potential risk associated with twin gestations, with others at risk for fetal growth restriction, congenital anomalies, and abnormal placentation. Other obstetric risks include the increased risk of preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. Twin gestation in itself is not an adequate obstetric diagnosis. The determination of placental chronicity is essential, as monochorionic twin gestations have unique risks associated with them that deserve surveillance.
