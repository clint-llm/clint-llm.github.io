The periodontal ligament (PDL) is the soft tissue connecting the cementum that covers the roots of the teeth to the surrounding alveolar bone. When an external impact occurs on a tooth, the periodontal fibers can tear, allowing partial or total displacement of the tooth from the socket. The ensuing damage can lead to neuro-vascular disruption, as well as pulp necrosis. The maxillary central incisors are the most commonly affected teeth, followed by the maxillary lateral incisors. Often, more than one tooth is avulsed. Periodontal ligament fibers can desiccate rapidly in the open air. Even in a replanted tooth, the damaged periodontal ligament fibers can lead to bony resorption of the root. Root resorption will lead to crown fracture and loss of the tooth.
