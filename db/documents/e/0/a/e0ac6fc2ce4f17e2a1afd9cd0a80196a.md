Ablation procedures have been used to treat chronic back pain and sciatica of unknown etiology as an alternative to surgical severing the dorsal rami. Nerve ablation is a minimally-invasive procedure that involves coagulation necrosis of afferent nociceptive signals via high-frequency waves (300 to 500 Hertz). This activity outlines the ablative nerve block procedure and reviews the relevant anatomy, indications, and contraindications. This activity details the role of the interprofessional team in the ablative nerve block procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for an ablative nerve block.
- Describe the equipment needed to perform an ablative nerve block.
- Outline the potential complications of ablative nerve blocks.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and care delivery for patients undergoing ablative nerve blocks.
