Knowledge of hair follicle structure and the hair cycle is vital in the understanding of hair disorders.

Alopecia has many variants that are categorized as scarring and non-scarring.

Abnormal keratinization causing increased cohesiveness of keratinocytes within the pilosebaceous unit is implicated in both acne vulgaris and keratosis pilaris. Specifically, follicular hyperkeratinization leads to the obstruction of the pilosebaceous unit in acne vulgaris and of hair follicles in keratosis pilaris. Please note there are other important mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris. Folliculitis is the inflammation of hair follicles usually secondary to bacterial or fungal infection. Hidradenitis suppurativa is another inflammatory condition involving occlusion of the hair follicle in apocrine-rich areas of the body (e.g., axilla, groin).
