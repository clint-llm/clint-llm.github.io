Depending on the part of the corpus callosum affected, agenesis of the corpus callosum may classify into one of two varieties:

- Complete agenesis

- Partial agenesis (hypogenesis or dysgenesis), in which usually the splenium (the posterior part) is absent.

As a rule of thumb, primary agenesis of the corpus callosum (total agenesis) can be excluded by the presence of the rostrum. One exception is holoprosencephaly. In this condition, there may be atypical callosal dysgenesis, in which anterior parts of the corpus callosum are absent.

The other developmental abnormalities of corpus callosum include:

- Dysgenesis - Abnormal shape

- Hypoplasia - Decreased thickness

Morphologically, agenesis of the corpus callosum classifies into two types:

- Type 1 - Axons form, but these are unable to cross the midline. Hence they form large aberrant Probst bundle fibers along the medial hemispheric walls.

- Type 2 - Commissural axons fail to form, so Probst fiber bundles are not found.

Probst fiber bundles run parallel to the medial walls of the lateral ventricles and enlarge and deform their medial borders, especially at the level of the frontal horns. Recently a reduction in the number of von Economo neurons, which are large spindle-shaped neurons localized to the anterior cingulate cortex and frontoinsular cortex, has been described in agenesis of the corpus callosum. Partial agenesis of the corpus callosum has correlations with 'sigmoid bundles,’ which asymmetrically connect the frontal lobe with the contralateral occipitoparietal cortex.
