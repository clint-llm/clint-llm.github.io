If coxa saltans cannot be diagnosed by history and physical exam, imaging can be used to help rule out other hip pathology and confirm the diagnosis. Plain radiographs usually are of little use to confirm the diagnosis; however, they should be done to rule out anatomical variations, developmental dysplasia, or other hip pathology.  Additionally, a positive response to anesthetic joint injection in the affected area can help distinguish between external and internal snapping hip syndrome.

Clinically visible external snapping hip syndrome can be confirmed on T1 weighted axial MRI as a thickened iliotibial band or thickened anterior edge of the gluteus maximus muscle. If the snapping is not visible on a physical exam, dynamic ultrasonography can be used to demonstrate the snapping of the iliotibial band over the greater trochanter. Dynamic ultrasonography also can reveal associated tendonitis, iliopsoas bursitis, or muscle tears.

A diagnosis of internal snapping hip syndrome can be confirmed using iliopsoas bursography combined with fluoroscopy, dynamic ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, or magnetic resonance arthrography. Magnetic resonance arthrography is preferred because it also can detect intra-articular hip pathology, which commonly accompanies internal snapping hip syndrome.
