Patients with asymptomatic bacteriuria are, by definition, asymptomatic. They have no symptoms that can be attributed to bacteria in the urine. This is completely different from the evaluation and management of symptomatic bacteriuria or urinary tract infections. Â Several factors are thought to increase the likelihood of asymptomatic bacteriuria.

- obstructive uropathy (stones, prostatic hypertrophy, cystocele, etc.),

- fecal soiling of the perineum (especially in women),

- indwelling urinary catheters, and

- frequent instrumentation of the urinary tract.
