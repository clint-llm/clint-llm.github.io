The preoperative work-up in a patient being considered for operative treatment will help confirm the diagnosis, exclude other pathologic entities, and direct the operative intervention.

- Endoscopy:****This is an essential step in the evaluation of patients with GERD and a suspected hiatal hernia who are being considered for surgery. This study can exclude other diseases, such as tumors, and can document the presence of esophageal injury.

- Manometry: This study is used to rule out primary motility disorders such as achalasia, which can mimic the symptoms of reflux. Patients with primary motility disorders often require a partial fundoplication as opposed to a Nissen.

- pH monitoring: The 24-hour pH test is the gold standard for diagnosing acid reflux. In this study, a probe is placed 5cm above the GE junction and measures the amount of acid to which it is exposed. This data is then quantified into a number called the DeMeester score. A score of 14.7 or above indicates significant gastroesophageal reflux.

- Esophagography: The esophagogram provides valuable information in terms of the anatomy of the esophagus and proximal stomach. Anatomic abnormalities such as tumors or strictures may also be discovered during this study.
