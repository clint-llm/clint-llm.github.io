The histopathology will vary depending on the etiology.Â Males with X-linked hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia will have an absence of sweat glands, whereas female carriers will have reduced glands. The clinical presentation and or a skin biopsy will help identify those with local destruction or obstruction.

Light microscopy may not reveal marked morphological changes in sweat glands in patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis (AIGA) due to idiopathic pure sudomotor failure (IPSF). Still, there may be lymphocytic infiltration around sweat glands.
