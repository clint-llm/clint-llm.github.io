The anterior and posterior-lateral nasal arteries anastomose along the lateral walls of the nasal cavity with the anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries, helping to perfuse the anterior and posterior ethmoidal nerves, which are terminal branches of the nasociliary nerve, itself a branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V).
