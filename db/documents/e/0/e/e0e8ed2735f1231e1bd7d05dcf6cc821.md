Typically, an iatrogenic femoral pseudoaneurysm presents as a painful, pulsatile mass.  The mass will frequently exhibit a bruit on auscultation.  If there is an arterio-venous fistula, the bruit may demonstrate a to-and-fro quality.  Enlarging pseudoaneurysms may exhibit pressure on the skin with pain with ultimately skin ischemia, necrosis, and hemorrhage.  Thrombus that forms within the sac may embolize distally.

Most visceral artery pseudoaneurysms (91%) present with symptoms of rupture.

Aortic and femoral pseudoaneurysms are rarely spontaneous.  Mycotic pseudoaneurysms are typically the result of repeated IV drug use.
