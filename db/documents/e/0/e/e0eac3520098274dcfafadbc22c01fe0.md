A Chance fracture is an unstable spine fracture that typically occurs at the thoracolumbar junction. It is a horizontal fracture extending from posterior to anterior through the spinous process, pedicles, and vertebral body. One can overlook Chance fractures on the clinical exam because patients rarely present with a neurological deficit. However, the incidence of concurrent intra-abdominal injuries can be as high as 50%. Early recognition of this injury is critical as a delay in diagnosis significantly impacts clinical outcomes. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of Chance fractures and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the injury mechanism that leads to a Chance fracture.
- Outline the components of proper evaluation and assessment of a patient presenting with a potential Chance fracture.
- Summarize the treatment and management options available for Chance fractures, based on the specific fracture type and location.
- Explain the importance of interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to aid in prompt diagnosis of Chance fracture and improving outcomes in patients diagnosed with the condition.
