Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a neurotransmitter with an integral physiological role in the human body; it is involved in regulating various activities (e.g., behavior, mood, memory).

These treatments target 5-HT (either by increasing the neurotransmitter's concentration or maximizing the receptors' potentiality), which contributes to partial alleviation of such disorders' pathophysiological underlying schema. There is experimental evidence demonstrating reduced central nervous system (CNS) and plasma serotonin levels in patients with major depressive disorder and low mood, in general.

There is no consensus on whether serotonin should be the only factor studied extensively regarding these pathologies as they commonly manifest in multifactorial pathophysiology.
