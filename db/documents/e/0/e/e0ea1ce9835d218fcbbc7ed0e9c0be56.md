Evaluation of the patient with acute dystonic reaction should be performed with the same basic steps as any other acute presentation including assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation. Subtle signs such as dysphonia or complaints of throat discomfort following administration of a potential offending agent should raise suspicion of laryngeal dystonia. Definitive airway management with intubation should be considered in any patient who appears to be having difficulty protecting their airway or failing to ventilate or oxygenate. A thorough history and physical exam should be performed, looking for signs of other acute conditions including stroke and seizure. Special attention should be given to recently administered medications, and they should be reviewed for potential dopamine-blocking effects. Drug paraphernalia or the presence of, or report of, illicit substances may raise suspicion that the patient’s drugs may have been cut or spiked with an offending pharmacologic agent.
