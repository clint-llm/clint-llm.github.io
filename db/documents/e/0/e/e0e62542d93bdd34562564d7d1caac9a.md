Depending on the patient's immune system, a lung abscess can be indolent or symptomatic. History should focus on finding patients at risk of aspiration circumstances (impaired cognition, loss of bulbar motor function, immobility), causes of immune incompetence, oral or rectal instrumentation, intravenous drug abuse, and recent upper respiratory illness. Patients could present with fevers, chills, weight loss, fatigue, loss of appetite, or a cough, which might be productive or non-productive depending on the closeness of the abscess to the airway.
