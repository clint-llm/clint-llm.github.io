Traditionally, the source of Federal funding and oversight comes from the Office of EMS under the National Highway Traffic Safety (NHTSA), which is part of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT). This structure came from EMS's development in response to the 1960's "white paper" entitled "Accidental Death and Disability," which was a landmark paper addressing traumatic injuries as a national healthcare issue.
