Organizations have a significant role to play in dealing with this epidemic; however, to reduce burnout and promote provider engagement, both providers and organizations have to share this responsibility. Providers organizations like the American medical association (AMA) and the American college of physicians (ACP) are taking notice and have started allocating resources to the study and development of interventions targeting burnout. STEPS Forward is a program pioneered by the AMA and is an example of this kind of initiative. It is a seven-step process laid out by the AMA that organizations can follow. Ultimately, healthcare needs more academic and non-academic institutions to study burnout and publish data to understand and help providers and organizations manage this syndrome more effectively. When issues become apparent, an interprofessional team of providers, social workers, and nurses assisting the individual in working through personal challenges will provide the best outcome.[Level V]
