Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a congenital anomaly of the diaphragm with an incidence of approximately 1 in 2000 to 1 in 3000 births.  Of those, roughly 70 to 75% are posterolateral defects and thus characterized as Bochdalek hernias.

Symptomatic Bochdalek hernias in adults are relatively rare, with the majority of cases found incidentally. The overall incidence of adults with asymptomatic Bochdalek hernias has been estimated to be as low as 0.17% and as high as 6%, though there is a school of thought that some of these were hernias acquired during adulthood.
