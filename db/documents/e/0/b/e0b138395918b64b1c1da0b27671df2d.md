Elevated pressures in the pulmonary artery secondary to hypoxia from untreated and progressively worsening chronic lung disease increase right ventricular afterload. Due to the slow progression of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR)in the setting of group 3 PH, RV adapts and hypertrophy to compensate for the high afterload. This subsequently causes RV diastolic dysfunction and paves the way to right ventricular and pulmonary artery (RV-PA) uncoupling. In one study, RV dysfunction was seen as worse in group 3 PH compared to patients in group 1 PH despite less severe PVR. Worse outcomes were also observed in the male gender. [46] In addition, lung hyperinflation and an increase in intrapleural pressures decrease the preload and venous return to RV. Under the persistently high afterload, RV eventually fails with reduced systolic function, and cor pulmonale ensues.
