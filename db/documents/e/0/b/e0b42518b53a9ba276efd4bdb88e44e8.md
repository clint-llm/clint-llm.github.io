Medial epicondyle fractures comprise 12% of elbow fractures in the pediatric population. Most medial epicondyle fractures occur in pediatric patients between the ages of 9 and 14. Approximately 75% of medial epicondylar fractures occur in male pediatric patients. The increased numbers of collisions, falls, and valgus stress events on the elbow in active athletes contribute to patients' demographics at risk for these injuries.
