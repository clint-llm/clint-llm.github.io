MAC is managed surgically by simple excision or Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). Complication rates between MMS and simple excision are similar. When utilizing MMS, clear margins were obtained in fewer procedures and resulted in fewer office visits.

In the event that Mohs micrographic surgery is not an option due to lack of procedure availability or tumor extent, intraoperative frozen sections may be useful for guiding conventional surgical excision.

Patients should be followed every six to twelve months following diagnosis and management for full-body skin examination and lymph node examination.
