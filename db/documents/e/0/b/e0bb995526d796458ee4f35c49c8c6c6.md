Simulation is also widely used as either a supplement or replacement for clinical skills assessment in EMS education. For example, a paper on the state of EMS training and skills in under-resourced areas like Kenya used observation of simulation scenarios as part of its assessment of the skills of EMS personnel.

A statistical analysis examining the validity of simulation as an accurate assessment of clinical competence in the field found that in five of seven dimensions considered essential paramedic skills (situation awareness, history gathering, patient assessment, decision making, and communication), trainees scored comparably when observed in simulation and the field.Â  In the remaining two dimensions (resource utilization and procedural skill), trainee performance scores during simulation did not significantly correlate with scores obtained in the field. This study is critical to understanding the use of simulation in the assessment of EMS skills. Evaluation of clinical skills by simulation is overall a reliable means of evaluating clinical competence but does not guarantee skill level in the field or replace assessment in the field altogether.
