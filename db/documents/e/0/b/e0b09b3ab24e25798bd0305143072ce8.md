Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC), also known as undifferentiated carcinoma, is a rare, highly aggressive malignant tumor accounting for 2% to 3% of all thyroid gland neoplasms. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma continues to rank as one of the most deadly diseases worldwide and carries a very poor prognosis. In addition to considerable local invasion, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma often presents with metastatic spread to regional lymph nodes and distant sites.
