**Response to a Sentinel Event**

The hospital must review all sentinel events. All accredited hospitals are encouraged but not obligated to report to the Joint Commission every sentinel event. Since 2007, about 800 sentinel events are reported to the Joint Commission every year according to their summary data of sentinel events. Sentinel events occur in every healthcare setting. The great majority occur in a medical/surgical hospital setting, followed by psychiatric hospitals (including psychiatric units and clinics) and emergency departments. More than three-fourths of them are voluntarily reported to the agency. The most common sentinel events are wrong-site surgery, foreign body retention, and falls.

An appropriate response to a sentinel event may include the following:

- Stabilize the patient

- Disclose the event to the patient and family

- Provide support for the family and staff involved

- Notification to the hospital leadership

- Immediate investigation

- Comprehensive systematic review

- Root cause analysis (RCA) for identifying the causal and contributory factors

- Strong corrective actions to eliminate the root cause and prevent similar future events

- Establish a timeline for the implementation of corrective actions

- System improvement
