Histopathological findings in the lung vary with the stage of the disease. In the early stages, interstitial and intra-alveolar hemorrhage predominate, with collections of both free hemosiderin and hemosiderin-filled macrophages found in the alveolar spaces and the interstitium. When the disease progresses, interstitial fibrosis ensues. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy of the biopsy specimen taken from lung and kidney may differentiate idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPH) from Goodpasture syndrome and immune complex-mediated diseases.
