Organophosphate agents are used for insecticides and work by irreversibly inhibiting acetylcholine esterase. Excess acetylcholine act on muscarinic and nicotinic receptors and present with signs of acetylcholine toxicity. Toxicity characteristically demonstrates overactive parasympathetic stimulation and presents with symptoms of diarrhea, urination, miosis, bronchospasm, bradycardia, excitation of skeletal muscle and CNS, lacrimation, sweating, and salivation.

Organophosphate poisoning antidotes are atropine and pralidoxime. Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist, and pralidoxime can regenerate acetylcholinesterase.
