Water toxicity can occur due to numerous etiologies but it is challenging to diagnose as it presents with vague symptoms of altered mental status, disorientation, confusion, nausea, and vomiting which may resemble psychosis. It may be misdiagnosed on presentation, due to the variability of symptoms. To avoid more serious outcomes like seizures and coma early detection is vital. Untreated cases may also lead to death. This activity outlines the evaluation and treatment of water toxicity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the etiology of water toxicity.
- Describe the pathophysiology of water toxicity.
- Summarize the evaluation of water toxicit
- Explain how an interprofessional team can work toward the evaluation and treatment of water toxicity and educate the public in prevention.
