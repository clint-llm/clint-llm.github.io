Because there are many causes of lactic acidosis, the condition is best managed by a multidisciplinary team that consists of a surgeon, endocrinologist, internist, intensivist, ICU nurses and a pharmacist. The key feature is to determine the primary cause. At the same time, the patient should be resuscitated, hydrated and may even require mechanical ventilation. The outcomes of patients with lactic acidosis depend on the cause, patient age, other comorbidities, ARDS, multiorgan failure and response to treatment.
