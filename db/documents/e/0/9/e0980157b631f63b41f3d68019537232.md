Local anesthetics can be applied topically and subcutaneously to anesthetize local tissues. Topical use for some agents (e.g., viscous lidocaine) can include oral ingestion with swish and spit, as well as gargling and swallowing for pharyngeal anesthesia effects. Oral applications can also include agents such as benzocaine applied to the gums or aphthous stomatitis. These local anesthetic agents can also be administered around peripheral nerves and in the neuraxial space to anesthetize larger nerves or dermatomal distributions. Lidocaine is also administered intravenously to provide surgical anesthesia for an extremity, such as Bier block, or as a cardiac antiarrhythmic.
