Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a variant of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that, in recent years, has received a new identity and nomenclature from the histology perspective. The orphan among lung cancers has found a family, albeit with some newfound stepbrothers and sisters. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of bronchoalveolar cancer and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of bronchoalveolar cancer.
- Summarize the treatment of bronchoalveolar cancer.
- Describe the staging of bronchoalveolar cancer.
- Explain some strategies to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by bronchoalveolar cancer.
