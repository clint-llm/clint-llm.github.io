The diagnosis and management of cavernous sinus aneurysms are best done with an interprofessional team that includes a neurologist, neurosurgeon, invasive radiologist, ophthalmologist, neurosurgical nurses, and rehab specialists. The treatment of cavernous sinus aneurysms depends on their size and symptoms. Today, preferential treatment is endovascular therapy which is associated with significantly less morbidity than surgery. However, ruptured aneurysms can be life-threatening and need immediate treatment. Even after successful surgery, many patients are left with residual neurological and visual deficits.
