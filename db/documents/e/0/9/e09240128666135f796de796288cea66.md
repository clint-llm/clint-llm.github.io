The emphasis on physical activity goes back to 3000 B.C. when it was the quintessential principle of daily living and proper diet. Regular physical activity is essential for maintaining good health and an adequate quality of life. Physical activity has health benefits for everyone regardless of age, current fitness level, or underlying clinical conditions. Physical activity is linked with positive health outcomes that can start accumulating immediately after doing physical activity.

Sedentary behavior is characterized by low levels of energy expenditure (<1.5 metabolic equivalents), including leisure time while sitting, reclining, or laying down.

This lack of physical activity is associated with poor quality of life, increased risk of major medical illnesses, and an increased cost of healthcare in the United States. Consequently, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published guidelines with an updated edition in 2018 to help decrease physical inactivity and increase patient health benefits.

The World Health Organization (WHO) also released updated guidelines in 2020 regarding physical activity and sedentary behavior in an effort to increase global awareness about the lack of physical activity and associated health consequences.

This article reviews the recommendations provided in these guidelines in a clear and concise form to help promote better compliance with their key recommendations.
