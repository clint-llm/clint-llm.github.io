Mediastinitis refers to inflammation or infection that involves the mediastinum, the cavity within the thorax that is bordered by the pleural sacs, the thoracic outlet, and the diaphragm. There are multiple etiologies that can cause mediastinitis. Since many vital structures lie within the mediastinum, the disease process is life-threatening and requires emergent intervention and treatment. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of mediastinitis and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in providing comprehensive care to these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiologies of mediastinitis.
- Describe the presentation of a patient with mediastinitis.
- Outline the treatment considerations for patients with mediastinitis.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients affected by mediastinitis.
