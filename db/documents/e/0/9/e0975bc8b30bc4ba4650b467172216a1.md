A common physiologic variant is the presence of a retroverted uterus. The presence of a retroverted uterus is not associated with a higher incidence of infertility, urinary tract infection, or hyperemesis gravidarum. However, studies have demonstrated that the incidence of early pregnancy bleeding and spontaneous abortion are significantly higher in those with a retroverted gravid uterus.

Additionally, the origin of the uterine artery may vary in up to 1 of 5 cases.
