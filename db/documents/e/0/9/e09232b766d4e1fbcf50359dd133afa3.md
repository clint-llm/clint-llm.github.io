Beta-blockers are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of various cardiac disorders, hyperthyroidism, migraine, glaucoma, and anxiety. Besides physicians, nurses and pharmacists need to be familiar with the therapeutic uses of these drugs and their toxicity. Over the years, the numbers of beta-blocker associated toxicity have slightly increased, but the fatalities have decreased because of prompt diagnosis and treatment. The outcomes after beta-blocker toxicity depend on when the patient presents and the amount ingested. Overall, the lipid-soluble beta-blockers are more toxic than the water-soluble agents because of their quinidine-like effects. Individuals with underlying heart and lung disease are most susceptible to the toxic effects of beta-blockers. The outcomes are worse in people who are also consuming other cardioactive and psychotropic agents. When patients present with suspected beta-blocker toxicity, the patients should be admitted to the ICU, and a nephrologist should be consulted, in case dialysis is required. Any patient with an intentional overdose should be referred to a mental health counselor prior to discharge.
