The contraindications for esophageal reconstruction include patients who are too debilitated or malnourished to tolerate an esophagectomy. Depending on the indication for esophagectomy, patients may receive gastric or jejunal tube feedings to supplement enteral feedings.

With regards to cancer, patients who present with metastatic or locally advanced, inoperable esophageal cancer are best treated with palliative measures. Instead of esophageal reconstruction, these patients should be treated with chemoradiation, esophageal stents, and possible esophageal dilations.
