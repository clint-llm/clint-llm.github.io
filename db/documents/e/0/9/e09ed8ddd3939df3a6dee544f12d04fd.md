With the significant amount of money invested annually, the list of medications aspires to grow each year.

The development of pharmaceutical formulations is currently dependent on trial and error methods. Trial and error methods help predict optimal formulations. This process is time-consuming and expensive and involves a significant amount of labor to develop and monitor. There is pressure on the pharmaceutical industry to decrease the cost of healthcare and the number of new active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). To combat this, determining the desired formulations is necessary for the industry to determine efficient ways to develop drugs.

API must be safe and efficacious, but the excipients, primary packaging materials, devices need to be safe as well.
