Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit cyclooxygenases, a necessary enzyme for prostaglandin synthesis. Physiologic roles of prostaglandins are initiating and maintenance of the protective mucosal barrier of the stomach and promoting intrarenal plasma flow and electrolyte balance. The potential gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities and nephrotoxicity should be addressed with the family. A survey of pediatric rheumatologistsâ€™ experience reveals significantly more abdominal pain, easy bruising, epistaxis, headaches, and fatigue for nonselective NSAIDs than for selective COX-2 NSAIDs. However, a study in safety profile, including GI toxicity between nonselective NSAIDs (COX1 and COX2 inhibitors) and selective COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) is no different. Since over 50% of children with JIA developed of GI symptoms related to NSAID, corticosteroid, and methotrexate use, reviewing the medical history and previous or concurrent use of NSAIDs, corticosteroid or methotrexate is necessary to assess and minimize the potential risk of gastrointestinal toxicity. The potential nephropathy, such as acute interstitial nephritis or acute papillary necrosis, was rarely reported. The prevalence of nephrotoxicity in children is 0.4%, which is five times less than the prevalence in adults. The benefit of routine monitoring (blood and urine) of asymptomatic children with JIA receiving only NSAIDs is unclear.
