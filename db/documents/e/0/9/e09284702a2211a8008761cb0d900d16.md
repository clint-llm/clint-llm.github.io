Takayasu arteritis (pulseless disease) is a systemic inflammatory condition characterized by damage to the large and medium arteries and their branches. It presents at first with nonspecific constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, weight loss, and anorexia. Other presentations such as hypertension, neurologic manifestations, and upper limb claudication occur secondary to arterial insufficiency. This activity illustrates the evaluation and management of Takayasu arteritis and explains the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the epidemiology of Takayasu arteritis.
- Describe the pathophysiology of Takayasu arteritis.
- Outline the use of CTA in the evaluation of Takayasu arteritis.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to provide patient education and long term monitoring of the effects of drugs which will improve outcomes for patients affected by Takayasu arteritis.
