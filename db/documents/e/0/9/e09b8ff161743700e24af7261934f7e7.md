Meningitis is defined as inflammation of the meninges. The meninges are the three membranes (the dura mater, arachnoid mater, and pia mater) that line the vertebral canal and skullÂ enclosing the brain and spinal cord. Encephalitis, on the other hand, is inflammation of the brain itself.

Meningitis can be caused by infectious and non-infectious processes (autoimmune disorders, cancer/paraneoplastic syndromes, drug reactions).

The infectious etiologic agents of meningitis include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and less commonly parasites.

Risk factors for meningitis include:

- Chronic medical disorders (renal failure, diabetes, adrenal insufficiency, cystic fibrosis)

- Extremes of age

- Undervaccination

- Immunosuppressed states (iatrogenic, transplant recipients, congenital immunodeficiencies, AIDS)

- Living in crowded conditions

- Exposures:

- Travel to endemic areas (Southwestern U.S. for cocci; Northeastern U.S. for Lyme disease)
- Vectors (mosquitoes, ticks)

- Alcohol use disorder

- Presence of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt

- Bacterial endocarditis

- Malignancy

- Dural defects

- IV drug use

- Sickle cell anemia

- Splenectomy
