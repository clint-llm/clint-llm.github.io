Many diseases and disorders can present with hemarthrosis. However, categorization is generally divided into traumatic, non-traumatic, and postoperative. Traumatic injury is the most common cause of hemarthrosis.

Non-traumatic hemarthrosis can be caused by a variety of bleeding disorders that are either hereditary or acquired. Hereditary bleeding disorders include hemophilia and other inherited coagulation factor deficiency disorders. Examples of acquired bleeding disorders include advanced liver or renal disease, vitamin K deficiency, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or anticoagulation medication use. Other more rare causes of non-traumatic hemarthrosis include the following:

- Neurologic: Reflex sympathetic dystrophy, diabetic neuropathic arthropathy

- Infectious: Septic bacterial arthritis

- Vascular: Vitamin C deficiency, ruptured peripheral artery aneurysms, osteoarthritis (degenerative tears of peripheral arteries associated with a posterior horn of the lateral meniscus)

- Neoplasms: Benign synovial hemangiomas, pigmented villonodular synovitis, or any malignant tumor arising near a joint cavity or metastatic

Post-operative recurrent hemarthrosis is frequently associated with total knee arthroplasty and has also been described as an uncommon complication following arthroscopy.
