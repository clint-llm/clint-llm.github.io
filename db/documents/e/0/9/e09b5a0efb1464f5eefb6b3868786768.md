The left cerebral hemisphere is commonly described as the dominant hemisphere, while the right hemisphere is nondominant. This arrangement is true for most people as one’s dominant hemisphere is typically the opposite of their handedness. The majority of people are right-handed, and therefore, in most cases, the left cerebral hemisphere is dominant. Certain areas of the frontal cortex, such as Broca’s area, are described as being in the left hemisphere as it is a dominant hemisphere structure and so, theoretically, if one’s dominant hemisphere was on the right their Broca’s area could be as well.
