Clonidine is a commonly prescribed biochemical derivative of imidazoline with a variety of clinical uses. It was originally developed as a nasal decongestant, but its main use has been an anti-hypertensive agent. In recent years it has gained popularity in pediatric patients for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, and sleep disturbances. It has also been shown to be useful in treating several different drug withdrawal syndromes. Clonidineâ€™s effect on the body stems from its action on alpha-2 receptors, imidazoline receptors, and the functional overlap of alpha-2 receptors on mu receptors. Overdose results in a toxidrome not easily identified. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management/prevention of clonidine toxicity and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the basic pathophysiology/toxicokinetics of clonidine toxicity.
- Summarize some of the various presenting signs and symptoms that would accompany clonidine toxicity. 
- Review treatment and management strategies available for clonidine toxicity.
- Evaluate possible interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and treatment of clonidine toxicity and improve outcomes.
