Leydig cell tumor is a rare subtype of testicular tumors, which are common in young males. This cancer follows a benign course most of the time with rare metastasis. The usual presentation is a painless testicular mass in a young adult; precocious puberty is possible in children. Imaging studies, including ultrasound and CT scans, are important for evaluation, but there are no distinctive ultrasound features to distinguish this tumor. An accurate diagnosis is possible using histology and the identification of Leydig cells and their features, including Reinke's crystals. Standard therapy is radical orchidectomy.

This tumor can occur in females as a subtype of ovarian cancer and can cause virilization.

One of the most common pathologies of Leydig cells is Klinefelter syndrome, where testosterone levels are usually low despite high levels of luteinizing hormone and abundant Leydig cells. The cells are abnormal, but no steroid precursor accumulation is noted, which excludes enzyme defects or deficiencies.

Leydig cells are also affected by systemic diseases, including severe renal failure, in these cases, testosterone levels are low, but luteinizing hormone levels will measure as high.
