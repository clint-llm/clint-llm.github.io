Fasciae derive their blood supply from branches of the vessels that supply the structure which they enclose. Arguably more important than blood supply is the relation of the main vessels of the neck to these fasciae. As previously mentioned, the carotid sheath contains the common carotid and internal carotid arteries as well as the internal jugular vein. The vertebral arteries travel through the transverse foramina of the cervical vertebrae which are themselves surrounded by the prevertebral fascia.

The major groups of lymph nodes that drain the mucosal surfaces of the oropharynx and nasopharynx are located deep to the investing fascia and superficial to the pretracheal and prevertebral fasciae and tend to lie in proximity to nerves or vessels that course through this space. The retropharyngeal space contains deeper nodes whereas the danger space does not contain any organized lymph tissue.
