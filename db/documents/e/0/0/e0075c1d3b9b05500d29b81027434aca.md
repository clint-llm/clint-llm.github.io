M-type phospholipase A receptors (PLA2R) are the transmembrane proteins expressed on the podocytes. Circulating antibodies against PLA2R are responsible for 85% of the primary MN. These antibodies are not commonly seen in secondary MN. Other antigen-antibody complexes include anti-thrombospondin type-1 domain-containing 7A (THSD7A; 3% of primary MN),

Secondary MN, which is 25% of the overall disease burden, is caused by autoimmune diseases like class V lupus nephritis (the most common cause of secondary MN), RA, autoimmune thyroid disease, IgG4-related systemic diseases, and ANCA associated vasculitis.**CLL**), and melanoma. Medications like NSAIDs and toxins including heavy metals are also implicated. Alloimmune diseases include graft versus host disease, autologous stem cell transplants, and de novo MN in transplant patients.
