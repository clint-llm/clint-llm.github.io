A severe childhood burn is strongly associated with an increased risk of melanoma, while more incremental occupational exposure does not confer an increased risk. These findings support the hypothesis that melanoma risk is affected primarily by intermittent intense sun exposure that paralyzes normal immune surveillance and destroys abnormal melanocytes.Â Sunburn in adolescence damages lifelong immune surveillance and disturbs normal apoptosis of neoplastic cells. Genetic susceptibility also may help account for melanoma in shaded areas. As many as 1 in 10 cases of melanoma may be linked to inherited faulty genes.
