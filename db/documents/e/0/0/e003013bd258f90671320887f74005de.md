The prevalence of congenital prolonged QT is largely unknown. Figures estimate between 1:2000 and 1:20,000 have the genetic mutation for QT prolongation. Clinically more males than females exhibit the trait. Little is also known about the prevalence or incidence of drug-induced torsades de pointes. This is mainly because the arrhythmia is often transient, and an accurate diagnosis requires an ECG to be recorded during the event. Several European centers estimate that the annual reporting rate of drug-induced Torsades de Pointes is between 0.8 and 1.2 per million person-years. The incidence of drug-induced Torsades de Pointes also varies based on the drug in question and the population being studied.
