Cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) is detectable either through serological-based tests or tissue-based studies of malignant ovarian or endometrial tissue specimens.

When the CA 125 assay is used for cancer diagnosis, sampling should not be done immediately before or during menstruation because the physiological elevation of the CA 125 levels may give false positive results.
