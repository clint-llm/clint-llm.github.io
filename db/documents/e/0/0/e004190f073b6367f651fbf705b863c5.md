The epidural technique is one of the earliest ones in the field of anesthesia. Properly performed, it is a safe technique that provides multiple benefits. It is usable as a sole anesthetic for surgical procedures, decreasing the need for general anesthesia and airway management, with the risks that this implies. It also reduces the exposure to volatile anesthetics and may potentially decrease theÂ opioid requirement during or after a procedure, lowering the incidence of the side effects associated with these drugs. This is particularly relevant in pediatric anesthesia since there is controversy regarding the potential negative impact of certain anesthetic drugs on neurodevelopment. The epidural technique is also highly valuable for postoperative pain management as part of a multimodal approach.
