Laboratory monitoring of thyroid function tests should take place while the patient is on PTU therapy. Prothrombin time also requires monitoring in patients who are also on warfarin therapy concomitantly.

A key component of PTU therapy is patient education and counseling. The patient should receive counsel to:

- Contact the physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant while on the drug for dose adjustments and monitoring during the entire pregnancy.

- Report to the physician in case of any fever, drug eruptions, or infection.

- Report to the physician regarding any signs/symptoms of liver disease like nausea, right upper quadrant pain, and jaundice.

- Watch for the symptoms of agranulocytosis, which may include: sore throat, fever, chills, and infections of the gums or skin. It can also present with a severe drop in blood pressure.
