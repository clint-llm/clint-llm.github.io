Lichen striatus initially presents as a spontaneous eruption of a pink rash with raised spotting (papules) that come together to form a singular or multiple, dull-red, potentially-scaly, linear band that affects the Blaschko lines. It is a distinct cutaneous surface pattern of lines on the skin that do not originate from the nervous or circulatory systems.  These often occur on the extremities, but, can also be observed on the buttock, neck, and trunk region. The condition is often asymptomatic but in some cases, patients present with pruritus. The lesions often resolve on their own; although, in some circumstances, post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation can occur.
