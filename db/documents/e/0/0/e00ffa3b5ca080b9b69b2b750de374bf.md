**Surveillance**

There isÂ limited evidence for recommendations for follow-up after surgical resection. For all resected small intestinal and colonic carcinoid tumors follow long-term surveillance as there is a risk of recurrence even 5 years following resection. For small intestinal carcinoids, the general recommendation for surveillance is with triple phase CT or MRI imaging. Tumors less than 2 cm in size are less likely to metastasize. Urine 5-HIAA and Chromogranin A are followed every six months for the first couple of days. This is followed by annual surveillance for four years followed by every 2 years up to 10 years after surgery.
