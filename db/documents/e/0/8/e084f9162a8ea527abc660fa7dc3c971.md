The mammillary bodies are a part of the hypothalamus. Physiology of this region of the brain is necessary for survival. Therefore, few developmental/physiological variations allow for the survival of a fetus.

Throughout life, the mammillary bodies adapt to environmental and physiological changes of an individual; this enables the individual to alter behavior based on learned salience of a stimulus or set of stimuli. Although it is ideal for the mammillary bodies to change with variations in environmental stimuli, the neurons, and connections with the mammillary bodies are susceptible to damage based on environmental factors (e.g., alcohol, thiamine deficiency).
