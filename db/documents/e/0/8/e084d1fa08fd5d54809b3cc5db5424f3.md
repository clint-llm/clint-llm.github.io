The abdomen derives from three primary germ layers as an embryo. These are the ectoderm, which forms the epidermis, the somatic and splanchnic mesoderm, which forms the skeletal muscle of the abdominal wall and smooth muscle of the bowel, respectively, and the endoderm which forms the majority of the alimentary canal.

Embryologically, the gastrointestinal system develops as the foregut, midgut, and hindgut.

- Foregut: esophagus to the proximal duodenum where the bile duct enters

- Midgut: distal duodenum to proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon

- Hindgut: the distal third of the transverse colon to anal canal above the pectinate line
