Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord presents in patients with risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency. Since this is a progressive and reversible condition and the therapeutic regimens that have been explored so far are useful, it is crucial to evaluate patients who are at risk regularly. The early identification, evaluation, and treatment of this condition are imperative.

Primary care providers play an essential role in evaluating patients and identifying abnormal neurological signs and symptoms in patients with Crohn's disease, celiac disease, those that adhere to a strict vegan diet and patients post gastric or bariatric surgeries. Since symptoms present in a subacute manner, paying close attention to the history and examination can provide an early diagnosis of the disease.

Early identification and initiation of vitamin B12 supplementation in these patients have been found to improve neurological outcomes. Alerting neurologists to the concerns of the primary care provider can be beneficial in determining the optimum course of management. An interprofessional team composed of pharmacists, nurses, and other health care providers contributes to the shared decisions that can help achieve the best possible outcomes.
