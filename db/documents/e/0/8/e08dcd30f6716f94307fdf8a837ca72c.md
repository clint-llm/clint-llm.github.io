**Absolute Contraindications**

Some conventional angiography tables in North America have a labeled weight limit of 350 pounds. Morbidly obese patients with weights exceeding this limit may not have angiography for technical safety concerns.

**Relative Contraindications**

Pregnancy, except in the presence of intractable hemorrhage with a risk of maternal death

History of severe iodinated contrast medium allergy manifesting as bronchospasm, laryngospasm, angioedema, and cardiovascular collapse. Carbon dioxide angiography could be done on these patients when available.

Patients with a history of mild allergic reactions can be pretreated with steroids and antihistamines.

Patients with underlying renal impairment or dehydration are at high risk of developing renal function following exposure to contrast medium. Ultra-low contrast or zero contrast techniques have been proposed for this subset of patients.

Patients with coagulopathy, INR > 2, and platelet count < 50,000/microliter are at higher risk of bleeding. However, with the advent of vascular closure devices, the risk of bleeding is now minimal.

Patients with diabetes on metformin are at risk of deterioration in renal function and lactic acidosis, especially if they have underlying renal impairment.

Patients with excessive anxiety or who are unable to lie still may require conscious sedation.
