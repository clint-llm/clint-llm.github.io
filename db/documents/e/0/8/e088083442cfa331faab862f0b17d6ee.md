The prognosis depends on the deformity's cause and complexity and whether it is primary or associated with other medical conditions.

**Clubfoot:**The Ponseti method has a reported success rate of around 90% in reducing the need for posteromedial surgical release (PMR), with children expected to be able to walk independently and even run and be active after the end of the treatment.

**Planovalgus:**Prognosis varies depending on age and the underlying risk factors. However, the deformity resolves spontaneously in most cases, especially in children.

**Cavovarus:**Prognosis is associated with the underlying condition leading to cavovarus deformities.

**Congenital vertical talus:**The prognosis depends on the age at which the patient is diagnosed and the staging of the CVT.

**Congenital oblique talus:**COT may be considered a physiologic, anatomic variant. Prognosis, therefore, varies and depends on the degree of the deformity.

**Metatarsus adductus:**Excellent prognosis, with 90% of flexible metatarsus adductus resolving spontaneously without intervention.

**Skew foot:**Prognosis varies and, in severe cases, may lead to foot pain or dysfunction.
