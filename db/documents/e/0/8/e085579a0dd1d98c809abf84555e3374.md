There have been no controlled trials comparing medications or duration of treatment in COP. Treatment regimens are based on consensus guidelines. The initial clinical presentation, severity of disease, and degree of responsiveness should be considered when deciding on an appropriate regimen and duration of therapy.

Spontaneous remissions have been described for patients with mild symptoms and minimal radiographic and PFT abnormalities. The anti-inflammatory effect of macrolides particularly clarithromycin has been exploited in some reports to treat patients with mild symptoms.

The vast majority of patients with progressive symptoms and diffuse radiographic involvement are treated with oral glucocorticoids resulting in marked improvement in symptoms. British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend initiating prednisone at a dose of 0.75 to 1 mg/kg per day and weaning over 6 to 12 months. Alternative regimens include starting prednisolone at a dose of 1 to 1.5 mg/kg for 3 months and then tapering or starting methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 g intravenously (IV) for the first 3 days followed by prednisolone at 20 mg daily, then tapering based on clinical response. Some authors have tried shorter courses tapered over 3 to 6 months with similar relapse rates. Regardless of the regimen, the initial dose is typically maintained for 4 to 8 weeks. Patients should be followed closely with follow-up clinical examination, pulmonary function testing, and chest radiographs. Relapses are common when tapering steroids but do not seem to affect the outcome. Delayed onset of initial treatment and evidence of cholestasis on laboratory testing are shown to be associated with multiple relapses. The last effective dose of glucocorticoids should be reinstituted at the earliest sign of worsening disease. Other groups have attempted lower dose of glucocorticoids with a goal of reducing cumulative steroid exposure, with slightly higher relapse rates but overall no change in morbidity and mortality. Close monitoring for adverse effects of glucocorticoids is recommended. Surgical resection is not recommended as treatment.

Patients who are unable to taper off glucocorticoids or have significant side effects to glucocorticoids can be started on a steroid-sparing agent, although COP is an unapproved indication for all steroid-sparing medications. Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, among others, have been reported in case series for successful management of COP.

In patients who fail to improve despite high-dose steroid therapy, alternative diagnoses or infections should be first ruled out. Second-line agents such as cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine A have been reported to produce good clinical responses in these steroid non-responsive cases.
