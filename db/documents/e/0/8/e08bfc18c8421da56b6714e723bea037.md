Palpation is the contact of the operator's fingers and hands with the body of the woman or child. It offers the possibility of collecting data on an area, structure, or function by touch. Uterine contractions, the size of the pregnant uterus, any uterine masses, and attitude, presentation, degree of commitment of the fetus, and any fetal-pelvic disproportions can be detected.

Abdominal palpation is accurate in identifying the presentation, mainly if performed by experienced healthcare professionals. If in doubt about the presentation part, obstetric ultrasound should be used to confirm the results of the palpation. Ultrasound can also rule out fetal abnormalities, low placenta, hyperextension of the baby's head, and the presence of the umbilical cord around the neck of the fetus. The palpation technique requires skill and delicacy. The entire palm and fingers are useful for detecting myometrial activity, fetal movements, or any neoformations (fibroids), or the degree of edema. Palpation can be superficial or deep (the superficial one must always precede the deep one since the latter can cause pain); avoid having long nails because they can cause discomfort or injury.

From a psychological point of view, palpation is to be considered a form of analog communication between the midwife and the woman. Therefore through this technique, the operator can transmit the feelings they have towards the patient.
