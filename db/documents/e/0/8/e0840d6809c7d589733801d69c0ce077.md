Cytogenetics refers to the study of chromosomes. Although it has been known that chromosomes form the physical basis for inheritance for well over a hundred years, the discipline of mammalian cytogenetics, as we know it today, started around the mid-1950s.

Chromosomal abnormalities generally fall into two basic categories: numerical or structural. Numerical disorders are considerably more common than structural ones; they involve any deviation from the normal diploid number for a given species. This category can further subdivide into a group in which individual chromosomes may be either missing or duplicated and a group in which whole haploid sets of chromosomes may be added or lost.

Chromosomal abnormalities may also classify as constitutional or acquired. Constitutional chromosomal abnormalities arise during gametogenesis or early embryogenesis and affect all or a major portion of an organismâ€™s cells.
