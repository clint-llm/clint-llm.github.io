A single-center cohort study of 39 patients determined the probability of having the benign cutaneous form of the disease was 70%. The likelihood of benign disease increased to 97% after a 7-year duration of skin-limited disease. No patients with cutaneous-limited disease had a lethal outcome. In contrast, the overall mortality in the systemic disease was 21%, with a mean survival time of 0 to 9 years.
