Contrast-induced nephropathy was first reported by Bartel et al. in the 1950s and was related to a fatal acute renal injury that happened following intravenous pyelography in a patient with a myeloma kidney. A transient rise in creatine occurs in 15% of patients undergoing invasive procedures. Even mild contrast-induced nephropathy is associated with longer hospital stays, increased cost, and higher short-term and long-term mortality. The reported incidence varies between 7% and 11% depending on the definition applied, study population, and setting. An average additional cost of more than $10,000 is associated with a contrast-induced nephropathy-related hospital stay. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is diagnosed by following up on creatinine levels two to three days after contrast exposure.

Patients suffering from contrast-induced nephropathy usually have a preceding history of contrast administration, 24-48 hours before the presentation, while undergoing a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure, such as percutaneous coronary intervention. Acute kidney injury is mostly nonoliguric.

A physical examination is helpful in ruling out other possible causes of acute nephropathies, for instance, cholesterol emboli (pathognomonic findings of which are blue toes and livedo reticularis) or interstitial nephritis secondary to drugs (that typically involves a rash). There may be signs of volume depletion or there could be decompensated heart failure.
