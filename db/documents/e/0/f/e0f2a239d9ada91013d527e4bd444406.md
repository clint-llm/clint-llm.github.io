The largest known study to date regarding brain death determination protocols worldwide was released in 2020 by Lewis A et al. 136 corresponding countries' contacts (42% world) revealed high variability in the brain death criteria protocols internationally.

A previous international study of brain death criteria in 91 countries by Patel PV et al. showed 22% of low-income vs. 97% of high-income countries had an institutional protocol for brain death determination.

Another study evaluated brain death intranational standards practiced within the US's top 50 neurology/neurosurgery institutions, as reported in 2006. Results showed variability in the protocols between various health institutions, including the performance of the apnea and the ancillary tests. It was also found that there were different requirements for the examiner depending on the state, including if one or two physicians are required to determine brain death. Some states (Alaska) allow nurses to assess brain death with further certification by a physician. Another common requirement is that if the patient is the potential for organ procurement, the physician who declares brain death should not be a procurement team member.

A recent study, "The World Brain Death Project," tried to achieve the minimum clinical criteria needed to determine brain death by performing a literature search of important databases from January 1, 1992, through April 2020.
