The ryanodine receptor serves as a conduit for calcium to flow through to produce a contraction in striated muscle.

In skeletal muscle, the depolarization from the action potential leads to a protein to protein interaction across the junctional cleft between the dihydropyridine receptor and the ryanodine receptor type 1 to release calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to produce a muscle contraction.

In cardiac muscle during systole, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum by directly activating the type 2 ryanodine receptors by an inward current of calcium via the L-type calcium channels during excitation produced from the action potential.
