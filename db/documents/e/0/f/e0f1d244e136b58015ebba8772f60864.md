Unilateral vocal cord paralysis (UVCP) is a common presentation to otolaryngology outpatient clinics. The condition presents with dysphonia, shortness of breath and swallowing difficulty, and occurs secondary to damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve by causes such as cancers, trauma, and surgery. UVCP requires extensive clinical history taking, examination, and investigation by an experienced otolaryngologist to identify the underlying cause. The otolaryngologist can often restore the patient's voice with a variety of surgical and non-surgical interventions.
