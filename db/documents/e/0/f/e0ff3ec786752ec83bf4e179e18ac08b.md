The solar electromagnetic spectrum includes UVA(320-400nm), UVB(280Â to 320nm), and UVC(<280nm) and is the part between X-rays and visible light.UVR is produced artificially by a technique in which fluorescent tubes containing mercury vapors and phosphorus coating which enable the electric current to pass, then excited electrons of mercury are absorbed by phosphorus coating and then by the process of fluorescence radiations of longer wavelengths reemit. UVA and UVB can be produced by changing of phosphorus.UVA rays penetrate deeper than UVB but UVB is more readily absorbed by DNA than UVA.
