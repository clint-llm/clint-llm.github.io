Obesity hypoventilation syndrome is commonly misdiagnosed even in patients with morbid obesity resulting in frequent hospitalizations with hypercapnic respiratory failure.

The impact of therapy, particularly noninvasive PAP, on complications and mortality is positive, but even when treated with positive airway pressure therapy, the mortality in those with severe OHS remains substantially worse than in individuals with OSA alone.
