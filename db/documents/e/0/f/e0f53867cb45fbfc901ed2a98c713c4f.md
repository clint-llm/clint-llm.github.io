Malingering is a very difficult disorder to diagnose and treat. The disorder is best managed by an interprofessionalÂ team involving a mental health nurse, psychiatrist and a psychotherapist. These patients can be confrontational and threaten lawsuits if their demands are not met. The outlook for most of these patients is guarded. Most eventually get into legal problems as a result of their psychiatric pathology.
