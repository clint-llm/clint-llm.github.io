Diabetic macular edema is one of the leading causes of visual loss among the working population worldwide. Its prevalence in population-based studies is around 4.2 to 7.9% among patients with type 1 diabetes and was 1.4Â to 12.8 % among patients with type 2 diabetes.

The incidence of Irvin Gass syndrome secondary to an uncomplicated surgery varies from 0.1 to 2%. The risk factors for its development include systemic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, pre-existing ocular conditions like diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinal vein occlusion, epiretinal membrane, uveitis, and intra-operative complications like posterior capsule rupture, surgical trauma, especially to iris, vitreous loss, use of high phacoemulsification energy during the surgery and long surgical duration.

The incidence of SRF in eyes with NAION is approximately 10%. However, this may be an underestimation as all these patients are not routinely subjected to optical coherence tomography (OCT).

Macular edema may occur in 10 to 50% of patients with RP.
