The exact etiology of illness anxiety disorder remains largely unknown. However, multiple risk factors have been implicated in the development of this disorder.

- People with IAD may be uncomfortable experiencing normal body sensations, and they may label the subtle bodily changes as pathological.

- If a person is raised in a family where health anxieties are frequently discussed or if parents were disproportionately concerned about health-related issues, IAD may develop.

- A person might be at increased risk of developing IAD if they experienced serious illness in their childhood or their parent(s) or siblings suffered from a serious medical condition.

- People with underlying anxiety disorders (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder) are also at an increased risk of developing IAD.

- If a person spends an exorbitant amount of time reviewing health-related materials on the internet, he or she may be at an increased risk of developing IAD.
