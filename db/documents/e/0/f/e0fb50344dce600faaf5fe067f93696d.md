Haloperidol is one of the most commonly used antipsychotics in this world. However, since the drug can cause several side effects and is related to several toxicities after initiation, the healthcare workers must be familiar with its pharmacology, signs, and symptoms of toxicity, and management of adverse effects. In addition, a proper history and physical examination are necessary before the initiation of haloperidol in any patient. Therefore, recommended course of action when prescribing haloperidol is as follows:

- The clinicians(MD, PA, NP) prescribe haloperidol for appropriate indication.

- Psychiatrists are responsible for the overall care of patients on haloperidol therapy.

- Pharmacists should ensure proper dosing and report back to clinicians if there are potential drug interactions.

- Specialty-trained nurses should review the medicine administration record to ensure there were no administration errors.

- Emergency department physicians and triage nurses are the first to respond in case of acute haloperidol overdose.

- Intensivist ensures proper ICU care and monitoring while in hospital.

- Severe cases of haloperidol toxicity require the consultation of a medical toxicologist.

As depicted above, close interprofessional coordination between providers (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare workers is necessary to improve patient outcomes and decrease adverse events when using haloperidol therapy. The above illustrated interprofessional healthcare team approach makes haloperidol therapy more effective, with fewer adverse events, and improves patient outcomes. [Level 5]
