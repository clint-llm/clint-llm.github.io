The sphenopalatine artery anatomy has been studied extensively by numerous researchers. Ninety-seven percent of these cadaveric studies have demonstrated at least two arterial branches at the plane of the sphenopalatine foramen.

The individual arrangement of the arterial branches is highly variable with distributions superior or inferior to the ethmoidal spine, crisscrossing upon exiting the foramen, and demonstrating asymmetry between nasal cavities within the same cadaver. However, the ethmoidal crest serves as a consistent landmark that can help navigate within the nasal cavity, regardless of any variation seen in the SPA or its branches.
