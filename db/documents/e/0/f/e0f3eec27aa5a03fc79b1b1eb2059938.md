Equipment needed for successful arterial cannulation and catheter placement includes:

- Sterile gloves and drapes

- Skin prep solution such as povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine

- A 20-ga length appropriate catheter

- Five ml 1% lidocaine without epinephrine

- A 3 ml syringe with 25 ga or 27 ga needle for subcutaneous administration of lidocaine

- No. 11 blade scalpel

- A 4-0 nylon suture

- Sterile 4 x 4s

- Adhesive tape

- A 3-way stopcock

- Transducer kit

- Pressure tubing

- Size appropriate arm board (for radial artery access)

- Needle holder

- Intravenous (IV) tubing T-connector

Many kits are available specific to arterial cannulation that includes a catheter situated over a wire for fast and easy insertion. A 20-ga catheter is an acceptable size for older children and adults, a 22-ga catheter is preferred for pediatrics and infants. When planning for brachial or femoral artery cannulation, appropriate length catheters are necessary to ensure sufficient cannulation. The desired length of a brachial or femoral arterial catheter is 15 cm at a minimum.

Ultrasound guidance may also be used to help define the anatomy and visualize arterial cannulation.
