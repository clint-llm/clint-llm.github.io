Anatomic approaches to pericardiocentesis include needle insertion via the subxiphoid approach or anterior chest. Both may be performed using either ultrasound or fluoroscopy for guidance. The area is prepped and draped in a sterile fashion, and a large-bore (20 gauge or larger) needle of sufficient length is then inserted through the skin and into the pericardial sac. If the pericardiocentesis is being performed blind (without real-time guidance via TTE or fluoroscopy) and fluid is not encountered on the first pass. The needle is withdrawn to the skin and adjusted as deemed appropriate by the operator, moving sequentially across the anticipated position of the heart and pericardial sac until fluid is encountered.
