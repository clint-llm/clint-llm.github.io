Edwards syndrome usually results from an extra copy of chromosome 18q. There are three types of Edwards syndrome: Complete, partial, and mosaic trisomy 18.

- Complete trisomy 18 is the most common form (94%). In this type, every cell contains three complete copies of chromosome 18. The extra chromosome is due to nondisjunction, mostly during meiosis II. The extra chromosome is most often of maternal origin. The frequency of nondisjunction errors increases with advancing maternal age.

- Mosaic trisomy 18 is the second most common type (less than 5%). In this type, both a complete trisomy 18 and a normal cell line exist. Thus, the phenotype can range from complete trisomy 18 phenotype with early mortality to normal phenotype.

- The partial trisomy 18 accounts for 2% of Edwards syndrome. In this type, only a partial segment of chromosome 18q is present in triplicate. The partial triplicate often results from a balanced translocation or inversion carried by one of the parents. The partial trisomy 18 has a variable phenotype based on the location and the triplicated segment's extent.

The prevalence of Edwards syndrome has a positive correlation with advancing maternal age. Recurrence risk for complete trisomy 18 is 0.5% to 1% for subsequent pregnancies.
