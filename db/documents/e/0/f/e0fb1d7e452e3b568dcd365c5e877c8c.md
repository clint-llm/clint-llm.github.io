**Viral Hepatitis**

The basic treatment of acute viral hepatitis is supportive.  Patients who are experiencing significant nausea or vomiting and those who are elderly and immunocompromised should be admitted and started on intravenous fluids to rehydrate them. Patients who have complications like liver abscess, variceal bleed, or hepatic encephalopathy require admission and appropriate treatment. However, most of the patients can be safely monitored as an outpatient. Patients should avoid medications like acetaminophen or substances like alcohol that can be hepatotoxic.  Patients with acute viral hepatitis infection take proper rest and avoid vigorous physical activities until the symptoms improve. If required, patients should obtain a referral to specialty services like gastroenterology or hepatology.

**Hepatitis A**

Treatment for acute hepatitis A infection is supportive. There is no antiviral therapy for hepatitis A infection. Patients who have intractable nausea or vomiting, as well as those who are showing signs of liver failure, should be admitted and closely monitored.

**Hepatitis B**

Treatment of hepatitis B virus infection falls into two categories, treatment of an acute HBV infection and chronic HBV infection.

**Acute Hepatitis B Infection**

Treatment of acute hepatitis B virus infection is supportive and similar to the treatment of acute hepatitis A infection. For severe cases of acute hepatitis B virus infection, lamivudine has been used and showed good results.

**Chronic Hepatitis B Infection**

The main goal of treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus infection is the inhibition of viral replication with secondary goals being reducing symptoms and prevent or delay the progression of chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Inhibition of viral replication is indicated by loss of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and suppression of hepatitis B virus DNA levels. First-line monotherapy agents include pegylated interferon alfa-2a (PEG-IFN) and oral nucleoside or nucleotide analogs, including tenofovir or entecavir. Therapy should be selected based on individual patient profile, patient or provider preference, safety, efficacy, and cost of the treatment and risks of drug resistance.

Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) treatment usually continues for 48 weeks for both HBeAg positive and negative chronic hepatitis. Advantages of pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) treatment include high rates of seroconversion within one year of therapy and absence of resistance however it has many side effects including flu-like symptoms, fatigue, weight loss, depression, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, bone marrow suppression, etc. and is not well-tolerated. Also, patients require weekly injections, and with many side effects, compliance remains a big issue.  Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) treatment is contraindicated in patients who have suicidal tendencies, psychiatric disorder, autoimmune conditions, pregnancy, decompensated cirrhosis, and blood dyscrasias.

Treatment with oral agents like tenofovir or entecavir usually continues for 1 to 2 years; however, almost all patients require indefinite therapy as withdrawal of treatment usually results in relapse. The advantages of treating with tenofovir or entecavir include ease of administration and infrequent side effects as these drugs have an excellent safety profile and are well-tolerated.  Tenofovir is contraindicated in children and can cause renal insufficiency, decreased bone density, Fanconi syndrome, and proximal tubular acidosis; however, these side effects are rare. Patients with renal insufficiency should have their tenofovir dose adjusted. Entecavir should be used cautiously in patients with decompensated liver disease and renal insufficiency and can cause headaches, cough, fatigue, and abdominal pain, but the side effects usually remain mild. Patients who cannot receive pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) treatment usually tolerate these oral agents well. These agents have a very potent antiviral effect with viral suppression seen in more than 95% of patients over five years with the prevention of cirrhosis and fibrosis regression.  However, due to its indefinite duration of therapy, more studies are required to evaluate long-term safety and risk of drug resistance. Effectiveness of combination therapy with two oral agents or one oral agent with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) is not well established and is currently being studied.

**Hepatitis C**

Treatment of hepatitis C virus infection divides into two categories, treatment of an acute HCV infection and chronic HCV infection.

**Acute Hepatitis C Infection**

Acute hepatitis C infection is usually not detected frequently, but when detected, early interferon therapy is an option. Data regarding the efficacy of early interferon therapy is limited, but some studies have shown a sustained virologic response as in chronic hepatitis C virus infection treatment, which is defined as an undetectable serum hepatitis C virus RNA 6 months after completion of treatment. It must be kept in mind, however, that the patients in whom acute hepatitis C virus infection is detected may still be able to eliminate the infection spontaneously. Therefore, the antiviral therapy may be started six months after the hepatitis C virus infection is diagnosed depending on case by case basis except in cases of acute HCV infection after liver transplantation where the antiviral therapy should start immediately.

**Chronic Hepatitis C Infection**

The main goal of treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus infection is the eradication of the hepatitis C virus, with secondary goals being reducing symptoms, prevent or delay the progression of chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, and treat extrahepatic complications of the hepatitis C virus infection like glomerulonephritis and cryoglobulinemia. Pegylated interferon alfa-2b and alfa-2a have been the drug of choice for more than two decades and are used along with ribavirin as a combination therapy. This combination therapy is usually given for a duration of 24 weeks to 48 weeks, depending on the genotype of the hepatitis C virus. Treatment with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) has shown sustained virologic response with the eradication of hepatitis C virus RNA and a reduction in the rate of fibrosis progression. Therapy should be selected based on individual patient profile, patient or provider preference, safety, efficacy, and cost of the treatment and risks of drug resistance. Patients must understand in advance that eradication of the hepatitis C virus can not be achieved in every case and may not always be necessary to achieve the desired clinical result.  Patients who have extrahepatic manifestations like glomerulonephritis or non-Hodgkin lymphoma can benefit from partial suppression of the hepatitis C virus through the treatment, which can stabilize their renal function or progression of malignancy, respectively.

Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin treatment both are known to have side effects and can create compliance issues in patients.  Interferon therapy has many side effects, including fatigue, joint pain, flu-like symptoms, emotional irritability, hair loss, depression, bone marrow suppression, etc. Ribavirin can cause rash and hemolytic anemia. Due to bone marrow suppression caused by interferon and hemolytic anemia caused by Ribavirin, patients require routine lab work and close follow-up.  Patients with leukopenia and anemia may need administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and erythropoietin administration. Also, thrombocytopenia remains a common side effect with interferon therapy; this is especially important because patients who have hepatitis C virus-induced cirrhosis may have thrombocytopenia at baseline, which can become severe due to interferon therapy and can cause complications of bleeding. Patients who have hepatitis C virus-induced cirrhosis and thrombocytopenia with platelet counts lower than 70,000/µL are sometimes treated with eltrombopag which was approved by FDA in 2008 originally for treatment of thrombocytopenia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) however eltrombopag is known to cause venous thromboembolism and drug-induced liver injury and should be used cautiously and only if required.

In the last decade, antiviral treatment for hepatitis C virus infection has improved dramatically with development of newer therapeutic oral agents called direct-acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) including simeprevir, sofosbuvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, etc. showing very high cure rates regardless of negative factors like unfavorable HCV genotype, coexisting HIV infection or high viral load. These agents are taken for 8 to 12 weeks and are very effective with viral eradication, are well tolerated and have less side effects however the number of people receiving the treatment remains low due to the cost of treatment, insurance denials, lack of willingness of providers to treat the HCV-infected person with these medications and certain factors like homelessness and substance use that can impact medication compliance.

**Hepatitis D**

Patients who are coinfected with the hepatitis D virus and hepatitis B virus usually receive treatment with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN). Oral nucleoside or nucleotide analogs have limited or no efficacy and are not useful. Unfortunately, the treatment of hepatitis D has not changed in a long time, and pegylated interferon remains the only effective treatment. In one study, patients who had hepatitis D virus infection with coexisting HIV infection had therapy with tenofovir, which showed good efficacy. Still, the exact mechanism of this efficacy is not known, and more studies are required.

**Hepatitis E**

Treatment for acute hepatitis E infection is supportive. Immunosuppressed patients and solid organ transplant recipients can develop chronic hepatitis E infection and can have treatment with ribavirin. Pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) has been used successfully but was associated with many adverse effects like cholestasis.

**Hepatitis G**

There is currently no recommended treatment for hepatitis G.  Patients who develop liver cirrhosis have treatment with similar treatment modalities used to treat cirrhosis of any other etiology.

**Autoimmune Hepatitis**

The mainstay of treatment has been the use of corticosteroids alone or in combination with azathioprine. The majority of patients respond to initial therapy and go into remission; however, once the treatment ceases, the majority of patients relapse as well. Treatment is necessary for patients who have tenfold or more greater than the upper limit of normal serum AST levels, fivefold or more greater than the upper limit of normal serum AST levels and twofold or more greater than the upper limit of normal serum gammaglobulin level or bridging necrosis on the histologic exam. Timely treatment initiation in these patients results in the slowing of disease progression. Patients who have inactive cirrhosis, intolerance to medications, and pre-existing comorbid conditions usually do not receive treatment. Patients who have end-stage decompensated liver disease are usually referred for liver transplantation and not started on medications.

Once liver function tests normalize after initial therapy, prednisone dosing tapers off, and patients are put on maintenance therapy with azathioprine alone.  Azathioprine therapy usually terminates one year after liver function tests remain within the reference range. In the initial phases of treatment, liver enzymes need frequently checking. If enzymes do not return to the reference values in the first two months of therapy, steroid dose needs to increase. Those patients who do not tolerate prednisone well can try on budesonide as an alternative agent. Cyclosporine has been used in several studies as well and has shown good efficacy. Treatment usually stops if patients achieve remission, develop significant side effects from therapy, or have an incomplete or no response to therapy.

Patients who achieve remission report significant improvement in symptoms with aminotransferases. They return to the reference value range and a reduction in inflammatory activity on liver biopsy. These patients can be tapered off steroids over a few months and later on can stop azathioprine as well.  The typical duration of treatment is approximately two years before the withdrawal of treatment is considered. Histologic changes on the liver biopsy often lag behind clinical and laboratory improvement by 3 to 6 months, which the clinician should consider before stopping the treatment. A small number of patients deteriorate with worsening of their symptoms, laboratory markers, and histologic features while being on combination therapy. Fulminant hepatic failure can happen in these patients, and they have a high short-term mortality rate. These patients should be put on high-dose prednisone alone or in combination with azathioprine.  Patients who do not tolerate high-dose prednisone should have a trial of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, or budesonide. If they do not respond to these medications also, then they should be considered for early liver transplantation. Some patients respond only partially to the treatment and have some improvement in the symptoms, lab values, and liver histology but cannot satisfy remission criteria. These patients require indefinite treatment with frequent dose adjustments as necessary to prevent relapse or further deterioration. These patients should also be monitored for early signs of hepatic decompensation and should obtain a referral for early liver transplantation.

Patients who experience significant side effects from therapy should also stop the treatment. Long-term use of corticosteroids can cause many adverse effects, including acne, hirsutism, cushingoid features, cardiac arrhythmias, diabetes mellitus, mood swings, osteoporosis, fractures, hypertension, cataracts. Azathioprine can cause cholestasis, nausea, vomiting, pancytopenia, pancreatitis, and rash; however, most of the patients tolerate azathioprine better than high-dose steroids. Each patient requires an individual assessment for side effects, and dose should be adjusted, or treatment should be withdrawn depending on the severity of the side effects and treatment tolerability. Patients should receive calcium and vitamin D supplementation to prevent the development of osteoporosis, and bone density scans are an annual requirement. If patients end up developing osteoporosis, then it should be treated with bisphosphonate therapy. Patients on azathioprine therapy should also have a routine complete blood count.

About half the patients experience relapse within six months after the treatment is withdrawn, and the majority of patients experience relapse within three years of treatment. Patients who experience relapse are usually put back on the original treatment regimen, and most of them experience remission; however, after stopping the treatment the second time, many patients experience relapse again. Patients who relapse twice will receive indefinite low-dose combination therapy.  Therapy should not stop or undergo abrupt withdrawal as it can result in a severe life-threatening exacerbation.

Patients who do not tolerate therapy do not respond to treatment or have decompensated cirrhosis need a referral for liver transplantation.  Recurrence of autoimmune hepatitis after liver transplantation is rare, and usually, the long-term outlook is excellent. Patients who have autoimmune hepatitis-primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome will have treatment with ursodiol in combination with immunosuppressive therapy.

**Alcoholic Hepatitis**

Patients with mild alcoholic hepatitis do not require treatment and should be counseled for alcohol cessation, maintain proper nutrition, and should take supplemental vitamins, including folic acid and thiamine. Patients who have significant coagulopathy should receive vitamin K. Patients who are at high risk of experiencing alcohol withdrawal should obtain appropriate treatment. Patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis have high mortality, on the other hand, compared to patients with mild alcoholic hepatitis. These patients can present with various complications like hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, and should be hospitalized for closer monitoring. Patients can benefit from steroids in the short-term, but in the long-run, only alcohol abstinence is effective. After maintaining alcohol abstinence for 6 to 12 months, alcoholic hepatitis continues to improve and usually resolve in a few years. Patients who have difficulty abstaining from alcohol should attend a rehabilitation program. Malnourishment is common in patients with alcoholic hepatitis, and patients should be encouraged to take about 60 to 100 grams of dietary protein per day, except when patients have hepatic encephalopathy. Patients with ascites with suspicion for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis should be treated with antibiotics empirically. Liver transplantation can be an option in end-stage liver disease, but patients must abstain from alcohol for at least six months before they are candidates for transplantation.
