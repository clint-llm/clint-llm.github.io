These are not actually the issues of concern but some of the unique features of the lung.

- The early prenatal development of the lungs depicts the development of an exocrine tubule-alveolar gland. Initially, it begins an offshoot from the endoderm of the foregut as a lung bud. Later, branches to form the tracheobronchial tree and canalizes. This is precisely how the glands develop. Hence initial development of the lung is said to be **pseudo-glandular development**** **

- The lung alveoli start developing in the prenatal stage and very important for a live birth with the active secretion of surfactant from its type II pneumocytes. Nevertheless, 95% of alveoli are formed postnatally during the first eight years of life, that too a majority being in the first three years.

- The lymphoid tissue of the tracheobronchial system is modified to contain diffuse, aggregated, and solitary lymphatic nodules specialized to be called **bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT)**. This is important for the hypersensitive reaction, which occurs with respiration. They also have a significant role in the defensive mechanism from the exposed microorganisms form, reaching the lungs through the inhaled air.
