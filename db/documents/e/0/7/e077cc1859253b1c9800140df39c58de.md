In addition to the laser itself, safety goggles rated for protection at 2,940 nm are required for all members of the healthcare team present during the treatment to avoid corneal injury. The Er:YAG laser delivers energy in the near-infrared range so that the goggles will appear transparent to the naked eye. The patient should either receive safety goggles or steel eye shields, depending on where the laser is to be applied. Whenever lasers are in use, particularly if there will be an oxygen source, a fire extinguisher should be readily available, as well as a container of water with which to douse the fire, if necessary. Additionally, to combat smoke and microorganism particulate inhalation, there should be a smoke evacuator with an ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) filter present, and healthcare team members should wear laser-rated masks rather than standard surgical masks.
