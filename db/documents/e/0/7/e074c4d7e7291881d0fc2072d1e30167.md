A point mutation in the beta-globin chain of the hemoglobin causes sickle cell disease. Specifically, it occurs when a single base from A to T in the codon for glutamic acid at position 6 is changed to valine of the beta-globin. If this mutation affects both beta-globin chains, sickle cell anemia occurs; if only one chain is involved, it results in the sickle cell trait.
