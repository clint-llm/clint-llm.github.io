Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm can be either congenital or acquired. Embryologically, sinus of Valsalva aneurysm forms first as a blind diverticulum secondary to pressure forces on the aortic root. Congenital sinus of Valsalva aneurysm has been linked to connective tissue diseases, such as Marfan's syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Congenital Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm may be associated with bicuspid aortic valves.

Acquired forms of sinus of Valsalva aneurysm may also be seen with connective tissue disease. Infectious etiologies that weaken elastic tissue and are associated with acquired Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm include syphilis, bacterial endocarditis, and tuberculosis. Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm may also occur secondary to chronic changes of atherosclerosis and medial cystic necrosis. Chest trauma and iatrogenic injury during aortic valve surgery have been reported as causes of acquired Sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. Vasculitic diseases, such as Takayasu's Arteritis, may lead to a formation of the sinus of Valsalva aneurysm.
