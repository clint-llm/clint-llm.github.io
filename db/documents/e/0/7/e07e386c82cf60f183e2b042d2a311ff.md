Zolpidem, a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agent, works as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a receptor chloride channel modulator/agonist that increases GABA inhibitory effects leading to sedation. The GABAa receptor, also called GABA-BZ, is found in the sensorimotor cortical regions, globus pallidus, inferior colliculus, pons, ventral thalamic complex, olfactory bulb, cerebellum, and substantial in the brain. The drug upregulates these receptors allowing for the sedative effects leading to the preservation of deep sleep.

Differing from benzodiazepines, which non-selectively bind to and activate all benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor subtypes, zolpidem in vitro binds the BZ1 receptor preferentially with a high-affinity ratio of the alpha1/alpha5 subunits.
