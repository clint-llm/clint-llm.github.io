**Macroscopy**

Tubular carcinoma often presents like an ill-defined grey to a white, firm or hard mass measuring between 0.2 cm and 2 cm in diameter; most are 1.5 cm or less.

**Histopathology**

The characteristic feature of tubular carcinoma is the predominance of open tubules composed of a single layer of epithelial cells enclosing a clear lumen. These should comprise over 90% of the tumor. The tubules are generally an admixture of oval or rounded and angulated shapes and arranged haphazardly. The cells are small to moderate in size, regular with little nuclear pleomorphism, inconspicuous nucleoli, and scanty mitotic figures. Myoepithelial cells are absent around the tubules, but some may have an incomplete surrounding layer of the basement membrane. A secondary but essential feature is the cellular desmoplastic stroma, commonly accompanying the tubular structures. Tubular carcinoma occurs in association with flat epithelial atypia, low-grade ductal carcinoma in situ, and less commonly tubular neoplasia

**Immunohistochemistry**

Tubular carcinoma is nearly always positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors has a low growth fraction and is typically negative for HER2, EGFR, P-cadherin, p53, and high molecular weight keratins.
