Dermatosis papulosa nigra (DPN) is a benign epidermal growth that presents as hyperpigmented or skin-colored papules that develop on the face and neck beginning in adolescence. Most healthcare workers including nurse practitioners are probably unfamiliar with this skin disorder, hence referral to a dermatologist is recommended. The key reason patients seek care is for cosmesis.
