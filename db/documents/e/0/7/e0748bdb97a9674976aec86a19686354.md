Pityriasis rotunda is a rare skin disorder which is not easy tp diagnose. The condition may be seen by the primary care provider or nurse practitioner but because of the complexity in diagnosis, it is best managed by a dermatologist. Once diagnosed, the management of pityriasis rotunda is often challenging. Topical corticosteroids, antifungal agents, emollients, tars, and keratolytic topicals (salicylic acid and lactic acid) are poorly efficient. Retinoids, either topicals (retinoic acid and tazarotene) or oral (etretinate) have been used with little or no success in pityriasis rotunda. Treatment with vitamin D3 analogs such as calcipotriolÂ leads to a progressive improvement in the lesions in a small number of patients. The skin condition can take months or even years to disappear.

However, for patients with comorbidities, successful treatment of the underlying disease often leads to remission of pityriasis rotunda lesions. Because of the few cases, there are no evidence based guidelines on the management of this disorder.
