Among the cutaneous lymphomas, nearly two-thirds are of the T cell type. The most common immunophenotype is CD4 positive. In mycosis fungoides, there is a clonal expansion of CD4 cells that often lack the normal T cell antigens like CD7, CD5 or CD 2. These cells are attracted towards the skin by keratinocytes. As the cells accumulate in the dermis, they cluster around the langerhanÂ cells- which is known as Pautrier microabscesses. Some of the malignant cells travel to the local lymph nodes and then pass into the bloodstream where they circulate with other CLA-positive T cells.
