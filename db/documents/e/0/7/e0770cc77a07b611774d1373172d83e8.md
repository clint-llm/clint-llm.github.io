Despite current research developments on the cellular mechanisms of edema, edema development requires alteration in one or more Starling forces in the direction favoring increased net filtration and/or inadequate removal of filtered fluid by lymphatic drainage. Possible alterations include elevated capillary hydrostatic pressure, increased capillary permeability, higher interstitial oncotic pressure, lower plasma oncotic pressure, lymphatic obstruction, or a combination of these factors.

Several factors protect against edema including increased lymphatic flow and contractility in the presence of tissue edema and/or removal of excessive fluid. Fluid entry in the interstitium ultimately raises the interstitial hydraulic pressure and thus reduces the pressure gradient to favor filtration. Fluid entry into the interstitium also lowers interstitial oncotic pressure by dilution and lymphatic removal of interstitial proteins.
