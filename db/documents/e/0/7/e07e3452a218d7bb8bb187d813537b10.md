Positional brachycephaly primarily raises aesthetic concerns. Reliable evidence of its effect on the neurological development of affected infants is lacking. Conversely, untreated synostotic brachycephaly may impede volumetric brain growth and development, is associated with elevated ICP in infants, and has a high incidence of intracranial hypertension in older untreated patients.

Cognitive and behavioral difficulties in those affected have been previously suggested to have some relationship with elevated ICP.
