Intestinal stomas play an important role in the management of many gastrointestinal diseases. Hartman's end colostomy, loop colostomy, and ileostomy are the most usual stomas performed in surgical practice. Indications for these procedures in older persons differ from those in children. At present, colorectal cancer is the most common indication for stoma creation in adults. Unlike adults, intestinal stoma in children can manage congenital malformations of the intestine, such as Hirschsprung's disease and anorectal malformation.
