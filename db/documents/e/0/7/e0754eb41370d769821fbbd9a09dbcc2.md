Treatment of dengue depends on the patient's illness phase. Those presenting early without any warning signs can be treated on an outpatient basis with acetaminophen and adequate oral fluids. Such patients should receive an explanation regarding the danger signs and be asked to report to the hospital immediately if they notice any. Patients with warning signs, severe dengue, or other situations like infancy, elderly, pregnancy, diabetes, and those living alone need to be admitted. Those with warning signs can be initiated on IV crystalloids, and the fluid rate is titrated based on the patient's response. Colloids can be started for patients in shock and are also preferred if the patient has already received previous boluses of crystalloid and has not responded. Blood transfusion is warranted in case of severe bleeding or suspected bleeding when the patient remains unstable, and hematocrit falls despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Platelet transfusion is considered when platelet count drops to <20,000 cells/microliter, and there is a high risk of bleeding. Avoid giving aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and other anticoagulants. No antiviral medications are recommended.

No laboratory tests can predict the progression to severe disease.
