A variety of theories have been used to explain the etiology of neurosarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis affects the lymphoreticular system, characterized by cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  Due to the distribution of lymphatics, the spleen and liver can also be affected. Neurosarcoidosis results from sarcoid granulomas within the nervous system. Pathologically, lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes surround a noncaseating epithelioid cell granuloma. Symptoms result from the location of where the granulomas lie in the nervous system. For example, granulomas in the muscle may cause myositis, while granulomas in the nerve within the perineurium and epineurium may cause axonal damage and as a result peripheral neuropathy. Nerve injury may cause diffuse polyneuropathy, mononeuritis multiplex, and polyradiculopathy due to spinal root sheath involvement.
