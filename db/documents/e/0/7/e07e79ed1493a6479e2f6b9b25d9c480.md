Prophylaxis against IE is not recommended in patients at risk of IE for other non-dental procedures, such as a transesophageal echocardiogram, esophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, or cystoscopy, in the absence of active infection. There is no indication for dental, gastrointestinal, or genitourinary procedural prophylaxis for patients with implantable cardiovascular devices. However, prophylaxis with an anti-staphylococcal antibiotic is indicated at the time of cardiovascular device implantation and any subsequent manipulation of the surgically created device pocket.

For patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery, antibiotic prophylaxis is not needed for dental procedures, as there is no increased risk of long-term infection.  Similarly, antibiotic prophylaxis is not needed for dental procedures for patients with coronary artery stents.
