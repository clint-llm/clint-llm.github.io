The FPL muscle is the primary flexor of the thumb, providing flexion at its metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint and interphalangeal (IP) joint. Additionally, FPL has minor contributions in radial wrist deviation and wrist flexion.

FPL arises on the volar aspect of the radius and the adjacent interosseous membrane, just distal to the radial tuberosity. Its proximal attachment lies distal to the supinator muscle, as well as deep and radial to the radial head of the flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS). The muscle tapers into a long, flat tendon that courses superficial to the pronator quadratus muscle and directly lateral to the index finger tendon of FDS. The FPL tendon, now covered by the synovial sheath of the radial bursa, travels through the carpal tunnel passing deep to the transverse carpal ligament (flexor retinaculum)

The thumb’s flexor pulley system consists of the three annular ligaments (A1, Av, A2) and one oblique ligament. The order of ligaments proximally to distally is A1, Av, oblique, A2. The oblique ligament is the most important pulley for the FPL tendon.
