- If a patient with unstable SVT were to lose his or her pulse at any point, treatment would default to the ACLS algorithm for PEA.

- If a patient with unstable VT with a pulse were to lose his or her pulse at any point, treatment would default to the ACLS algorithm for VF.

- If a patient were to develop VF, the monitor/defibrillator needs to be taken out of the "synchronize" mode, as defibrillation will not be possible while the machine is searching for a QRS complex.
