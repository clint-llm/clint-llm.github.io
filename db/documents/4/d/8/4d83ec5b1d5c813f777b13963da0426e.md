The cerebellum receives its blood supply from 3 arteries that branch out from the posterior circulation of the brain (also called the vertebrobasilar arterial system, which is the collective term for the 2 vertebral arteries and the basilar artery).

- **Superior Cerebellar Artery (SCA):**branches off from the superior part of the basilar artery and supplies the superior part of the cerebellum

- **Anterior Inferior Cerebellar Artery (AICA):**branches off from the middle part of the basilar artery and supplies the anterior-inferior segment of the cerebellum.

- **Posterior Inferior Cerebellar Arteries (PICA):**branches off from the vertebral arteries and supplies the posterior cerebellum and the inferior cerebellar peduncle.
