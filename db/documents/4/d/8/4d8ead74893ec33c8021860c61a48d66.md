Rhabdomyolysis is commonly seen in medical practice; elevated CPK levels are the most sensitive test for diagnosis. Aggressive fluid resuscitation with isotonic fluids, normal saline should be given to maintain a urine output goal of 200 to 300 mL/h. Identification and removal of the offending agent minimize further muscle injury. Examinations, laboratory tests should be obtained in the early identification of complications like compartment syndrome, pulmonary edema, acute kidney injury, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Patient education and avoiding the offending agent in the future should be a part of discharge planning.
