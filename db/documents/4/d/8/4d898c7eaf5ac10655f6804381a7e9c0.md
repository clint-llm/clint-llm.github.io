Cyclophosphamide is a type of nitrogen mustard drug which exerts its effects through the alkylation of DNA. The drug is not cell-cycle phase-specific and metabolizes to an active form capable of inhibiting protein synthesis through DNA and RNA crosslinking.

The majority of the antineoplastic effects of cyclophosphamide are due to the phosphoramide mustard formed from the metabolism of the drug by liver enzymes like cytochrome P-450. Hepatic enzymes first convert cyclophosphamide to hydroxycyclophosphamide and then subsequently metabolized to aldophosphamide. Aldophosphamide is cleaved to the active alkylating agent phosphoramide mustard and acrolein. The phosphoramide metabolite forms cross-linkages within and between adjacent DNA strands at the guanine N-7 position. These modifications are permanent and eventually lead to programmed cell death.

In addition to antimitotic and antineoplastic effects, cyclophosphamide has immunosuppressive effects and selectivity for T cells. High-dose cyclophosphamide is used in eradication therapy of malignant hematopoietic cells, while lower dosages have shown merit for use in selective immunomodulation of regulatory T cells. The drug decreases the secretion of interferon-gamma and IL-12 while increasing the secretion of Th2 cytokines like IL-4 and IL-10 in the CSF and peripheral blood.
