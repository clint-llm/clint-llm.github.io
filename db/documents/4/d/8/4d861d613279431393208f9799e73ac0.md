Entrapment neuropathies are common disorders which lead to significant disability. Correct diagnosis is essential for proper management. History taking and physical examination are a cornerstone in the diagnosis of the ilioinguinal neuralgia. Patients of ilioinguinal neuralgia complain of pain (mostly postsurgical) in the lateral aspect of the iliac fossa, lower abdomen, and upper thigh, as well as abnormal sensation in the cutaneous distribution of the nerve (hyperesthesia orÂ hypoesthesia). The pain is often burning in nature, continuous, and may radiate to the scrotal or inguinal region.

On examination, there is tenderness on palpation 1 inch medial and inferior to the anterior superior iliac spine and impaired sensation along the sensory distribution of the nerve. Complete neurologic examination is mandatory to exclude genitofemoral neuralgia, lumbosacral radiculopathy, and plexopathy.
