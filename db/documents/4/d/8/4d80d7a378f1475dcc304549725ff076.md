Retinal traction detachmentÂ is an ocular complication of many systemic disorders, including DM, HTN, sickle cell disease, and premature birth. The visual prognosis depends largely on the systemic control of the parameters. Coordination of the ophthalmologist with the physician, endocrinologist, nephrologist, neurologist, cardiologist, hematologist, and neonatologist is very important. Coordination of the nursing staff for the preoperative surgical preparation and preoperative systemic stabilization is essential. Since these patients have a guarded visual prognosis, psychological counseling may be needed for the management of depression.
