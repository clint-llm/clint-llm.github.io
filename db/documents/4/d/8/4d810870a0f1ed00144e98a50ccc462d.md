Cutis marmorata telangiectatica (CMTC) is a rare, sporadic, congenital cutaneous vascular disorder of unknown etiology. CMTC usually presents at birth with persistent cutis marmorata, vascular telangiectasia, and occasionally, ulcers. There is typically improvement of this reticular vascular skin pattern during the first year with gradual improvement in time. Some infants with CMTC have been associated with musculoskeletal anomalies, vascular abnormalities, cardiac defects, neurological defects, and ocular anomalies. This activity reviews the workup of cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita and describes the role of health professionals working together to manage this condition.
