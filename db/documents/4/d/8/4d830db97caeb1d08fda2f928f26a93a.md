The assassination of Kim Jong-nam with VX in the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in February 2017 and the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal with a 'Novichok' (Russian for 'newcomer') nerve agent in the United Kingdom in March 2018 serve as examples of how nerve agent attacks with even one or two victims will quickly become international news. Once a patient has been diagnosed with a V-series nerve agent exposure, healthcare providers will be responsible for communicating not only numerous colleagues and staff but also with public health officials, law enforcement agencies, members of the media, and elected officials. The marshaling of resources to respond will almost certainly reach the national and international levels. (Level V)

Important communication points early in the care of the patient among physicians, nurses, and pharmacists will include adequate decontamination of the patient and appropriate precautions for first responders and hospital staff to avoid additional casualties. Training and education prior to such an event will be more effective than just-in-time training after an event has occurred when emotions run high and resources may run low. In large-scale events, it will be essential for healthcare staff to have a clear understanding of their available resources, and continuously communicating with government officials to access medical supply stockpiles and resources for the capacity to treat large numbers of patients will be vital.
