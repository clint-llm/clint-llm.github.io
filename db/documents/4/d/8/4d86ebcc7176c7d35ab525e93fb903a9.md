Diagnosis is initially guided by the clinical presentation of the affected individual. This includes intermittent paralysis and/or paratonia after certain triggers. Diagnosis is based primarily on several criteria, which include a history of transient episodes of weakness, ictal serum potassium levels, electromyography, and exclusion of secondary causes. The proposed diagnostic criteria are as follows: 2 or more attacks of weakness with serum potassium greater than 4.5 mEq/L or 1 attack in the patient with a relative with 1 attack with serum potassium greater than 4.5 mEq/L.

In addition, 3 of the 6 following clinical or laboratory features can also assist in making a diagnosis: symptom onset before age 30; attacks must last less than 2 hours, identifiable triggers, myotonia, family history, confirmed genetic testing for sodium channel mutation in the SCN4A, or positive McManis short exercise test.

Historically, provocative tests were utilized to establish a diagnosis. However, due to the risk of inducing severe attacks, they are no longer recommended. Muscle biopsy is not recommended due to the lack of specific findings as well as the lack of influence on management.
