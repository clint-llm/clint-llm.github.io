All class III (potassium channel blockers) antiarrhythmic drugs are proarrhythmic. Therefore, physicians should take extreme care when prescribing dofetilide to patients.

Toxic manifestations are usually an extension of pharmacological activity (e.g., torsade de pointes). Oral dofetilide doses of 500 mcg twice daily have correlations with an increased risk of developing torsades de pointes; there is a report of sudden death in one patient. A patient received two 500 mcg dofetilide doses one hour apart and developed ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest 2 hours after the second dose.

The most likely side effect of overdose is the excessive lengthening of the QT interval.

There is no known remedy for dofetilide overdoses; treatment of dofetilide overdose is supportive and symptomatic. Start cardiac monitoring with ECG. A charcoal slurry given within the first 15 minutes of administration is useful. Pharmacological management of dofetilide overdose and torsades de pointes may include isoproterenol, with or without cardiac pacing, and magnesium sulfate; beta-blockers have also been used.
