Traumatic brain injury includes several types of insults to the parenchyma of the brain. One of the most severe forms of damage is a hemorrhagic cerebral contusion. Traumatic brain injuries that are associated with cerebral contusions are closely related to death and disability. This activity describes the evaluation and management of cerebral contusions and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of cerebral contusions.
- Review the appropriate evaluation of cerebral contusions.
- Outline the management options available for cerebral contusions.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication in patients with cerebral contusions to improve outcomes.
