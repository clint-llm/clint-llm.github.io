Lenticonus is a very rare congenital ocular anomaly in which there is a conical protrusion of the lenticular capsule and the cortical matter beneath it. The lenticonus usually ranges from 2 to 7 mm. In lenticonus, the conical bulge can be anterior or posterior. Bilateral involvement is suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance. Sometimes the bulge can be spherical instead of conical. In such cases, it is called lentiglobus. In lenticonus cases, there is usually a reduction in visual acuity and irregular astigmatism, which is generally not reversible with spectacle or contact lenses. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography is a valuable tool to assess posterior capsular status. The management rests on spectacles, contact lenses, lens extraction, and IOL implantation. In not managed early in the course of life, these patients are prone to amblyopia, cataract, squint, and central fixation loss, as seen in cases with posterior lenticonus. Lenticonus can be anterior as well as posterior. This activity describes the etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, investigations, management options, complications, and prognosis of lenticonus.
