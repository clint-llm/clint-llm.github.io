Evaluation of the complete blood count (CBC) usually reveals anemia or pancytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy and aspirate are usually performed after exclusion of other causes of their cytopenias. There is no one histopathologic feature that defines MDS but rather a constellation of findings from the peripheral blood and bone marrow which meet the accepted criteria for diagnosis. Additional diagnostic workup includes flow cytometry immunophenotyping, cytogenetics with karyotype and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), along with genetic profiling to assess for relevant somatic mutations.

During evaluation of a bone marrow biopsy, a pathologist will determine marrow cellularity, the number of blasts, dysplasia of the megakaryocyte lineage, the presence ofÂ ring sideroblasts by iron stains, fibrosis, as well as exclusion of metastases from outside the bone marrow. Bone marrow evaluation is performed using Giemsa and iron stains. The bone marrow is typically normocellular or hypercellular, though it can be hypocellular. Dysplasia in more than 10% of a single cell lineage is part of the diagnostic criteria for MDS and can be seen in red cell precursors, granulocytes and/or megakaryocytes.

Relevant immunostains are performed such as myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD34, CD117, CD61 or CD42b for megakaryocytes, CD68 for monocytes, CD20 for B-cell lineage and CD3 for T-cell lineage.
