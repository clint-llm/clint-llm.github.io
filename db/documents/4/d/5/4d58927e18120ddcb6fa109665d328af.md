While an ophthalmologist is almost always responsible for detecting drusen bodies on fundoscopic examinations, there are other roles to play in possibly preventing progression to AMD. Extensive studies on the modifiable and unmodifiable risk factors for the progression of drusen deposits to AMD are currently ongoing. Increasing age seems to be the most consistent unmodifiable risk factor for progression to AMD; however, female sex, Caucasian race, and certain genetic markers have a higher risk for AMD.

Primary care physicians, nurse practitioners, and other members of an interprofessional team play a vital role in the recognition and prevention of AMD. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes that there is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on screening for visual acuity in elderly adults with grade I evidence.
