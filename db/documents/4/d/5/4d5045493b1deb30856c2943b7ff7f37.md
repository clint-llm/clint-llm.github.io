There are no specific clinical criteria for congenital smooth muscle hamartoma. The diagnosis merits consideration in cases of any hairy plaque on the skin. It may resemble other skin conditions, especially Beckerâ€™s hamartoma. Because the condition presents at birth, nurses, pediatricians, and obstetricians should be familiar with the disorder. These healthcare professionals should be able to differentiate a congenital smooth muscle hamartoma from a congenital melanocytic nevus since it displays potential malignancy and requires different medical management.
