N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is the mainstay of therapy for acetaminophen toxicity. NAC has Federal and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of potentially hepatotoxic doses of acetaminophen (APAP), and it is almost 100% effective if given within 8 hours post-ingestion.

NAC has also been investigated for use in xenobiotics with free radical or reactive metabolite toxicity. There is good evidence to show it is of benefits in acute exposures to cyclopeptide containing mushrooms and carbon tetrachloride.

Other potential applications, but still in the experimental stage, include NAC being used as an antineoplastic agent as well as for psychiatric conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, gastrointestinal conditions like hepatorenal syndrome, Helicobacter pylori infections, necrotizing enterocolitis, critical care patients like lung injury, cardiac injury, multiorgan dysfunction, sepsis and hematological conditions like sickle cell disease.

There are case reports of NAC helping with improving neurological status in patients comatose with carbon monoxide poisoning.
