**ACC/AHA 1997****and Updated 2002 Guideline Indications for Exercise Stress Testing:**

**Class I**

- Patients (including those with right bundle branch block or less than 1 mm resting ST depression) having an intermediate pretest probability of CAD based on gender, age, and symptoms

- Patients with known CAD who have a change in clinical status

- Low-risk (of short term death or myocardial infarction (MI)) unstable angina patients who have been free of active symptoms for at least 8 to 12 hours

- Intermediate-risk (of short term death or MI) unstable angina patients who have been free of active symptoms for at least 2 to 3 days

- Post-MI (>4 days from the event) patients for evaluation of prognostic assessment, activity prescription, and evaluation of medical therapy

**Class IIa**

- Patients with intermediate-risk (of short term death or MI) unstable angina patients who have normal initial cardiac markers (drawn at least 6-12 hours after onset of symptoms) and serial EKGs without dynamic changes

- Evaluation of known or suspected exercise-induced arrhythmias

- After discharge in post-revascularization patients for evaluation of prognostic assessment, activity prescription, and evaluation of medical therapy

**Class IIb**

- Patients who have a high or low pretest probability of CAD by age, symptoms, and gender

- Exercise capacity evaluation of patients with valvular heart disease (excluding severe aortic stenosis)

**American College of Cardiology Foundation (ACCF) and the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) Appropriate Criteria**

A mean score of 7-9 implies society recommends stress nuclear MPI as the appropriate test for the given indication, whereas 1-3 indicates inappropriate.

**Recommended as Appropriate (Appropriateness Score (AS) 7-9):**

- The intermediate to high pretest probability of CAD for patients with stable angina, an uninterpretable EKG, and inability to exercise (AS 9)

- The intermediate pretest probability of CAD for patients with stable angina, an interpretable EKG, and ability to exercise (AS 7)

- The high pretest probability of CAD for patients with stable angina, an interpretable EKG, and ability to exercise (AS 8)

- The intermediate pretest probability of CAD for patients with acute chest pain but negative cardiac enzymes and no STE on EKG (AS 9) (AS 1 for high pretest probability with ST elevations)

- Prior indeterminant exercise treadmill test (AS 9)

- New-onset heart failure or LV systolic dysfunction and moderate Framingham risk of coronary heart disease with stable angina (AS 8) and without chest pain symptoms (AS 7.5)

**American College of Cardiology Foundation Appropriateness Criteria Task Force and American Society of Echocardiography Appropriate Criteria**

A mean score of 7-9 implies society recommends stress echocardiography as the appropriate test for the given indication, whereas 1-3 indicates inappropriate.

**Recommended as Appropriate (Appropriateness Score(AS) 7-9):**

- The low pretest probability of CAD for patients with stable angina, with either an uninterpretable EKG or inability to exercise (AS 7)

- The intermediate pretest probability of CAD for patients with stable angina, with an interpretable EKG and inability to exercise (AS 7)

- The intermediate pretest probability of CAD for patients with stable angina, with either an uninterpretable EKG or inability to exercise (AS 9)

- The high pretest probability of CAD for patients with stable angina, regardless of EKG interpretability or ability to exercise (AS 7)

- The intermediate pretest probability of CAD for patients with acute chest pain but negative cardiac enzymes and no dynamic EKG changes (AS 8) (AS 1 for high pretest probability with ST elevations)

- Prior equivocal exercise treadmill test (AS 8)

- The intermediate pretest probability of CAD and new-onset heart failure and normal LV systolic function for patients with stable angina (AS 8)

- Moderate Framingham risk and new-onset heart failure and normal LV systolic function for patients without chest pain (AS 7)

**Selecting the Best Stress Method and Imaging Modality:**

Most intermediate-pretest probability patients with an interpretable EKG capable of exercising are candidates for exercise treadmill testing (ETT) (Class I, LOE A in ACC/AHA guidelines). Uninterpretable EKGs include patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB), paced-rhythm, pre-excitation, digoxin use, and a resting STD >1 mm, which is common in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).

Imaging improves the sensitivity and specificity of identifying CAD.

Stress can be induced via treadmill or bike exercise or pharmacologic agents. Pharmacologic stress is reserved primarily for patients with functional impairments such as arthritis or peripheral neuropathy. Exercise is preferred to pharmacological when able, as it offers additional prognostic information. Symptom limiting exercise capacity less than five metabolic equivalents (METS) carries a poor prognosis.

Given limited studies on pregnant females, an exercise echocardiogram stress test is preferred in this population to avoid any unnecessary pharmacological or radiation exposure.

**Stress Echo:**(88% sensitivity, 83% specificity)

**Advantages**

- No radiation exposure, ideal in young females

- Cost-effective

- Additional insight to structural, such as valvular or pericardial, pathology, diastolic function, and pulmonary pressures

- Also offers viability assessment, identifying stunned and hibernating myocardium

**Disadvantages**

- Post-exercise imaging is time-sensitive, need to acquire images within 1 minute of exercise termination

- Highly dependent on sonographer and interpreter skills

- Diagnostic accuracy reduced by excessive tachycardia, arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, COPD, obesity,****or other cause of poor sonographic windows

**Stress Nuclear MPI:**(86% Sensitivity, 74% specificity)

**Advantages**

- Most sensitive for detecting single-vessel disease

- Best for patients with LBBB or pacemakers causing abnormal septal motion

**Disadvantages**

- Radiation exposure, with radioactivity for 3 to 4 days post-procedure

- Diagnostic accuracy reduced by arrhythmias and soft-tissue attenuation

- 300 lbs weight limit for most machines

- Severe claustrophobia may prohibit use

**Stress Testing Not Indicated:**

- Patients who have a low risk of coronary artery disease

- Pre-operative risk stratification for non-cardiothoracic, non-vascular surgery for patients (even with CAD) able to perform at least four metabolic equivalents (METS) of exertion, such as walking up one flight of stairs

- The three most common inappropriate uses for stress imaging are pre-operative evaluation, symptomatic (often low-risk) patients with an exercise treadmill test suitable EKG, and asymptomatic patients
