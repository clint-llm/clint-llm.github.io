In patients with systemic scleroderma, the clinical assessment has two objectives: to confirm the diagnosis and to look for complications.

Complementary exams to be performed if systemic scleroderma is suspected are:

- Nailfold capillaroscopy

- Screening for antinuclear antibodies (mainly anti-centromere and anti-scl70/anti-topoisomerase antibodies)

- Transthoracic echocardiography

- HRCT of the chest

- Diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and spirometry

- Hand X-ray

- Esophageal manometry

When the diagnosis of systemic scleroderma is established, in addition to previous exams, it is necessary to perform:

- Electrocardiogram

- Complete blood count

- Renal and liver functions

- Urinalysis

- NT-pro-BNP dosage

- Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy

Exams that should be done for follow-up each year are:

- NT-pro-BNP dosage

- Spirometry and DLCO

- Transthoracic echocardiography
