Parasympathetic fibers from the vagus nerve (CN X) may vasodilate coronary resistance vessels. Sympathetic fibers may favor vasoconstriction of the coronary resistance vessels via alpha adrenoreceptors. However, local metabolic control of adenosine released from myocardial cells typically overshadows this effect, resulting in net vasodilation on exertion.
