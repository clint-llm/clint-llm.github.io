Optimal outcomes in IV therapy require an interprofessional team approach (primarily nurses and phlebotomy technologists reporting to managing physicians), with prompt placement when required, regular monitoring of line function, considering the ongoing need for venous access, removing lines when their presence is no longer clinically indicated, and early intervention if complications are suspected.

Some healthcare facilities traditionally mandated that IV lines should be removed and replaced as a matter of practice after a certain period, such as 48 or 72 hours, to reduce the risk of complications. A 2018 systematic review of the literature with meta-analysis found no evidence that routine replacement of IV lines reduces the incidence of thrombophlebitis, catheter-related bloodstream infections, pain, or mortality (although it likely reduces rates of catheter blockage), and such practice may increase overall healthcare costs associated with line placement.

The benefit of safety lines compared to standard lines is unclear. Users feel themselves to be at less risk of needlestick injury when using safety lines, but they are more expensive, may be more difficult to insert (partly due to slower flashback), and may increase the risk of blood splatter when the mechanism activates.
