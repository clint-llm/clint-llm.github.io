Pyramidal tract lesions are identifiable from the set of symptoms presented in the patient and should be managed quickly to avoid devastating consequences. Symptoms vary depending on the lesion site and tract involved. Spasticity, clonus, and hyperreflexia are common themes in corticospinal injuries which cause impairment to the movement of the limbs and trunk. Corticobulbar damage causes impaired facial and hypoglossal nerves functions. A detailed history and physical examination provide enough information to predict the site of injury. Â By utilizing imaging and other modalities, the insult, if applicable, can be accessed surgically and treated.

Management of these lesions involve intensive rehabilitation and exercise, medical interventions such as botulinum toxin, and benzodiazepines to decrease spasticity and contractures. Surgery is reserved for severe and life-threatening complications or in those whose medical therapy has failed to provide relief and improve the quality of life.
