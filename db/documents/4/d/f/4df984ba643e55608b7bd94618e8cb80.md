Most cases of SCFE are idiopathic. Often there isÂ no history of trauma or injury before the onset of symptoms. Additionally, an association has been reported between the development of SCFE and patients with endocrine disorders (including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, panhypopituitarism, and growth hormone deficiency), renal disorders, and down syndrome.
