**History**

It is crucial to ascertain the mechanism and timing of the injury. Note whether the injury was caused by blunt or penetrating trauma, as penetrating trauma is more likely to involve deeper-lying neurovascular structures.

**Physical**

As with any trauma patient, it is important to start the examination with an evaluation of the "ABCs." Ensure the patient has an adequate airway, is breathing spontaneously, and that any bleeding is under control. It is also vitally important to "clear" the cervical spine for any associated injury. Inspect the face, noting any obvious asymmetry, lacerations, and ecchymosis of the skin. Ipsilateral epistaxis is common and requires controlling if severe. An ophthalmologic exam should be performed, including visual acuity, visual fields, and extraocular movements. In a patient with a ZMC injury, the facial flattening may be apparent from a birds-eye view, which is caused by depression of the malarÂ eminence; however, the facial flattening may get obscured by overlying soft tissue edema. The clinician should note the position of the globe. Enophthalmos may be visible from a worms-eye view. The face should be palpated, noting any bony step-offs or mobility of the underlying craniofacial skeleton. A comprehensive cranial nerve examination should be completed, paying special attention to facial movement and sensation.
