The prognosis of mild cognitive impairment in the context of polypharmacy, in general, is favorable. Identifying the appropriate drug and risk factors and managing the underlying organic cause with alternative medications when feasible should be strongly considered. Isolated polypharmacy as a sole cause of mild cognitive impairment without other risk factors should recover well once the offending agent is identified and removed. The natural aging process, presence of diabetes, hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease might contribute to cognitive decline over time.
