Due to the ischemic etiology of anterior cord syndrome, symptoms are typically acute in onset. Patients present with acute motor dysfunction as well as the loss of pain and temperature sensation below the level of infarction. These symptoms are almost always bilateral because both halves of the anterior spinal cord receive vascular supply from one midline anterior spinal artery. Depending on the location of infarction, the severity of motor dysfunction varies typically from paraplegia to quadriplegia.

Often the location of infarction includes the lateral horns within levels T1-L2 of the spinal cord, causing autonomic dysfunction, the most common manifestations being neurogenic bowel/bladder requiring bladder catheterization, hypotension, and sexual dysfunction. Acute onset of back pain is also a common symptom of cord infarctions in general and usually localizes at the level of the infarction.
