Medicine is an art as well as a science that requires repeated exposure to reach competence.  Enhanced simulation experiences such as training with standardized patients will help to improve confidence and skills among learners. To replicate the real-world experience, the learner must become immersed in the activity. Different types of learners ranging from physicians, advanced practice nurses, physician assistants, registered nurses, residents, medical students, pre-hospital workers, and other interested health care practitioners utilize and benefit from health care simulation experiences. The use of standardized patients is a valuable methodology that can be applied and used for many different types of learners to improve patient care through skill-building and increasing medical knowledge.

The use of standardized patients is recognized as a simulation specialty requiring dedicated personnel, including a standardized patient program director, to support the recruitment, training, and development of individuals and the associated scenarios in which they participate. Multiple groups within simulation have worked to define standards for the function of SP programs, including certification and accreditation, as well as the roles and responsibilities of those working in this area.
