Debriefing is among the most important aspects of simulation-based learning. David Kolb has described the importance of reflection and analysis of the development of experiential learning theory.

- Reducing the time between performance and debriefing as much as possible

- Identifying and addressing performance and perception gaps

- Creating a safe environment to enhance learner comfort and participation

- Learner engagement in self-reflection

- Instructors should espouse strong facilitation and debriefing skills

- Debriefing should not be comprehensive and should focus on only a few learning objectives or educational goals that are manageable

- Structured debriefing should preclude broad, open-ended questions, such as “what happened” and utilize questions such as “what was your thought process when you first encountered the patient?”

- Faculty should engage in active listening and pay particular attention to nonverbal cues from learners

The “conscious competence” learning model can aid in guiding the debriefing process.

When they are working effectively, inter-professional healthcare teams' productivity is more than the sum of its individual members whose autonomous actions can have profound impacts on team function.  Such behavior is characteristic of a complex adaptive system.
