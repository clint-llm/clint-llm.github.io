The Palmer Classification is used to categorize TFCC injuries. Class 1 is traumatic, and class 2 is degenerative. All type 2 lesions can potentially associate with positive ulnar variance. Each class is further subclassified:

- 1A: The central aspect of the triangular fibrocartilage disc is perforated. Since the radioulnar ligaments are intact, these are stable injuries.

- 1B: Injury of the ulnar attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage disc. This injury is noncommunicating on arthrography.

- 1C: Distal disruption of the TFCC. In this case, there is a detachment of the volar ulnotriquetral and ulnolunate ligaments from the carpal attachment.

- 1D: Injury to the radial attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage disc. These injuries are communicating on MR arthrography.

- 2A: Degenerative changes of the triangular fibrocartilage disc without evidence of perforation.

- 2B: Grade 2A with the additional presence of chondromalacia of the hyaline cartilage on the articular surface.

- 2C: Full-thickness perforation of the triangular fibrocartilage disc.

- 2D: Any of the features in 2A through 2C plus lunotriquetral ligament tear.

- 2E: Grade 2D with the additional presence of ulnocarpal arthritis.
