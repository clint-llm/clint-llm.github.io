The optic nerve is part of the central nervous system (CNS). The mammalian CNS lacks the ability for regeneration and axonal growth. When the optic nerve is exposed to axonal damage, glial scars are formed that limits the diffusion of growth factors.

A CON can occur by compressing the vascular supply and causing ischemia to the nerve or directly causing mass effect upon the axons, thereby impairing axonal transport and signal transmission. The areas most susceptible to compression are where the nerve passes through small bone structures like the orbital apex and optic canal.

Optic nerve compression seen in exophthalmos secondary to thyroid disease occurs due to the enlargement of extraocular muscles due to the proliferation of fibroblasts, increased extracellular matrix, and adipocyte proliferation and differentiation.
