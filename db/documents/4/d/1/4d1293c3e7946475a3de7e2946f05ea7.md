The diagnosis of thyroid storm needs clinical suspicion based on the presentation mentioned above in a patient with hyperthyroidism or suspected hyperthyroidism. One should not wait for lab results before starting treatment. Thyroid function tests can be obtained, which usually show high FT4/FT3 and low TSH. It is not necessary to have a very high level of thyroid hormone to cause thyroid storm. Other lab abnormalities may include hypercalcemia, hyperglycemia (due to inhibition of insulin release and increased glycogenolysis), abnormal LFTs, and high or low white blood cell (WBC) count.

**Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS)**

In 1993, the following scoring system for the diagnosis of thyroid storm was introduced:

- Temperature: 5 points per 1 F above 99 F (maximum 30 points)

- CNS dysfunction: 10 points for mild (agitation), 20 for moderate (delirium, psychosis, or extreme lethargy), and 30 for severe (seizure or coma)

- Tachycardia: 5 (99-109), 10 (110 -119), 15 (120 -129), 20 (130 -139) and 25 (greater than 140)

- Presence of atrial fibrillation:10

- Heart failure: 5 for mild (pedal edema), 10 for moderate (bi-basilar rales), 15 for severe (pulmonary edema)

- GI dysfunction: 10 for moderate (diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, or abdominal pain) and 20 for severe (unexplained jaundice)

- Presence of Precipitating factor: 10 points

Diagnosis: A total score of more than 45 is highly suggestive of thyroid storm, 25 to 44 supports the diagnosis, and less than 25 makes the diagnosis unlikely.

**The Japanese Thyroid Association (JTA)**

This is a different scoring system based on similar clinical findings.

- CNS manifestation (restlessness, delirium, psychosis/mental aberration, lethargy/somnolence, coma)

- Fever (38 C/100.4 F or greater)

- Tachycardia (130/min or higher)

- CHF (pulmonary edema, rales, cardiogenic shock, or NYHA class IV)

- GI/Hepatic Manifestation (Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, total Bilirubin 3 mg/dl or more

**Diagnosis**

Definite Thyroid Storm (TS1): Thyrotoxicosis (elevated FT3 and/or FT4) plus

- At least one CNS manifestation plus one or more other symptoms (fever, tachycardia, CHF, GI/Hepatic) ‘OR’ A combination of at least three features among fever, GI/Hepatic, CHF, or tachycardia

Suspected Thyroid Storm (TS2): Thyrotoxicosis (elevated FT3 and/or FT4) plus

- A combination of at least two features among tachycardia, CHF, GI/Hepatic, Fever ‘OR’ A patient with h/o thyroid disease, presence of goiter and exophthalmos who meets criteria for TS1 but TFTs not available

These scoring systems are just guidelines. The actual diagnosis is based on clinical judgment. Based on the BWPS scoring system, a score of 45 or more is more sensitive but less specific than JTA scoring systems TS1 or TS2 to detect thyroid storm cases. A BWPS score of 25 to 45 may suggest an impending storm.

A chest X-ray may help to assess heart failure. Head CT may help exclude a neurological cause in some patients.

An ECG is often done to monitor for arrhythmias.
