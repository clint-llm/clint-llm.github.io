Complications from a CPB are known but rare. However, there is always the risk of an unsuccessful block. Orthostatic hypotension is the most common complication of the procedure and can be minimized with adequate hydration. Other complications that may occur, even with image-guided therapy, include but are not limited to:

- Intravascular injectionÂ of the anesthetic agent

- Injury to surrounding tissues, including nerve roots, vasculature, muscles, and nearby organs

- Paresthesias

- Intrathecal or epidural injection of the anesthetic agent

- Bleeding, including retroperitoneal hematoma formation

- Pneumothorax

- Infection with or without abscess formation

- Paraplegia

- Local anesthetic toxicity with central nervous system and cardiovascular compromise

Diarrhea is also a known complication of a CPB. Complete sympathetic denervation of the gastrointestinal tract will likely cause a patient to develop increased peristalsis due to unopposed parasympathetic nervous system activity.
