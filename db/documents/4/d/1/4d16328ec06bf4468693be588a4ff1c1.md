Bronchial asthma (BA) is considered the most common chronic disease in pregnancy, complicating 4% to 8% of pregnancies. Bronchial asthma exacerbation in pregnancy represents a major clinical problem that can lead to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality in pregnant patients with asthma. The percentage of women hospitalized for asthma exacerbation during pregnancy was 5.8% in a previous study. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of bronchial asthma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the pathophysiology of asthma in pregnancy.
- Review the presentation of asthma in pregnancy.
- Outline the management options available for asthma in pregnancy.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination among interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for pregnant patients affected by asthma.
