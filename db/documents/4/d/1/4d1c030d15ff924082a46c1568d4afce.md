EPP results from a deficiency of the ferrochelatase enzyme, which is involved in the final step of heme biosynthesis. Insufficient ferrochelatase enzyme activity results in increased accumulation of protoporphyrin that lacks Fe+2 or other metals, particularly zinc (i.e., metal-free protoporphyrin). In EPP, the main source of production of increased red cell and plasma protoporphyrin is by bone marrow reticulocytes. Conditions that increase the erythropoiesis may result in increased formation of protoporphyrins by the bone marrow.
