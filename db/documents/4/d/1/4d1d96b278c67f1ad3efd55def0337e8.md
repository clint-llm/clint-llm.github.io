Proteinuria may be asymptomatic, many patients do not report any symptoms, and proteinuria is detected on routine laboratory examination. A thorough history should be obtained from the patient, mainly asking about the symptoms of renal failure, including leg swelling and weight changes, as well as symptoms of connective tissue diseases, including arthralgias, skin rashes, and mouth ulcers.

Thorough drug history is essential to rule out any nephrotoxic drug currently being used or used in the past as a possible cause of proteinuria. These include but are not limited to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antihypertensive drugs including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, loop diuretics, and various antibiotics, especially penicillamine, aminoglycosides, and over-the-counter herbal medicines.
