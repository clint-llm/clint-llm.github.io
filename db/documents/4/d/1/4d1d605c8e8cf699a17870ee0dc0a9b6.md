Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) is the most common enzyme-related glycolytic defect that results in red cell hemolysis. Invariably, PKD results in hereditary non-spherocytic anemia. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of pyruvate kinase deficiency and highlights the role of the healthcare team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of pyruvate kinase deficiency.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency.
- Outline the management options available for pyruvate kinase deficiency.
- Summarize the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients affected by pyruvate kinase deficiency.
