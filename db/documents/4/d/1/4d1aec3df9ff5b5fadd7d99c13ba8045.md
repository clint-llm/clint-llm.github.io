The scalp is rich in arterial anastomoses, with the majority of the blood supply arising from the external carotid artery. The vascular supply to the temporoparietal fascia is the superficial temporal artery, which is the terminal branch of the external carotid artery. It pierces through the substance of the parotid gland anterior to the tragus. The scalp lymphatic system lacks lymph nodes and drains primarily into parotid, anterior/posterior auricular, and occipital lymph nodes. Venous drainage patterns follow that of lymphatic drainage.
