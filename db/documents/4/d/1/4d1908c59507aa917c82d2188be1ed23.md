Natalizumab is an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease(CD).

Natalizumab has been shown to slow down the progression of symptoms during a flare-up in individuals with multiple sclerosis and decrease the rate of relapse in those with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. In a randomized, placebo-controlled study, 77% of patients were relapse-free at the end of 1 year compared to 56% of those on placebo. The 2-year relapse-free rate was 67% with natalizumab versus 41% with placebo.

Natalizumab is indicated to induce and maintain clinical response and remission in adult patients with moderately to severely active CD with positive evidence for inflammation. These patients must have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, conventional CD therapies and inhibitors of TNF-α.
