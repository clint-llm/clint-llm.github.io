High fidelity mannequins can allow for all procedures to be performed on them but can very costly as well. With cost being a major factor for many academic programs, task-trainers allow for a cost-effective option without compromising clinical reasoning, knowledge acquisition, and learner satisfaction.

While task trainers are more cost-effective than high-fidelity mannequins, task trainers can come in variable forms. Some task trainers can be homemade from relatively inexpensive items, while other ones can have a more realistic appearance of skin and muscle.

Task trainers can also be a great hybrid option for objective structured clinical examination (OSCEs). Standardized patients have shown to lead to a more realistic experience by residents with higher post-test scores obtained when compared to using mannequins for OSCEs.
