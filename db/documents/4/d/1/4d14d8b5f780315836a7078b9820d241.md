Clinicians prescribe statin therapy to lower cholesterol concentrations; simvastatin targets cholesterol production. The biosynthesis of this molecule consists of a multi-step pathway. The rate-limiting step in this pathway involves the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme. Using acetyl-CoA as a substrate, mevalonic acid is formed, and subsequent reactions lead to the formation of cholesterol. Simvastatin acts on the rate-limiting step and serves as an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, consequently leading to decreased cholesterol concentrations.

Statins also possess additional properties in addition to their ability to lower cholesterol concentrations. These include inhibition of platelet aggregation, reduction in inflammation at the site of atherosclerotic plaque, and improved endothelial function. These properties are commonly taken advantage of when prescribing statin therapy for individuals with normal cholesterol levels. Studies have shown that early statin therapy initiation has reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events, leading to reduced mortality.

Simvastatin is hepatically metabolized via the CYP450 enzyme system, primarily through CYP3A4 as well as CYP2C6; this figures prominently in some of its potential adverse effects and drug-drug interactions, of which more later. It is a prodrug. It is excreted in the feces and urine and has a half-life of between two and five hours.
