**Glossopharyngeal Neuralgia**

Glossopharyngeal neuralgia (GPN) is characterized by oropharyngeal pain that is triggered by mandibular actions, mainly swallowing, but also chewing, coughing, and yawning.Â  It is a sporadic condition related to hyperactivity of cranial nerve IX.

First-line treatments of GPN are anti-epileptic and anti-depressant medications such as carbamazepine, gabapentin, and pregabalin.
