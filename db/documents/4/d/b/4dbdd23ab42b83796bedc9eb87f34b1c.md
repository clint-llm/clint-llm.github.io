A careful history and evaluation of radiological findings are necessary to rule out Purulent accumulation in the subdural abscess. In certain cases, the subarachnoid space occupied by the normally-occurring cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with a natively decreased brain mass as in hydrocephalus ex vacuo may give the appearance of a subdural hematoma.
