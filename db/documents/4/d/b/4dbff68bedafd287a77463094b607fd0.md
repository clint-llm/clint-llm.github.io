A dose of 1 mg/kg is potentially toxic in the pediatric population under the age of six.Â Similar to other beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, albuterol has been shown to cause an increase in liver aminotransferase concentrations on very rare occasions. This particular toxicity reaction is much more common in other beta-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, such as terbutaline, that are administered in much greater quantities such as in the case of abating uterine contractions.
