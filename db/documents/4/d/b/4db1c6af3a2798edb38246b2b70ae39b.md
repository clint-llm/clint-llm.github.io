Montelukast is an effective prophylactic agent for asthma. However, prescribers, including nurse practitioners, pharmacists, internists, and primary care providers, must be aware that the drug can cause neuropsychiatric alterations in young people, including suicidal thoughts. It is, therefore, necessary to adopt an interprofessional team approach to montelukast therapy. This healthcare team includes clinicians (MDs, DOs, NPs, PAs), nurses, respiratory therapists, and pharmacists, all contributing from their expertise and openly sharing information and patient status among the team. Young patients may need to be closely monitored by a mental health nurse while on treatment.
