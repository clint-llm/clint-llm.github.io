The practitioner may use a rudimentary estimate of the effect of temperature on blood gas values with the following simple equations:

For each 1°C decrease in body temperature below 37°C, the PO2 will decrease by 5 mmHg, PCO2 will decrease by 2 mmHg, and pH will increase by 0.012. Arterial CO2 increases by 4.6% for each 1°C over 37°C.

- logcPao2 = logPao2 + [T-37]/2.303 * f, where f = 0.058/(0.243[Pao2/100] * 3.88 + 1) + 0.013

The method of Nunn is one algorithm that can be used to determine CO2 with temperature changes: (PatcCO2); PatcCO2 PaCO2/10^0.0185 (change in T), where the change in T = 37°C - body temperature(C).

Most temperature correction guidelines are based on empirical data and may not take specific patient qualities into account.
