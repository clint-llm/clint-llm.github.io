Naltrexone may cause gastrointestinal irritation, such as diarrhea and abdominal cramps, and in some studies, it shows clinically insignificant increases in blood pressure.

In clinical studies of patients with opioid use disorder, headache, anxiety, low energy, joint and muscle pain, nervousness, abdominal pain/cramps, difficulty sleeping, and nausea and vomiting were reported in more than 10% of patients. Less than 10% of incidents reported were loss of appetite, constipation, diarrhea, increased energy, increased thirst, feeling down, dizziness, irritability,  delayed ejaculation, skin rash, and chills. It is safe and associated with few adverse effects, such as headache, nausea, and abdominal pain, when taken chronically for years.

Naltrexone can precipitate a withdrawal syndrome in patients with opioid use disorder characterized by dysphoria, irritability, and signs of autonomic hyperactivity such as tachycardia, tremor, and sweating. Other rare but potentially serious effects include depression and suicidality.

Piloerection is often associated with opioid withdrawal, especially when stopping the drug suddenly. Clonidine, an alpha2-adrenergic agonist, can aid in detoxification by reducing the signs of autonomic hyperactivity.

**Drug-Drug Interactions**

- Concurrent administration of bremelanotide with naltrexone is contraindicated due to reduced naltrexone systemic exposure resulting in therapeutic failure.

- Naltrexone should not be administered with thioridazine due to the risk of lethargy and somnolence.

**Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act**

The Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act provision updates federal guidelines to expand the availability of evidence-based treatment to address the opioid epidemic. The MAT Act empowers all health care providers with a standard controlled substance license to prescribe buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (OUD), just as they prescribe other essential medications. The MAT Act is intended to help destigmatize a standard of care for OUD and integrate substance use disorder treatment across healthcare settings.

As of December 2022, the MAT Act has eliminated the DATA-Waiver (X-Waiver) program. All DEA-registered practitioners with Schedule III authority may now prescribe buprenorphine for OUD in their practice if applicable state law permits, and SAMHSA encourages them to do so. Prescribers registered as DATA-Waiver prescribers will receive a new DEA registration certificate reflecting this change; no action is needed from registrants.

There are no longer limits on the number of patients with OUD that a practitioner may treat with buprenorphine. Separate tracking of patients treated with buprenorphine or prescriptions written is no longer required.

Pharmacy staff can now fill buprenorphine prescriptions using the prescribing authority's DEA number and does not need a DATA 2000 waiver from the prescriber. However, depending on the pharmacy, the dispensing software may still require the X-Waiver information to proceed. Practitioners must still comply with applicable state limits regarding treating patients with OUD.
