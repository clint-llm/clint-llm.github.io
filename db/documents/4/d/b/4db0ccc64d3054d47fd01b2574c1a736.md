For bone scintigraphy, a single or dual-headed gamma camera with a high-resolution parallel hole collimator is required. A pin-hole collimator may be used to acquire high-resolution images and is routinely used with pediatric patients. Obtaining SPECT imaging requires that the gamma camera be oriented in a 180 deg geometry between detector heads, and images are then obtained over 360 degrees in approximately 10 to 30 seconds. SPECT/CT requires the addition of a CT scanner with a combined gamma camera. Refrigeration of the tracer at 4Â to 8 deg C may be required, depending on the brand used. Intravenous access is necessary for the administration of radiotracer.

The radiolabeling of leukocytes for both In-111 and 99mTc-HMPAO scans requires a sterile field and appropriate sterile PPE. The labeling process is usually completed in a sterile laminar flow cabinet or isolator. Intravenous access for the withdrawal of patient blood and the administration of the labeled leukocytes is required. Imaging equipment is essentially the same as with bone scintigraphy, utilizing a planar gamma camera.

FDG-PET and PET/CT scans require the appropriate scanner, and the latter of the two uses a single system with a combined PET and CT scanner on a single table. In addition, intravenous access, a glucometer, and a patient scale is required. Images obtained from the scan must be processed using software approved for clinical use and evaluated on approved monitors with appropriate settings.
