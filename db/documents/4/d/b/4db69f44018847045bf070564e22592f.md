Obtaining a complete history is vital in determining the etiology of ventral cord syndrome. Neurological examination shows complete motor deficiency along with the loss of pain, temperature, and crude-touch sensations. Bilateral motor deficits will be relevant directly below the level of the lesion whereas bilateral sensory deficits start two to three dermatomal segments below the level of the lesion since the spinothalamic tract ascends at least two to three segments before decussating at the anterior commissure. Early motor deficits due to spinal shock include flaccidity with absent reflexes, followed by a gradual return of the reflexes and increased tone or spasticity. Ventral cord syndrome patients will have preserved sensations of light touch, proprioception, and vibration. Damage to the autonomic centers of the spine results in orthostatic hypotension, bladder and bowel incontinence, and sexual dysfunction. Also, patients often report a radicular or diffuse type of pain.
