Clavulanic acid, also known by its potassium salt form clavulanate, is FDA approved for clinical use in conjunction with amoxicillin to treat certain bacterial infections. This can be based on the source of the infection, Gram stain, or culture and sensitivity results. The antibacterial activity of amoxicillin is not improved by clavulanic acid when used against bacteria that do not produce beta-lactamase. Therefore, indications for this drug combination only include patients suspected of infection with beta-lactamase-producing bacteria.H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and S. aureus. The amoxicillin/clavulanate combination should be considered before ceftriaxone for urinary tract infections to decrease the risk of re-infection and complications.
