**Quantification of Radiation**

Before understanding the biological effects of radiation, one should get familiarized with two important medical terminologies in radiology, i.e., absorbed radiation dose and effective dose.

**Absorbed Dose**

Itâ€™s the amount of energy that radioactive waves deposit in any material through which they pass. The unit to measure the dosage of deposited energy is rad (radiation absorbed dose) or Gray (Gy). An absorbed dose of 1 rad means 1000 ergs get absorbed in 1 gram of material after radiation exposure.

1 Gy = 100 rad

Absorbed dose does not measure the biological effects of radiation on human tissues. For this purpose, an effective dose or dose equivalent is used.

**Effective Dose (Dose Equivalent)**

Dose equivalent or Effective dose combines the amount of radiation absorbed and the biological effects of radiation. They measure how much of absorbed radiation dose actually have a biologic effect on tissues. Dose equivalent is used when measuring the effective radiation dosage in a specific organ or tissue, while the effective dose is used to measure the effective radiation dosage of the whole-body.

Equivalent dose= Absorbed dosage x Tissue weighting factor.

The tissue weighting factor varies from one organ or tissue to another and reflects the sensitivity of the organ to the radiation.
