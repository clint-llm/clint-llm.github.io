The International Classification of Sleep Disorders or ICSD-3 criteria requires that several criteria be met to establish a diagnosis of insufficient sleep syndrome.

- The patient has irrepressible daytime lapses into sleep daily; in prepubertal children, a complaint of behavioral abnormalities due to sleepiness.

- The patient's total sleep time can be provided through clinical history, sleep diaries, or objective methods such as actigraphy and is usually shorter than expected for age.

- Sleep pattern is present on most days for a minimum of three months.

- The patients have decreased total sleep time due to external factors such as an alarm clock or curtailment of sleep by another person and, in the absence of such measures, are generally able to sleep longer.

- Extending the total sleep time causes the resolution of the symptoms.

- The symptoms should not be better explained by other untreated sleep disorders, medication or drug effects, or other underlying physical or mental disorders.

The AASM guidelines suggest using actigraphy to evaluate total sleep time in adults suspected of insufficient sleep syndrome. Compared to patient-reported sleep logs, actigraphy provides objective data that may be valuable in assessing poor sleep.
