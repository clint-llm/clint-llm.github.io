Benign rolandic epilepsy (BRE), also called benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes (BECTS) or benign epilepsy of childhood with centrotemporal spikes (BECCT) is the most common epilepsy syndrome in children. As the name states, these seizures originate in the rolandic area of the brain. This activity illustrates the evaluation and treatment of rolandic epilepsy seizure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the epidemiology of benign rolandic epilepsy.
- Explain the role of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in confirming the diagnosis of benign rolandic epilepsy.
- Describe the use of a single anti-epileptic drug in the short-term treatment of benign rolandic epilepsy.
- Summarize the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team members to counsel the patient on the correct use of the anti-epileptic drugs along with the monitoring for side effects to improve outcomes for those affected by benign rolandic epilepsy.
