**Anatomical Views**

The transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) probe is inserted through the oropharynx into the esophagus. All of the described TEE views are obtained when the TEE probe is located in the esophagus or stomach. The echocardiographer is typically able to identify a variety of structures including the cardiac chambers, valves, lungs, liver, superior vena cava, inferior vena cava, hepatic vein, pulmonary veins, pulmonary arteries, aorta, and stomach. One limitation of TEE is that the left main bronchus disrupts the views of the aortic arch and proximal ascending aorta.

The 2013 Basic Perioperative Transesophageal Echocardiography Examination guidelines list the 11 most relevant views for a basic echocardiographer. These include:

- Mid-Esophageal (ME) Four-Chamber View

- ME 2-Chamber View

- ME Long-Axis (LAX) View

- ME Ascending Aortic LAX View

- ME Ascending Aortic short-axis (SAX) View

- ME AV SAX View

- ME RV Inflow-Outflow View

- ME Bicaval View

- Transgastric (TG) Midpapillary SAX View

- Descending Aortic SAX View

- Descending Aortic LAX View

The updated 2013 Guidelines for Performing a Comprehensive Transesophageal Echocardiographic Examination include 28 views. These include:

- ME Five-Chamber View

- ME Four-Chamber View

- ME Mitral Commissural View

- ME 2-Chamber View

- ME LAX View

- ME AV LAX View

- ME Ascending Aorta LAX View

- ME Ascending Aorta SAX View

- ME Right Pulmonary Vein View

- ME AV SAX View

- ME RV Inflow-Outflow View

- ME Modified Bicaval TV View

- ME Bicaval View

- ME Right and Left Pulmonary Vein View

- ME LA Appendage View

- TG Basal SAX View

- TG Midpapillary SAX View

- TG Apical SAX View

- TG RV Basal View

In addition, there are guidelines for the performance of an intraoperative 3-dimensional TEE exam.
