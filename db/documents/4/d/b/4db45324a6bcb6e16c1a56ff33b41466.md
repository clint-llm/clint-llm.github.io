The only way to prevent suicides is to work in an interprofessional team that includes a mental health nurse, psychiatrist, primary care provider, social worker, and nurse practitioner. Practitioners must work with the patient's family and friends, as well as with the other patients who knew the deceased. The first step is to prevent harm to the patient and secondly, treating the cause of the behavior that is causing suicidal ideations. All patients with suicidal ideations should be closely monitored. The family should be educated about the potential signs of danger. Unfortunately, in many cases, the healthcare system does fail as many patients do go on to end their lives.
