The central dictation of peripheral vascular resistance occurs at the level of the arterioles. The arterioles dilate and constrict in response to different neuronal and hormonal signals.

During an adrenergic response where norepinephrine gets released into the bloodstream, it binds to the smooth muscle cells of the vasculature binding to an alpha-1 receptor (Gq protein); this causes an increase in GTP in the cell, which activates phospholipase C, creating IP3. IP3 signals for the release of the intracellularly stored calcium as free calcium. This free calcium stimulates Calcium-dependent protein kinases into activated protein kinases which leads to contraction of the smooth muscle.

Other molecules that cause vasoconstriction on a cellular level include thromboxane, endothelin, angiotensin II, vasopressin, dopamine, ATP.

Epinephrine binds to vascular smooth muscles at the beta-2 receptor (Gs protein); this binding activity increases adenylate cyclase activity, causing an increase in cAMP, subsequently leading to an increase in protein kinase A. Protein kinase A phosphorylates myosin-light-chain kinase (MLCK), decreasing its activity, and thus dephosphorylation of myosin light chain, and leading to vasodilation of the vasculature.

Other molecules that cause vasodilation on a cellular level include nitrous oxide, histamine, prostacyclin, prostaglandin D2 and E2, adenosine, bradykinin, carbon dioxide, and vasoactive intestinal peptide.
