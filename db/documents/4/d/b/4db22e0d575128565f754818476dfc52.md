Lens-induced inflammation is more likely to occur in an aging population and inÂ areas where access to health care is difficult. The importance of regular health check-ups and ocular examinations by holding eye camps in underprivileged areas help to detect cataracts in the early stages and prevent the occurrence of phacolytic glaucoma and phacogenic uveitis. Among older generations, waiting for cataracts to attain "maturity" is still the norm.

Educating the patient population through mass media and sending healthcare personnel to rural areas for screening the adult population are some of the means to prevent lens-induced inflammation from occurring. On the other hand, traumatic cataracts can occur in both developed and developing nations. Prevention of industrial accidents by wearing protective gear during hazardous activities, recognizing damage to the lens capsule, and managing traumatic cataracts with early surgical intervention may help save vision.
