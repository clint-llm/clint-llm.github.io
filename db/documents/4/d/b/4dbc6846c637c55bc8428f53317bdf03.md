Three main components contribute to labor: cervical changes, persistent uterine contractions, and activation of the decidua and membranes. The difference between labor at term and preterm is that the former occurs via a normal physiologic process and the latter is pathological. Some processes are acute, and some can take several weeks leading up to preterm labor.

One of the key events to occur in preterm labor that is pathological is the fetal inflammatory response syndrome (FIRS) which involves systemic inflammation and elevation of fetal plasma interleukin-6, typically in response to a trigger such as chorioamnionitis.

Additionally, contractions are an integral contributor to labor. The change from uncoordinated myometrial contractions to coordinated uterine contractions is attributed to neural control. Oxytocin plays an essential role in the circadian rhythm of these contractions.

The degradation of the extracellular matrix is assessed by fetal fibronectin detection in cervicovaginal secretions and is also part of the parturition process. When detected between 22 and 37 weeks gestational age, it indicates the disruption of the decidual-chorionic interface and increased risk of preterm labor. Evidence implicates apoptosis as a critical factor leading in the above process.
