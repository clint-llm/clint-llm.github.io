Palliative care medicine is the interprofessional subspecialty focused on relieving suffering and improving the quality of life in patients with serious illness as well as their families. Beyond the aspects of physical illness, palliative care -as defined by the World Health Organization- strives to implement “means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual.”

As defined by the American Art Therapy Association (AATA) in About Art Therapy (2018), art therapy, as facilitated by a professional art therapist, is a therapeutic modality used over ongoing sessions to “improve cognitive and sensorimotor functions, foster self-esteem and self-awareness, cultivate emotional resilience, promote insight, enhance social skills, reduce and resolve conflicts and distress and advance societal and ecological change.”
