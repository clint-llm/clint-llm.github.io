The axillary artery is the principal arterial supply of the upper limb, commencing as a continuation of the subclavian artery as it emerges from underneath the first rib to enter the axilla. It provides key landmarks for understanding the position of other important structures in the region, in particular the brachial plexus. The axillary artery gives offÂ six branches before terminating at the lower border of teres major by becoming the brachial artery.
