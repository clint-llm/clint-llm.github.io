Providing care for injured patients fromÂ hazardous chemical exposure is an uncommon scenario but can be very disruptive to normal clinical operations. The entire interprofessional team of acute care providers needs to be familiar with the principles of decontamination. Institutional protocols and scheduled practical exercises are helpful to ensure readiness to care for individuals exposed to hazardous chemicals. Pre-positioned supplies should be readily available in patient receiving areas of the healthcare facility, and additional stocks of supplies should remain on hand in the facility for replenishment.
