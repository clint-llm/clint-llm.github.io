Primary cases ofÂ PAN are idiopathic. Secondary PAN is less frequent and often seen in hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and malignancies such as hairy cell leukemia.

Impairment in endothelial function is believed to perpetuate the inflammatory reaction. Patients who develop hepatitis B may develop PAN, usually within the first 6 months of the infection. With the use of the hepatitis B vaccine, the cases of PAN have dropped.

Loss of function mutations in CECR1 has also been linked to PAN. Besides hepatitis B, several other organisms have been linked to PAN including Klebsiella, Toxoplasma, Pseudomonas, trichinosis, parvovirus B-19, and Yersinia species. In addition, PAN has been linked to Sjogren syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and hairy cell leukemia.
