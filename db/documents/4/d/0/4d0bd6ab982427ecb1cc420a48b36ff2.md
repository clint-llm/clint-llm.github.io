On gross pathology, hepatic cystadenomas are multiseptated, and mucin-filled lesions surrounded by a dense fibrous capsule that may occasionally include calcifications. Microscopically, BCAs have three characteristic layers including a mucin-producing, biliary type epithelial layer, a subepithelial layer of cellular stroma, and dense surrounding layering of collagenous connective.
