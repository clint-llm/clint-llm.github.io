The pathophysiology will depend on the etiology of acute liver failure. Liver failure occurs due to massive hepatocyte necrosis and/or apoptosis. The mechanism of necrosis characteristically demonstrates ATP depletion, cerebral edema, mitochondrial depolarization, and cell membrane rupture. However, in apoptosis, there is a preservation of ATP with activation of caspases, chromatin condensation, DNA degradation and reabsorption of cellular components.
