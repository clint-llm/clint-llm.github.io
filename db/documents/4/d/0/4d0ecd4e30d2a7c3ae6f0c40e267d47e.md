Mediastinotomy is used to biopsy and facilitates the histologic diagnosis of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. In the setting of a known pulmonary lesion, particularly the left upper lobe, it is important to have a tissue diagnosis to confirm the pathologic stage and resectability of the primary index lesion. Generally, with lesions appearing as lung cancer, the surgeon would order a PET CT scan to look for metastatic disease. Nodes more than 1cm or "hot" nodes would need a pathologic diagnosis. The diagnosis can be made through endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy (EBUS), CT guided biopsy, and sometimes with the mediastinotomy.

The AP window nodes are not accessible by EBUS, so the mediastinotomy is preferred. Other indications would be for enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum or a mass that would need a pathologic diagnosis that could not be accessed or accomplished with less invasive means. The differential diagnosis for some of these masses and nodes is wide-ranging, including carcinoma, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, as well as lymphomas, thymomas, and other germ cell tumors, etc.
