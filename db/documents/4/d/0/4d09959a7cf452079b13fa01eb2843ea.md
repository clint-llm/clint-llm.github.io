Although pars planitis is one of the benign forms of uveitis, severe complications secondary to chronic inflammation may occur.

An important ocular complication is epiretinal membrane formation with a reported incidence of 7% to 36%, the mean duration between onset of pars planitis and epiretinal membrane formation has been reported to be 6.5 to 7.9 years. Cataracts are reported to occur in 14% to 30% of pars planitis cases They may occur as a result of the disease or as a result of treatment with corticosteroids, and it is difficult to distinguish between the two causes. A posterior subcapsular cataract is the most commonly diagnosed cataract. Cystoid macular edema is described as the major cause of vision loss. Other complications include retinal vasculitis, retinal neovascularization, peripheral vitreous traction, and vitreous hemorrhage.

In a study, the complications of pars planitis 'included macular edema (47.7%), vitreous opacities (38.6%), papillitis (38.6%), vasculitis (36.4%), and cataract (20.5%)'.
