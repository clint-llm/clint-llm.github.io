Overdose of edrophonium will result in muscarinic symptoms due to the cholinergic crisis manifested by excessive acetylcholine binding to muscarinic receptors. The cholinergic crisis includes diarrhea, increased urination, miosis, muscle weakness, bronchospasm, bradycardia, emesis, and lacrimation. The more serious outcomes of edrophonium overdose involve respiratory muscle weakness and cardiac arrhythmias that can progress to a fatal outcome. Hence, clinicians must ensure patent airway and circulation. The treatment of an edrophonium overdose is atropine. Atropine is an ideal antidote for edrophonium since it has a similar onset of action as edrophonium. Atropine functions by competitively inhibiting the muscarinic receptors on structures innervated by postganglionic cholinergic nerves and inhibiting muscarinic receptors on smooth muscle. Atropine can be administered up to 1.2 mg intravenously initially and repeated every 20 minutes until secretions are controlled. If convulsions are present, clinicians should institute appropriate supportive measures. For convulsions, supportive treatment is required.
