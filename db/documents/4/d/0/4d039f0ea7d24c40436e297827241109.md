Patients, particularly athletes with osteitis pubis, often have concomitant pathology making the diagnosis difficult. The entire kinetic chain of the lower extremity can be involved requiring evaluation of the sacroiliac joint, hip labrum, femoroacetabular impingement, adductors, and abdominal muscles. Pathology at any of these locations can result in osteitis pubis for the reasons mentioned earlier.

The physical exam can be difficult in osteitis pubis as it does overlap with athletic pubalgia or sports hernia. However, according to Lynch et al., the two can be differentiated with pain elicited by direct palpation over the pubic symphysis with OP. Another exam maneuver, the spring test, where direct pressure is applied just lateral to the pubic symphysis on the ramus, evokes pain.

Due to osteitis pubisâ€™s common association with FAI, the hip joint must be evaluated. Patients with limited flexion, extension, or internal and external rotation of the hip should undergo evaluation. Patients presenting with either sacroiliac pathology or with FAI may have pain with the FABER test, which is flexion, abduction, and external rotation of the hip.
