A multidisciplinary approach is needed for an effective ‘termination of life support.’ Compassionate attitude, empathetic communication skills, and the use of support staff to help the family overcome social and financial issues. All of these steps help provide effective care. Palliative care has been shown to improve the quality of life for the patient and sometimes also improve the life span of the patient.

Death is the ultimate reality for all of us. While modern medicine has been able to delay it to an extent, it is helpful to make the process of dying 'pain-free' for the patient and less stressful to the family in-grief, when death is inevitable. A physician’s duty goes beyond the immediate care of the patient and involves taking care of the family before and after bereavement. A good life is aspired by all, but providing access to a 'good death' to all is also important, when possible.
