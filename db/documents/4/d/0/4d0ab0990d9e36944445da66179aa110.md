SMILE was first approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2016 for the treatment of myopia from -1 diopter (D) to -8 D and astigmatism up to -0.5 D in patients 22 years or older.

There are many considerations when deciding whether a patient would be a better fit for SMILE or LASIK. Because there is no flap creation, SMILE may be preferable for patients who engage in contact sports, which carry a risk for traumatic flap dislocation.
