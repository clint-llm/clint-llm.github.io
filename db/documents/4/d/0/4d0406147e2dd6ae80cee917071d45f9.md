Lesions of the glenoid labrum are most commonly the result of traumatic shoulder dislocation.

Abnormal translation of the head of the humerus during dislocation results in excessive loading and stretching of the labrum and capsuloligamentous structures.Â This excessive stretch leads to a tear or avulsion of the labrum with associated capsular injury.
