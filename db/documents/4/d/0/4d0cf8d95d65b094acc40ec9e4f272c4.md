Functional endoscopic sinus surgery is in constant progress, along with the technical advances in imaging, instrumentation, and navigation. With a better resolution and more detailed images, the application of FESS is spreading into the intracranial world and the oncological world. The group of multidisciplinary providers involved depends on the pathology and its extension. It can include rhinologists, neurosurgeons, oncologists, endocrinologists, pulmonologists, ophthalmologists, and allergy specialists.

A delicate stepwise technique following the anatomical landmarks guides the surgeon throughout the procedure and helps in avoiding the possible complications. For patients with CRS, the two main goals intraoperatively are to restore patency of the sinuses while preserving mucosa and to prevent injury to the surrounding structures.

Postoperative care is as essential as the applied technique to decrease the risk of recurrence of CRS. Medical therapy with nasal rinsing, topical or oral corticosteroids, and antibiotics, is continued postoperatively to reduce the inflammation and the risk of recurrence. There is no clear consensus on the role of postoperative debridement in decreasing the risk of recurrence of disease and adhesions. It depends on the surgeon's preference, the level of inflammation, and the extent of the surgery.
