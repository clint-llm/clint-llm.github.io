The 1976 American Legion Convention marked the discovery of Legionnaires' disease, a syndrome of pneumonia caused by Legionella. Many people became sick at this convention which sparked an investigation to uncover the cause. Legionella is an aerobic gram-negative bacillus that is spread through aerosolized water particles. It is a common cause of community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia.

- Legionnaires' disease is caused by Legionella pneumophila. Pontiac fever refers to a benign, self-limited, acute febrile illness which is linked serologically to L pneumophila.

- L pneumophila causes community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia and should be considered as a pathogen in any patient with atypical pneumonia.

- The Legionella bacterium was first identified in 1976 during the 58th annual convention of the American Legion in Philadelphia. Infection was thought to spread the disease by contamination of the water in the air conditioning system. Patients developed symptoms ranging from flu-like symptoms to multisystem organ failure. Of the 182 infected, 29 died.

- Legionnaires' disease describes infections caused by the Legionellaceae family.

- The Legionella bacterium is a small, aerobic, waterborne, gram-negative, unencapsulated bacillus that is nonmotile and oxidase and catalase positive.

- Legionella bacterium is a fastidious organism and will not grow anaerobically on a standard media. Buffered charcoal yeast extract agar is the medium used for isolation of the bacterium.

- The Legionellaceae consists of more than 42 species. L. pneumophila is the most common species, and it causes 90% of the cases of legionellosis, followed by L. micdadei, L. bozemanii, L. dumoffii, and L. longbeachae.

- Fifteen serogroups of L. pneumophila have been identified, with serogroups 1, 4, and 6 identified as the causes of human disease. Serogroup 1 is thought to be responsible for 80% of the reported cases.
