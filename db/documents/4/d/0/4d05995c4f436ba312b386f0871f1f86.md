There are multiple treatments for LBP, including massage, physical therapy, exercise programs, spinal injections, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) unit, patches, creams, medications, and counseling. Unfortunately, many of these treatments have inconclusive efficacy. Further research on the management of LBP is needed due to its high prevalence in patients, the large healthcare costs associated with it, and the conflicting efficacy of treatments.

A pilot study performed in 2003 showed that MET significantly improved acute LBP in which the patients underwent four contractions of MET held for 5 seconds each for a total of eight treatments. They were compared to a control group that received a sham treatment.Â Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was recorded before and after MET. ODI statistically significantly improved with a decrease in ODI by 83 % in the MET group versus 65 % in the control group.

Overall, MET is a gentle method for treating LBP, it has been proven effective, and there is a low risk of harming patients when performing this procedure. However, more research is needed to continue exploring MET and its mechanism(s) of action.
