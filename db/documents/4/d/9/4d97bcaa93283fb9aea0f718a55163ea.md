The production of toxins is the major virulence factor involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. The gene responsible for the synthesis of the toxin is encoded by corynebacteriophage, which, when integrated into the bacterial genome, can potentially transform the non-toxigenic strain into a virulent toxigenic strain.

It is made up of a single polypeptide chain consisting of 535 amino acids.

- Catalytic domain with Nâ€“terminal ADP ribosyl transferase activity

- A transmembrane domain assists in the delivery of catalytic domain across the cell membrane

- Cell receptor binding domain. After binding of the diphtheria exotoxin to the host cell receptor, it undergoes receptor-mediated endocytosis.

The toxin is then endocytosed, where it is acidified. The transmembrane domain is then inserted into the membrane, where it allows the delivery of the catalytic domain to its cytosol. The catalytic domain catalyzes the NAD+ dependent ribosylation of elongation factor 2 and hence inhibits protein synthesis.

**Regulation of Diptheria Toxin Production**

DtxR is a repressor gene that is activated by metals and is responsible for the regulation of iron uptake as well as the expression of haem-oxygenase and diphtheria toxin.
