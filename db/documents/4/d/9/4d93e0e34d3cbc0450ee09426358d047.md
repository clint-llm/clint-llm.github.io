LS is an unusual clinical entity of congenital/acquired ASD in combination with congenital/acquired MS (most commonly rheumatic). The presence of ASD alters hemodynamics, and thus, the clinical course of LS as compared to an isolated MS. LS is clinically suspected when there is a systolic thrill over the upper left parasternal area. The first heart sound is loud, second heart sound is widely split and fixed, a mid-diastolic murmur is heard over the apex, and ECG is showing findings of biatrial and right ventricular enlargement. However, the diagnosis may not be evident on clinical examination alone, and echocardiography is required to confirm the diagnosis. (level I) Early diagnosis and transcatheter or surgical management can reduce morbidity and mortality. (Level II )
