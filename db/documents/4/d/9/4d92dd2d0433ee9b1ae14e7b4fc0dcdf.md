**Management**

The appropriate management of chylothorax depends on the cause and includes one or more of many interventions like dietary modification, pleurodesis, and thoracic duct ligation. Recently, the use of somatostatin/octreotide, midodrine, and sirolimus to prevent chyle formation has been used. New surgical techniques like pleurovenous or pleuroperitoneal shunting and thoracic duct embolization have been used with success. Most patients benefit from a staged care plan, from least invasive options to more invasive techniques.

**Dietary therapy**

As chylous fluid is formed the long-chain fatty acids; decreasing or eliminating these fatty acids from the diet will lead to decreased chyle drainage spontaneously closure of leak. Diet with less than 5 kcal of fat per meal is used in this technique. This can effectively reduce chyle formation, but over long periods, it will lead to fat deficiency and malnutrition. In fact, venous fat hemorrhage can remedy some of the shortcomings of this therapy. Small chain and medium-chain fatty acids can be provided in a diet, and long-chain fatty acids can be supplemented intravenously.

**Thoracentesis**

Intermittent therapeutic thoracentesis or the use of an indwelling catheter for home drainage is typically used in the initial management of non-traumatic and nonsurgical traumatic effusions to relieve dyspnea caused by the pleural fluid. This technique can be effectively used if there is a gradual recommendation of her pleural fluid. A chest tube can be used in postsurgical chylothorax. Prolonged drainage of pleural fluid comes with a risk of significant malnutrition and loss of immunoglobulins, putting the patient at risk of infections. Hence continuous pleural fluid drainage should typically be restricted to less than 2 weeks. Surgical intervention is recommended if the pleural fluid drainage exceeds 1.5 L per day.

**Pleurodesis**

This should be reserved for patients who continue to reaccumulate fluid despite dietary modification and repeated thoracenteses. Pleurodesis can be accomplished by tall installation of a chest tube drainage by video-assisted thoracic surgery with talc insufflation. In some cases, this procedure can remedy up to 80% of chylothorax. Concomitant ligation of the thoracic duct to prevent further chyle formation during surgical pleurodesis is also done with high success.

**Thoracic Duct Ligation**

This invasive procedure is done using video-assisted thoracic surgery and can be useful in patients where dietary modification and pleurodesis has failed. Lymphedema is a known complication of thoracic duct ligation but usually resolves after several months due to collateral lymphatic venous communications.

**Thoracic Duct Embolization and Disruption**

Percutaneous catheterization and embolization are needle disruption of the thoracic duct, and cisterna chyli, along with prominent retroperitoneal lymphatic ducts, have been used increasingly in both traumatic and nontraumatic chylothorax. Initial pedal lymphangiogram follows fluoroscopic visualization of the large retroperitoneal lymphatics, which has been accessed by transabdominal percutaneous needle cannulation. After cannulation of the cisterna chyli, the catheter is advanced with thoracic duct installation of contrast to localize the leak. The affected thoracic segment is then embolized with coils and surgical clues.

**Emerging Therapies**

Somatostatin and octreotide can decrease the gastric, pancreatic, and biliary secretions and reduce the total flow of gastric lymphatics. Because of the reduction of chyle formation and flow rates, they can spontaneously remedy the leak in the thoracic duct. This technique is reported to be useful in many cases of spontaneous chylothorax, congenital chylothorax, postoperative chylothorax, and chylothorax due to malignancy. The optimal dose and duration of treatment are not clear.

Sirolimus used for the effect to the treatment of lymphangiomyomatosis is also known to decrease the incidence of chylothorax in these sets of patients.

Pleuroperitoneal or pleural venous shunt. Shunting of chylous pleural fluid into the venous system or peritoneal cavity can also resolve chylothorax. Two types of pleuroperitoneal shunts are available. Denver pleuroperitoneal shunt is an active pump that requires manual pumping, and Le Veen's pleuroperitoneal shunt is a passive pump. The main advantage of the shunt procedure is the recycling of the nutritionally rich chyle to the body. Pleural venous shunting of chylous fluid from the pleural space to the subclavian jugular vein has been performed successfully in patients with yellow nail syndrome and postsurgical chylothorax.
