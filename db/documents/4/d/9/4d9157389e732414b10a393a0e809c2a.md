The pathogenesis of fat embolism syndrome is poorly understood, and evaluation of the progression of histopathological changes in patients is not very practical. Animal model studies included injecting Tirolean, a form of fat found in bone marrow, into the caudal veins of rats and monitoring changes in the lungs over an 11 days period. The subsequent histopathological examination of the lung tissues included staining for fat, collagen, and actin of the smooth muscle. The most notable change was a decrease in the patency of the arteries and arterioles over the first 96 hours, but there was a return to normal patency towards the end of the period of observation which is the 11th day. There was also a significant amount of inflammation and fibrosis around the blood vessels. These changes were noticeable within the first couple of hours of infusion and persisted for the time frame for which the study was conducted.

Although the results of a rat model, they give insight into the changes that can occur in patients with fat embolism or fat embolism syndrome.
