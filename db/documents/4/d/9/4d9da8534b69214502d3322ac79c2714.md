Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic derived from the organism Streptomyces roseosporus. Daptomycin is used to treat various bacterial infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). Daptomycin has numerous FDA-approved and off-label clinical uses. This activity reviews the mechanism of action, adverse event profile, toxicity, dosing, pharmacodynamics, and monitoring of daptomycin, pertinent for interprofessional team members in treating conditions where daptomycin is appropriate.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of daptomycin.
- Review the FDA-approved indications for daptomycin, as well as some of the non-FDA-approved indications.
- Identify the important adverse reactions associated with daptomycin therapy.
- Summarize the importance of interprofessional communication improving care coordination among the interprofessional team when initiating daptomycin therapy
