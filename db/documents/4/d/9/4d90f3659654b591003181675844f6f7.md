An interprofessional approach should be considered in conjunction with trauma services, neurosurgery, general pediatrics, nurse practitioners, and social work.  The treatment depends on the severity of the injury and depression of the bone fragments. Close follow-up is paramount to ensure safe outcomes.  Any child suspected to be a victim of nonaccidental trauma should be reported per state law.  The outcomes of skull fractures depend on many factors like a concomitant injury to other organs, the presence of neurological deficit at the time of presentation, low GCS, and the need for mechanical ventilation.
