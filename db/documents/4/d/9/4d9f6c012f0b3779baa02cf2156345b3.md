Complications of ventricular tachycardia depend on the underlying mechanism of ventricular tachycardia. The common complications of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia include tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy is much more common in patients with incessant episodes of VT and those with a genetic predisposition and other risk factors of cardiomyopathy, e.g., alcohol intake.

Cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death are the major complications of inherited ventricular tachycardia as well as scar-related ventricular tachycardia. However, these complications can be minimized with early recognition and implantation of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
