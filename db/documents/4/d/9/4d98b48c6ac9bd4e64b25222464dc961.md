Clinical manifestations of non-small cell lung cancer can be divided into intrathoracic effects and extrathoracic effects. Intrathoracic effects can include cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea, or hoarseness, which can be appreciated on history and physical exam. Squamous cell carcinoma can cause Pancoast syndrome, manifested by pain in the shoulder (but may also include the forearm, scapula, or fingers), Horner syndrome, atrophy of the hand muscles, or bony destruction. Bony metastasis can be suspected during the physical examination as approximately 20 percent of NSCLC have bone metastases on initial presentation.
