Many adverse related health events develop due to alcohol and substance abuse. Alaskan Natives and American Indians both experience higher mortality rates from alcohol, chronic liver disease, and drugs when compared to all other races.

Alcohol use disorders among Alaskan Natives also contribute to higher cirrhosis rates, dementia, suicide, homicide, and non-intentional injuries.

Similar to the variability of alcohol and substance use rates observed among different tribes and geographic locations, there is also variability among the death rates. Indian Health Service areas reported alcohol-related death rates from as low as 18.3/100,000 observed in the Eastern United States to as high as 86.4/100,000 in North and South Dakota.
