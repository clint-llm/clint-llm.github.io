The care of pregnant patients is best undertaken with an interprofessional team approach. Healthcare providers of women during pregnancy have the responsibility to screen and monitor the fetus to identify potential problems. This allows theÂ practitioner to provide patient-centered, targeted treatment, and follow-up. Patients should be educated about the importance of self-monitoring of fetal movements. When decreased fetal movement is perceived, the team should work together to evaluate the fetus further. Many techniques for monitoring fetal movement are controversial and lack sufficient study to document their efficacy. In theory, detecting risk factors and complications during pregnancy could lower neonatal morbidity and mortality.
