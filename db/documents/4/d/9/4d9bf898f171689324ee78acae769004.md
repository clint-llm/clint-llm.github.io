Food allergies stem from the host's immune system. If an individual has an allergy to milk, the bodyâ€™s immune system responds to a specific milk protein, triggers an immune response, and attempts to neutralize the triggering protein. The next time that the body comes into contact with the protein, the immune response recognizes the protein. It triggers the immune system to mount a response, including the release of histamine and other immune mediators. This release of chemicals causes the signs and symptoms of cow's milk allergy.
