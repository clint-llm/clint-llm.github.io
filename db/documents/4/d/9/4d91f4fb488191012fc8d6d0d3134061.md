The mainstay of treatment for DFUs is offloading. DFUs will not heal until they are adequately offloaded and have no sustained pressure on the wound bed. Multiple modalities exist for offloading including custom molded shoe inserts and neuropathic walker boots. Total contact casting is the gold standard to offload DFUs on the weight-bearing surface of the heel.

Clinical practice guidelines recommending the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of DFU suggest adding hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) to patients with Wagner 3 or higher DFU who have recently had a surgical debridement of an infected foot. HBOT delivered acutely in the postoperative period will reduce the risk of major amputation and incomplete reepithelialization. Further recommendations suggest adding HBOT to the standard of care treatment in patients with Wagner 3 or higher DFU that have not shown significant improvement after 30 days of treatment to reduce the risk of major amputation and incomplete reepithelialization. Recommendations also suggest against the use of HBOT in patients with Wagner 2 or lower DFU. [13]

Studies have demonstrated that patients who received hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) treatment for DFUs healed faster and remained healed at one year, more than their cohorts who were not treated with HBO2.
