The chest x-ray may reveal left ventricular enlargement and florid pulmonary edema. Two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler is used to diagnose ventricular septal rupture, which shows blood flow across the ventricular septum.

Transoesophageal echocardiography is indicated in patients in whom it is difficult to get an adequate view of the myocardium via transthoracic echocardiograms. These may include patients who are on a mechanical ventilator or have a large body habitus. The electrocardiogram (ECG) is needed to rule out reinfarction and may show elevated ST segments in patients with a ventricular aneurysm. A heart block may be present in 30% of the patients. Cardiac catheterization is only undertaken in stable patients and requires good judgment. The procedure can help differentiate VSR from mitral regurgitation. In VSR, the patient will have a step-up of oxygen between the right atrium and the pulmonary artery.
