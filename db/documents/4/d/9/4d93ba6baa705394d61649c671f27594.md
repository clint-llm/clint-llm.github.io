Therapeutic: Large and painful joint effusions can be aspirated for pain relief. Also, it can be used forÂ intra-articular injection of certain medications (primarily steroids). Evaluate response to treatment.

Diagnostic: Synovial fluid analysis can provide physicians with an unequivocal etiology of acute arthritis, specifically to differentiate between septic arthritis and an inflammatory cause of bloody mono-arthritis.

The procedure can be done in the clinic or the minor operating room.
