The etiology of asteroid hyalosis remains to be elucidated. Voerhoeff postulated that angiosclerosis of intraocular vessels along with local deposition of lipids and fats leads to AH formation. Rodman described type 1 AH in normal vitreous and type 2 AH in vitreous with associated inflammation.

The unilateral occurrence of asteroid hyalosis can be postulated by the contribution from various factors, e.g., local inflammation, retinal pigment epithelial degeneration, local changes in pH, vitreous collagen degeneration, and most notably increased retinal vascular permeability altering the calcium and lipid levels of the vitreous. However, the exact etiology remains to be proved.
