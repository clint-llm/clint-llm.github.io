Congenital hearing loss affects 1 to 3 per 1000 newborns. For many children born with hearing loss, it is an isolated finding known as a non-syndromic hearing loss. Alternatively, the term syndromic hearing loss is used when a patient has hearing loss in addition to other medical abnormalities. Approximately 20 percent of children with genetic hearing loss have other associated findings. This activity describes the evaluation and management of syndromic sensorineural hearing loss and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the epidemiology of syndromic sensorineural hearing loss.
- Review the pathophysiology of syndromic sensorineural hearing loss.
- Summarize the treatment options for syndromic sensorineural hearing loss.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the evaluation and management of syndromic sensorineural hearing loss and improve outcomes.
