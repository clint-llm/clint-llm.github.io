The typical history will include a patient living in an endemic tropical environment or a rural or agriculture area.

The development of a non-painful eschar in these high-risk populations should also prompt immediate consideration for the infection. They may develop lesions with significant edema within the oropharyngeal cavity necessitating prompt airway evaluation and management. Similarly, unexplained ascites, peritonitis, or frank GI hemorrhage should be considered as possible presentations of anthrax infection. Respiratory symptoms may be vague initially with the presentation appearing similar to flu-like symptoms with fevers, malaise, and nonproductive cough. However, in all modes of infection, symptoms can progress rapidly to florid sepsis, shock, and cardiopulmonary collapse. Therefore, a high index of suspicion should guide history to elucidate possible risks for exposure.

Injectional anthrax was previously reported in a number of patients, withÂ substance abuse, manifesting in the form of extensive soft tissue edema and necrosis. It was inferred that the subcutaneous injection(heroin, etc) provided a site for the germination of spores. Injectional anthrax was associated with a higher risk of septic shock and mortality compared to cutaneous anthrax.
