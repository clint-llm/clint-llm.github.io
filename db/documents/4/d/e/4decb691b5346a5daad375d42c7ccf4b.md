Cardiopulmonary bypass has become the standard of care for many cardiac procedures. The procedure is relatively safe if the duration of surgery is not prolonged. This activity reviews the technique involved in performing a cardiopulmonary bypass and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the pre- and post-operative management of patients undergoing this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Summarize the indications for cardiopulmonary bypass.
- Describe the technique involved in performing cardiopulmonary bypass.
- Outline the complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass.
- Explain interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance the safe use of the cardiopulmonary bypass procedure and improve patient outcomes.
