Endobronchial ultrasound is an advanced bronchoscopic procedure combining traditional bronchoscopy with ultrasound. It is primarily used to view and obtain samples from peri-bronchial lesions and lymphadenopathy within the hilar regions and anterosuperior mediastinum by transbronchial needle aspiration. This activity outlines the principles behind endobronchial ultrasound and explains the interprofessional team's role in managing patients who undergo this procedure.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for an endobronchial ultrasound.
- Identify the contraindications for an endobronchial ultrasound.
- Review the common complications of endobronchial ultrasound and endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration.
- Summarize the management considerations for patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy.
