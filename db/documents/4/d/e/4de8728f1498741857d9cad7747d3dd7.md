Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has shown promise in salvaging flaps in tissue that has been irradiated or in areas where there is decreased tissue perfusion or hypoxia. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy can potentially increase tissue viability and thus decrease the need for repeat procedures. This activity reviews the indications, contraindications, and techniques involved in utilizing hyperbaric oxygen therapy for skin grafts and flaps and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in the management of patients with skin grafts and flaps.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the indications for hyperbaric oxygen therapy therapy for skin grafts and flaps.
- List the contraindications to hyperbaric oxygen therapy therapy for skin grafts and flaps.
- List the complications of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance care of patients with skin flaps using hyperbaric oxygen therapy to improve outcomes.
