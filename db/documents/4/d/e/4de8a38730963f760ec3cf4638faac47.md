The most common presenting symptom of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is dyspnea. Patients also can develop syncope, palpitations, angina, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, dizziness, congestive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. The latter represents the most devastating presenting symptom.

Physical examination findings are characterized by a double apical impulse due to forceful left atrial contraction against a highly noncompliant left ventricle, normal s1 and split s2, s3 due to decompensated heart failure, prominent "a wave" of jugular venous pressure, laterally displaced apical impulse, and double carotid pulse.

A systolic ejection murmur is present as follows: diminished intensity with increase preload (squatting) or afterload (handgrip) and increased intensity with a decrease in preload (Valsalva maneuver, standing), and with any decrease in afterload (vasodilator administration).
