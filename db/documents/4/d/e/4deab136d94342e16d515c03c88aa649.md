Fresh frozen plasma is indicated for the deficiency of coagulation factors with abnormal coagulation tests in the presence of active bleeding. Fresh frozen plasma is also indicated for a planned surgery or invasive procedure in the presence of abnormal coagulation tests, the reversal of warfarin in the presence of active bleeding, or planned procedure when vitamin K is inadequate to reverse the warfarin effect, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and congenital or acquired factor deficiency with no alternative therapy. This activity reviews the indications for fresh frozen plasma and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with coagulopathy that requires the use of fresh frozen plasma.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the mechanism of action of fresh frozen plasma.
- Describe the adverse effects of fresh frozen plasma.
- Review the appropriate monitoring of patients who are administered fresh frozen plasma.
- Explain some interprofessional team strategies to improve care coordination and advance managing conditions treated with fresh frozen plasma.
