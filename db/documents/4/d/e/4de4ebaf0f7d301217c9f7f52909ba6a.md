Coombs test is necessary when autoimmunity to red blood cells is a consideration in the differential diagnosis, including warm and cold hemolytic anemia. Following are some indications where antiglobulin testing becomes useful:

- Autoimmune hemolytic anemia

- Drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia

- Alloantibodies-mediated hemolytic transfusion reactions

- Hemolytic disease of the newborn

- Systemic lupus erythematosus (without hemolytic anemia)
