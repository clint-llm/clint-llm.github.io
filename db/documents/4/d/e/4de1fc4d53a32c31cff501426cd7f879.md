PLG: Flocks coined the term - Phacolytic glaucoma.

LPIG: Lens-particle-induced glaucoma was previously mislabeled as 'phacotoxic uveitis.' There is a release of lens particles after extra-capsular cataract extraction (ECCE) or a traumatic rupture of the lens capsule. The lens particles deposit directly into the TM, obstructing the aqueous outflow and leading to open-angle glaucoma. There is minimal-to-nil inflammation in LPIG.

PAG: Verhoeff and Lemoine described this entity as 'endophthalmitis phacoanaphylactica.'

PBG: The mechanism of classic pupillary block glaucoma is obstruction of aqueous flow in the mid-dilated pupil. An anteriorly positioned lens may worsen this condition. The presence of ectopia lentis with an anteriorly dislocated lens also blocks the aqueous flow similarly.

PMG: Phacomorphic glaucoma is precipitated by a sudden increase in the volume of the cataractous lens. The presence of an intumescent cataractous lens leads to pupillary block. Acute angle-closure with a shallow anterior chamber, with an open angle in the contralateral eye, suggests PMG.
