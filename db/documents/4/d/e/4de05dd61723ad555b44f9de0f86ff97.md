Infection with R. equi has been described in every continent. R. equi is best described as a soil organism that is carried in the gut of many herbivores and widespread in animal dung, manures, soils of grazing fields, and other related farm situations. The number of organisms isolated from the air increases with warmer temperatures and is typically highest on dry and windy days.

Exposure to soil contaminated with herbivore manure is likely the major route of acquisition for both animal and human infection. Humans and animals can acquire the infection by either inhalation or ingestion of contaminated material as well as traumatic inoculation or superinfection of wounds.

Even though horses and foals are traditional hosts, the infection has been described in other animals including sheep, goat, cattle, cats, dogs, and wild birds.
