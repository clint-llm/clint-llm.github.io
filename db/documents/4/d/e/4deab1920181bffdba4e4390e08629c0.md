Acute ankle sprains are commonly seen in both primary care and sports medicine practices as well as emergency departments and can result in significant short-term morbidity, recurrent injuries, and functional instability. Although nonoperative treatment is often successful in achieving satisfactory outcomes, correct diagnosis and treatment is important at the time of initial evaluation to mitigate the risks of recurrent instability.Â  Appropriate treatment can limit the impact of long-term detrimental effect such as chronic recurrent ankle instability, arthritic progression, and long-term disability.
