The innervation of the atlantoaxial joint is primarily by the branches of theÂ second cervical spinal nerve. In general, each cervical vertebrae has two nerve roots that arise from the spinal cord and extend out from each side. The ventral segment of the vertebrae contains the ventral root, and the dorsal segment of the vertebrae contains the dorsal root. As the nerve roots converge together in the spinal foramen, they are termed spinal nerves. Although there are seven cervical vertebrae, eight pairs of spinal nerves exist. Usually, the spinal nerves exit above each corresponding vertebrae. However, the C8 nerve root exits below the C7 vertebrae.
