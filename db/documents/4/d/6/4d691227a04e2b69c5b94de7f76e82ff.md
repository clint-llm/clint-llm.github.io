Coordinated patient care is key to the treatment of any disease. For patients with persistent chest pain, multiple emergency room visits, and numerous cardiology workups, osteopathic manipulative techniques need to be at the forefront of a provider's next treatment plan. Patients can be evaluated and assessed for underlying pathology while also being evaluated for musculoskeletal dysfunctions.

Clinicians should take responsibility for patient referrals to osteopathic providers when deadly underlying pathologies have safely been ruled out. Patients benefit from a well-rounded treatment approach that includes pharmacology, diagnostic testing, physical medicine, and manipulative treatments. This was shown in a clinical trial using rats where the lungs of rats diagnosed with Streptococcus pneumoniae had reduced levels of bacteria after receiving lymphatic pump techniques along with antibiotics compared to controls.

It is essential for all patient providers, including nurses, urgent care workers, primary care physicians, emergency medicine physicians, and pharmacists, to communicate openly to formulate a healthy treatment plan. This approach will help to better monitor patients with chronic pain to reduce opioid and other substance abuse. All of these methods of providing patient care will deliver a well-rounded systemic approach to healing patients with musculoskeletal discomfort from inhaled ribs and ruling out underlying deadly disease processes.
