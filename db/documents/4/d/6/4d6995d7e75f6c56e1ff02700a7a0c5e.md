Patients with invasive breast cancer who undergo breast conservation therapy should receive post-operative whole breast radiation as recommended by the NCCN guidelines. The purpose of radiotherapy is to eradicate any microscopic foci of remaining tumor cells in the conserved breast tissue to prevent local recurrence and distant metastasis. The addition of radiotherapy halved local recurrence rates, and there was an estimated 5% absolute reduction in breast cancer death at 15 years.

Additional adjunctive endocrine therapy has its basis on hormone receptor status, which is ER, PR, and HER-2-Neu status and is discussed elsewhere. For those patients with triple-negative expression, breast conservation therapy merits consideration, but chemotherapy is a recommendation.

Following curative treatment of non-metastasized breast cancer with breast-conserving therapy, imaging surveillance is of utmost importance to monitor for locoregional recurrence. Bilateral mammography 6 to 12 months after completing radiation therapy followed by an annual screening mammogram and biannual breast exam is the recommended procedure.
