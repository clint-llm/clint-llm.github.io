**Optical Basis For JCC Power Determination**

An astigmatic eye presents two foci at different meridians of the eye, which forms the conoid of Sturm. The main aim of the JCC power refining is to collapse the two focal points or to reduce the conoid of Sturm to the least possible.

When the JCC is used, there is a movement of the two focal points in the opposite direction because the opposite powers on the JCC are 90 degrees apart. One can assume that there is no astigmatic error in an eye when a JCC of +/- 0.50 is presented before the eye with the + 0.50 at the 90 meridians and the - 0.50 at the 180 meridians. The 90-degree meridian will focus 0.50 D in front of the retina, while the 180-degree meridian will focus 0.50 behind the retina.

A circle of least confusion will then be formed between the foci on the retina (the other limiting membrane). If the JCC is flipped, there is a reverse since the 180-degree meridian will now focus in front of the retina, while the 90-degree meridian will focus behind the retina. In both cases, the circle of least confusion will be the same, and the visual acuity will seem to be the same in both cases, thus indicating that there is no astigmatism.

In an eye that has not been corrected, let us assume the 90-degree meridian is of more plus power; the astigmatism is on the 180-degree meridian. When the JCC is presented, if the minus axis overlaps the 180-degree meridian, there will be an increase in the minus power at the 180-degree meridian. There will also be an increase of plus power on the 90-degree meridian, which gives rise to an increase in the circle of least confusion which, in other words, results in a blurry image. If the JCC is flipped, there will be a reduction of the plus power when the minus axis of the JCC overlaps the more plus meridian of the eye and a reduction in the minus power concurrently. In this case, the circle of least confusion is collapsed, and as such, the subject reports clear vision.
