There has been a 60% decrease in cases of MAOI exposures in the United States over the last 25 years. In 2015, only 208 cases of MAOI exposures were reported to poison control centers. Single exposures to MAOIs accounted for 90 of the cases. Adults accounted for 71 of these cases, and 28 cases were intentional ingestions. Death due to MAOI exposure is rare, with about one case reported per year over the past decade (including cases with both single and multiple exposures)
