Patients initiated on sotalol should be in the hospital for at least three days with cardiac rhythm monitoring and assessment facilities. Do not initiate sotalol with a baseline QTc greater than 450 msec. Providers should have magnesium over 2 mEq/L and potassium greater than 4 mEq/L available when patients receive sotalol. The dose requires adjustment according to renal function. The recommendation is that the dose of sotalol gradually is increased over a three-day interval. Most cardiologists recommend observing the patient in a hospital for at least three days after starting sotalol with serial EKGs.
