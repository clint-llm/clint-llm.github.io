**Issues of True IM Injections**

True intramuscular injections are observed only in 32 to 52%, with the incidence even falling to 8% among females.

**The Practice of Aspiration Prior to Drug Administration**

Though nurses continue practicing aspirations, most do it for a short duration than the recommended time of 5 to 10 seconds.

**Use of Filter Needles**

The syringe filters significantly minimize the risk of glass particle contamination.

Some of the current nursing practices pertaining to IM injections seem to evolve more like a tradition passing from one generation to the next and based upon Schön’s and Benner's learning concepts.
