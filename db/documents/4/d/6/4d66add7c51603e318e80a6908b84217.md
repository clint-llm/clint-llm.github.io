Appropriate patient selection and discussion regarding potential benefits, risks, recovery expectations, and complications are mandatory. Similar to incisional glaucoma procedures workups, the surgeon should take into account the patient's general health, including the status of the other eye. The patient must be assessed as to their anesthetic suitability, whether they are a candidate for local anesthesia under peribulbar/retrobulbar block or whether they require a general anesthetic assessment.

A complete ocular examination and subsequent biometry measurements for IOL selection are required if performing ECP with combined cataract surgery.

This assessment should consider any concurrent ocular inflammation and preoperatively control this as necessary. Along with factoring in any potential future interventional surgical operations the patient may later undertake and consider sparing the superotemporal quadrant of conjunctiva if deemed a possibility.
