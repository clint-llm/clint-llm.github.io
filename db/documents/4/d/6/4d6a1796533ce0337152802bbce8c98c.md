# Continuing Education Activity

The rare clinical manifestation of Popliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome (PAES) was defined approximately 40 years ago. It has a preference for young to middle-aged patients. The hallmark of this disease is a vascular compromise within the popliteal fossa resulting in an insidious, progressive course of exercise intolerance and calf pain with exertion relieved by rest (claudication). While the incidence of this disease has risen slightly in recent years, the true prevalence is unknown as the number of cases is likely underreported. This activity describes the evaluation, and treatment of PAES, and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the most common age group to be affected by popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.
- Describe the most common clinical presentation of popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.
- Summarize the treatments available for popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.
- Outline the medical management and education options the interprofessional team should provide to a patient with popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.

# Introduction

Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES), described by Stuart in1879, is an uncommon limb-threatening vascular entity comprising approximately 0.17%-3.5% of the general population in the United States (US)

Additionally, the management of uncomplicated PAES usually includes the surgical exploration with the addition of fasciotomy, the myotomy, or the release of the popliteal artery by sectioning the fibrous bands

# Etiology

Both congenital and acquired mechanisms have been proposed in the development of PAES

The embryological phases of the plantaris muscles play a significant contribution to the congenital PAES

Furthermore, various anomalies regarding the relative position of the popliteal artery, medial head of the gastrocnemius (MHG) and popliteus muscles define the multiple types of PAES

# Epidemiology

Although PAES remains an essential cause for vascular compromise, over the last few decades, the incidence of this uncommon abnormality has increasedet al. reported the overall incidence of PAES to be in the range of 0.17% to 3.5% general population

# Pathophysiology

Generally, the majority of the PAES cases are due to the embryological anomalies while fewer patients have been documented having acquired (fibrous bands) causes for the PAES

- **Type I:**An aberrant medial course of the popliteal artery around a normally positioned MHG

- **Type II:**MHG attaches abnormally and more laterally on the femur causing the popliteal artery to pass medially and inferiorly

- **Type III**: Abnormal fibrous band or accessory muscle arising from the medial or lateral condyle encircling the popliteal artery

- **Type IV:**Popliteal artery lying in its primitive deep or axial position within the fossa, becoming compromised by the popliteus muscle or fibrous bands

- **Type V:**The entrapment of both the popliteal artery and vein due to any of the causes mentioned above

- **Type VI:**The muscular hypertrophy, resulting in a functional compression of both the popliteal artery and vein

The functional PAES (Type VI or F) describes another subtype of the disease that is not due to inherited anatomic abnormalities

A more straightforward and practical classification system for the PAES was also introduced by Heidelberg et al.

- **Type 1:**The problem lies in the course of the popliteal artery

- **Type 2:**The muscular insertion is atypical

- **Type 3:**Both of the abovementioned conditions are present

# History and Physical

A high degree of clinical suspicion is warranted as the patients affected with the PAES can face significant physical impairment. Symptoms usually present in the second to third decade of life and are insidious in onsetet al. in a study also reported that the absence of the food pulses during the active plantar flexion and passive dorsiflexion of the foot is characteristic for the PAES

# Evaluation

Diagnosis of the PAES poses a considerable clinical challenge as it calls for the proper interpretation of clinical as well as radiological aspects of this rare clinical entity. Radiologically, to achieve the higher sensitivity in detecting the PAES, a combination of the radiological tests elaborating not only the functional and anatomical status of the popliteal artery; but also the structural details of the popliteal fossa are favoredet al. reported that a combination of the MRI and the duplex ultrasonography (DU) is far superior in diagnosing PAES

Besides, the duplex arterial ultrasonography (DAU) using provocative maneuvers (leg/foot positioned first in a neutral position and then in resisted plantar flexion) provides a quick, inexpensive, and non-invasive initial screening test

# Treatment / Management

The management of the PAES is tailored based on the presence and absence of the symptoms

Furthermore, for symptomatic PAES patients, surgical resection has been the management of choice

Also, the open surgical procedures offer the best results to address the PAES and assess the artery for repair or bypass

Moreover, the management of functional PAES is still controversial although some have had success with gastrocnemius debulking

# Differential Diagnosis

Various surgical and non-surgical conditions mimic the PAES which add additional challenge in diagnosing this limb-threatening condition. The differential diagnosis for the PAES include but not limited to

- Chronic exertional compartment syndrome

- Medial tibial stress syndrome

- Fibular stress fractures

- Tibial stress fractures

- Fascial defects

- Nerve entrapment syndrome

- Referred pain from lumbar disc herniation

# Prognosis

The prognosis of the PAES entirely relies on its detection time. If PAES is detected and managed early in the course of the disease, the prognosis of the PAES  is generally reasonable

# Complications

PAES is a limb-threatening vascular disorder demanding of early clinical diagnosis and early intervention. If this disorder is undetected, PAES can lead to the

- Popliteal artery stenosis (PAS)

- Popliteal artery thrombosis (PAT)

- Distal arterial thromboembolism (DAT)

- Limb amputation

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Following steps should be part of PAES patient education.

- The patient should be educated about the cause of the PAES as detailed as possible.

- They should be educated that earlier surgical intervention is the only way to reverse the progression of the disease and offers the best treatment.

- Post-operatively patient must be educated about the signs and symptoms of the compartment syndrome.

# Enhancing Healthcare Team Outcomes

PAES is a rare vascular disorder seen in young people. The diagnosis is difficult and thus requires an interprofessional team that includes a radiologist, nurse practitioner, vascular surgeon, primary care provider, and an emergency department physician. The treatment depends on the symptoms. The primary care provider can observe asymptomatic patients, but symptomatic patients require treatment. There are several treatments besides an open vascular bypass. Following treatment most patients have a good outcome; however, several patients may develop nerve injury following surgery (Level V).
