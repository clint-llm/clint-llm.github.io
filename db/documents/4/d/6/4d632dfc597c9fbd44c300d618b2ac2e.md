Preparation is similar to other cardiac catheterization procedures.

- Patients should be adequately assessed for the procedure and counseled in detail about the risks, benefits, and complications of the procedure.

- Blood tests are done before proceeding to check the coagulation profile, especially if the patient is taking anticoagulants.

- The patient is kept on fasting for at least six hours before the procedure. Intravenous cannulas are maintained, and antibiotics with an anti-staphylococcal coverage are administered as a prophylaxis for implant infection.

- After arriving in the catheterization laboratory, the patient is draped after cleaning the access site with an antiseptic solution.

- Intravenous sedation is given before the procedure, and local anesthetic agents are given at the site of venous puncture and pocket formation.
