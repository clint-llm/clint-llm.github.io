The diagnosis of pulseless VT is based on physical examination and ECG. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, according to Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines, should be started immediately as far as the diagnosis is confirmed. ECG findings usually include regular R-R intervals, rapid ventricular rate with an undistinguishable atrial rate (absence of p-waves), AV dissociation, and a wide QRS complex (more than 0.12 sec).

Several ECG criteria have been created to help diagnose VT.

**The Classical Criteria:**

- AV dissociation

- Capture or fusion beats

- Negative or positive concordance

- Right bundle branch configuration

- QRS width >140 ms and left axis 
- QR, R, or RSr' complex in V1
- RS >1 in V6 or QS in V6

- Left bundle branch configuration

- QRS width >160 ms and right axis
- Initial R in V1 >30 ms
- Slurring or notching of the downstroke of the S-wave in V1-2
- Begin QRS-nadir S-wave in V1-2
- Any Q in V6

**Brugada Criteria:**

- Absence of an RS complex in all precordial leads

- The longest R to S interval >100 ms in any precordial lead

- AV dissociation

- Classical criteria for both VT present in both lead V1-2 and V6

If any single one of the above Brugada criteria is present, then VT is diagnosed.

**The Vereckei Criteria:**

- The presence of AV dissociation

- In lead aVR (any one of the following):

- The presence of an initial R-wave
- Initial R or Q > 40ms
- Notch in the descending limb of a negative onset and predominantly negative QRS
- Vi/Vt ≤ 1

In general, per the AHA, basic criteria to support the diagnosis of VT includes

- AV dissociation

- QRS complex >0.14 seconds

- Monophasic R wave in aVR

- Specific QRS morphologies (i.e., positively or negatively concordant QRS complex in precordial leads)

- The absence of an RS complex in all precordial leads

- An RS interval >100 ms in at least 1 precordial lead
