Approximately 33% of the world's population has latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). For this reason, screening for Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is essential for public health. People with LBTI are at risk for developing active tuberculosis (TB) and becoming infectious. The greatest risk for progression occurs during the first two years of infection. The goal of testing for LTBI is to identify individuals who are at high risk of developing active TB. The decision to test should presuppose a decision to treat if the result is positive.

The tuberculin skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) are the current methods for screening and are based on the measurement of adaptive host immune response.
