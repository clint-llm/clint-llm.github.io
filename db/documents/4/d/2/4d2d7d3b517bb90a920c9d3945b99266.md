The superficial perineal space contains three pairs of muscles that are contained within the superficial perineal pouch. These include the following:

**Ischiocavernosus**

The ischiocavernosus is a paired muscle covering the crus penis in males and the crus clitoris in females. It originates from the ischial tuberosity and the ischiopubic ramus and forms the lateral boundary of the perineum. It attaches to the under-surface of the crus clitoris and the crus penis. It is innervated by the deep branch of the perineal nerve and receives its arterial supply from the perineal artery, a branch of the internal pudendal artery. Contraction of the ischiocavernosus muscle pushes the blood away from the roots of the erectile tissue and also leads to the compression of the surrounding veins preventing venous return. This helps in maintaining the turgidity of the penis and the clitoris during erection.

**Bulbospongiosus**

The bulbospongiosus covers the bulb of the penis in males and encircles the vaginal orifice in females. It is a bipennate muscle and has different origins and insertions in the two sexes. In females, it originates from the perineal body and is inserted into on the dorsal surface of the corpora cavernosa of the clitoris.

In males, the muscle originates from the median raphe and the perineal body and divides into three fibers: the anterior fibers that radiate to encircle the corpus cavernosum, the middle fibers encircle the bulb of the penis and the corpus spongiosum, the posterior fibers attached to the perineal membrane. It is innervated by the deep branch of the perineal nerve and receives its blood supply from the perineal artery a branch of the internal pudendal artery. In males the compression of the bulbospongiosus, aids in emptying the penile urethra during urination and ejaculation. In both the sexes the contraction of the muscle aids in the process of erection by force blood from the corpus spongiosum in males and the bulb of the vestibule in females to more distal structures.

**Superficial Transverse Perineal Muscle**

The superficial transverse perineal muscle is a transverse strip of muscle that runs across the superficial perineal space anterior to the anus. It originates from the anterior and medial aspect of the ischial tuberosity and inserts at the perineal body. It is also innervated by the deep branch of the perineal nerve.
