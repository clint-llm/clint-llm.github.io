- Nitrogen dioxide exposuresÂ may occur secondary to stored silage in grain silos, "Zamboni" ice resurfacers, electroplating, or as a combustive byproduct of nitrogen fuel.

- Acute exposures should be admitted for 24 hours to observe for signs of delayed pneumonitis.

- Be aware of nitrogen dioxide's triphasic illness and assess for signs and symptoms 2 to 8 weeks after initial exposure.

- Treatment includes removal from source, supportive care for any acute lung injury, and steroids in the setting of bronchiolitis obliterans.
