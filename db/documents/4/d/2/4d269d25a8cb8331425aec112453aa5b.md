Neuronal brain tumors are an uncommon group of central nervous system tumors that arise from cells with neuronal differentiation. These tumors may be purely neuronal in origin or have mixed neuronal and glial components, which comprise a subset of glioneuronal tumors.

The purely neuronal group includes gangliocytoma, multinodular and vacuolating neuronal tumor (MVNT), dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma (Lhermitte-Duclos disease), central neurocytoma, extraventricular neurocytoma, and cerebellar liponeurocytoma. The mixed glioneuronal group includes ganglioglioma, desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma/desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma (DIG/DIA), dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET), diffuse glioneuronal tumor with oligodendroglioma-like features and nuclear clusters (DGONC), papillary glioneuronal tumor (PGT), rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor (RGNT), myxoid glioneuronal tumor (MGT), and diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT). MVNT, DGONC, and MGT are newly classified entities in the WHO CNS tumor classification schema.

Although there are some exceptions, these tumors are mostly low-grade with minimal risk for an aggressive clinical course. They most commonly present with seizures, although other symptoms of space-occupying intracranial lesions such as headache, vomiting, papilledema, cerebellar dysfunction, and focal neurological deficit have also been described.
