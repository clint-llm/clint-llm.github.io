Man in a barrel syndrome can result from bilateral watershed strokes due to systemic hypotension, such as seen in cardiac arrest.

- The internal carotid artery supplies blood flow to the anterior two-thirds of the brain via the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The most distal branches of the ACA and MCA supply brain tissue, including upper extremity motor fibers. In the setting of inadequate blood flow to both sides, the brain, these most distal branches, or watershed zones, do not receive an adequate amount of oxygenated blood, resulting in the death of these cells. Based on the neuroanatomy of these anterior circulation watershed zones, damage to these areas can result in bilateral upper extremity weakness.

- Any lesion affecting the bilateral upper extremity motor fibers can result in similar clinical findings of bilateral upper extremity weakness - including hemorrhage, inflammatory lesions, traumatic injury, or neoplastic or metastatic disease.

- Acute ischemia in the brainstem pyramidal decussation or cervical spinal cord, compressive or intrinsic cervical spinal cord lesions affecting upper extremity motor fibers while sparing lower extremity motor fibers, and peripheral neuropathic injury involving the bilateral nerve roots, brachial plexus, peripheral nerves, or neuromuscular junction can all result in MIBS.
