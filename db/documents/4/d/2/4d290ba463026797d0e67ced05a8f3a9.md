The treatment of clear cell carcinoma is similar to that of cervical cancer. Radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy constitute a standard surgical treatment for patients withÂ early-stage cervical carcinoma FIGO stage IB or IIA, which results in permanent infertility in the patient. External beam radiotherapy is the standard of care for stage IIB and IIIB.

A recent study revealed oncologic outcomes of fertility-sparing radical trachelectomy versus radical hysterectomy for stage IB1 cervical carcinoma in young adult women and found no statistically significant survival differences, indicating that for early-stage cancer, fertility-sparing surgery is a safe option.
