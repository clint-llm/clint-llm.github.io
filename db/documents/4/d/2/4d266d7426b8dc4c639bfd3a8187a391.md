Elevated pulmonary vascular resistance is caused by the proliferation of endothelial and smooth muscle cells, causing tunica media hypertrophy of small-caliber pulmonary arteries. Moreover, the endothelial cells have impaired production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin.

Patients with idiopathic and heritable forms of pulmonary artery hypertension (HPAH) are distinguished by identifying an inheritable genetic mutation, whereas idiopathic forms have an underlying genetic predisposition to develop pulmonary hypertension. Regardless, both forms have genetic mutations that overlap each disease process. IPAH has correlated with the following genetic mutations: bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2), mothers against decapentaplegic, Drosophila, a homolog of 1 and 9 (SMAD 1 and 9), potassium channel subfamily K member 3 (KCNK3), and caveolin 1 (CAV1). While a genetic basis exists in the development of IPAH, there are environmental factors that likely contribute to the pathogenesis. For instance, in a review of 340 patients with idiopathic PAH, it was found that these patients were 10.14 times more likely to have a history of stimulant use (amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine) in comparison to patients with pulmonary artery hypertension and a risk factor (familial disease, collagen vascular disease, congenital systemic-to-pulmonic shunts, or use of fenfluramine/dexfenfluramine). Further research is needed to elucidate these findings fully.
