Folic acid deficiency can arise from multiple causes, including inadequate dietary intake. Heating during cooking destroys folic acid. Folate is absorbed in the jejunum by active and passive transport mechanisms across the intestinal wall. Hence, diseases such as celiac disease, tropical sprue, short bowel syndrome, amyloidosis, gastric bypass, or mesenteric vascular insufficiency can inhibit folate absorption resulting in a deficiency. Elevated pH, as occurs in achlorhydria, can also lead to poor folate absorption. Drugs such as methotrexate, phenytoin, sulfasalazine, and trimethoprim can antagonize folate utilization, inhibit its absorption or conversation to its active form resulting in folate deficiency. Congenital deficiencies of enzymes required in folate metabolism can lead to folate deficiency.  Folic acid deficiency can occur subsequent to vitamin B-12 deficiency due to an impairment of methionine synthase resulting in the trapping of folate as methyltetrahydrofolate whereby methylene THFA accumulates in serum leading to folate trap phenomenon and increased urinary excretion of folate. Alcoholism is a significant cause of folate deficiency. Pregnancy, hemolytic anemia, and dialysis can also result in folate deficiency.
