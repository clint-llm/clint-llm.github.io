Epidemiology varies depending on the subset to which one refers.

- Professionals estimate that 1% of the population suffers from erosive esophagitis.

- Medication-induced esophagitis has an estimated incidence of 3.9 per 100,000 population per year with a mean age at diagnosis of 41.5 years.

- Many studies have tried to identify the most accurate incidence and prevalence of eosinophilic esophagitis. The estimated incidence is 0.35 per 100,000 population with a prevalence of 55 per 100,000 population has been associated with food allergies, asthma, and eczema. It appears to be more common in males who usually present with symptoms in their 2nd or 3rd decade.

- Radiation esophagitis is a relatively frequent complication of radiation therapy. Acute injury invariably occurs at doses of 6000 cGy given in fractions of 1000 cGy per week. Lower doses or longer schedules are associated with lower rates of radiation esophagitis.

- For infectious esophagitis, the numbers are not very easy to define. One thing that is certain is that is way more prevalent in patients who are immunocompromised such as HIV-infected patients and patients with hematological malignancies.
