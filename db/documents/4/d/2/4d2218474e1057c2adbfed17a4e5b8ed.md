Osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD) is a benign fibro-osseous developmental condition of bone which commonly occurs in the cortical bone of the anterior mid-shaft of the tibia in children.

The term "osteofibrous dysplasia of the tibia and fibula" was coined by Camanacci and Laus, thereby including the histological similarity to fibrous dysplasia and the occurrence of the disease in the tibia in the term.

OFD can be classified as monostotic, polyostotic, and McCune Albright syndrome. Most cases of monostotic lesions present with no significant symptoms and are often found incidentally on x-ray. The condition mainly affects patients in their third decade.
