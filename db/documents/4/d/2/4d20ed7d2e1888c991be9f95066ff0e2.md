Abdominal angina is postprandial pain that occurs in mesenteric vascular occlusive disease when blood flow to the colon is unable to meet visceral demands. This is similar to intermittent claudication in peripheral vascular disease or angina pectoris in coronary artery disease. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of abdominal angina and the role of the interprofessional team in recognizing and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Describe patient history clues that might lead to consideration of abdominal angina. 
- Review the gold standard test for diagnosing abdominal angina.
- Explain the interprofessional team's role in decreasing the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with abdominal angina. 
- Describe how careful patient monitoring and good communication among the interprofessional team will improve patient outcomes in those with abdominal angina.
