PML is a severe, progressive, multifocal, demyelinating disease, and it is fatal in most cases. Present therapy is directed at prolonging survival rates. Remyelination does not occur, and patients can develop complications in the long term. These are primarily neurological and include cognitive impairment, sensory deficits, motor deficits, and disturbances in coordination.
