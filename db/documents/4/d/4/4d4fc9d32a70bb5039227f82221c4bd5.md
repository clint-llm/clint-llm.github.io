There is a classic correlation between the prevalence of SpA and the prevalence of HLA-B27 gene in a given population. The strongest relationship is in AS. In the United States, the prevalence of HLA-B27 is 7% of the general population, but it is present in 90% of those diagnosed with ASHLA-B27, HLA-DR7, and HLA-DQ3. In IBD associated arthritis (Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis), the HLA association is weaker compared to the other SpAs. ReA (which follows enteric or urogenital infection) has a variable relationship with HLA-B27 with studies reporting anywhere from below 50% to 60% to 85% associationHLA-B27 is positive in about 50% of those with undifferentiated SpA and 60% to 80% of those with juvenile-onset SpA.
