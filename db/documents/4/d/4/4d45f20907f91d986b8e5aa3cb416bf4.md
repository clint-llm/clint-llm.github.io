The evaluation of digital clubbing is primarily during initial patient evaluation. A thoroughly taken history including attention to characteristic features of the many possible etiologies of clubbing should be taken into account. The history is followed by the physical exam where digital clubbing is assessed based on the features mentioned above, and measurements. Acquired clubbing is most often associated with pulmonary or cardiovascular diseases so obtaining chest radiography is very reasonable during initial workup. If plain films demonstrate no abnormality, a CT scan is a next step to look for a pulmonary neoplasm or other lesions which may still be localized and curable.
