Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common trachea cancer and is commonly seen in patients with a smoking history. It constitutes one-third of all primary tracheal tumors. These lesions are primarily found in the lower third of the trachea and involve the posterior wall. Based on a review of 59 cases diagnosed between 1985 and 2008, 24% of tracheal squamous cell cancers were well-differentiated, 49% were moderately differentiated, and 27% demonstrated poor differentiation.

The next most common type of primary malignant tracheal tumors is adenoid cystic cancers which look similar to salivary gland tumors, which are slow-growing, well-differentiated, and present with infiltration of the submucosal planes resulting in positive margins at surgery due to their longitudinal axis involvement. An analysis of 108 cases of tracheal adenoid cystic carcinoma showed positive microscopic margins (R1) in 55% of cases, and positive macroscopic margins (R2) were noted in 8% of cases.

Adenocarcinoma may be seen in the trachea secondary to the direct invasion from the lung tumor or the involvement of the mediastinal lymph nodes. Patients usually present with obstructive symptoms in the later decades of life and with bulky tumors. Histologically, this tumor wouldÂ demonstrate large vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli with mucin production.
