In general, the appendix will appear normal, but the nearby mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches may show epithelioid granulomatous lesions, coagulative necrosis, and lymphoid hyperplasia, and can resemble tuberculosis. The small bowel may develop microabscesses, cryptic hyperplasia, and shortening of villi. Granulomatous abscesses form in organs like the liver, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and intestines when the organism spreads during sepsis.
