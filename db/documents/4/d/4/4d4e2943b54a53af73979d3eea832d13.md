The straight leg raise test also called the Lasegue test, is a fundamental neurological maneuver during the physical examination of a patient with lower back painÂ that seeks to assess the sciatic compromise due to lumbosacral nerve root irritation. This test, which was first described by Dr. Lazarevic and wrongly attributed to Dr. Lasegue, can be positive in various conditions, making lumbar disc herniation the most common. Nonetheless, there are multiple causes of a positive test, such as facet joint cysts or hypertrophy.

Low back pain is one of the most common complaints among active workers and a significant cause of absenteeism from work. Sciatic pain is radiating pain from the buttocks to the legs and is frequently associated with low back pain.

Therefore the objective is to describe the maneuver technique, pathophysiology, history, and usefulness of this common test through a review of the literature.
