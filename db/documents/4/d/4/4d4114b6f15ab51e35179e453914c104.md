Electrical injuries are a complex form of trauma that is often associated with high morbidity and mortality. The severity of the injuries depends upon the type of current, the voltage, and the resistance. This activity will review the pathophysiology behind electrical burns and explain the role of the interprofessional team as they evaluate and treat these complex patients.

**Objectives:**
- Explain the difference between alternating and direct current and the different injury patterns seen with both.
- Identify the potential immediate and long term complications associated with electrical injuries.
- Outline the treatment of patients presenting with electrical injuries.
- Summarize the importance of using an interprofessional team, system-based critical care approach in managing patients with electrical injuries.
