The rectum plays a role in fecal continence and the storage of feces. Directly above the pelvic diaphragm or the levator ani and the anococcygeal ligament is a dilation of the terminal rectum known as the ampulla. This area is the location where feces accumulate and remain until defecation. The ampulla of the rectum is very distensible and is capable of regulating the movement of fecal material into the anal canal for expulsion. The shape of the rectum, in conjunction with the flexures created along the way, also aids in the mechanism of fecal continence.

The anal canal also helps with the storage and expulsion of feces. The superior portion of the anal canal contains a circular muscle layer called the internal anal sphincter, which is tonically contracted most of the time to prevent leakage. The involuntary contraction of this muscle gets stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system and gets inhibited by the parasympathetic nervous system. As feces or gas passes through, the distension in the rectal ampulla causes a temporary relaxation of the internal anal sphincter and a voluntary contraction of the external anal sphincter, which is in the inferior portion of the anal canal.
