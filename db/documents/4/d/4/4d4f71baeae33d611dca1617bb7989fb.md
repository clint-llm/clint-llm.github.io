Paclitaxel is available as an IV formula infused over 3 to 24 hours, depending on the indication or protocol. Certain off-label protocols use a 1-hour infusion, as well as off-label intraperitoneal use. Paclitaxel infusion should be through a 0.22-micron in-line filter and polyethylene-lined administration set (non-PVC).
