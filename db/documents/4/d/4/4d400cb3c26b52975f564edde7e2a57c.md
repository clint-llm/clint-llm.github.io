Pneumatosis intestinalis itself is not a primary disease but a clinical sign of underlying pathology. In 1998, BL Pear proposed the mechanisms behind extraluminal gas formation included bowel necrosis, pulmonary disease, and abnormal mucosal permeability. The cause of PI may also be multifactorial from pulmonary, mechanical, and bacterial causes, although mucosal integrity disruption is present in all scenarios. The condition can also further be divided into primary and secondary types. In primary pneumatosis intestinalis, the gas collection is benign in nature and creates a cystic pattern in the intraluminal wall. Secondary pneumatosis intestinalis is correlated with a pathological condition, and gas distribution appears in a more linear fashion.
