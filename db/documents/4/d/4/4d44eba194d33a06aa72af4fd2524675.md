Brain damage caused by hydrocephalus can be significant and depends on multiple factors. Newborns with severe advanced hydrocephalus at birth will likely have brain damage and physical disabilities. Patients with less severe hydrocephalus who receive adequate treatment may have a relatively healthy life. Complications are associated with hydrocephalus progression, medical treatment, and surgical procedure.
