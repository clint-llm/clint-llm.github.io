The BBB tightly controls the entrance of molecules from the plasma into the central nervous system (CNS) and plays a critical role in proper CNS function. BBB dysfunction can be seen in numerous chronic degenerative neurologic disorders such as Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson disease, as well as acute CNS disorders such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and stroke.
