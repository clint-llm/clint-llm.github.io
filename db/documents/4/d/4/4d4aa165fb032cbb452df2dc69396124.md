The clinical evaluation for viral hemorrhagic fevers includes complete blood count with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel, type and cross, coagulation studies, liver function tests, as well as evaluation for bacterial infections with urinalysis, urine culture, chest x-ray, and blood cultures. Serological testing for virus-specific IgM and IgG can be helpful but is not as sensitive or specific as molecular-based testing. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and virus isolation via cell culture are methods that can be used for diagnostic testing.
