A hysterosalpingogram procedure assesses the female genital tract anatomy with a focus on the fallopian tubes and uterus. The female internal genitalia typically is comprised of a uterus with two fallopian tubes. During organogenesis, it is possible to have many different congenital malformations affecting the reproductive system. The endometrial cavity can have defects, which can be from Mullerian duct anomalies. These defects are from a failed resorption of the uterovaginal septum that can range from an arcuate uterus to a septate uterus. Additionally, defects result from the incomplete fusion of the Mullerian ducts, which can lead to a bicornuate uterus presentation.

There are currently seven classifications for Mullerian abnormalities: agenesis, unicornuate, didelphys, bicornuate, septate, arcuate, and Diesthystilbestrol-related anomalies. Imaging databases house different variations of abnormalities, useful for anatomical presentations that fall into a mixture of classifications.

Additional pathologies aside from Mullerian abnormalities include uterine cancer, polyps, fibroids, and adhesions. There are other superior ways to detect these findings, but the findings can still be present with a hysterosalpingogram.

Additional pathologies that can be diagnosed from hysterosalpingogram focus on the patency of the fallopian tubes. Tubal occlusions are present in 12 to 33% of patients undergoing an infertility workup.Chlamydia trachomatis infection and female infertility in greater than 75% of studies.
