Though there are small anatomic variations in the size and location of the femoral and tibial attachment, the surgical aim in the reconstruction of ACL is to provide adequate stability to the knee while allowing it to function well, allowing the patient to return to their normal activities.

A good understanding of the anatomy of attachments, the direction of the two bundles of ACL, and its status during flexion and extension of the knee is vital in achieving correct tunnel placement during surgery for securing the graft and obtain good tensioning of the graft.

The graft used to reconstruct the ACL can be either from the patient's tissues, a cadaveric tissue, or a synthetic material. The commonest autografts used are hamstring tendon, bone-patellar tendon-bone graft, and quadriceps tendon.

The chemical treatment and the irradiated autografts carry slightly higher risks of failure, infection, and lower outcome scores compared to autografts.

Chalmers et al. reviewed 29 studies with at least a 10-year follow-up comparing surgical and conservative management of ACL injuries. Surgical reconstruction was associated with fewer meniscal injuries and subsequent surgeries than nonoperative treatment. Some also argue that there were no differences in outcome scores (IKDC scores, Tegner scores, and Lysholm scores), and radiographic arthritis between the two groups.
