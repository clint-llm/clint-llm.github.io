- Always consider drug-induced linear IgA bullous dermatosis (LABD)  in adults with a new diagnosis of LABD.

- The chronic bullous disease of childhood has a reassuring prognosis as most of the cases spontaneously resolve within a few years of onset.

- Vancomycin is the most common cause of drug-induced LABD.

- Loose associations exist between LABD and malignancy, gastrointestinal disease, and autoimmune disease.

- Classic histopathological findings on H and E include subepidermal split, rich neutrophilic infiltrate +/- eosinophils.

- Classic DIF finding is linear IgA deposited along the basement membrane zone.

- Classic IIF finding is circulating IgA antibodies deposited on the epidermal side of salt-split skin (lamina lucida subtype) or circulating IgA antibodies deposited on the dermal side of salt-split skin (sub-lamina densa subtype).

- Vancomycin-induced LABD is associated with a severe presentation of the disease that may mimic TEN.

- At least two initial biopsies should be obtained, one of an actual lesion for H and E and another from a perilesional area for DIF.

- The most commonly used treatment is dapsone.
