**Ultrasonography**

High-resolution ultrasonography is considered to be the modality of the first choice for the detection of neoplasms in the salivary glands. However, ultrasonography is unable to evaluate that portion of the parotid gland situated deep in the mandible. Ultrasonography of salivary gland masses includes the evaluation of the contralateral gland as well as the cervical lymph nodes. If the lesion requires to be identified before surgery, ultrasound-guided FNAC may be performed. In Warthin tumors, ultrasonography reveals a well-defined mass with multiple anechoic areas or an anechoic mass, with posterior acoustic enhancement at the lower pole of the parotid. Nevertheless, the pattern may vary, and fast growth secondary to infection may occur. In some cases, multiple septa and the thickness of intratumoral fluid give a heterogeneous echogenic pattern. Since Warthin tumors are often multiple and bilateral, the contralateral gland should always be examined.

**Magnetic Resonance Imaging**

On MRI examination, Warthin tumors are often seen as encapsulated lesions that show low or intermediate T1-weighted signal features. The neoplasm shows intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted images.
