The goal of ARBC/D management is to prevent or decrease sudden cardiac death.

Management of ARVC/D includes pharmacologic, surgical, catheter ablation, and placement of implantable cardiac defibrillator.

1. Pharmacologic treatment involves arrhythmia suppression and prevention of thrombus formation.

- Sotalol is a beta blocker and class III antiarrhythmic agent. It is the most effective antiarrhythmic agent in ARVC/D.

- Warfarin is an anticoagulant. With decreased right ventricular ejection fraction and dyskinesis, anticoagulation may help prevent thrombus formation and further complications such as pulmonary embolism.

2. Radiofrequency catheter ablation may be used to treat refractory or incessant ventricular tachycardia.

3. The implantable cardiac defibrillator is the most effective against sudden cardiac death.

- Cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation

- Symptomatic ventricular tachycardia that is not inducible during programmed stimulation

- Failed programmed stimulation-guided drug therapy

- Severe right ventricular involvement with poor tolerance of ventricular tachycardia

- The sudden death of an immediate family member

4. Cardiac transplant surgery is performed in ARVC/D if there is uncontrolled arrhythmia or failure to manage right ventricular or biventricular failure with pharmacologic therapy.
