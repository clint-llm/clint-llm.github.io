Though CPET is generally tolerated well, it is not without risk. There are several absolute and relative contraindications for testing, which are compiled from expert opinion and the currently accepted standard of care. The absolute contraindications include:

- Active myocardial ischemia

- Decompensated heart failure

- Exercise-induced syncope

- Uncontrolled/untreated arrhythmias

- Severe aortic stenosis

- Endocarditis, myocarditis, pericarditis

- Aortic dissection or suspected dissecting aortic aneurysm

- Untreated pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis

- Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation or uncontrolled asthma

- Acute pulmonary edema

- Resting oxygen saturation of less than 85%

- Acute respiratory failure

The relative contraindications that may preclude the use of CPET until the patient is more stable to complete the test include:

- Severe pulmonary hypertension

- Untreated left main coronary artery stenosis

- Moderate stenotic valvular disease

- Severe hypertension (systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 200 mmHg, or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) greater than 120 mmHg)

- Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

- Second or third-degree atrioventricular block

- Uncorrected electrolyte abnormalities

- Symptomatic tachycardia or bradycardia

- Advanced or complicated pregnancy

- An implanted cardiac defibrillator that cannot be interrogated or temporarily reset due to inaccessibility to device representative
