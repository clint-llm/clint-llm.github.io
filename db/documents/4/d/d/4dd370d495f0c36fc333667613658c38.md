As described earlier, thoracic aortic aneurysms are commonly suspected on chest radiographic films when done for an unrelated indication and are characterized by widening of the mediastinal silhouette, abnormalities of aortic contour, or tracheal deviation.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are imaging modalities of choice for accurate detection and measurement of TAA. It is preferred to delineate aortic anatomy, size, branch artery involvement, and to rule out other differentials.

Echocardiography can also be used to visualize the aorta and its major branches. The suprasternal view is best for viewing the aortic arch, whereas orthogonal and longitudinal scanning plans are beneficial when the involvement of the innominate artery, left subclavian artery or left common carotid artery is also suspected.

If TAA is detected, it is recommended to image the abdominal aorta to screen for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
