Simulated learning and can have varying levels of difficulty. To create efficacy, simulations must address learning objectives for the case, contain a debrief, offer open-ended questions to facilitate learning, and must be in a safe, non-judgmental learning environment.

Simulation allows transition away from the classic master-apprentice model. They are implemented with various gynecologic and obstetric procedures such as pediatric-adolescent gynecologic exams, management of postpartum hemorrhage, laparoscopic hysterectomy, cesarean sections, and interdisciplinary obstetric emergencies.

These articles have demonstrated the experience contains similarities to the operative and patient encounters and that practicing utilizing simulation-based training has provided learners with more comfort and confidence with the patient and operative management. The repetition and simulation increase skill acquisition in a protected environment.
