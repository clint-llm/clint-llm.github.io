Ludwig angina is primarily diagnosed based on clinical evaluation. Imaging studies do not play a direct role in the immediate assessment of the patient. In cases with a compromised airway, the decision to intubate is based solely on clinical parameters, as delaying treatment to send the patient for a CT scan can delay treatment. Once the airway is secured, a neck CT with intravenous contrast is the most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate the severity of the infection and assess for abscess.

Although common in clinical practice, laboratory testing holds little immediate value in the diagnosis of Ludwig angina since it primarily relies on clinical assessment. Blood cultures should be obtained to determine if the infection has a hematogenous spread. Obtaining cultures from the affected area through swab or needle aspiration has limited diagnostic value in cases of Ludwig angina.
