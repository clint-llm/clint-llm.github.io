The incidence of type I hypersensitivity is hard to predict as discrepancies occur in the assessment of the type of reaction. For instance, some document patients as having anaphylaxis reaction status-post milder symptoms, and others report anaphylaxis with a full-blown presentation. A study predicted that the frequency of an individual experiencing anaphylaxis is 1% to 2% worldwide, with the incidence increasing in the younger population.

European research estimates that 0.3% (95% CI 0.1â€“0.5) of the population will undergo episodes of anaphylaxis in their lifetime.
