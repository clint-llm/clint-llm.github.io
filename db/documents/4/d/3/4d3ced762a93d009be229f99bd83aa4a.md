Brain death occurs after the destruction of enough neuronal cells in the brain that there is both an irreversible loss of consciousness (coma) and the absence of brainstem reflexes, including the inability of the lungs to inhale and exhale without external positive pressure support (apnea).

In adults and children, the precipitant of brain death is either from an intracranial or extracranial cause. First, we have to establish an acute and irreversible cause. Intracranial injuries leading to brain death in adults are most commonly caused by traumatic brain injury or subarachnoid hemorrhage. In children, the most common cause is non-accidental trauma. The extracranial cause of brain death is most commonly cardiopulmonary arrest with inadequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

We have to exclude the presence of any drugs or poisoning in the system. This can be accomplished by history, drug screen, etc. A thorough lab testing is performed to exclude severe endocrine, acid-base, and electrolyte disturbances.

The usual causes include:

- Severe head injury

- Brain tumors causing brain swelling may lead to brain death

- Blockage of blood vessels due to blood clots

- Infections like encephalitis and meningitis may lead to brain death
