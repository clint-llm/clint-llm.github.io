Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, otherwise known simply as neuromyelitis optica, is an uncommon but distinct clinical entity from the typical forms of optic neuritis. Clinicians need to be aware of these conditions and evaluate them carefully, especially in the setting of a patient presenting with atypical optic neuritis, as the evaluation should include additional serologic testing. The treatment paradigm may involve chronic immunosuppressive therapy to prevent potential long-term. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder by interprofessional.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical features of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.
- Outline the distinguishing characteristics of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder from other forms of optic neuritis.
- Identify the ancillary testing, neuroimaging, and serologic testing that can aid in the proper diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.
- Summarize how interprofessional collaboration can improve treatment for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder.
