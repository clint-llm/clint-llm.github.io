Symptoms of Kikuchi disease develop over several weeks, with an acute to subacute presentation. The most common presentation is of unilateral tender posterior cervical lymphadenopathyÂ in 60-90% of cases, with occasional involvement of the supraclavicular and axillary nodes. Affected lymph nodes are typically mobile, solitary, nonsuppurative, and are painful in approximately half of cases. The affected nodes are enlarged typically to 1-2cm in diameter, however up to 7cm has been reported in the literature
