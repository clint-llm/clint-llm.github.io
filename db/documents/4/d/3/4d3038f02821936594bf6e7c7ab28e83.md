Few contraindications exist for performing the Bekhterev-Jacobsohn reflex. An open wound on the radial portion of the forearm is the major contraindication. Severe or major swelling in the area may also limit the reflex. Dr. Jacobsohn noted that the reflex is even useful in a patient with hand contractures, which are not aÂ contraindication for performing the reflex.
