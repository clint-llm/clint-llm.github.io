In an article published in 1920, British surgeon George Grey Turner, MBBS (1877-1951), described finding subcutaneous discoloration of the flanks in patients found to have severe pancreatitis. Referring to a patient with severe pancreatitis, he wrote, “I now noticed two large discolored areas in the loins. They were about the size of the palm of the hand, slightly raised above the surface, and of a dirty greenish color. There was a little edema, with pitting on pressure, but there was no pain or tenderness.” Since that publication, the exam finding of ecchymosis of the flank in association with intra-abdominal bleeding has carried Dr. Turner’s name. However, descriptions of non-traumatic abdominal wall ecchymosis exist as far back as Hippocrates, Galen, and Leonardo da Vinci.

In severe acute pancreatitis, the injured pancreas releases pancreatic enzymes that cause fat necrosis and inflammation, occasionally resulting in peri-pancreatic bleeding. The resulting fluid collection can travel via an anatomical defect of the transversalis fascia to the space between the two leaves of the renal fascia. It then flows to the pararenal space, followed by the lateral edge of the quadratus lumborum muscle and finally to the subcutaneous tissue of the flanks.
