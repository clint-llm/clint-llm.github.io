There are multiple imaging modalities and laboratory tests that can be useful to identify the presence and etiology of a hollow viscus perforation. Abdominal and upright chest x-rays are quick and cheap and can identify even small amounts of pneumoperitoneum. Evidence of small and large bowel obstructions can also be visualized. CT of the abdomen and pelvis, however, is the most sensitive and specific test to diagnose a perforation and ascertain the most likely etiology.

In children, the preferred primary test is ultrasound given its ease and lack of radiation exposure. If necessary, secondary testing such as x-ray, MRI, and CT are reasonable options.
