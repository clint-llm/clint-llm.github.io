Clinical presentation of atrioventricular septal defects is influenced by the type of atrioventricular septal defect, the magnitude of the intracardiac shunt, and other associated cardiac malformations.

Patients with the partial atrioventricular septal defect without other complex congenital cardiac malformations and minimal atrioventricular valve regurgitation, usually remain asymptomatic in infancy and early childhood. They are diagnosed on the bases of incidental findings, including pulmonary or tricuspid flow murmur and a fixed splitting due to atrial septal defect.

Symptoms of heart failure in infants may include difficulty in feeding, sleepiness, lethargy, and failure to thrive, while children may have a complaint of dyspnea.

Signs of heart failure include:

- Tachypnea, tachycardia

- S3 gallop

- Rales on chest auscultation

- Raised jugular venous pressure

- Tender hepatomegaly

- Wide fixed splitting due to atrial septal defect

- Pansystolic murmur due to atrioventricular valve regurgitation

- Pulmonary flow murmur due to increased flow through the pulmonary valve

- Mid diastolic flow murmur due to increased flow through the tricuspid valve

General physical examination may reveal cyanosis when there is a reversal of shunt (Eisenmenger syndrome) and dysmorphic features in case of associated syndromes.
