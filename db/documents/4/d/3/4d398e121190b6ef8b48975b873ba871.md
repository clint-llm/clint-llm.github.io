The Moro reflex is a normal primitive, infantile reflex. The Moro reflex is an involuntary protective motor response against abrupt disruption of body balance or extremely sudden stimulation.

The reflex is elicited by pulling up on the infant's arms while in a supine position and letting go of the arms causing the sensation of falling.
