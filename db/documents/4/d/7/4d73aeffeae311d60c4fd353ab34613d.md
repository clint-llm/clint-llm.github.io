For appropriate sonographic evaluation, two probe transducers must be available.  A curvilinear probe (1 to 6 MHz) is the preferred probe for transabdominal assessment, while a high-frequency endocavitary probe (7.5 to 10 MHz) is used for transvaginal evaluation.

A probe cover must be used for the transvaginal approach. After each use, the probe should be appropriately disinfected as per institution protocols.
