Unlike other tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants, which have doses from 75 to 300 mg/day, protriptyline dosing uses much lower doses and then increased as necessary. Unlike other tricyclic and tetracyclic drugs, which often have once a day dosing, dosage for protriptyline is divided into 3 or 4 times a day. When stopping the medication is necessary, taper to avoid the effects of withdrawal.

- Protriptyline is available in tablets of 5 or 10 mg.

- Initiate at 15 to 40 mg a day, starting with the morning dose.

- Divide dose into 3 or 4 doses, not to be taken all at one time.

The maximum dose is 60 mg a day, if necessary, beginning at a lower level and increasing gradually while looking for the patientâ€™s response and any side effects as the dosage increase.
