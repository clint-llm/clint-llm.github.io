Octave Landry formulated the fundamental concepts in the physiology of sensation as proprioception and stereognosis.

There are four types of mechanoreceptors:

- Merkel cell receptors respond to slowly moving stimuli

- Ruffini corpuscles responding to skin stretch

- Meissner corpuscles for low-frequency vibrations

- Pacinian corpuscles for high-frequency vibrations

They perceive information about the size, shape, texture, and motion of the objects. The spatial pattern of the activation of the mechanoreceptor in response to the forces applied to the skin and the relative receptive field of each receptor determine the perception. The information from the forelimb is carried in the dorsal column-medial lemniscal pathway to the cuneate nucleus in the medulla and from there to the ventroposterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus. From the thalamus, the inputs go to the primary somatosensory cortex, Brodmann areas 3,1, and 2. The information is then carried to the association areas in the posterior parietal cortex and the second somatosensory cortex.

Astereognosis occurs in cortical sensory syndrome secondary to superior-posterior parietal stroke.
