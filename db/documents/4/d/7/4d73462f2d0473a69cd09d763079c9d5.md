Perioperative safety enables safe surgery and mitigates adverse events. Patients following MWL often require multiple body contouring procedures, and it is recommended that such procedures are staged appropriately. This staging or separation of procedures into multiple operations, at least three months apart, reduces operative time, anesthesia time, blood loss, personnel fatigue, and complications.

The number of stages required will vary between patients and depends on several variables, including the number of surgeons operating, the number of theatre staff and availability of multiple teams, and the risk assessment of the patient. If brachioplasty is the only procedure intended, then this lessens the perioperative risk considerably but can be mitigated further if two teams are operating simultaneously, one on each arm.

Intraoperatively, other than essential management of the patient under GA and optimizing their comorbid risk factors, specific attention must be paid to patient positioning, patient warming, and risk management of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

In brachioplasty, patients are positioned supine, with the arms abducted on arm boards and elbows flexed 90 degrees. The forearm and hands should be covered in a sterile drape or equivalent circumferentially and secured; this offers flexibility in moving the arm as desired intraoperatively.

Pressure points at bony prominences should be protected using gel pads to curtail the risk of nerve injury. Preventing hypothermia is imperative and may be achieved using several measures, including a heated gel pad, limiting exposure to the operative site, Bair huggers, warming blankets, and administering warmed intravenous fluids.

Venous thromboembolism is a serious and highly undesirable complication. Prudent measures to curtail its risk include using a sequential compression device (SCD) placed on calves intraoperatively, administering low molecular weight heparin or equivalent following thrombosis/bleeding risk assessment as per local policy, and most importantly, encouraging early mobilization after recovery from general anesthesia. Patients should be counseled preoperatively about the benefits and rationale for early mobilization in the postoperative period.
