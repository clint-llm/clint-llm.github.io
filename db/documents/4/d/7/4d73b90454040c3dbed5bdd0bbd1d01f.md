The pathophysiology resulting in end-organ dysfunction in hypertensive emergencies is not fully understood. However,Â the mechanical stress on vascular walls likely leads to endothelial damage and a pro-inflammatory response. This results in increased vascular permeability, platelet, and coagulation cascade activation, and fibrin clot deposition leads to hypoperfusion at the level of the target organ tissue.
