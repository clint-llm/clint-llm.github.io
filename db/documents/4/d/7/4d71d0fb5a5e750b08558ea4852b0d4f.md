There are no strict contraindications for the usage of etesevimab. The following is the list of precautions or warnings while using Etesevimab and Bamlanivimab.

- **Pregnant patients:**Etesevimab and bamlanivimab can only be prescribed for pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 only if the benefit overbalances the risk for the duo (fetus and mother). Being an IgG antibody, both bamlanivimab and etesevimab can cross the placenta and reach the fetus. However, it is unclear if this placental transfer is beneficial or risk for the growing fetus.

- **Lactating mother:**No data so far has shown any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child.

- **Pediatric patients:**Both etesevimab and bamlanivimab are not recommended for children less than 12 years or children weighing < 40 Kg.

- **Geriatric patients:**The pharmacokinetics of etesevimab and bamlanivimab in elderly patients is similar to young adults, so no dose adjustment is required.

- **Hepatic and Renal Impairment**: The dose adjustment is not required in renal impairment and mild hepatic impairment. However, more studies are required to study the safety among moderate or severe liver impairment.
