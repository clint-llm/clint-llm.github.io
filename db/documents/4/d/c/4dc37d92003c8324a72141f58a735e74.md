The patients with GCT benefit notably from an inter-professional team providing their care. Primary care providers or emergency physicians are typically the first to visit the patients. Chiropractors may also be the first to encounter a GCT on their radiographs and must refer the patient to the appropriate specialist. After obtaining a plain X-ray showing the bone tumor, the patient should be referred to an orthopedic surgeon. The radiologists provide interpretations of the images, and an orthopedic oncologist provides the appropriate surgical care. Nursing assists in all phases from pre-op care to assisting in surgical and postoperative care.

Finally, the patient should receive rehabilitation from an occupational or physical therapist. Each of these disciplines is warranted to work together closely as a team to provide optimal care and achieve the best outcomes for the patients, which helps them get back to their ordinary daily activity as soon as possible.
