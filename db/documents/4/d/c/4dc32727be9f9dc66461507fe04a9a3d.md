Laboratory analysis includes a complete blood count which reveals peripheral blood eosinophilia in approximately 20% of the cases.

A biopsy of the lesions is required to establish the diagnosis (see histopathology for findings). An immunohistochemical study reveals a strong reactivity for CD31 and lesser reactivity for CD34 and factor VIII-relatedÂ antigen.

Adequate radiologic workup can be further performed to explore ALHE involving internal organs, arteries, orbit, bones, etc.
