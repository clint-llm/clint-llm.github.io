Inactivated polio vaccine is contraindicated in individuals who have had anaphylaxis following either a previous dose of the vaccine or after taking streptomycin, polymyxin B, or neomycin, as the vaccine does contain trace amounts of these substances. Contraindications also include patients with active, acute febrile illness and hypersensitivity to the vaccine or any of its components, including 2-phenoxyethanol and formaldehyde.

Injectable polio vaccine is both safe and recommended for administration to immunodeficient individuals and members of their household, as it is not a live vaccine. Note that the oral polio vaccine is live and should not be administered to immunocompromised persons.

Inactivated polio vaccine is also safe to administer during pregnancy or to a breastfeeding mother.

Adverse reactions following the receipt of the inactivated polio vaccine are reportable to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) per protocol.
