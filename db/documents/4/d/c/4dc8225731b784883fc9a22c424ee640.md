Traumatic musculoskeletal injuries are a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits in the United States. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CD)C and the American College of Surgeons, 42.2 million ED visits annually are related to injury, with 14% accounting for musculoskeletal injuries.

Joint injuries can occur from a wide variety of mechanisms or insults. It is important to understand the cause/mechanism of the injury to diagnose and manage the patient properly. Joint injuries can be sustained from severe mechanisms such as motor vehicle accidents, high-impact sports injuries, and assaults. However, it is important to understand that joint injuries can also occur and be equally severe in patients with low-impact injuries such as falls. It is vital to treat all joint injuries with the same systematic approach to avoid missing important elements of the injury. This will allow consistent management of injuries sustained in both an isolated manner and those occurring in conjunction with multisystem trauma.
