Poikilocytosis should be differentiated from the following:

- Anisocytosis is the abnormal size of RBCs. As a general rule, hypochromic microcytosis deals with iron deficiencies (with subsequent hemoglobin deficiencies) or hemoglobinopathies, while macrocytic anemia deals with B12 and folate deficiencies or hypothyroidism (causing nuclear/cytoplasmic asynchrony in maturation).

- Howell Jolly bodies, which are RBCs with inclusions, are seen in conditions like asplenia.

- Anisochromia is variability in the color density of erythrocytes due to unequal hemoglobin, including hypochromic cells seen in iron deficiency anemia.

- Rouleaux are aggregations of RBCs seen when the erythrocyte sedimentation rate is increased in infections, cancers, and inflammatory conditions. Rouleaux formation refers to the stacking of red cells like coins in a single file. It is seen in hypoproteinemia and paraproteinemias like plasma cell disorders as well as in B-cell lymphomas. Rouleaux is differentiated from agglutination, in which there are clusters or clumps of red cells. This is oft an antibody-mediated agglutination and could give a falsely elevated MCV.

- Heavy metals (lead); classically, coarse basophilic stippling is associated with heavy metal poisoning (e.g., Pb).
