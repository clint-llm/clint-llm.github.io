The most common type of cancer arising in the kidney is renal cell carcinoma (aka hypernephroma or Grawitz tumor), making up more than 9 out of 10 renal cancers in adults. Other types include transitional cell carcinomas of the renal pelvis, which behave like bladder cancers. Renal sarcoma is another rare tumor of the kidney. This review will focus mainly on renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which accounts for over 3% of all adult malignancies and has several histological subtypes. It is a tumor of older age group and is most commonly seen between the ages of 50Â to 70 years that has an approximate 2:1 male to female ratio.
