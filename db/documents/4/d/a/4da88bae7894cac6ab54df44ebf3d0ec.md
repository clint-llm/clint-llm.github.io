The collective collaboration by the ACR, AMA, National Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), FDA, American College of Surgeons, and College of American Pathologist to create the BI-RADS guidelines allowed for broad support and an effective transition to BI-RADS nationally. The fluidity of BI-RADS allows for it to evolve with changes in technology and research. The standardized reporting allows non-radiologist to follow mammographic reports generated anywhere in the country easily. BI-RADS pioneered the standardization in radiology reporting and accomplished its goal to be efficient and provide a cost-effective approach that will continue to be used in the foreseeable future.
