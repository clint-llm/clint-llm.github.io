Inotropes and vasopressors are commonly used in the ICU. Since the conditions they address and the effects they render can be critical, an entire interprofessional team should be involved in their ordering, dosing, and administration, as well as subsequent monitoring. While these medications are ordered by clinicians, the monitoring of the patient is done by nurses trained in critical care. Pharmacists should verify dosing and check for interactions and contraindications to their use. Besides vital signs, patient body weight, fluid status, renal function, and peripheral perfusion require continuous monitoring. A constant assessment of the patient is needed to ensure that the inotropes and vasopressors are tapered if not needed.
