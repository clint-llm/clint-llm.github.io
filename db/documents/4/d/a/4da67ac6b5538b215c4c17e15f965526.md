Although identification and proper management of toxic ingestions are vital skills for emergency and acute care clinicians, one cannot forget those that support our mission both before arrival and after treatment and discharge.  Caring for these complicated overdoses is a daunting task, especially for the pre-hospital personnel, as well as those providing aftercare. Numerous studies and articles are now focusing on reducing unnecessary ER visits for minor ingestions and patient safety, and proper mental health or substance abuse referrals.

Due to the complexity and risk of patients exposed to these agents, an interprofessional team approach will lead to the best outcomes. The nurse should help the clinician obtain an accurate patient and family history, including making calls as necessary to family members and pharmacists. The specialty-trained toxicology pharmacist should evaluate drug-drug interactions, select antidotes, and provide guidance for care to the team. The clinician should consult a clinical toxicologist in most cases to assist in guiding evaluation and therapy. Often a mental health counselor is involved as well. Only by working together as a team will these patients obtain the best care and chance for long-term survival. [Level 5]
