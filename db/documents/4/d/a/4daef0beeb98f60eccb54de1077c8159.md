The diagnosis of primary ovarian insufficiency should be based upon strong evidence after any confounding disease processes have been excluded. This diagnosis carries with it severe implications on a womenâ€™s future health, fertility, and psychological well-being, as discussed above. Currently, there are no treatment modalities that can reverse the damage done to healthy oocytes, increase the functionality of existing oocytes, or even generate new oocytes. Spontaneous pregnancy may be achieved as the course of POI is unpredictable. However, this chance remains low. If a woman with POI desires fertility, the mainstay of successful treatment remains oocyte donation.
