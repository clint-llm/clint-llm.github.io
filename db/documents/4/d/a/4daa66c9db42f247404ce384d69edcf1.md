In the United States, more than 5 million central venous catheters are inserted every year for a variety of indications in both hospitalized and surgical patients. Once an indication for central venous catheterization is established, the clinician has multiple sites to select from including the internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, femoral vein or a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC). Subclavian catheters can be temporary or permanent, simple, tunneled, or connected to a port under the skin. Subclavian catheters may be single or multiple lumens, and the diameter of the catheter is also variable.
