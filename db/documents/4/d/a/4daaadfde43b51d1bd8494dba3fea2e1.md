Tip-shaping or refinement is a common request during a consultation for cosmetic nasal surgery. However, surgery of the nasal tip has a unique set of functional and aesthetic challenges that must be understood by the rhinoplasty surgeon to ensure a successful outcome. Unfortunately, poor nasal tip cosmesis or function is a frequent factor leading dissatisfied patients to seek secondary or revision rhinoplasty surgeries. Understanding the anatomic relationships of the nasal tip allows the surgeon to perform maneuvers to create the desired aesthetic changes while preserving critical function. This activity highlights the role of the interprofessional team in rhinoplasty.

**Objectives:**
- Review the relevant anatomy for performing nasal tip rhinoplasty.
- Describe the mechanisms of nasal tip support and the effects of various surgical techniques on tip support.
- Summarize surgical concepts and outline specific techniques commonly employed in nasal tip rhinoplasty.
- Outline post-surgical care for patients requiring rhinoplasty tip-shaping surgery.
