Adolescent patients present after injuring their ankle. They may remember the exact mechanism of injury, but frequently just remember twisting the ankle and feeling it (give out).

**Physical examination**most commonly will demonstrate pain and swelling in the anterior lateral part of the ankle. This presentation is very similar to an ankle sprain or injuries to the anterior talofibular ligament. Because of this presentation, the injury is frequently mistaken for an ankle sprain. However, the fact that the physis may be still open in an adolescent and that the physis is weaker than the ligamentous anterior talofibular ligament should direct the examiner to order additional objective x-ray evaluations of the ankle to rule out any possible bony injury. A closer evaluation could suggest a joint effusion. This represents bleeding into the joint from the intraarticular extension of the fracture and should further alert the examiner to the need for further objective evaluation of the injury.
