Over 95% of HIV-infected pediatric cases are a result of vertical transmission. Neonatal HIV is the concern for HIV in an infant born to a mother with known or suspected HIV disease. It is important to identify those patients early so that appropriate treatment and monitoring can be implemented. This activity outlines the evaluation and management of neonatal HIV and reviews the interprofessional team's role in managing these patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the etiology and epidemiology of neonatal HIV.
- Review the common presentation, history, and diagnosis of neonatal HIV.
- Outline the appropriate treatment and management options available for neonatal HIV. 
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance identification of those at risk for neonatal HIV and improve outcomes.
