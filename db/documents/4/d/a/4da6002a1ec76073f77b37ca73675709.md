The mutational mechanisms associated with CRC are:

**Genomic Instability**

- **Instability Chromosome:**is the most common type found in 85% of the CRCs.

- **Microsatellite instability:**It is present in 15% of CRC.

**Epigenetic****(DNA methylation)**Methylation of CpG islands occurs in sporadicÂ CRC 15%**,**and also it affects the expression of DNA repair genes or Mismatch genes.
