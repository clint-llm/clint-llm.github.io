**FDA-approved Indications**

Trazodone is an FDA-approved antidepressant for treating major depressive disorders.

**Non-FDA-approved Uses**

Trazodone is used to induce sedation in patients with sleep problems. These patients may or may not have concurrent depression. Because of a lack of sufficient clinical data for justifying its use as a sleep aid, trazodone is not FDA-approved for sleep disorders. Trazodone is also used off-label for anxiety, Alzheimer disease, substance abuse, bulimia, and fibromyalgia due to its serotonergic receptor antagonism and serotonin reuptake inhibiting effects.

Trazodone has also been used for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if the first-line treatment use of SSRIs does not show efficacy. The dose of 50 mg to 200 mg of trazodone has been demonstrated to reduce episodes of nightmares as well as improve sleep habits in studies involving PTSD patients. However, various studies show patients with panic symptoms have suffered exacerbation in some instances, which is why SSRIs, instead of trazodone, are preferred as the first-line treatment for PTSD. Additionally, research has shown trazodone to improve apnea and hypopnea episodes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and the drug does not worsen hypoxemic episodes.
