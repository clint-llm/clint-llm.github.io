Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common form of skin cancer in the United States behind basal cell carcinoma. More than one million squamous cell carcinoma cases are diagnosed in the United States each year. Historically, a ratio of squamous cell carcinoma to basal cell carcinoma incidence of 3:1 has been reported, but more recent studies suggest that the ratio may be closer to 1:1. Furthermore, it has been reported that, with increasing age, the ratio trends toward squamous cell carcinoma occurrence. Squamous cell carcinoma most commonly appears after the age of 50 in areas of past sun exposure, and typically occurs in males with light skin and light eyes who have a history of UV solar radiation exposure. However, anyone with a history of significant UV exposure, whether from past medical treatment or the sun, is at an increased risk. Squamous cell carcinoma is also very prevalent in patients that are immunosuppressed and can develop into aggressive subtypes in these patients.
