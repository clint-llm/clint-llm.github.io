While it is conceivable to diagnose an isolated AP window in utero by fetal echocardiography, the more typical presentation is in the neonatal period or early infancy.

As noted above, an AP window can be associated with other types of congenital heart defects, and the associated defect can alter the presentation.  In the tetralogy of Fallot, a pulmonary ejection murmur and pulmonary valve click can be noted. When the AP window occurs with an interrupted aortic arch, the neonate can present with shock as the ductus arteriosus constricts. Occasionally the AP window can be restrictive and present with less significant symptoms of over circulation. In this scenario, a continuous heart murmur could be noted. Rarely, an AP window diagnosis is not made until later in childhood or even adult life. This could present with features of Eisenmenger syndrome, including cyanosis and clubbing.
