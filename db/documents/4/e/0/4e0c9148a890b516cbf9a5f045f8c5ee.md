The SMAS is considerably apparent in the buccal, temporal, zygomatic, and platysma regions. Thus, the corresponding muscles correlate or serve as an anatomical border to the SMAS. It lies directly anterior to the parotid gland and masseter muscle, which is a key muscle of mastication with a superficial and deep part.

The SMAS additionally invests smaller and more intricate muscles. This muscle group includes the orbicularis oculi, orbicularis oris, occipitofrontalis, and the levator labii superioris muscle. The orbicularis oculi are divided into orbital and palpebral sections, which are both attached in a complex manner to the surrounding structures of the eye. The orbital section is attached medially to the medial canthal tendon and laterally to the lateral palpebral raphe. Superiorly it interdigitates with the frontalis muscle.

The superficial fibers of the orbicularis oris originate directly from other muscles of facial expression - namely the depressor anguli oris, zygomaticus majos, zygomaticus major, levator labii superioris, levator labii superioris alaeque nasi and transversus nasi.

The forehead, nasolabial folds, and nasal regions are usually not included under the SMAS, although literature reporting several anatomical variants involving these muscles are available.
