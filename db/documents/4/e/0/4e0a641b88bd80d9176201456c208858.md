**Breast Cancer**

Breast cancer often categorizes as either estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) or progesterone-receptor positive (PR+) or ER+/PR+. The effects of progesterone, as well as estrogen, within the breast tissue, is closely related to mammary gland growth. As such, the upregulation of these receptors within the breast tissue can increase cell proliferation in the mammary gland by increasing the number of breast cells in the G2/M phase resulting in an elevated risk of developing breast cancer.

**Ovarian Cancer**

Progesterone can have both a protective or a proliferative effect on ovarian cells. In terms of ovarian neoplasia, the level of progesterone is indirectly related, such that the higher the level of progesterone, the lower the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Instances such as pregnancy, the use of oral contraceptives, and breastfeeding are all linked to increased levels of progesterone and a decreased risk of ovarian cancer. Conversely, advanced age, earlier onset of menstruation, and anovulatory cycles are associated with an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer due to their low levels of progesterone. Progesterone receptor expression also plays a role in the development of ovarian cancer. The expression of progesterone receptor B (PR-B) is associated with ovarian cancer to a greater extent than progesterone receptor A PR-A. PR-B acts via a transcriptional factor known as FOXO1, which goes on to induce p21.
