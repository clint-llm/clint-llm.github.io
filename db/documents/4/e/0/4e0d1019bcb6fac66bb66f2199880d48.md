GvHD occurs in the following settings:

- Following allogeneic bone transplantation (most common)

- Following transplantation of solid organs that are rich in lymphoid cells (eg. liver)

- Following transfusion of un-irradiated blood

For GvHD to occur, immunologically competent cells should be transplanted into immunodeficient recipients and the transferred cells should recognize alloantigens in the host. Other important factors that determine the occurrence and severity of GvHD are:

-  **Donor-host factors:**The incidence of GVHD increases with unmatched donor transplants, HLA disparity, sex mismatching.

- **Stem-cell source factors:**cryopreservation of marrow prior to its infusion and the use of umbilical cord blood lower the incidence of GvHD.

- **Immune modulation factors**: The incidence of GvHD is lower with triple therapy (cyclosporine, methotrexate (MTX), and prednisone as compared with double therapy (cyclosporine and MTX)

- **Chemotherapy and radiation therapy**: High-dose chemotherapy leads to local tissue damage and increases in the level of circulating cytokines that lead to a cytokine storm. This increases the ability of immune cells in the graft to recognize host antigens. An increased incidence and severity of GvHD is associated with regimens that include total body irradiation as compared with chemotherapy alone
