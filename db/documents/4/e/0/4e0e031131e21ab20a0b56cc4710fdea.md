Aortic dissection and rupture can happen as a result of an enlarging aortic aneurysm.

Surgical complications include bleeding, stroke, pulmonary dysfunction, myocardial dysfunction, and perioperative mortality. Patients have perioperative mortality of 28.6% during the repair of the descending aorta and 23.4% during the endovascular repair.

In an autopsy study in patients with sudden cardiac death, the TAA complications of dissection and rupture occur between 2 to 7.3%.
