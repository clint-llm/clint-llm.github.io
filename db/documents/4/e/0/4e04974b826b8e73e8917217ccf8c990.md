The lower division of cranial nerve III (oculomotor) innervates the inferior rectus muscle. Cranial nerve III is divided into upper and lower divisions, with the upper division innervating the superior rectus, levator palpebrae superioris, and the lower division innervating the medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles. The lateral rectus muscle is innervated by cranial nerve VI (abducens), and the superior oblique muscle is innervated by cranial nerve IV (trochlear).

Additionally, the parasympathetic innervation of the sphincter pupillae and ciliary muscle travels with the branch of the lower division of cranial nerve III that supplies the inferior oblique muscle, and this bundle passes near the inferior rectus muscle. This anatomy has important surgical considerations that will be explained further.
