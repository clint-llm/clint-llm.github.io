Isolated fibula fractures are quite rare, much less common than fibula fractures with associated ligamentous involvement and/or tibia fractures. Fortunately, the vast majority of isolated fibula fractures are treated nonoperatively. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of isolated fibula shaft fractures by an interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the typical mechanism of isolated fibula fractures.
- Outline the proper evaluation of a patient who has a fibula shaft fracture. 
- Review the treatment options for an isolated fibula shaft fracture. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication among the interprofessional team to ensure appropriate treatment of patients who present with an isolated fracture of the fibula shaft.
