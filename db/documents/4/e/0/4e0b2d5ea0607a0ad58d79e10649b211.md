Thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are insulin sensitizers that act on intracellular metabolic pathways to enhance insulin action and increase insulin sensitivity in critical tissues.

TZDs function by regulating gene expression through binding to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), a nuclear transcription regulator.

In addition to their function in glycemic control and improvement of insulin resistance, TZDs potentially have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. There is evidence that TZDs may slow the progression of medial intimal thickening and decrease coronary intimal hyperplasia. Research has shown additional beneficial effects on endothelial function, atherogenesis, fibrinolysis, and ovarian steroidogenesis. Some studies demonstrated that activation of PPAR-gamma receptors could induce cancer cell apoptosis.Â However, these mechanisms are still under investigation due to conflicting studies and possible confounders.
