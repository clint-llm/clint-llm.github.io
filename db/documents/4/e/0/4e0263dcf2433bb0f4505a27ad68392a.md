Most local anesthetics block voltage-gated sodium channels from inside the cell, preventing subsequent channel activation and interfering with the large transient sodium influx associated with membrane depolarization. Impulse conduction slows, the rate of rising and the magnitude of the action potential decrease, and the threshold for excitation is raised progressively until an action potential can no longer be generated and impulse propagation is abolished. Hence the pronounced effect of lidocaine toxicity on cells relies on the propagation of action potentials such as the central nervous and the myocardial conduction systems. Local anesthetics also may block calcium and potassium channels and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors to varying degrees.
