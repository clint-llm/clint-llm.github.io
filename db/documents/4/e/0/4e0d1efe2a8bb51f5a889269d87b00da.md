Parathyroid carcinoma presents similarly to primary hyperparathyroidism with elevated levels of parathyroid hormone and serum calcium. Paraneoplastic syndromes may also present similarly with elevated serum calcium levels but will be distinguishable with elevated levels or parathyroid hormone-related peptide. Thyroid nodules may be difficult to distinguish from parathyroid neoplasms but both present with a palpable mass in the neck.

Differential diagnosis:

- Parathyroid adenoma

- Parathyroid hyperplasia

- Paraneoplastic syndrome (lung or head and neck primary)

- Thyroid nodule

- Primary thyroid malignancy

- Brown's tumor
