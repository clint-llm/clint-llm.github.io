Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a relatively safe modality of treatment for various medical conditions which often do not have other effective treatments. However, there are some risks and complications that patients must be made aware of before initiation of HBOT.  While most common complications are relatively benign, such as ear and sinus barotrauma, claustrophobia, and transient myopic change, there do exist serious complications as well. As with all medical therapies to be offered to patients, education of risks and informed consent is key.
