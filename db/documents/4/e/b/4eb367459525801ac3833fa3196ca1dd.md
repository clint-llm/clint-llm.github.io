The cerebellum is substantially active during the initial stages of the learning process. Structural and functional imaging has found differences in the cerebellum of those with dyslexia. These individuals were found to have reduced grey matter in the right lobule of VI. It was also found that this lobule has abnormal activity in patients with dyslexia when asked to name objects rapidly. It is important to note that the cerebellar disruptions in dyslexia are different than those found in autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), suggesting that specific circuits lead to various symptoms.

Postmortem imaging has showed decreased asymmetry of the left and right sides of the planum temporale, left perisylvian architectonic dysplasias, and neuronal ectopias.
