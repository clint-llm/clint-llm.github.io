Doxycycline is the first-line treatment for anaplasmosis in adult and pediatric cases. A 14-day to the 21-day course is recommended or continuation of antibiotics for a minimum of 3 days after defervescence. For patients co-infected with Lyme disease (known or suspected), therapy should be continued for 10 days.

To prevent tooth discoloration, pediatric patients younger than 8 years of age co-infected with Borrelia burgdorferi should remain on doxycycline until they have been afebrile for 3 days. They should then switch to an active agent against the pathogen, for example, amoxicillin or cefuroxime, for the remainder of the 14-day course.

Of note, if a patient does not show signs of clinical improvement after 3 days of doxycycline therapy, the patient should be evaluated and treated for possible Babesia infection.
