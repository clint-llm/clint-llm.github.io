The general spread of metastases involves hematogenous spreading to the center of the vertebral body. Through an initial interaction between tumors associated factors and intrinsic bone cells like osteoclasts, a nidus of invasion is established. More commonly the tumor spreads backward often involving pedicles, which is an important point of understanding for surgical management of spinal metastasis that would require spinal stabilization. Due to this fact, screw fixation through the involved pedicles often is nonoptimal and requires extending fusion of several segments above and below the lesion. Commonly, the blood supply to the metastatic nidus comes from pedicular arteries making selective embolization through interventional procedures a viable option. Further understanding of the interaction between invading metastasis and surrounding bone cells and factors produced like IL-6, IL-1, TGF-beta and RANK/RANKL have offered chemical therapy in the treatment of painful bone metastasis, especially breast and prostate as known primaries. A complete description of the mechanisms and factors involved is outside the scope of this short clinically focused review.
