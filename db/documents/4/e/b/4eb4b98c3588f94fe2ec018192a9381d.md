Treatment of acute attack is symptomatic. An acute attack of a basilar migraine is usually managed with NSAIDs and anti-emetics like prochlorperazine or metoclopramide. Aura symptoms should be used as a signal for initiating early acute treatment.

Triptans and ergotamines were excluded in the earlier trials for the treatment of a basilar migraine and have not been well studied. Recent reports have shown benefits and improvement in a headache with triptans. Many believe that these medications can be used in abortive therapy of migraine with brainstem aura like in migraine with typical aura, but traditionally triptans and ergotamines are avoided in a basilar migraine because of the risk of increasing cerebral ischemia. The safety and effectiveness of triptans and ergotamines are not confirmed yet due to a lack of data.

Principles of preventive therapy are generally the same as with other types of migraines. It is important to identify and modify the triggers if possible. Maintaining a headache diary helps to keep track of frequency, duration, and severity of symptoms and identify triggers. Modification of triggers like food, noise, stress, regular exercise, a well-balanced diet, and stress management can help prevent migraine attacks. All patients with frequent, disabling headaches should be considered for preventive therapy.

Verapamil and topiramate are the most commonly used medications for preventing migraines with brainstem aura. Propranolol has traditionally been avoided as it can affect cerebral blood flow.

Non-pharmacological therapies like relaxation, acupuncture, massage, cognitive behavior therapy, and biofeedback techniques are also helpful for prevention, like with other types of migraines.
