From autopsies, it is known that about 16% to 29% of patients with SCD have cirrhosis, making chronic liver disease an important entity of those with SCD.Â Annual monitoring of liver function tests is recommended in patients with SCD; if serum ALT is two times the upper limit of normal, further investigation for chronic underlying SCH should be carried out. Note that mild chronic elevation of ALT and AST can be expected in patients with SCD, given underlying hemolysis.

There is not enough evidence on how to identify patients at risk of developing chronic liver disease and which interventions are best to prevent further disease progression. Interventions such as hydroxyurea in those with multiple vaso-occlusive crises, exchange transfusions to keep HbS levels below 30%, and ursodeoxycholic acid can be considered as they have shown some benefit.
