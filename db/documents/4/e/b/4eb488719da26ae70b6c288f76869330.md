Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) yield testable osteoprogenitors. The cell samples are diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a ratio of 1:3 then nucleated cells are isolated with a density gradient solution. Preparatory phase complete medium (CM) consists of  0.1 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, alpha-MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4.5 mg/mL d-glucose, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mmol/L HEPES buffer, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 0.29 mg/mL l-glutamine.

The collected nucleated cells are plated at a density of 100,000 cells/cm^2 in supplemented CM. The CM supplement requires an additional 5 ng/mL fibroblast growth factor-2 (GF2) and 10 nmol/L dexamethasones; both elements proliferate osteogenic commitment of bone marrow stromal cells. The supplemental process undergoes humidification at 37 degrees C in a 5% CO2 incubator.
