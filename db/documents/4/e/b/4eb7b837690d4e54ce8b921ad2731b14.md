In general, the minimally invasive procedures are not the standard of care for aortic valve replacement. These procedures are done in patients who are too ill to undergo a formal median sternotomy and use of a heart-lung machine. Short-term results of these minimally aortic valve replacement procedures are fraught with complications. Complications of minimally valve surgery include bleeding, failure of the procedure to work, immediate opening of the chest due to a complication, thrombosis of the valve, perforation of the esophagus, and damage to the femoral vessels (usually dissection). The recovery of the patient is done in the same way as a normal open-heart surgery patient.

Several large clinical trials have been performed on the use of the percutaneous method of aortic valve implantation, and early results indicate that the morbidity and mortality are the same as the conventional technique. However, more long-term data are needed to determine if the results are durable and sustained for at least a decade.
