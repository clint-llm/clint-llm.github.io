Malassezia is commensal of healthy skin, and it is most common in oily areas such as the face, scalp, and back. However, Malassezia can cause pityriasis versicolor when it converts to its pathogenic filamentous form. Factors that lead to this pathogenic conversion include a genetic predisposition, environmental conditions such as heat and humidity, immunodeficiency, pregnancy, oily skin, and application of oily lotions and creams.
