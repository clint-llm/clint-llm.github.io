Nearly all TKIs are effective when taken orally. Therapeutic loading and maintenance dosages are unique to each drug and should require unique dosing for each patient. When administering specific TKIs, many factors can contribute to reduced potency and the development of acquired resistance. These factors include such as whether or not food intake affects bioavailability, the mechanism of drug metabolism and elimination, liver and kidney function, drug-drug interactions, the presence of other medications that alter stomach pH, and patient demographics.
