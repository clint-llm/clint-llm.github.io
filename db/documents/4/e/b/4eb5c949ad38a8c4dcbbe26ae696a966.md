The utility of a selective peripheral kappa opioid receptor agonist in the treatment of uremic pruritis is emerging.

Understanding the mechanism of difelikefalin and how it effectively addresses the nonhistaminergic pathway, which causes uremic pruritus, is essential for the healthcare team to ensure that itching and the associated emotional distress often experienced by patients requiring dialysis may appropriately be addressed.

The opioid crisis facing the healthcare industry today requires the introduction of safer post-operative pain medications with decreased abuse potential. Surgeons and primary care clinicians are in a position to initiate intravenous or oral difelikefalin for patients with acute postoperative pain, or sub-acute and chronic pain, without the fear of lethal overdose or euphoric effects, even at supratherapeutic doses.

The extensive development of safer formulations of traditional oral opioid medications for pain management without the risk of abuse potential demonstrates the need that the novel difelikefalin oral formulation would fulfill with widespread implementation by healthcare providers.
