Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has come to light as a valuable tool in breast imaging. It is an ultimate supplementary imaging modality in addition to mammography and ultrasonography in the evaluation of breast disease. Breast MRI is most commonly obtained to evaluate and characterize malignancy. Screening breast MRI has shown higher sensitivity rates in the detection of breast cancer compared to mammography, ultrasonography or both combined in asymptomatic high-risk women.
