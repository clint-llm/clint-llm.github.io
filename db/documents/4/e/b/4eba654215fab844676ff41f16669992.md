The pelvic abscess is a frequent complication of an infection of the lower genital tract, including pelvic inflammatory disease. Other causes subsumed in the etiology of pelvic abscess are operative procedures like hysterectomy, laparotomies, caesarian sections, and induced abortion. Cancers of pelvic organs, trauma to the genital tract, Crohn disease complications, and diverticulitis are other significant causes.

The risk factor for the pelvic abscess is the same as that of pelvic inflammatory disease like multiple sexual partners, sexually transmitted infection, intrauterine device, diabetes, low immune system.  Other recognizable risk factors that have been studied in developing post-surgical abscess classify as preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative causes.

The preoperative risk factors involved in pelvic abscess formation are untreated pelvic inflammatory disease, hydrosalpinx, endometrioma, uncontrolled blood sugar with HbA1c greater than 6.5, renal comorbidities, obesity with BMI over 30, congenital anomalies of the genital tract. Asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis is also a known documented risk factor for postsurgical vaginal cuff cellulitis and abscess formation.

The perioperative risk factors include intraoperative blood loss of over 500ml, prolonged surgical procedure exceeding 140 minutes, patients undergoing extensive surgeries like para-aortic lymphadenectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy, pelvic exenteration for pelvic malignancies.

The postoperative risk factors include uncontrolled blood sugar over 200 mg in the first 48 hours, and prolonged preoperative hospital stay also increases the incidences of surgical site infections and pelvic abscess formation. Postoperative hematoma is also one of the critical causes of pelvic abscess.
