Potassium is usually an intracellular cation. Total body potassium stores are 50 to 75 mEq/kg body weight (approximately 3000 mEq).

Elevated levels of the following influence renal potassium excretion:

- Aldosterone

- Diuretics (which deliver sodium to the distal tubule)

- WNK1 and WNK4

- High levels of serum potassium

- A high flow of urine (osmotic diuresis)

- Presence of negative ions in the distal tubule (bicarbonate)

- Pseudohyperkalemia

- Metabolic acidosis

- Increased tissue catabolism

- Beta blockers

- Insulin deficiency, hyperglycemia, and hyperosmolality

- Exercise

- Hyperkalemic periodic paralysis

- Activators of ATP-dependent potassium channels (e.g., diazoxide, minoxidil, calcineurin inhibitors, and some volatile anesthetics)

- Red cell transfusion

- Succinylcholine

- Red cell transfusion

- Arginine hydrochloride

- Reduced aldosterone secretion

- Reduced distal sodium and water delivery

- Selective impairment in potassium secretion

- Ureterojejunostomy

- Acute and chronic kidney disease

- Gordon syndrome
