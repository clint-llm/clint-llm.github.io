The goal of treatment is to eradicate the parasite completely and is indicated for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals regardless of their immune status.

Uncomplicated strongyloidiasis is treated with ivermectin (200 micrograms/kg for two days), thiabendazole (25 mg/kg/day for three days), or albendazole (400 mg twice a day for 3-7 days).

Patients with evidence of hyperinfection syndrome are treated with ivermectin for at least two weeks or until stool is negative for two consecutive weeks.

Of the agents outlined above, the preferred therapy is ivermectin.

Treatment may be prolonged in immunocompromised individuals. Stopping or decreasing immunosuppressive therapy should be considered, and treatment should ideally be continued until larvae are undetectable in stool, urine, and sputum for at least 14 days.
