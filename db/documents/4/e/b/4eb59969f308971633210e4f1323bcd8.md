Pain management requires a multidisciplinary healthcare team to address accurately and individually pain control for patients. Because adverse effects tend to occur at a much higher rate in patients with specific comorbidities, follow-ups must include a complete history and physical exam to alert for side effects or signs of addiction/misuse.

Patient education is crucial; providers need to pay close attention to the patient's symptoms and complaints to provide the best healthcare possible and avoid any adverse systemic effects. Several methods exist to detect any type of drug misuse appropriately. They include the following: state prescription drug monitoring programs, assessment surveys, adherence check-lists, motivational counseling, urine screening, and dosage forms verification. Through collaborative interprofessional teamwork, pain management can confer maximum benefit with minimal downside.
