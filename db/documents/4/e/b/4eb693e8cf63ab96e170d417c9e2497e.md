Here are some important considerations regarding leukocytosis:

- Prompt identification of leukocytosis should be performed by clinicians obtaining a CBC, along with chart review for previous CBCs for evaluation of trends.

- Obtain a careful physical examination and history to ascertain the underlying force driving the presenting leukocytosis.

- Consider the patient's ethnicity, place of birth, geographical location, family, and social history when evaluating a new or chronic leukocytosis. This can help target risk factors for various etiologies for the presenting WBC count.

- Perform a medication reconciliation, as many common medications have been linked to nonspecific leukocytosis.

- Involve appropriate specialists as needed to treat the leukocytosis (i.e., infectious disease vs. hematology and oncology depending on the underlying cause for the CBC abnormality).

- Be aware of severe complications related to malignancy-associated leukocytosis receiving treatment, to include hyperviscosity syndrome and tumor lysis syndrome.
