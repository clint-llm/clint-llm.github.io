The history and physical examination are the most important evaluations in a patient with glossitis. Additional studies may be required depending upon the suspected etiology of the glossitis.

**Biopsy**

- May be helpful to diagnose bullous disease (pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid)

- Indicated for any stable or worrisome lesion to rule out malignancy

**Laboratory Studies**

- Vitamin levels can be obtained if primary deficiency is suspected or in endemic/high-risk areas.

- Rheumatologic studies (rheumatoid factor, anti-ro, anti-la, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, c-reactive protein, others) may be indicated if autoimmune conditions such as scleroderma are suspected.

- Complete blood count and HIV testing are necessary if immunosuppression is suspected or in the setting of opportunistic infections.

- Endocrine studies such as hemoglobin A1c and thyroid function tests may be helpful if diabetes or thyroid disease is suspected.

**Imaging**

- Routine imaging is not required.

- Suspected or known malignancy should receive imaging with computed tomography of the neck with IV contrast.
