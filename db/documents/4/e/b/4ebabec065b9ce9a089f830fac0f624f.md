Hypertension is the term for elevated blood pressure. More specifically, a systolic blood pressure ≥130 mmHg and/or a diastolic pressure ≥ 80 mmHg. Numerous medication classes are in clinical use to reduce high blood pressures by promoting vasodilation:

- Calcium Channel Blockers (CCBs): Block Ca+2 ions influx into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. The inhibition of Ca+2 leads to the relaxation of the vascular muscle cells and, therefore, vasodilation. These are primarily used to treat hypertension and angina.

- Nitrates: Utilizes secondary messengers that cause downstream effects of smooth muscle relaxation. Nitroglycerin is a nitrate most commonly used to relieve angina attacks.

- Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors: Prevent the production of angiotensin II and inhibit the breakdown of bradykinin. Angiotensin II normally decreases NO production, and bradykinin stimulates the release of NO. The combined effects of this lead to increased NO, which causes vasodilation and can be used to lower blood pressure.
