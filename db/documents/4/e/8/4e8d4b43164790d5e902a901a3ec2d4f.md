The most effective way to manage SFTPs is with a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including a thoracic surgeon, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and in some cases, pulmonologist. Ideally, cases should be discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board with experienced sarcoma oncologists. Treatment at a high-volume center is recommended. Palliative measures can be considered in patients with advanced disease. Interprofessional care coordination is also necessary, using oncology-specialized nurses who can assist in patient surgical preparation and counseling. They will also be crucial in assisting during surgical resection and in post-operative care.
