Essentially, the diagnosis of plaque psoriasis is clinical, and it is recognized by well-demarcated erythematous scaly plaques with a symmetrical distribution. Dermoscopy of typical plaques shows dotted vessels in a regular arrangement over a light red background and with uniformly distributed white scales. A biopsy may be performed to differentiate psoriasis from other inflammatory skin diseases. Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis should be screened for metabolic comorbidities like inflammatory arthritis, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. A history of smoking and alcohol intake should be included.
