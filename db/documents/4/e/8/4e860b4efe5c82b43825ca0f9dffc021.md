The aims of the treatment are relief of the symptoms, stopping the atrophy, prevention scar formation, and anatomical distortion, as well as malignant transformation. The therapy includes general care, topical treatments, systemic treatments, and surgical procedures. It is fundamental to inform the patient to avoid the use of irritating products such as soap and to prefer emollients to break the itch-stretch cycle.

For genital LS, the gold standard treatment is three months application of high potency topical steroids (clobetasol propionate). Second-line therapies include topical calcineurin inhibitors and imiquimod. In men, early circumcision may be recommended. Surgery is indicated only for the treatment of complications associated with lichen sclerosus. For extragenital LS, therapeutic modalities are limited and include phototherapy, ultrapotent topical steroids, tacrolimus ointment 0, 1%, and systemic steroids or methotrexate. Follow-up examinations must be kept indefinitely.
