As the need for behavioral intervention and long-term psychiatric care is steadily rising, alternative methods of treatment must be employed by physicians and healthcare teams to meet this increasing demand. Group therapy provides a solution to this problem by allowing for the treatment of multiple individuals simultaneously. Doing so allows healthcare providers to reduce wait times and increase accessibility. This approach is especially necessary for rural and low-income areas where clinics are often understaffed and have a high volume of patients. Furthermore, group therapy can be used to treat a multitude of conditions including, but not limited to, emotional trauma, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
