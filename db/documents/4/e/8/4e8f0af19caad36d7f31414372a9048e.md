The initial insult to the pulmonary arteries in idiopathic pulmonary hypertension is likely a combination of genetic predisposition with environmental influences. With that said, the pathophysiology of the development of pulmonary artery hypertension is the same except for different biomarkers that lead to a cascade of events, ultimately causing vascular remodeling of the vessel wall; this is an important distinction because knowing the underlying cellular mediators help guide targeted therapies. The vascular remodeling process innate to all forms of pulmonary artery hypertension begins with excessive vasoconstriction, which is related to abnormal expression/function of potassium channels. This leads to a decrease in vasodilators (nitric oxide, prostacyclin) and an increase in vasoconstrictors (endothelin-1).

The decreased lumen size of the pulmonary vasculature causes increased right ventricular afterload. In turn, right ventricular dilation results in septal flattening and Doppler notching and ultimately increased pulmonary artery systolic pressure. To estimate the PASP, continuous-wave Doppler will determine the peak tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRV). From here, the modified Bernoulli equation is applied (4v^2) and added to the right atrial pressure to estimate PASP. If PASP is greater than 50 mmHg, then pulmonary hypertension is very likely, and the patient should obtain a referral for a right heart catheterization.
