**Public Access to BON and NPA**

Since the BON is state-appointed and the NPA is the law, both the BON and NPA are available for public access. Licenses can be verified online through a state-sponsored verification system free of charge. Each state's BON has database tracking licensure as well as disciplinary actions against the nurse for public records. Federal law also requires states to report any adverse actions against a nurse to the National Practitioner Data Bank, established by Congress in 1986. This databank can be accessed by authorized entities, including hospitals, licensing boards, attorneys, licensees, and professional societies.[Russell KA]
