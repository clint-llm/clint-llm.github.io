A thorough physical examination is necessary to evaluate a patient with suspicion of mediastinal germ cell tumors, paying particular attention to the gonads. Testicular ultrasound should be a part of the standard work-up to identify co-existing germ cell tumors. Further imaging, histological, and biochemical analysis are necessary to make a diagnosis. Patients usually present after an incidental anterior mediastinal mass is found on a chest X-ray or may present with symptoms related to a large anterior mediastinal mass. Imaging with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can assist in better defining the tumor size, location, and borders. Biochemical markers, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (B-hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) can be elevated and should be checked. Similar to germ cell tumor diagnostic pathways, a significant elevation in serum B-hCG of >1,000 U/L with or without elevation in AFP is supportive of diagnosing mediastinal germ cell tumors in the appropriate clinical setting.

**Teratomas**

Mediastinal teratomas are usually located near or within the thymus gland in the anterior space of the mediastinum. Biochemical markers are typically not elevated in benign masses. The contents of a mediastinal mature teratoma include at least two of the three embryonic cell layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm) developed into well-differentiated histologic elements. Mesodermal elements are represented by bone, cartilage, and muscle. Endodermal elements include gastrointestinal, respiratory, and endocrine gland tissue. Ectodermal tissue can exhibit skin, dermal appendages, and cystic structures lined by squamous epithelium.

Mature teratoma tumors containing formed teeth or bone are not uncommon. Imaging studies show evidence of calcification in approximately 20% to 40% of cases. Contents can include calcification in or within the tumor wall, ossification in mature bone, or calcification from actual teeth remnants. CT scans will often exhibit a well-demarcated mass with cystic components. Immature teratomas are defined when immature embryonic tissue is intermixed with mature elements from all three germ cell layers. Their clinical significance is that they can form cystic structures with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Unlike mature teratomas, chemotherapy is often initiated prior to surgical resection.

**Seminomatous Tumors**

The seminomatous variant is the most common mediastinal germ cell tumor. Their gross appearance is characterized by a lobulated surface with a homogenous appearance with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. Histologically, cells have a distinct cell membrane exhibiting abundant clear eosinophilic cytoplasm containing glycogen. This characteristic can be easily demonstrated by a periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction. B-hCG serum levels are elevated in approximately one-third of patients. The presence of elevated AFP is an indication that a pure seminoma germ cell tumor is not present. Metastasis in most of the cases has already occurred during the time of discovery, with the most common involvement in adjacent lymph nodes. CT scans will appear as large masses with sharply demarcated borders, often with homogeneous attenuation.

**Non-seminomatous Tumors**

The non-seminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumor classification includes the remaining histological subtypes, including yolk sac tumors, choriocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma, or mixed type. They make up the most malignant variants of mediastinal germ cell tumors. The yolk sac tumor is the most common histological subtype, making up approximately 60% of the non-seminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumor cases. Yolk sac tumors are soft gray-white masses consisting of necrotic and hemorrhagic patches. They have distinctive glomeruloid perivascular structures, known as Schiller-Duval bodies, interlaced with various histological types, similar to those seen in the gonadal variants. Embryonal carcinomas have the gross appearance of poorly circumscribed invasive tumors. Their cells appear large with a primitive appearance and indistinct cell borders. Choriocarcinomas are larger tumors with extensive areas of hemorrhage. Histologically they are a mixture of different early blast cells that are typically only present during embryogenesis.
