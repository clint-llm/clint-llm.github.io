Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development is an extensive formal developmental assessment tool for diagnosing developmental delays in early childhood. BSID is the commonly used abbreviation for Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development. BSID scores are from a norm-referenced assessment of early childhood development. Nancy Bayley published the first BSID in 1969. The current BSID in use is BSID 4, published in 2019. BSID 4 is time-saving, has greater clinical sensitivity and accuracy when compared to BSD 3. It takes about 30 to 70 minutes to complete the test.

**Infant and Childhood Development**

Infant and childhood development comprises physical, cognitive, social-emotional, linguistic, and behavioral milestones. The differences in cultural, environmental, and genetic factors influence development. The development process is rapid and cumulative. Developmental disabilities are common and are reported 1 in 6 children in the United States. The number of children with select developmental disabilities (autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other developmental delays) has increased, requiring more health and education services.

**Developmental Assessments**

An estimated 5 to 10% of the pediatric population has a developmental disability.

- Routine developmental surveillance is where the health care professional takes a short developmental history and does a brief examination to elicit any developmental delay. Identification of developmental delay will be ineffective when based solely on routine surveillance.

- A developmental screening tool is a systematic and structured tool to identify developmental delay. Although screening tools are cost and time-efficient, they are not diagnostic and have less utility in high-risk populations.

- Formal developmental tests are widely accepted and have a diagnostic utility.

**Formal Developmental Assessment Tools**

The purpose of assessment and the age groups decides the type of tool used for formal development assessment. The evaluation will vary depending on the clinician's skill, the family's needs, and concerns. Some of them are norm-referenced, and some are criterion-referenced.

- A norm-referenced test is a standardized process of evaluating an individual against the performance of their peers.

- A criterion-referenced test evaluates the development of a child against pre-specified criteria. It helps to measure whole-group performance like in school.

Following is the list of developmental assessment tools commonly used in practice.

**The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development**

The Bayley Scales is in practice for several decades as a useful tool for detecting early developmental delay in clinical and research settings.

**Difference between BSID III versus BSID 4**

- Scoring is Dichotomous (1, 0) in BSID III, whereas scoring is polytomous (2,1,0) in BSID4.

- When compared to BSID III, BSID 4 takes approximately 30% less time to complete the assessment.

- BSID 4 has questions for the caregiver.

- Scoring is software-based in BSID III. BSID 4 scores need web-based administration.

- BSID 4 has retained the same five domains as in BSIDIII. However, in BSID4, the number of items in each section is decreased. 

- BSID III has the following number of items in each domain 

- Cognitive scale - 91 items 
- Language scale - 49 items in the receptive and 48 items in the expressive domain 
- Motor scale - 66 items in the fine motor and 72 items in the gross motor domain 
- Social-Emotional Scale derived from Greenspan Chart.
- Adaptive behavior scale derived from ABAS (Adaptive behavior assessment system) 


- BSID4 has the following number of items 

- Cognitive scale - 81 items 
- Language scale - 42 items in the receptive and 37 items in the expressive domain 
- Motor scale - 46 items in the fine motor and 58 items in the gross motor domain 
- Social-Emotional Scale is unmodified from Bayley III.
- The adaptive behavior scale utilizes the Vineland behavior assessment system.

**Purpose**

The BSID is employed to determine children's developmental functioning and plan management for kids with developmental delays. BSID helps in the following ways.

- Early identification of intellectual delay. Re-assessments can help to monitor progress over time.

- To individualize the management and to accommodate a child's developmental and learning needs.

- To assess individual domains of development: for example, cognitive delay.

- To help researchers as a research tool.

Early diagnosis of developmental disability is a critical responsibility of pediatric professionals.

**Target Age Group**

BSID III and BSID -4 are used for the age group starting from 16 days to 42 months.

**BSID Kit**

Each BSID kit will have a manual, forms, a booklet for the motor response, questionnaires for Social-Emotional, Adaptive Behavior domain, caregiver reports, observation Checklist, and manipulative set. Cognitive, Language, and Motor scores assessment needs a web-based device. The questionnaire for caregivers includes socio-emotional and adaptive domains. Scores are given as polytomous, ranging from 0 to 2. In BSID-4 scoring, two is Mastery, one is emerging, and zero means not present. After the assessment, the assessor summarizes standard and scaled scores. BSID administration requires training, which happens through webinars and workshops.

**Preparation**

The examiner explains to the caretaker what will happen during the assessment. By doing this helps in establishing a rapport with the child and avoid parental concerns during the evaluation. The caretaker is advised not to talk or aid the kid during the assessment, thereby avoiding skewed deviation.
