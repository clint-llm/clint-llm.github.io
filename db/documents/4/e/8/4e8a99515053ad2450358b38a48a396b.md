The initial steps of ocular infection involve adhesion of the pathogen to the corneal surface via mannose-binding protein and laminin-binding protein.Acanthamoeba proteases may induce damage to the corneal nerves, leading to significant pain and the characteristic finding on the slit lamp examination of radial keratoneuritis.Acanthamoeba is rare due to the intense response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the anterior chamber.Acanthamoeba are its ubiquity, absence of distinct morphology, ability to tolerate a wide range of temperatures and pHs, and ability to reversibly differentiate into a cyst or trophozoite.

Contact lens wear causes microtrauma to the corneal epithelium and upregulation of glycoproteins. Soft contact lenses have a more adherent surface than hard lenses, thereby providing the Acanthamoeba trophozoite greater access to the cornea.
