The diagnosis of hepatic cystadenomas has its basis in a combination of ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and clinicopathologic information. These lesions are typically intrahepatic, solitary, slow-growing, multiloculated cystic tumors filled with a clear mucinous fluid. BCAs have a female predominance and are often present within hepatic segment 4.

Sonographically, they appear as a well-defined, anechoic lesion surrounded by an echogenic capsule and containing multiple intrinsic septations. At CT, BCAs are a fluid attenuating cystic mass with a soft tissue attenuating rim, internal septa, and possibly capsular calcifications and mural nodularity.

Laboratory values are typically normal in patients, although in a minority of case reports elevated liver enzymes can be seen, specifically bilirubin levels.
