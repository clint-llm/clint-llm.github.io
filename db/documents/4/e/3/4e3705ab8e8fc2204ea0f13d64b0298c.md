Common variable immunodeficiency is a disorder characterized by defective B cell function leading to impaired immunoglobulin production. It can present with heterogeneous clinical manifestations such as recurrent infections, chronic lung disease, autoimmune disorders, gastrointestinal disease, or increased risk of malignancy. While some researchers have identified some genetic defect, the fundamental cause of CVID has been challenging to determine.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the pathophysiology of common variable immunodeficiency disease.
- Review the evaluation of common variable immunodeficiency disease, especially to avoid a delayed diagnosis.
- Describe the treatment and management options available for common variable immunodeficiency disease.
- Outline interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to improve short-term and long-term outcomes.
