The presenting symptoms of cardiogenic shock are variable. The most common clinical manifestations of shock, such as hypotension, altered mental status, oliguria, and cold, clammy skin, can be seen in patients with cardiogenic shock.

History plays a very important role in understanding the etiology of the shock and thus helps in the management of cardiogenic shock.

The patient should also be assessed for cardiac risk factors:

- Diabetes mellitus

- Tobacco smoking

- Hypertension

- Hyperlipidemia

- A family history of premature coronary artery disease

- Age older than 45 in men and older than 55 in women

- Physical inactivity

Physical examination findings in patients with cardiogenic shock include the following:

- Altered mental status, cyanosis, cold and clammy skin, mottled extremities

- Peripheral pulses are faint, rapid, and sometimes irregular if there is an underlying arrhythmia.

- Jugular venous distension

- Diminished heart sounds, S3 or S4, may be present, murmurs in the presence of valvular disorders such as mitral regurgitation or aortic stenosis.

- Pulmonary vascular congestion may be associated with rales.

- Peripheral edema may be present in the setting of fluid overload
