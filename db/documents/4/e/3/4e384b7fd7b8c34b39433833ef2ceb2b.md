No universal set of contraindications exists for all sympathomimetics, but a patient’s current condition may offer relative contraindications and the need for careful titration or selection of a more appropriate sympathomimetic. Although extremely rare, true hypersensitivity reactions would be considered a contraindication to specific agents. Following a comprehensive literature review, the following is a brief survey of contraindications for major sympathomimetic agents. High doses of phenylephrine may also be associated with extreme reflex bradycardia or asystole. For this reason, phenylephrine is a relative contraindication in patients with a history of extreme bradycardia.

Heart failure or cardiac injury is a relative contraindication for isoproterenol. The administration of isoproterenol may exacerbate an episode of decompensated heart failure due to the inotropic effects that increase myocardial oxygen demand while simultaneously decreasing myocardial oxygen supply.
