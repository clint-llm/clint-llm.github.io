Since the most common cause of headache presentations in the puerperium is exacerbations of a primary headache disorder, patient education regarding risk factor modification and self-medication with over-the-counter analgesics may lead to a lower rate of bounce-back visits in the emergency department. A discussion of what medications are safe to take postpartum and if breastfeeding, may help to ease maternal anxiety regarding self-medication. Physicians should give patients seen in the emergency department with puerperal headaches and discharged home strict and detailed return precautions. This instruction prevents additional delay in diagnosis in the case of a missed dangerous disorder.
