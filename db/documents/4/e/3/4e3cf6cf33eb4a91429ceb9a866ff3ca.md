The diagnosis of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism is similar to diagnosing hyperthyroidism. Obtaining a thorough clinical history is critical in correlating ICM exposure with the onset of symptoms. Most patients will develop symptoms less than a month after exposure to ICM, ranging from hours or days into weeks. Lab tests will show increased T3 and T4 and reduced TSH levels. Urinary levels of iodideÂ are increased up to three times the normal value. Nuclear imaging of the thyroid will show low to undetectable radioiodine uptake.
