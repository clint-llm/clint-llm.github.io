**Dissolution**

Methods to enhance dissolution to improve oral bioavailability include: ****

- Micronization to increase surface area for dissolution

- Salt formation of the active ingredient

- Use of co-solvents and micelle solutions to aid solubilization

- Complexation through the use of cyclodextrins

- Use of lipidic systems (for lipophilic drugs)
