Catheter management of mitral regurgitations is a relatively recent innovation. At the risk of an understatement, it is a considerable advancement in cardiology. It offers a correction option for patients with severe MR and prohibitive surgical risks. Recently studies have shown catheter management to be superior to surgical intervention in some circumstances.

Post MV repair with the edge-to-edge device, left ventricular contractility and cardiac output remain constant, although total ejection fraction and global strain may decrease. This is likely due to a decrease in regurgitant volume after a repair, which reduces the Left ventricular end-diastolic volume, thereby decreasing myocardial Oxygen demand and can lead to improved NYHA functional class after three months.
