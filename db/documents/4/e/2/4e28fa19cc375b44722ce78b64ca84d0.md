The following are some of the complications seen in patients with BWS:

- Perinatal complications: gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus, vaginal bleeding, polyhydramnios, prematurity, and macrosomia-related complications (cephalohematoma, brachial plexus injury, or other birth trauma).

- Neonatal complications: increased risk for mortality mainly as a result of complications of prematurity, macroglossia (breathing and feeding difficulties), hypoglycemia, and, rarely, cardiomyopathy.

- Other complications: speech issues related to macroglossia, cognitive impairment related to specific chromosomal anomalies and/or perinatal complications, high risk to develop embryonal tumors (especially Wilms tumor and hepatoblastoma), nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis, renal cysts, recurrent urinary tract infections, scoliosis related to the leg-length discrepancy, fertility issues from cryptorchidism, and psychosocial issues related to the fear for the condition and complications.
