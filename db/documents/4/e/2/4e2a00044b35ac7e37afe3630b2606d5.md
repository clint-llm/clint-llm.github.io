- Outline the typical presentation of a patient with a lumbar somatic dysfunction.
- Describe the steps of performing lumbar counterstrain or facilitated positional release. 
- Explain the importance of collaboration and communication amongst the interprofessional team to improve outcomes for patients affected by lumbar somatic dysfunctions.
