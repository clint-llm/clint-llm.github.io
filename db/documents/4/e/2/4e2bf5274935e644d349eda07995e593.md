The lateral and medial menisci are accessory structures of the knee joint. A meniscus is a C-shaped cartilaginous pad between the opposing articular surfaces of the proximal tibia and the distal femur. The average width of the meniscus is 10 mm to 12 mm, and the average thickness is 4 mm to 5 mm. The meniscus is made of fibroelastic cartilage and serves as a cushion and shock absorber within the joint. It is an interlacing network of collagen, glycoproteins, proteoglycan, and cellular elements and is about 70% water.

Three ligaments attach to the meniscus. The coronary ligaments connect the meniscus peripherally. The transverse or inter-meniscal ligament is located anteriorly and connects the medial and lateral meniscus. The meniscofemoral ligament joins the meniscus to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and has two components: the Humphrey ligament anteriorly and the ligament of Wrisberg posteriorly. The meniscofemoral ligament originates from the posterior horn of the lateral meniscus.

The blood supply to the meniscus is derived from the medial inferior genicular artery and the lateral inferior genicular artery. Meniscal blood supply is known to be very poor, especially in the central portion, which gets most of its nutrition via diffusion.

There are several types of meniscal tears. These include flap tears, radial tears, horizontal cleavage tears, bucket handle tears, longitudinal tears, and degenerative tears.
