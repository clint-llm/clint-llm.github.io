- Metformin is a biguanide compound used as an antihyperglycemic in the treatment of diabetes mellitus

- Metformin associated lactic acidosis (MALA) is defined as pH < 7.35 and lactate > 5 mM in the setting of known or suspected metformin use

- There are two subsets of metformin toxicity:

- Chronic or incidental MALA - a predisposing pathophysiological condition that leads to supra-therapeutic accumulation of metformin
- Intentional or acute metformin-induced lactic acidosis (MILA) – an acute overdose of metformin

- MALA occurs in about 9% of mono-overdoses of metformin and 0.7% of poly-substance overdoses

- Patients at risk for the development of MALA should be observed for a minimum of 12 hours

- A broad workup to evaluate for other etiologies of metabolic acidosis and shock states should be initiated

- Patients presenting with MALA may exhibit signs of shock requiring aggressive management, including intubation, ventilation, and vasopressor support

- Sodium bicarbonate infusion is recommended for pH < 7.20, especially in the setting of underlying cardiovascular disease or hemodynamic compromise

- Hemodialysis should be initiated for pH < 7.0, lactate > 20, and in patients who do not respond to more conservative therapies

- Hemodialysis exhibits a higher clearance rate of metformin and lactate than CRRT and is preferred with concurrent use of vasopressors

- ECMO, when available, is a potential intervention if hemodynamics doesn’t allow for hemodialysis and if unresponsive to vasopressors

- Methylene blue may be used adjunctively as a possible rescue agent for vasoplegic shock and metabolic bypass
