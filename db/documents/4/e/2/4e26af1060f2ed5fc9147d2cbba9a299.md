The inferior alveolar artery mainly perfuses the lower jaw, including the teeth and gingivae. Also, the inferior alveolar branches will perfuse some of the muscle nearby. The mylohyoid branch of the inferior alveolar artery perfuses the mylohyoid muscle and the anterior muscle belly of the digastric muscle.

The anastomoses that the inferior alveolar artery and its branches form will perfuse other muscles in the face indirectly.
