Although the cause of migraine headaches is not entirely understood, the thinking is that arteriolar vasodilation and inflammation of the trigeminal nerve due to the release of local vasoactive peptides, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP) plays a role. CGRP is a neuropeptide that can be found in the central and peripheral nervous systems and has pain-signaling and vasodilator functions. Patients with migraines have elevated levels of circulating CGRP, and migraine medications, such as the ergot alkaloids, are associated with lowering these CGRP levels.

Caffeine may work synergistically with ergotamine by also constricting cerebral vasculature or enhancing its GI absorption. The vasoconstrictive effects of caffeine are due to its antagonistic properties at adenosine A1, A2A, and A2B receptors. Implications point to adenosine receptors in vasodilation. The mechanism ofÂ caffeine's rate-accelerating effect appears to be due to its ability to increase ergotamine's water solubility and decrease gastric pH. Caffeine also has numerous physiologic effects that may influence improvement in migraine symptoms such as enhancing mood, alertness, and exercise performance.
