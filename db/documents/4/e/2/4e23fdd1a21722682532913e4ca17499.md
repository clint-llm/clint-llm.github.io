Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a condition in which the foramen ovale, present in the atrial septum of the developing fetus, fails to close after birth. In divers, it has been associated with severe neurological decompression sickness, inner ear decompression sickness, and cutis marmorata. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of PFO in divers and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the risk of decompression illness in divers with patent foramen ovale versus those without.
- Outline the risks and potential benefits of patent foramen ovale closure in divers.
- Identify potential complications of patent foramen ovale in divers.
- Explain the importance of improving care coordination amongst interprofessional team members to improve outcomes for patients known to have patent foramen ovale who are considering diving.
