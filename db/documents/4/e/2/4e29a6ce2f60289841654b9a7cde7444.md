The causes of FGR SGA are diverse, with maternal and placental factors the most common underlying etiologies. Maternal factors such as chronic medical conditions (hypertension, renal disease, collagen vascular diseases), infections (toxoplasmosis, rubella, Cytomegalovirus, malaria, trypanosomiasis, HIV), nutritional status (low pre-pregnancy weight, low pregnancy weight), and substance use (cigarette smoking, alcohol, illicit drugs, medications) are all implicated in FGR SGA. Other factors contributing to FGR SGAÂ include placental factors such as a single umbilical artery, placental hemangiomas, placenta previa, low-lying placenta, and chronic placental abruption.

Finally, genetic disorders have been found to be responsible for FGR SGA in 1/3 of infants.
