The recommendation is that patients schedule a pre-travel appointment with a preventive medicine or infectious disease physician for education regarding malaria deterrence. Malaria prevention centers around vector control and chemoprophylaxis while exposed to mosquito-ridden environments.

Vector control is the prevention of mosquito bites by way of insecticide-impregnated bed nets, permethrin treatment of clothing, and DEET application to the skin.Plasmodium falciparum are atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, and mefloquine. Atovaquone-proguanil is taken once daily during and one week after travel to an endemic region; it suppresses the hepatic stage and does not have approval for pregnancy.
