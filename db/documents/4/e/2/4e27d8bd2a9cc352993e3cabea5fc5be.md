The oculomotor nerve originates from 2 nuclei in the midbrain

- 
Oculomotor nucleus

- 
Accessory parasympathetic nucleus (Edinger-Westphal nucleus)

The oculomotor nerve exits the brainstem near midline at the base of the midbrain just caudal to the mammillary bodies. It passes through the cavernous sinus and proceeds through the supraorbital fissure to reach the orbit of the eye (Figure 1).

The third cranial nerve has both somatic and autonomic fibers. Somatic (voluntary) nerve fibers are bundled deep inside the nerve, while the autonomic (involuntary) fibers surround the somatic fibers around the outside of the nerve. Knowing the spatial layout of these fibers will help one understand the various forms of presentation in third nerve palsies.

Somatic (voluntary) functions of the oculomotor nerve include elevation of the upper eyelid via innervation of the **levator palpebrae superioris muscle**. Other essential functions include coordination of eye muscles for visual tracking and gaze fixation. These functions of eye movement occur through innervation of four eye muscles:

- **Superior rectus muscle**-elevates the eye while looking straight ahead (primary position)

- **Medial rectus muscle**-adducts the eye from a primary position

- **Inferior rectus muscle**-moves the eye down from a primary position

- **Inferior oblique muscle**-elevates the eye when the eye is adducted from a primary position

There are two primary functions of the autonomic parasympathetic (involuntary) oculomotor nerve. It constricts the pupil (miosis) by innervating the smooth muscle (**sphincter pupillae**) near the pupil. It also innervates the**ciliary muscles**. These muscles connect the iris to the choroid. Contraction of the muscle alters the curvature of the lens which allows individuals to focus the lens on near objects (Figure 1).
