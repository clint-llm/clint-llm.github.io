Acrochordons (fibroepithelial polyps, skin tags, papillomas) are common benign neoplasms of the skin, often associated with obesity. These small pedunculated polyps are frequently a nuisance for patients, typically developing around the neck, axilla, and groin areas. They can bother the patients due to associated symptoms like pain, itching and rubbing against clothes or sometime only because of their appearance. There is established association of acrochordons with insulin resistance and obesity along with a familial predisposition for developing such lesions. [1][2][3]
