**Compartment syndrome**: The first and most sensitive sign of compartment syndrome is pain out of proportion or pain with passive stretch. The other classical signs are palpable swelling, pallor, pulselessness, and paresthesias but many of the other signs will only develop later.

**Malunion**: Proximal tibia fractures especially have a tendency for malalignment in the valgus and apex anterior (procurvatum) deformity.

**Nonunion**: Typically defined by the inability for a fracture to heal without surgical intervention or no radiographic healing after six months.

**Anterior knee pain**: The most common complication after insertion of an intramedullary nail.
