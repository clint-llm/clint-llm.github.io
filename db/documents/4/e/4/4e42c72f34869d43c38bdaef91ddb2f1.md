In the United States, trauma is the fourth most common cause of death. Trauma is the leading cause of death between ages 1 and 44.

General risk factors associated with increased morbidity and mortality include low socioeconomic status, non-Caucasian race, medical comorbidities, and living in a trauma “desert” with no nearby level I or II trauma centers.

The trauma of the duodenum is rare and accounts for only 3.7 to 5% of all patients with an abdominal injury.
