Neurapraxia is the mildest form of peripheral nerve injury commonly induced by focal demyelination or ischemia. In neurapraxia, the conduction of nerve impulses is blocked in the injured area. Motor and sensory conduction are partially or entirely lost. This activity describes the evaluation and management of neurapraxia and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in improving care for patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of neurapraxia.
- Describe the appropriate evaluation of neurapraxia.
- Outline the management options available for neurapraxia.
- Review interprofessional team strategies for improving care in patients with neurapraxia and improve outcomes.
