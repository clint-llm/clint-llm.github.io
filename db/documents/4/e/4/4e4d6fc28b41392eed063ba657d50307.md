The diagnosis and management of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans require an interprofessional team that consists of an oncologist, surgeon, radiologist, radiation therapist, and physical therapy. The treatment of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is surgical removal. The key is to remove the entire lesion with clear margins. Local recurrences are very common when margins are positive. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans does not respond well to chemotherapy or radiation. All patients need long-term follow-up with imaging studies because recurrences are known to occur. The prognosis for patients with completely excised lesions is good.
