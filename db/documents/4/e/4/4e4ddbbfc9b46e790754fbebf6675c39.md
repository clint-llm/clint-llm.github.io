The talus ranks as the second largest tarsal bone with unique anatomic features and serves an important role in the mobility of the foot and ankle as it is the osseous link between the leg and the foot. The posterior process of the body is composed of the medial and lateral tubercles. The flexor hallucis longus tendon runs between these two tubercles. The os trigonum is another normal variant due to non-fusion of the lateral tubercle ossification center. Vascular supply to the talus arises from three arteries: posterior tibial, dorsalis pedis and perforating peroneal arteries. The blood supply is predominately extraosseous because of the extensive articular cartilage coverage and is therefore easily disrupted in the setting of displaced fractures or dislocation leading to avascular necrosis or osteonecrosis. This activity addresses the presentation, evaluation, and management of talus fracture and examines the role of an interprofessional team approach on the care of affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the anatomy of the talus bone.
- Review the work up of a patient with talus fracture.
- Summarize the treatment options for talus fracture.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by a talus fracture.
