Postpartum thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease and associated with the presence of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO). Postpartum thyroiditis also is known as destructive thyroiditis with lymphocytic infiltration within the thyroid gland. Histological features of postpartum thyroiditis are similar to Hashimoto thyroiditis, and both are associated with HLA-D and HLA-B haplotypes. These findings indicate the importance of inherited risk factors.

The presence of TPO antibodies is seen in other autoimmune thyroid diseases such as Graves disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis. The level of TPO antibodies reflects the severity of the infiltration of lymphocytes within the thyroid gland. TPO antibodies are complement-fixing, which subsequently induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
