A dorsal approach is preferred due to the thinness of the skin in this location and decreased sensitivity.

The procedure is performed in the following steps:

- Have the patient place their hand palm-down on a clean, flat, sturdy surface

- Using aseptic technique, identify landmarks and clean area using an alcohol wipe or chlorhexidine 2%

- Insert a 27 gauge needle according to the nerve block desired. The dorsal and palmar nerves on each side can be anesthetized with a single needle puncture.
- For superficial dorsal nerves - perpendicular to the digit into the dorsal aspect of the web space on one side of the digit slightly distal to the knuckle
- For superficial palmar nerves - perpendicular to the digit into the palmar aspect of the web space on one side of the digit slightly distal to the knuckle, taking care not to advance through the palmar skin

- Advance the needle slightly

- Aspirate to ensure the needle is not intravascular, then inject 0.5 to 1.5 mL of the local anesthetic solution while withdrawing the needle

- Firm massage for approximately 30 seconds to enhance the diffusion of the anesthetic

- Repeat the procedure on the opposite side of the digit to be blocked
