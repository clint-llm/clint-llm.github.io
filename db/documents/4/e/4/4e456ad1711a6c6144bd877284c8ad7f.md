Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy is a cytosine, adenine, and guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat expansion in the atrophin-1 (ATN1) gene, in exon 5.

Some exceptions are reported in rare cases of asymptomatic patients with high CAG repeats. Complete penetrance of the condition is more than 48 tandem copies, which have a typical clinical presentation. Incomplete penetrance phenotypes are found in patients with alleles of 35 to 47 repeat length, associated with a milder clinical phenotype. Japanese patients have a higher number of baseline CAG repeats, 20 to 35, compared to people of European descent.
