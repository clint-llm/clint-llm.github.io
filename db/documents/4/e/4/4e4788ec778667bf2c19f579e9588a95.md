The administration of most tetracyclines is via the oral route; however,Â topical, intramuscular (IM), and intravenous (IV) forms of the medication do exist. Only oxytetracycline and tetracycline administration can be via IM injection. Oral tetracycline absorption occurs primarily in the stomach, duodenum, and small intestine. They distribute well in tissues, ascitic fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, and bronchial secretions. Tetracyclines have poor penetration into the cerebral spinal fluid. The absorption of all tetracyclines decreases when administered with multivalent cations such as aluminum, calcium, iron, or magnesium. Cations cause chelation of the tetracyclines, thus impairing their absorption in the gut, leading to excretion of the drug in the urine and feces.
