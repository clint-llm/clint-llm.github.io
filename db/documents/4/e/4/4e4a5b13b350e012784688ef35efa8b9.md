Before thymectomy, the preoperative evaluation contains many of the same characteristics common to all surgeries, including a comprehensive history and physical exam. The type of work-up also depends on the disease process necessitating a thymectomy. If thymectomy is performed for underlying myasthenia gravis, adequate preoperative stabilization is necessary to avoid myasthenia crisis. This includes anticholinesterase inhibitors, intravenous immunoglobulin, and/or plasmapheresis. Preoperative imaging includes a CT scan with IV contrast to evaluate nearby structures' involvement, including blood vessels (innominate vein).

MRI and PET-CT scans may also benefit from differentiating between thymic hyperplasia and thymoma and identifying nodal or distant metastases 30928002. Preoperative evaluation should also include pulmonary and cardiac function tests. Even if pulmonary resection is not indicated, there is a large respiratory burden following median sternotomy or at baseline from myasthenia gravis. Therefore, pulmonary function tests, electrocardiogram, and a cardiac stress test may all be indicated depending on the patient's co-morbidities.
