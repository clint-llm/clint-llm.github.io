Overall the function of the male urethra is to allow passage of urine and semen. The urethra connects the distal portions of the urinary system, such as the urinary bladder, to the external environment and allows for urine excretion from the body. Likewise, the urethra provides a conduit for ejaculate to pass from the distal portions of the male reproductive system, specifically the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate.

Microscopically there are groups of cells that serve essential functions related to the urethra. The epithelial cells lining the lumen of the urethra are protective against the constant exposure to urine, seminal fluid and the external environment. The submucosal layer is supportive due to its extensive vascular content. The fibromuscular layer of cells is the outer-most portion of the urethra and provides structure, propulsion, and tone to the urethra.
