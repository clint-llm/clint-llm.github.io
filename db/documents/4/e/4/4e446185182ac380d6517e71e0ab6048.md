Although transesophageal echocardiography is a relatively safe modality, it is an invasive procedure and does carry the risk of infrequent but potentially life-threatening complications. Therefore, it should only be performed by qualified, trained physicians. There are multiple, recently published guidelines that cover the training and maintenance of certification guidelines for the practice of intraoperative echocardiography. Cardiologists often have a base of knowledge in transthoracic echocardiography before learning transesophageal echocardiography. This is not always the case for anesthesiologists, who utilize intraoperative TEE at a much higher rate than TTE. The majority of the intraoperative echocardiography guidelines are synthesized and published by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), the Society for Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists (SCA), and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE). Physicians typically demonstrate their competence in echocardiography by completion of a training program and achieving a passing score on a certifying exam. The primary examination and certification organization for intraoperative echocardiography is the National Board of Echocardiography (NBE) which was founded in 1998 by a joint partnership between the SCA and the ASE.

The NBE offers examinations and certifications in the following areas:

- The ASCeXAM is for physicians who can show special competence in all areas of echocardiography including TTE, TEE, and stress echocardiography - this exam and certification is most commonly taken and acquired by cardiologists

- The Advanced PTEeXAM is intended for physicians who are especially competent in advanced perioperative transesophageal echocardiography - this is the exam and certification which is most commonly acquired by cardiovascular anesthesiologists; the goal of this exam is to demonstrate the full diagnostic and surgical decision-making capacity of perioperative TEE

- The Basic PTEeXAM covers basic perioperative transesophageal echocardiography: The goal of this exam and certification is the process of intraoperative non-diagnostic monitoring except in the case of an emergent situation; this exam and certification is most commonly obtained by general anesthesiologists and is not specifically designed for those who routinely practice cardiovascular anesthesiology

In order to acquire certification in any of the above areas, the physician applicant must not only pass a computerized exam, he or she must also complete a variety of additional requirements including personally performing a certain number of applicable echocardiography examinations, completion of a certified training program, acquisition of a certain number of continuing medical education requirements, and the achievement of board certification in their specialty.
