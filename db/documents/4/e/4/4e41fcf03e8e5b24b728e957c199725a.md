Clinical laboratories can assay hormones relatively easily. Using automated immunoassay platforms, one can quantify most hormones with precision. In certain instances, such as urine free cortisol, the most reliable tests are high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Â In rare cases, techniques such as gel chromatography and equilibrium dialysis may be required to assay free hormones. However, clinical laboratories or reference laboratories can reliably measure most hormones.
