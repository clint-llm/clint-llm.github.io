The indications for spinal motion restriction are dependent on the protocol developed by local emergency medical service directors and may vary accordingly. Although there may be some variation, they will typically incorporate either the NEXUS C-Spine Rule or the Canadian C-Spine Rule. However, the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT), the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), and the National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP) have developed a joint statement on spinal motion restriction in adult blunt trauma patients in 2018 and has listed the following indications:

- Altered level of consciousness, signs of intoxication, GCS < 15

- Midline spinal tenderness or pain

- Focal neurologic signs or symptoms such as motor weakness, numbness

- Anatomic deformity of the spine

- Distracting injuries or circumstances (e.g., fractures, burns, emotional distress, language barrier, etc.)

The same joint statement also made recommendations for pediatric blunt trauma patients, noting that age and ability to communicate should not be a factor in decision making for prehospital spinal care. The following are their recommended indications:

- The complaint of neck pain

- Torticollis

- Neurologic deficit

- Altered mental status, including GCS <15, intoxication, and other signs (agitation, apnea, hypopnea, somnolence, etc.)

- Involvement in a high-risk motor vehicle collision, high impact diving injury, or has substantial torso injury
