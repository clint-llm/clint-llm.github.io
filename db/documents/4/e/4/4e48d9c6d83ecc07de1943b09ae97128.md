The differential diagnosis for these presentations includes:

- Infectious etiologies like tetanus, sepsis, or meningoencephalitis are similar concerning alterations in mental status, body temperature setpoints, and focal neurologic changes that may mimic heat-related injury.

- Primary metabolic abnormalities, including endocrine dysfunction like thyroid storm or diabetic ketoacidosis

- Neurologic insults, including stroke or primary seizure disorder

- Toxicologic ingestions including anticholinergic toxidrome, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, and withdrawal symptoms

Specific heat illnesses can also have symptoms that mimic other syndromes. For example, heat edema should not be mistaken for swelling caused by other medical conditions, including hypervolemia from congestive heart failure or liver dysfunction or a deep vein thrombosis of the extremity. Heat syncope should not be confused for syncope of other etiology, including cardiogenic or with different pathologies that lead to a transient change in consciousness (e.g., pulmonary embolism, rupture of an ectopic pregnancy, aortic dissection, or some environmental gas exposures).
