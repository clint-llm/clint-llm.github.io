Fibrinogen is a substrate for three major enzymes: thrombin, plasmin, and factor XIIIa. Due to various functional interactions, it plays aÂ crucial role in hemostasis. Fibrinogen is the soluble precursor to insoluble fibrin, and it also supports platelet aggregation. The fibrin clot also activates the fibrinolytic system; thus, the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis determines the clinical manifestations.

Formation of fibrin: When thrombin (factor IIa) binds to fibrinogen, it releases fibrinopeptide A and B (FPA & FPB, respectively) from A alpha and B beta chains. The resultant molecule is a fibrin monomer that spontaneously polymerizes to form a fibrin clot. Once polymerized, factor XIIIa activates cross-linking of fibrin which strengthens the clot and provides prevention against mechanical or enzymatic disruption.
