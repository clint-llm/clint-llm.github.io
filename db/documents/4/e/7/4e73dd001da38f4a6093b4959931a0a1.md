Giant cell tumor (GCT) is one of the most common benign bone tumors, which occurs in young adults 20-40 years old with a high recurrence rate and a potential for aggressive behavior.

The biopsied tissue has multinucleated giant cells under the microscope. They consist of three different cell types:

- Giant cell tumor stromal cells of osteoblastic origin

- Mononuclear histiocytic cells

- The multinucleated giant cell of an osteoclast-monocyte lineage.

The tumor bone resorption is primarily done by the giant cells. The spindle-like stromal cells recruit monocytes and promote their fusion into giant cells. The stromal cells also improve the resorptive ability of the giant cells.
