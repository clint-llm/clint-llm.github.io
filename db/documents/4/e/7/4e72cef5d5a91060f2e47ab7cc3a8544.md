Insulin aspart should be administered subcutaneously (SC) within 5 to 10 minutes before a meal, with 1 to 4 meals per day. To avoid lipodystrophy, rotate injection sites between the top of thighs, back of upper arms, buttocks, or abdomen. Avoid injecting within 2 inches of the naval. Insulin aspart may also be administered using a continuous subcutaneous infusion through an insulin pump or intravenously (IV) as a diluted solution with close monitoring of blood glucose and serum potassium. Insulin aspart may be mixed with NPH insulin only but may only be administered SC once mixed.
