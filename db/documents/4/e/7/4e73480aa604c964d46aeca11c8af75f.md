Talking about death and dying is an important element in the treatment and care of patients and families. It is important for the healthcare provider to be comfortable in engaging with this type of discussion not only during the terminal phase but also in the early stages of a grave prognosis or when broached by a patient. It is crucial, as a healthcare provider, to self-reflect on one's emotional thoughts and feelings regarding death and dying, in general, and how the topics relate to each patient. It is normal to have strong feelings. Identify those feelings. Talk with a colleague or keep a personal journal. It is helpful to role play difficult discussions before having them and reflect on the emotions. Addressing those emotions before encountering the patients and their families will allow the healthcare provider to be fully present for that patient and their needs.

As mentioned before, the primary cause of death for ages 1 through 44 years in the United States of America is unintentional injuries. This causes a complicated grief situation for the family due to the swiftness and unexpectedness of the situation. Ensure to provide resources and be prepared to repeat information as the family may experience the first stage of grief, denial, and not retain what was discussed in your meeting. If the second stage of grief, anger, is present, and practitioners should not take anger directed toward them personally. The family will have a unique grief experience. Provide support as they need it.

Conflicts may arise when a patient's wishes do not match with a family member's wishes or when a patient wants to continue treatments that the medical team deems futile. In such situations, it is advisable to hold a number of discussions to ensure that all parties have the same information and understanding. An ethics committee may need to become involved if resolution cannot be reached.
