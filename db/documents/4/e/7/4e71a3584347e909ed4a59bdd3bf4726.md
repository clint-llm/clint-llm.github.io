The normal individual has four parathyroid glands that are usually located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. One or more parathyroid glands may get accidentally resected during surgical intervention on the thyroid. The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), and any resection of those glands can decrease PTH levels.
