Erythrokeratodermia variabilis is mostly a skin-limited condition. Nevertheless, the evaluation of systemic manifestations is necessary to eliminate other variants of erythrokeratodermia that can mimic EKV clinically. These include KID syndrome with erythrokeratodermia-like lesions. In this condition, keratitis, hearing loss, alopecia, and increased susceptibility to infection are present. Moreover, reports exist of neurological symptoms in association with EKV-like lesions including ataxia, and peripheral neuropathy.
