The hypothalamus is the central command center for hormonal regulation. Its effects are primarily carried out by the hormones released from the hypothalamus to their target organs, including the pituitary gland, adrenal gland, thyroid gland, and ovaries and testes. Numerous dysfunctions may manifest as a result of hypothalamic injury, including body temperature, growth, weight, water balance, milk production, emotions, and even sleep cycles. This activity will review the role of the interprofessional team in the evaluation and treatment of hypothalamic dysfunctions.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the associated signs and symptoms of hypothalamic dysfunction according to the affected area and physiological function.
- Summarize the evaluation in patients with hypothalamic dysfunction.
- Outline the management options available for hypothalamic dysfunction.
