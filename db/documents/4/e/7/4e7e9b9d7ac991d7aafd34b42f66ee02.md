Hypoglycemia is defined as a clinical condition when the venous blood glucose level is <55mg/dl (<3mmol/L), obtained if possible, at the time of the symptoms.

Hypoglycemia is frequently observed in patients with diabetes mellitus but is uncommon in patients without diabetes. Hypoglycemia in patients without diabetes may be due to a variety of causes. Therefore, it is important to take a thorough clinical history and examination. Appropriate diagnostic tests should be undertaken to elucidate the cause of hypoglycemia.
