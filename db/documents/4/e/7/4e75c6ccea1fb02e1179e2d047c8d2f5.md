The SYNTAX trial compared patients who underwent CABG versus PCI with DES placement and followed up patients in 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 10-year intervals. At 10 years follow-up, patients with triple vessel disease who underwent PCI with DES placement had a hazard ratio for death of 1.41 (CI 95%: 1.1 - 1.8) compared to CABG.
