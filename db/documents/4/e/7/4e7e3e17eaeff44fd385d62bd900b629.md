The initial evaluation should commence by placing a curvilinear probe with the appropriately selected OB settings over the suprapubic area. The probe can be placed in either sagittal or transverse orientation. The probe indicator should be directed to the cephalad for the sagittal images and towards the patient's right side for transverse images.

If a transvaginal examination is indicated, the patient should be placed in the lithotomy position. The probe should be inserted with the indicator in the vertical direction. Sagittal images are obtained by maintaining the indicator pointing towards the ceiling, while transverse imaging requires rotating the probe to have the indicator facing the patient's right side.

Several measurements are indicated for appropriate assessment of the status of the fetus and the maternal structures, starting with the estimation of the gestational age. Gestation dating by ultrasonography may be inaccurate during the third trimester.

- Biparietal diameter (BPD)

- Occipitofrontal diameter (OFD)

- Head circumference (HC)

- Abdominal diameter (AD)

- Abdominal circumference (AC)

- Femur length (FL)

On the other hand, estimation of fetal size is best performed during the third trimester.

Frequently, fetal movement can be identified and should be documented. However, lack of fetal movement can have different significances and can be affected by the fetal sleep cycle. The fetal heart should be measured using M mode as established by As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) recommendations.

Evaluating the fetal lie is of paramount importance, especially as the term date approaches. First, the fetal head is identified, followed by the direction of the hyperechoic fetal spine. If the fetal head is closer to the cervix, this is described as cephalad. The laterality of the spine is also essential, and it is always described based on the mother's orientation. On the other hand, when the head is more cephalad to the mother, it is considered a breech presentation. The specific type of breech presentation should be evaluated as frank, complete, or footling.

The fetal anatomy should be evaluated for any apparent abnormalities. The laterality of all anatomic structures visualized should be noted. The fetal head and its general should be examined for symmetry. Intracranial anatomical structures should be visible, including the cerebellum, cavum septum pellucidum, and ventricles. The inability to identify any of these structures warrants further investigation.

The probe should be optimized to assess the heart's movement, position, and orientation in detail. During the third trimester, the four heart chambers should be visible. The fetal heart rate should be evaluated for any signs of arrhythmia. The lungs should be seen flanking the heart bilaterally, and they should appear echogenic and homogeneous, in what is described as "liver-like."

Further moving caudally in the fetus, the abdominal organs should be appreciated. The stomach is seen on the left side as an anechoic cystic structure below the diaphragm.

A general evaluation of the cervix is wise. First, by visual inspection, the sonographer should determine if the cervix is open or closed. If open, the distance from the inner wall to the inner wall should be measured. Subsequently, due to the morbidity associated with cervical insufficiency, the length from the outer to the inner cervical os should also be measured.

The placenta can be identified by tracing the endometrium until an isoechoic structure with increased vascularity on color Doppler. The location of the placenta should be described as anterior or posterior. The location of the placenta should be described as anterior or posterior. The presence of placenta previa should be excluded by measuring the distance from the caudal edge of the placenta to the inner cervical os. A measurement of less than 3 cm is concerning for placenta previa and should be further evaluated.

The placenta should be further inspected for masses or retroplacental hemorrhage, which will appear as heterogenous or anechoic areas, respectively. Its size in both longitudinal and transverse axes should be determined. Any abnormal finding should be further studied by applying both Color Doppler and Power Doppler modes.

From the placenta, the point of insertion of the umbilical cord should be traced and classified as central, eccentric, marginal, or velamentous. After applying color Doppler mode to the umbilical cord, both venous and arterial flow pulsations should be distinguished. Ideally, spectral doppler should be seen in the free cord, but this can be technically challenging at times. In these cases, consistency should be preferred over accuracy, and it should be measured at a site where it can be reliably reproduced. Once a continuous wave Doppler is applied, an umbilical artery waveform following a “sawtooth” pattern should be easily discerned from the venous flow. A resistive index can be calculated by applying the formula as follows:

resistive index (RI) (Pourcelot index) = (peak systolic velocity – end-diastolic velocity) / peak systolic velocity

Doppler indices are known to decline with the progression of the gestational age, given that diastolic flow increases gradually. If the umbilical artery resistive index is abnormal, further investigation is warranted.

Finally, the amniotic fluid level should be measured by both amniotic fluid index (AFI) and deepest vertical pocket (DVP) methods if possible. To assess AFI, using the linea nigra and mediolateral lines as the axial and horizontal axis, the sonographer must divide the uterus into four different quadrants.

The deepest pocket identified in each quadrant devoid of both fetal parts and the umbilical cord is measured vertically. The dimensions in centimeters of these measurements are added together to calculate the AFI. Normal AFI is between 5 to 25 cm. An AFI of less than 5 cm is considered oligohydramnios.

To determine DVP, the deepest pocket of fluid devoid of fetal parts and the umbilical cord is identified and measured vertically. A value of less than 2 cm is concerning for oligohydramnios, while more than 8 cm indicates polyhydramnios.

As stated before, abnormal findings required further specialized sonographic examination and prompt consultation with an obstetrician. Other specialized studies fall beyond the scope of this activity.
