Umbilical cord prolapse is when the umbilical cord exits the cervical os before the fetal presenting part. Compression of the cord results in vasoconstriction and resultant fetal hypoxia, which can lead to fetal death or disability if not rapidly diagnosed and managed. This activity reviews the diagnosis and management of patients with umbilical cord prolapse in the emergency department and highlights the role of early recognition and interprofessional involvement in improving patient outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the clinical presentation of umbilical cord prolapse.
- Outline the key steps in the acute management of umbilical cord prolapse.

- Review alternative management strategies that can be utilized after initial attempts at funic decompression have failed or in cases where obstetric care is not immediately available. 
- Explain strategies to improve care coordination between the interprofessional teams caring for patients with umbilical cord prolapse to improve outcomes.
