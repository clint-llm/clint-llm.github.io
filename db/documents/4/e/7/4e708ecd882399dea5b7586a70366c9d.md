Before starting a bisphosphonate, a discussion of the possible adverse effects and toxicities needs to be held with patients. Risk assessment is key in managing patients who are candidates for bisphosphonates. A discussion within and amongst the healthcare and dental professional teams will further help to select appropriate patients in whom the benefits of bisphosphonatesÂ outweigh the associated risks.
