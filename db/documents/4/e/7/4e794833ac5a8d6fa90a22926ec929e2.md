Atrial flutter is the second most common cardiac arrhythmia after atrial fibrillation.

It is commonly associated with atrial fibrillation, but the incidence and the prevalence of the atrial flutter are less known when compared with atrial fibrillation.

Atrial flutter in common in patientsÂ with underlying diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure.

Isolated atrial flutter in the absence of abnormal heart anatomy is rare and usually is present when atrial size abnormalities have developed.

Atrial flutter is more frequent in males than in females. Aging is a significant risk factor as other associated disorders in patients with atrial fibrillation include systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and history of alcohol abuse.

Older age is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.
