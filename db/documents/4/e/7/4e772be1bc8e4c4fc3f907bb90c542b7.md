Corneal endotheliitis is defined as corneal endothelium-specific inflammation, which Khodadoust and Attarzadeh first described in 1982, characterized by corneal edema, keratic precipitates (KP), mild anterior chamber (AC) inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Based on the presentation of KP and pattern of the overlying stromal and epithelial edema, corneal endotheliitis can be classified into four types: linear, sectoral, disciform, and diffuse.

Viruses including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), or human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7)Â have been reported in association with corneal endotheliitis. In 2006, Koizumi reported the first case of corneal endotheliitis caused by CMV.
