Muscles and myocutaneous flaps are useful for various acquired oncologic or traumatic defects throughout the body. Myocutaneous flaps have historically been the choice in head and neck, pressure sore, perineal, extremity, and breast reconstructions.  Wounds that are high risk for infection and have large dead space are ideal for muscle flaps. When considering donor flaps, one must determine the size and tissue components necessary for reconstruction, the resultant function and morbidity of the donor site, and the eventual function and aesthetic outcome of the recipient site. While facial reanimation may require free tissue transfer with thin, pliable, and innervated muscle such as the gracilis, pressure sores require bulky myocutaneous flaps that can tolerate pressure better than a muscle flap with a skin graft. For extremity reconstruction, weight-bearing surfaces benefit from a myocutaneous flap, as repeated pressure on a skin grafted site can result in some breakdown.
