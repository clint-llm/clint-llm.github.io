The primary evaluation of the toxic diffuse goiter consists of a complete thyroid profile, including serum T3, T4, and TSH levels.

- The serum TSH is the best screening test for evaluating thyroid hormone excess or deficiency.

- In the case of diffuse toxic goiter, the above tests usually result in low or marginally low normal TSH levels with elevated peripheral serum thyroid hormone levels.

- Based on preferences in accordance with population characteristics, socioeconomic reasons, and cultural backgrounds, the modalities of evaluation of the cause of thyrotoxicosis can either be radioactive iodide uptake or a combination of thyroid ultrasound with TSH-receptor antibodies.

- A high radioactive iodine uptake diffusely depicts Graves disease, as does an enlarged gland with positive TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb).
