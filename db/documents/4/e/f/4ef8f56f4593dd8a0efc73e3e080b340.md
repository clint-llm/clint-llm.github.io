Spells resembling seizures stem from many different processes. One key differentiation is between a syncopal event and a seizure. Both events have an abrupt onset, but a syncopal event often has a provocative cause, the loss of consciousness is brief, and return to full consciousness is prompt without a confusional state. Incontinence may be present with either type of event. At times syncope is associated with motor movements mimicking a seizure.

Another distinction often involves distinguishing seizures from psychogenic nonepileptic seizures. Please see that chapter for further information.

A partial of seizure mimics follows:

- Syncope, convulsive syncope

- Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures

- Convulsive concussion

- Movement disorders

- Sleep-related movements

- Convulsive concussion
