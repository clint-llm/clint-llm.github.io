Acid-fast microscopy remains a valuable laboratory test for diagnosing and screening patients of active pulmonary tuberculosis. This technique is relatively inexpensive yet requires proper training and expertise. For middle- and low-income countries, acid-fast microscopy provides a cost-effective alternative to the expensive nucleic acid amplification tests. Furthermore, the infectivity of tuberculosis patients can also be assessed by this tool. Considering the high burden of tuberculosis and the need for a fast, safe, inexpensive, sensitive and specific diagnostic test, acid-fast microscopy, whether by fluorescence staining or carbolfuchsin staining, remains a standard of care.
