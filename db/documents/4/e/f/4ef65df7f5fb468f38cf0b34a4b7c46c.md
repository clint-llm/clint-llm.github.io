**Mechanism of catecholamine degradation:**

Please see the attached figure for a pictorial overview of the following steps:

Step 1: Deamination catalyzed by monoamine oxidase (MAO)

- Forms deaminated aldehyde intermediates.

- Dopamine converted to 3,4-dihydroxy phenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL)

- Norepinephrine and epinephrine both convert to 3,4-dihydroxy phenyl glycolaldehyde (DOPEGAL)

Step 2: Formation of alcohol or acid metabolites

- Two main enzymesÂ are aldehyde dehydrogenase (AD) and aldehyde reductase (AR)

- AD works to convert DOPAL to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and DOPEGAL to 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine (DHMA)

- AR works to convert DOPAL to 34-dihydroxy phenyl ethanol (DOPET) and DOPEGAL to 3,4-dihydroxy phenyl glycol (DHPG)

- Because dopamine and DOPAL both lack a beta-hydroxyl group, DOPAL will preferentially bind to AD, favoring DOPAC formation.

- Because epinephrine, norepinephrine, and DOPEGAL all have a beta-hydroxyl group, DOPEGAL will preferentially bind AR, favoring the formation of DHPG.

- In sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells, a third enzyme called aldose reductase also converts DOPEGAL to DHPG (not shown)

Step 3: O-methylation

- Catalyzed by catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT)

- Primary dopamine metabolite DOPAC is converted to homovanillic acid (HVA), which is the end-product of dopamine degradation.

- The primary metabolite of norepinephrine and epinephrine DHPG converted to vanylglycol (MHPG)

- Note: COMT can also convert norepinephrine to normetanephrine, which is converted to 3-hydroxy-4-hydroxyphenyl glycolaldehyde (MOPEGAL) by MAO (red pathway in the figure)

Step 4: Formation of vanillylmandelic acid (VMA)

- Catalyzed by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase

- MHPG converted to MOPEGAL (short-lived intermediate)

- MOPEGAL converted to VMA, end-product of epinephrine and norepinephrine degradation
