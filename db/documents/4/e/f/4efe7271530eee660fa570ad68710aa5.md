An accurate hearing evaluation is possible for the population of all ages, though there are specific limitations that are age- or cognition-related regarding formal audiometric evaluation that may complicate the picture. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics as well as the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, all infants should undergo a hearing evaluation to rule out any hearing impairment at birth or by the age of one month.

Hearing loss evaluation can differ according to the age of the child. BAER (brainstem audio-evoked response) test is the method for early diagnosis of hearing loss in newborns and infants. Otoacoustic emissions are also an option in newborns, and it is an easy, inexpensive technique, but they are less reliable than BAER tests. Finally, audiometry works with older children, aged 4 to 5 and older, who can respond to sound stimuli according to instructions. There are age-specific audiometric tests that can be performed. Young, pre-lingual children can be conditioned to respond to play stimuli that can assess whether they can hear. This method of testing is not ear-specific and can only confirm they have at least one ear that can hear at a given test level. This is important because as long as there is one ear that hears at a normal level, normal language development can be expected. Tympanograms and audiograms are of value in adults and children but provide information only regarding the mobility of the tympanic membrane.
