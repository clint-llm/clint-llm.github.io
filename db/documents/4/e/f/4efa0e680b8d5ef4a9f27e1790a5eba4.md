Reported complications of AGEP include bacterial superinfection of desquamating skin, hepatomegaly, lymphadenopathy, liver injury, kidney injury, hypocalcemia, pleural effusions, respiratory distress, agranulocytosis, and even multiorgan involvement. However, reporting bias and retrospective hospital patient data likely influence the reported frequencies.

One review of 340 AGEP cases in the United States found roughly 8% of patients had acute kidney insult as defined by serum creatinine 1.5 times their baseline, and 8.5% had elevated liver enzymes at least twice the upper limit of normal.Â In severe or atypical cases of AGEP refractory to supportive care and medication discontinuation alone, AGEP may mimic septic shock or clinically overlap with TEN or DRESS, with multiorgan involvement requiring additional treatment interventions. Complications are rare, and most cases resolve after stopping the offending medication.
