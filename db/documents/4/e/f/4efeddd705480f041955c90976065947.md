# Introduction

Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) presents as bilateral corneal opacification present at birth or in the immediate newborn period and is due to an autosomal recessive mutation affecting the corneal endothelium.

Opacification is the result of stromal edema and Descemet membrane thickening due to endothelial dysfunction.

# Etiology

In the recent past, congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy was classified in either of two categories: Autosomal dominant, progressive (CHED1), and Autosomal recessive, nonprogressive (CHED2). CHED1 is extremely rare, only found in five family pedigrees, and was later re-classified as a form of posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) after clinical, histopathological, and electron microscopy showed more consistency with PPCD.

The CHED mutation is due to an affected gene, SLC4A11, on chromosome 20p13.SLC4A11 codes for a transmembrane protein that acts as a bicarbonate transporter, actively countering the osmotic gradient by pumping fluid from the stroma into the aqueous humor.SLC4A11 in CHED most commonly result in a truncated BTR1 protein that is unable to reach the cellular membrane and perform appropriately.

The gene SLC4A11 is also expressed in fibrocytes of the inner ear and renal epithelium, suggesting possible comorbidities.SLC4A11 gene is not strictly related to CHED, as mutations can also result in Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) and Harboyan Syndrome.SLC4A11 mutation.SLC4A11 more often progress to Harboyan Syndrome.

Studies have found that CHED is associated with mutation heterogeneity, such that a variety of mutations in the SLC4A11 gene may result in the disease.SLC4A11, which suggests genetic heterogeneity.SLC4A11 mutation.  Instead, an MPDZ mutation was identified, which was similarly found in her mother, who had Fuchs Dystrophy.SLC4A11 promoter region in 20 families affected with CHED resulted in no pathogenic SLC4A11 variants.

In 2016, a novel variant of CHED was reported in a 45-year-old woman that resulted in delayed onset of the disease. She reported poor bilateral vision since childhood and rapid decline of vision the past 5-years. CHED was confirmed by slit-lamp examination, histopathology, genetic screening, and clinical correlation. Genetic testing confirmed new compound heterozygous mutations affecting the SLC4A11 gene.SLC4A11 may only mildly affect BTR function, resulting in delayed onset of CHED signs and symptoms.

**Risk Factors**

Family history positive for CHED and consanguineous parents increases a neonates’ risk of being born with the disease. It is recommended that families with children diagnosed with CHED be offered genetic counseling due to a 25% risk of recurring in future offspring.

# Epidemiology

An analysis published in 1998 analyzed 1,124,654 births in Spain and reported the incidence of congenital corneal opacities to be 3.11/100,000 newborns.

# Pathophysiology

Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy manifests in the neonatal period as corneal edema and opacification. Edema can result in 2 to 3 times the normal corneal thickness.SLC4A11 gene is active in corneal endothelium, and codes for bicarbonate transporter-related protein-1 (BTR1) that acts as a sodium-borate cotransporter to relieve excess water from the stroma. In CHED, BTR-1 is dysfunctional and often fails to reach the plasma membrane to perform its purpose.

# History and Physical

For a young patient with corneal opacification, the onset of symptoms and family history should be elicited from the patient’s family. In older untreated children, it is essential to discuss the timing of onset, as well as the progression of symptoms of reduced vision, amblyopia, nystagmus, and possible hearing loss.

# Evaluation

Endothelial function and permeability can be further assessed by the fluoro-photometrical method.

Audiometric monitoring should also be considered due to the possibility of Harboyan syndrome, a form of congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy associated with sensorineural hearing loss. Hearing deficit is not usually found until 10 to 25 years old, and there have been no reported cases of prelingual deafness.SLC4A11.

# Treatment / Management

The definitive treatment for congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy is currently surgical, either by penetrating keratoplasty (PK) or endothelial keratoplasty (EK). PK is a full-thickness graft and has traditionally been the mainstay of treatment.

PK is technically challenging in the pediatric population, both operatively and postoperatively.

DSAEK grafting, where only the endothelium and part of the posterior stroma are transplanted, has proven to be a viable alternative to PK in CHED. Studies suggest improvement in clinical outcomes without significant complications.

However, DSAEK is not without complications. Children have a clear crystallin lens, a smaller anterior chamber, and increased difficulty to identify and strip the Descemet’s membrane, especially in infants.

Descemet’s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) is an alternative EK procedure. The graft is prepared by manually stripping the Descemet’s membrane with fine tweezers from the donor cornea.

Some exciting studies have suggested that SLC4A11 mutations that result in impaired-folding of the BTR-1 protein being retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can be corrected nonsurgically with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS).SLC4A11 cell surface functional activity.SLC4A11.SLC4A11 mutation results in misfolded proteins that are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. This is a promising treatment since the majority of CHED cases are associated with retained-ER proteins.

# Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for pediatric corneal opacities is broad, and a classification system can aid the organization of the diseases. One method is via the mnemonic **STUMPED**:**S**clerocornea,**T**ears in Descemet's membrane,**U**lcers,**M**etabolic,**P**eters anomaly,**E**ndothelial dystrophy,**D**ermoid.

**Sclerocornea**

A congenital disorder resulting in poor development of the anterior chamber presents with peripheral corneal opacity resembling sclera. The central cornea is often spared.

**Tears in Descemet's Membrane**

This most commonly is caused by birth trauma associated with forceps assisted delivery and presents with clouding and edema due to the rupture of Descemet's membrane. Linear and vertical Haab striae (breaks in the Descemet's membrane) may be identified.

Congenital glaucoma can present at birth as corneal clouding with elevated IOP. It is essential to identify markers for congenital glaucoma such as buphthalmos, optic disk cupping, curvilinear Haab's striae oriented horizontally, and concentric to the limbus, and enlarged corneal diameter.

**Ulcers**

The presence of corneal ulceration should increase suspicion for an infectious cause. Common infections include herpes simplex keratitis and bacterial keratitis.

**Metabolic**

Mucopolysaccharidoses, cystinosis, and mucolipidosis IV should be considered. Mucopolysaccharidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder that can result in corneal clouding within the first year of life due to the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans.

**Peters Anomaly**

This is identified by centralized vascular corneal opacity due to the failure of the cornea to separate from the iris and lens.

**Endothelial Dystrophy**

CHED is distinguished from other corneal opacities as diffuse, nonbullous edema with corneal opacification ranging from blue-gray to complete opacity. Opacification remains consistent over time. Due to thickened corneas, intraocular pressure measurements may be artifactually elevated.

Posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD) is autosomal dominant and widely variable in presentation.

Congenital hereditary stromal dystrophy (CHSD) in an autosomal dominant disorder that presents as diffuse corneal opacity with a central flaky appearance in the stroma and is nonprogressive from birth.

**Dermoid**

Dermoids are choriostomas that present near the limbus and may obstruct the visual axis. Size can vary, but large dermoids often affect vision and require surgery to prevent amblyopia.

# Prognosis

Prognosis is determined by a multitude of factors, including disease severity, age at treatment, and existing comorbidities. Surgery performed at an earlier age avoids amblyopia and allows for earlier visual rehabilitation for improved visual development, but is associated with increased risk for surgical complications.

# Complications

Untreated congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy can result in poor visual development and occlusive amblyopia. Although the risk of developing amblyopia decreases the younger a child is treated, earlier interventions are associated with increased risk of graft dehiscence, suture induced amblyopia, and increased exposure to anesthesia.

Astigmatism is a significant risk with corneal grafting. The risk for astigmatism is highest in PK procedures and can sometimes be severe enough to result in amblyopia.

Lens trauma during EK grafting is possible due to a child’s clear, crystalline lens. Trauma can result in the development of an iatrogenic cataract. One method used to protect the lens during EK is with pilocarpine, a cholinergic agonist, which induces miosis.

# Deterrence and Patient Education

Due to the genetic inheritance of CHED, it is recommended that patients with a positive family history be offered genetic counseling.

# Pearls and Other Issues

- Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder causing endothelial dysfunction resulting in corneal opacification.

- Pathognomonic findings include bilateral, symmetric corneal opacification presenting in the immediate neonatal period with increased corneal thickness, corneal edema, and thickening of the Descemet’s membrane.

- Current treatment requires grafting, either by PK or EK. DSAEK is associated with decreased postoperative complications and faster corneal recovery.

- New studies have shown certain Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatories such as glafenine, diclofenac, and nepafenac, to be highly effective at restoring water-flux activity in certain mutational types of patients with CHED and are promising potential treatments

- Early treatment avoids amblyopia but may increase surgical risk and postoperative complications.
