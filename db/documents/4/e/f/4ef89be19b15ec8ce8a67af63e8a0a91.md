Clinical manifestations of annular pancreasÂ can occur at any age, from infancy to adulthood, and considering its bimodal age distribution, it precisely depends on the age of presentation and the degree of duodenal constriction.

Many infants with AP also have various other associated congenital anomalies such as malrotation, tracheoesophageal fistula, esophageal atresia, duodenal atresia, renal anomalies, duodenal diverticulum, pancreas divisum, biliary atresia, anorectal malformations, and congenital heart disease.
