Patient education is important for patients with a history of one or more dislocations. Redislocation can result in further chondral damage, bone loss, and disruption of soft tissue stabilizers. Avoidance of positions that place the joint at risk should be avoided, including extreme abduction and external rotation. Younger patients and athletes should be counseled on their particular risk for redislocation.
