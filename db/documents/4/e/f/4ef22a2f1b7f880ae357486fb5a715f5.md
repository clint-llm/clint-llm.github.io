Complications from surgery are typically minor and not directly related to the surgery itself. It is estimated that the overall 30-day mortality rate associated with antireflux surgery is 0.19%. Complications that are specific to antireflux surgery include the following:

- Pneumothorax: This is the most common intraoperative complication. However, this is reported to occur in less than 2% of patients.

- Gastric and esophageal injuries: Reported to occur in approximately 1% of patients undergoing Nissen fundoplication.

- Splenic and liver injuries: This can result in bleeding and occurs in about 2.3% of patients. Major injury is rare.

- Dysphasia: This typically resolves without further intervention and is most commonly caused by postoperative edema.
