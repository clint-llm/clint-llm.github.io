Ocular or retinal migraines are generally defined as a transient monocular scotoma or loss of vision that is accompanied or followed by a headache within 60 minutes of visual symptoms onset. In some cases, persistent monocular visual loss and abnormal ophthalmological findings have been reported. The symptoms are usually transient, and the pathophysiology of those persistent deficits is not clear. This activity reviews the evaluation and management of retinal migraines and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in caring for affected patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the epidemiology of retinal migraines. 
- Explain how to properly evaluate for retinal migraines.
- Review the treatment and management options available for retinal migraines.
- Desribe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance care for patients with retinal migraines and improve outcomes.
