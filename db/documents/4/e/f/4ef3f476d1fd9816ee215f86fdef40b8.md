The patient should be seen in a private area to allow for digital manipulation. An abdominal exam is to be performed to look for a rebound, guarding, or a rigid abdomen. If there are peritoneal signs present, patients will require large-bore intravenous access for fluid resuscitation and laboratory studies, including blood count, electrolytes, coagulation panel, and type and screen. The clinician may consider sending a lactic acid if the patient appears septic. In this case, wide-spectrum antibiotics should be administered, which include 3rd generation cephalosporins and metronidazole. An upright chest x-ray may ascertain the presence of free air, which could indicate that perforation has occurred. An abdominal x-ray can be obtained to identify and confirm the presence of a RFB if the object is radio-opaque. Adequate analgesia and possible sedation medications should be available to facilitate manual removal if needed. A conversation about the risks and benefits of the procedures to be performed should occur with the patient to obtain informed patient consent.
