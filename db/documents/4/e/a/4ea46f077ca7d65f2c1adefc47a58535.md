First isolated in 1982, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157: H7 has become an important food and waterborne pathogen that causes diarrhea, hemorrhagic colitis, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) in humans. An enterohemorrhagic bacterial strain, E. coli O157: H7 infects the alimentary tract and induces abdominal cramps with hemorrhagic diarrhea. Transmission of E. coli O157: H7 occurs via the fecal-oral route after consumption of contaminated, undercooked liquids and foods. Alternatively, E. coli 0157: H7 can be transmitted by person-to-person through fecal shedding and accounts for an estimated 11% of infections. The production of Shiga toxins is a key factor contributing to the development of HUS. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157: H7 induces illness secondary to its production of Shiga toxin that causes a range of gastrointestinal illnesses, from watery diarrhea to hemorrhagic colitis. E. coli 0157: H7 induces enterohemorrhagic disease that can cause systemic illness by hemolytic uremic syndrome, which manifests as hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure. HUS can result in both acute, potentially life-threatening illness and lifelong, chronic illness.
