Lactational mastitis usually develops after a period of incomplete drainage and milk stasis. It is important to educate patients on ways to limit this stasis to prevent mastitis. Things to discuss may include the appropriate frequency of feeding and proper infant latching technique. Nipple pain is a common complaint in breastfeeding women and may lead to less frequent nursing. This increases milk stasis, thus increasing their risk of developing mastitis. It is important to counsel patients on ways to manage and decrease their pain. Patients with lactational mastitis may feel inclined to stop breastfeeding during their period of illness, possibly due to a combination of the discomfort and pain, as well as the concern of passing the infection to their infant. Providers should ensure the patient that breastfeeding with mastitis is safe and that they should continue to do so if desired.

In addition to patient education, provider education is equally important. One small study showed that some providers are misinforming patients with mastitis that they must stop breastfeeding while infected.

Periductal mastitis is found almost exclusively in smokers. Encouraging smoking cessation is important and may help reduce the risk of recurrent inflammation.
