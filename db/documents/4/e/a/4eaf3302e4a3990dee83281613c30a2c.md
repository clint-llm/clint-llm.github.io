Myopia is the fastest-growing refractive error, and it is expected that by 2030 almost half of the world's population will be suffering from myopia. Childhood myopia is a major challenge faced by ophthalmologists. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of myopia will aid in finding new ways to prevent its progression. Various theories have been proposed for myopia progression. A disproportionate increase in the axial length of the eyeball during the phase of ocular development is one of the most accepted theories of myopia. Patients with pathological myopia risk developing various retinal complications, including retinal detachment, staphyloma formation, and chorioretinal degeneration. This activity describes the pathogenesis of childhood myopia and its relation to ocular development. The article highlights the interprofessional team's role in managing childhood myopia patients.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiopathogenesis and epidemiology of childhood myopia and its relation to ocular development.
- Describe the clinical evaluation process for childhood myopia.
- Explain the pharmaceutical management and other treatment options available for childhood myopia.
- Review the prognosis and complications of childhood myopia and the role of interprofessional collaboration in preventing and managing childhood myopia.
