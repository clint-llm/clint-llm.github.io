The diagnosis and management of game keeper's thumb is complex; it is also associated with high morbidity if not appropriately treated. The condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a hand surgeon, emergency department physician, orthopedic surgeon, orthopedic nurse, and physical therapist. Patients who ski and use the thumb frequently in certain occupations should be educated that if the thumb is injured, it is important to seek treatment early. If the UCL is torn is displaced, surgery is necessary. Unfortunately, even after surgery good outcomes are not assured. All patients need extensive rehabilitation. Recovery is often prolonged and chronic pain is common.
