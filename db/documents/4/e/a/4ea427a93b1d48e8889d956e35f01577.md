All members of the dental team have a responsibility to ensure patient safety. The operator and dental assistant should ensure that the anesthetic solution has not expired and the maximum dose is not exceeded.

The dental team members must be aware of the risk of toxicity and understand how to prevent, identify, and manage toxicity. All team members must also be able to recognize and address any medical emergencies that may occur during or after the administration of local anesthesia. Dental assistants can also play a key role in patient care, for example, by providing reassurance to anxious patients. All team members must work together to deliver patient-centered care to ensure good patient outcomes.
