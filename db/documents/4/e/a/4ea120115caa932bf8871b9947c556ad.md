No definite cause of hyperopia is identified to date. Genetic predisposition, along with family history, plays an important role. Asthenopic symptoms must be emphasized and evaluated in children. Hyperopic children are usually less intelligent compared to myopic. Their social, mental, and educational development depends upon their vision.

The commonest treatment option is rehabilitation with glasses. Regular follow-ups with cycloplegic refraction are mandatory. Adult hyperopic should be treated with glasses or cataract surgery if the cataract is the cause. Unilateral/bilateral aphakia should be treated with amblyopia therapy with glasses or contact lenses immediately followed by intraocular lens implantation.
