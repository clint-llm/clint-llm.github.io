The surface of the human retina contains about 6 million cones and 100 million rods. Cones transmit color information; rods focus on greater sensitivity to low-light conditions. The fovea is the center of the retina and predominately concentrated with cones to accommodate high visual acuity in high light conditions. Photon-powered isomerization of rhodopsin, a complex consisting of vitamin-A derived retinal, and the protein opsin is the molecular mechanism of action for retina cells (photoreceptors).
