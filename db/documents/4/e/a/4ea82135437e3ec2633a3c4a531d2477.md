Placental insufficiency is a condition whereby there is a failure of placental vascular remodeling, leading to a failure of placentation resulting in acidosis and fetal hypoxemia. The most common downstream fetal consequences of this condition include intrauterine growth restriction, prematurity, or, unfortunately, fetal demise. In order to reduce the risk of fetal morbidity and mortality, especially in high-risk pregnancies, regular prenatal screening with Doppler ultrasound should be done to increase the chances of detection and diagnosis. This activity reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, and potential treatments of placental insufficiency, and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Review the risk factors associated with placental insufficiency.
- Describe the typical imaging findings on Doppler ultrasound associated with placental insufficiency.
- Identify the most common adverse events associated with placental insufficiency.
