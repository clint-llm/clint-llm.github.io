The principal etiology of TTTS is an increased number of arteriovenous anastomoses deep in the placenta; these are capillary connections that occur in the cotyledon portion of the placenta. Unidirectional flow can occur in these AV anastomoses and result in shunting of blood towards one twin and away from the other when the AV anastomoses are unbalanced. Arterioarterial anastomoses and venovenous anastomoses can have bidirectional flow and are found more superficially on the placenta. AA anastomoses are thought to be protective against TTTS and are decreased in twin gestations with TTTS. MCMA twins are thought to have more AA anastomoses, which is a theoretical reason why rates are lower in these twins than MCDA twins.

The hypovolemia experienced by one twin causes renal hypoperfusion, which stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in that twin. This leads to oliguria and oligohydramnios. The hypervolemia experienced by the other twin causes cardiac stretch, which increases atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide release in that twin. This inhibits the RAAS and leads to polyuria and polyhydramnios.
