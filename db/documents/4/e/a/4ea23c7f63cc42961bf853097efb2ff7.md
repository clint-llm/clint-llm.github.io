Bertolotti syndrome is congenital. Therefore patients have no choice on whether they have a transitional vertebra or whether that vertebra will cause pain in the future. Although deterrence is not possible, early and frequent patient education may help patients avoid the sequelae of chronic pain. That is why the early and accurate diagnosis of this condition is critical.

Patients should be informed of any abnormal connections or anatomy within the spine as soon as it is identified and should be counseled on how that may affect their mobility and quality of life. Patients should also be counseled on the importance of maintaining their activity level and be given resources on preventative stretching and therapy to try and decrease any muscular strain secondary to the abnormal vertebral connection.
