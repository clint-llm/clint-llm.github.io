The main consequence of undiagnosed or untreated rectus hematomas is pain. In addition to pain, severe bleeding is serious and can be life-threatening. Therefore severe bleeding should be promptly identified and aggressively treated. Another potential complication is abscess formation. As in any blood collection that is not drained, there is always a chance of superseding infection and the development of an abscess. Draining of abscess becomes mandatory when it develops.
