Amphetamines belong to a class of CNS stimulants called phenethylamines. Amphetamines contain a methyl group to the alpha position on its carbon chain resulting in lipophilicity, increasing its volume of distribution, and CNS stimulation. Amphetamines block monoamine reuptake transport systems resulting in high synaptic concentrations. Amphetamines are also indirect neurotransmitters leading to increased cytosolic levels of monoamines. It is theorized the excess dopamine in the cytosol leads to drug craving and seeking and psychiatric symptoms. These two processes lead to both alpha and beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation, causing sympathomimetic symptoms (hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia, vasoconstriction, and diaphoresis). Amphetamines are metabolized via the cytochrome CYP2D6 pathway and renally and hepatically excreted.
