Intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring (IONM) is recommended for individuals at increased risk of neurological injury during surgical procedures. The following are the indications for IONM.

**Somatosensory Evoked Potential (SSEP) or Motor Evoked Potential (MEP)**

- Spine and spinal cord surgery including scoliosis and Kyphosis correction with instrumentation, spinal cord decompression/stabilization, anterior and posterior spinal fusions (cervical, thoracic, and thoracolumbar), the release of tethered cord, correction of spina bifida, resection of the tumor, cyst, aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation of the spinal cord

- Brain and brain stem surgeries including craniotomy for tumor removal, craniotomy for aneurysm repair, arteriovenous malformation repair, localization of cortex during craniotomy, thalamotomy

- Cerebrovascular surgery, including clipping of intracranial aneurysms, interventional neuroradiology

- Stereotactic surgery on the brain stem, thalamus, and cerebral cortex

- Pelvic fracture surgery

- Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair

- Repair of coarctation of the aorta

- Brachial plexus and lumbosacral plexus surgery

- Peripheral nerve repair

- Carotid endarterectomy

- Thyroid surgery

**Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potential (BAEP)**

- Acoustic neuroma resection

- Vestibular nerve section

- Vascular loop decompression

- Vestibular schwannomas

- Facial nerve decompression

- Brainstem tumor resection

- Auditory brainstem implant

- Posterior fossa procedures

- Functional localization of the cortex with direct cortical stimulation

- Assess auditory pathways within the brainstem

- Assess ischemia at the cochlea and eighth nerve

**Visual Evoked Potentials or Response (VEP):**

- Monitoring the visual system during optic nerve surgery

- Orbital surgery

- Pituitary gland surgery

**Electroencephalogram (EEG):**

- Carotid endarterectomy

- Cerebral aneurysm clipping

- Epilepsy surgery

- Monitoring depth of anesthesia

**Electromyography (EMG)**

- To monitor cranial nerve function during procedures including acoustic neuroma resection, microvascular decompression of the facial nerve, parotid tumor resection, vestibular neurectomy for Meniere disease, neurotologic/otologic procedures.

- Nerve root or spinal cord monitoring during spinal surgeries including spinal instrumentation (e.g., pedicle screw placement), a mechanical spinal distraction

- Resection of skull base tumors, spinal tumors

- Surgical excision of cranial nerve neuromas of motor cranial nerve

- Brachial or lumbosacral plexus surgery

- Neck surgery including thyroid surgery, neck dissections
