The normal physiology of the small intestine consists of the digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients. The large bowel continues to aid in digestion and is responsible for vitamin synthesis, water absorption, and bilirubin breakdown. Any obstructive mechanism will hinder these physiologic components. Obstruction causes dilation of the bowel proximal to the transition point and collapses distally. A result of partial or complete blockage of digested products during obstruction is emesis. Frequent emesis can lead to fluid deficits and electrolyte abnormalities. As the condition is left untreated and worsens, a bowel wall edema forms, and third-spacing begins. A serious and life-threatening complication of bowel obstruction is strangulation. Strangulation is more commonly seen in closed-loop obstructions. If the strangulated bowel is not treated promptly, it eventually becomes ischemic, and tissue infarction occurs. Tissue infarction progresses to bowel necrosis, perforation, and sepsis/septic shock.
