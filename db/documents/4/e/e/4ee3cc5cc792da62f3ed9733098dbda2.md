Phototherapy is delivered by different types of equipment such as whole-body cabins, small panel radiators, whole body panels, and point sources for narrowband UVB. Whole-body cabins contain 1800 mm long fluorescent tubes that line the walls in front of reflective metal surfaces, which enable them to achieve greater dose uniformity and greater treatment efficiency.Â Small panel irradiators are used for the treatment of palmar and plantar skin.

Point source devices usually avoid unnecessary irradiation of unaffected skin, but care is needed to avoid under-or overdosing at overlap areas. Calibration and dosimetry are done by dose calculation and designated patient irradiance, and these values are important for the determination of irradiation by UV unit at regular intervals. The mean UV irradiance in whole body cabinet to which a patient is exposed is called designated patient irradiance(DPI), and the irradiance is measured at 12 sites of the body at posterior, anterior, and both lateral positions.
