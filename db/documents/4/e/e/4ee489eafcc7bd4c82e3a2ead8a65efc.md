**Case Management**

The widely accepted definition of case management by accrediting bodies such as Case Manager Certification (CCMC) is " A collaborative process which evaluates, plans, implements, coordinates, monitors, and assesses the options and services required to meet an individual's health needs, using communication and available resources to promote quality, cost-effective outcomes." The central concept of case management is all cases do not require a continuum of care or high demand for medical services. Only a small portion of patients was chronically ill and needed continuous monitoring and care coordination, but they utilized the most servicesÂ resulting in considerable healthcare costs. The care management team's key role is to identify and track those complex cases, which usually slip through the cracks in the healthcare delivery system because of the requirement of care from various departments and different levels of care as well. High frequency of admissions in a short period and longer LOS after surgical hospitalization with multiple complications are few examples where case managers need to be competent in clinical knowledge and play a key role in curtailing costs of utilizing expensive medical services. Some examples of complex cases include preterm delivery, a CVA suffered by a teenager, a spinal cord injury, etc.
