Acute or insidious onset of double vision with tilting of images or images separated vertically can be a symptom of trochlear nerve palsy. Patients should be encouraged to seek a strabismology opinion when faced with such issues. The symptoms of trochlear nerve palsy, in most, cases can be managed medically/surgically. An extensive neurological workup might be needed in selected cases.
