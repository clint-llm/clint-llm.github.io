Many histopathological findings in FA have been confirmed and described since the original publication in 1863:

- Loss of myelinated fibers of the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts on the spinal cord

- Compact fibrillary gliosis without inflammatory cells within dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts

- Degeneration and death of fibers of the dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts

- Shrinkage of dorsal columns and corticospinal tracts with capsular cell proliferation

- Absence of large myelinated fibers in posterior roots

- A decrease in myelinated axons in peripheral nerves

- Neuronal destruction with atrophy of dorsal root ganglion

- Hypoplasia of dorsal root ganglion

- Degeneration and loss of cells of the Clarke column in the thoracic spinal cord

- Progressive atrophy of large neurons of the dentate nucleus

- Patchy loss of Purkinje cells in the superior vermis of the cerebellum

- Neuronal loss in the inferior olivary, pontine and medullary nuclei

- Neuronal loss in the optic tracts

- Lack of Betz cells in the motor cortex
