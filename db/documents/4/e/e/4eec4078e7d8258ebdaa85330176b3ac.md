All women 65 years and older and men 70 years and older should be screened for asymptomatic osteoporosis.

Women younger than 65 years old at risk for osteoporosis:

- Estrogen deficiency

- History of maternal hip fracture before the age of 50

- Low body mass (less than 127 pounds)

- History of amenorrhea more than 1 years before the age of 42

Women younger than 65 years old or men younger than 70 years old with the following risk factors:

- Current cigarette smoker

- Loss of height

- Thoracic Kyphosis

Also recommended for screening:

Individuals at any age with bone mass osteopenia or fragility fractures on imaging studies, individuals 50 years and older who develop wrist, hip, spine, or proximal humerus fracture with minimal or no trauma, excluding pathologic fractures.

People of any age who develop one or more insufficiency fractures.

Individuals receiving (or expected to receive) glucocorticoid therapy equivalent to > or = to 5mg of prednisone or equivalent per day for > or = 3 months.

Individuals considering pharmacologic therapy for osteoporosis.

Hypogonadal men 18 years and older and men with surgically or chemotherapeutically induced castration.

Individuals beginning or receiving long-term therapy with medications known to affect BMD adversely:

- Anticonvulsants

- Androgen deprivation therapy

- Aromatase inhibitor therapy

- Chronic heparin

Individuals with an endocrine disorder known to affect BMD adversely:

- Hyperparathyroidism

- Hyperthyroidism

- Cushing’s syndrome

Individuals with medical conditions that could alter BMD:

- Chronic renal failure

- Rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides

- Eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa and bulimia

- Organ transplantation

- Prolonged immobilization

- Conditions associated with secondary osteoporosis, such as gastrointestinal malabsorption or malnutrition, sprue, osteomalacia, vitamin D deficiency, endometriosis, acromegaly, chronic alcoholism or established cirrhosis, and multiple myeloma

- Individuals who have had a gastric bypass for obesity (The accuracy of DEXA in these patients might be affected by obesity)

Individuals monitored for:

- Assess the effectiveness of osteoporosis drug therapy

- Follow-up medical conditions associated with abnormal BMD.

Children or adolescents with medical conditions associated with abnormal BMD including but not limited to:

- Individuals receiving (or expected to receive) glucocorticoid therapy for more than 3 months

- Individuals receiving radiation or chemotherapy for malignancies

- Individuals with an endocrine disorder known to adversely affect BMD (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, growth hormone deficiency, or Cushing’s syndrome)

- Individuals with bone dysplasias known to have excessive fracture risk (osteogenesis imperfecta, osteopetrosis) or high bone density

- Individuals with medical conditions that could change BMD, for example:

- Chronic renal failure

- Rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides

- Eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa and bulimia

- Organ transplantation

-  Prolonged immobilization

-  Conditions associated with secondary osteoporosis, such as gastrointestinal malabsorption, sprue, inflammatory bowel disease, malnutrition, osteomalacia, vitamin D deficiency, acromegaly, cirrhosis, HIV infection, prolonged exposure to fluorides

DEXA may be indicated in the diagnosis, staging, and follow-up of individuals with conditions that result in pathologically increased BMD, such as osteopetrosis or prolonged exposure to fluoride.

DEXA may be indicated as a tool to measure regional and whole-body fat and lean mass (patients with malabsorption, cancer, or eating disorders).
