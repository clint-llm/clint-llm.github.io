**Maternal Evaluation**

Maternal hyperglycemia has been a significant cause of fetal macrosomia and should be screened for by the following:

-  One-hour 50-gram glucose challenge test at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation-values higher than 140 mg/dL is considered abnormal.

-  Confirmatory testing is with the 3-hour 100 gram glucose tolerance test.

Gestational diabetes is confirmed when any two readings shown below are abnormal.

Fasting glucose greater than 95 mg/dL

-  Glucose level after one hour greater than 180 mg/dL

-  Glucose level after two hours greater than 155 mg/dL

-  Glucose level after three hours greater than 140 mg/dL

Other maternal evaluations should include:

-  Blood pressure monitoring to rule out pre-eclampsia

-  Complete blood count (CBC)

-  Urinalysis

-  BUN

-  Creatinine

-  Lipid profile

-  Liver function tests (LFT)

-  Routine fetal imagine studies with abdominal ultrasound

**Fetal Evaluation**

Macrosomic fetuses are at risk of various metabolic derangements and should be monitored closely. Laboratory measurements of the following electrolytes should be taken immediately after delivery.

- Glucose levels: with the sudden withdrawal of the glucose-rich in utero environment, neonates born to diabetic mothers are prone to hypoglycemia.

- Calcium levels: hypocalcemia and tetany can occur.

- Magnesium levels: hypomagnesemia can also occur

- Bilirubin levels: this may occur as a result of inefficient enterohepatic circulation and increased hemolysis if polycythemia also exists.

- Complete blood count: it is necessary to check for polycythemia.

Clinical evaluation of the neonate’s respiratory effort after birth is also essential as meconium aspiration due to fetal distress and transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) are common and tend to occur two to three times more frequently in macrocosmic babies, especially if secondary to gestational diabetes.
