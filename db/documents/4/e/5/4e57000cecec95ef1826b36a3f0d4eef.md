In most cases, there is a prior history of head trauma, brain tumor, or a space-occupying lesion. Often, there is altered sensorium ranging from confusion to comatose state due to underlying transtentorial herniation and consequent perturbation of the reticular activating system. There is anisocoria due to the involvement of the ipsilateral third cranial nerve with contralateral weakness.

In some cases, ipsilateral weakness can present due to the “Kernohan notch” phenomenon, which is an indentation of the cerebral peduncle on the contralateral side against the tentorium cerebelli.
