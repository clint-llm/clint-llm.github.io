**Thoracic Wall**

The thoracic wall is formed by 12 ribs, 12 thoracic vertebrae, cartilage, sternum, and five muscles.

The thoracic vertebral bodies and intervertebral discs make the posterior thoracic wall.

From superficial to deep, muscles of the thoracic wall are the external intercostal, internal intercostal, innermost intercostal, subcostalis (posteriorly), and transversus thoracis muscle (anteriorly).

Breast tissue is present over the anterior thoracic wall superficial to the pectoralis major muscle.

**Thoracic Cavity**

The thoracic cavity is found deep to the thoracic wall, superior to the diaphragm, and inferior to the root of the neck (thoracic aperture).

The thoracic cavity can typically be divided into well-established compartments.

A horizontal plane (also known as the thoracic plane) through the angle of the sternum (the junction of the manubrium and the body of the sternum) crossing the T4-T5 vertebral junction divides the superior and inferior mediastinum.

Gross contents of each mediastinal compartment are as follows:

- Pleural cavities - lungs and pleura

- Superior mediastinum - great vessels, trachea, esophagus, vagus nerve, phrenic nerve, sympathetic nerves, thoracic lymphatic duct, thymus

- Anterior mediastinum - connective tissue, thymus, and lymph nodes

- Middle mediastinum - heart, roots of great vessels, phrenic nerve, and pericardium

- Posterior mediastinum - descending aorta, azygos veins, esophagus, vagus nerve, sympathetic nerves, bronchi, and thoracic lymphatic duct
