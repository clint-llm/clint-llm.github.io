There are two main points of focus in planning a strategy for improving health care outcomes. The first being systematic documentation and maintenance of registers of acute rheumatic fever, and the second being the availability of clinical expertise and high-quality therapeutic aids of benzathine penicillin at all levels of the health care system. The primary care physicians should not ignore the skin lesions in patients presenting with a sore throat, fever, and joint pain and should seek the advice of a dermatologist for the same. Although a clinical diagnosis, a skin biopsy may sometimes be required to rule out other differential diagnoses.

In patients with C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency or hereditary angioedema, erythema marginatum is commonly confused with acute urticaria leading to a common misdiagnosis of anaphylaxis. Hence prompt recognition of erythema marginatum can reduce the mortality associated with hereditary angioedema.
