**United States**

Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia is a common abnormality, usually due to hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; moreover, it may be observed in systemic illnesses with hepatic involvement. As conjugated hyperbilirubinemia may result from secondary causes, the epidemiology will correlate with the specific disease state.

**International**

In certain countries, parasitic infections like clonorchiasis and ascariasis can cause biliary obstruction. Certain infections like malaria can also lead to hemolytic anemia with increased indirect bilirubin and causing pigment gallstones resulting in cholestasis.

**Demographics**

Demographic distribution varies by disease state, causing conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; age, sex, and racial differences are unique for each underlying disease process. Nonetheless, children may experience distinct causes of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, including but not limited to, biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis. The diagnosis of Wilson disease needs to be considered when there is a liver disease associated with neurological signs in a young adult.
