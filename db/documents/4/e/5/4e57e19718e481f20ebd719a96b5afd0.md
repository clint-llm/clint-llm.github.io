A patient who presents with a headache, vomiting, and blurred vision should be evaluated for neurologic deficits and receive head imaging to rule out the causes of intracranial hypertension.

All patients with severe TBI (Glasgow comaÂ scale of 3 to 8 on initial presentation) should follow the latest guidelines on the management of severe TBI that includes monitoring of ICP, maintenance of CPP greater than 60 to 70 mm Hg for adults, and treatment of ICP greater than 22 mm Hg.
