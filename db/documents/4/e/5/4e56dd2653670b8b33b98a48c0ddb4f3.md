The stylohyoid muscle is nearly horizontal in children. However, its shape and length change with age; thus, the course of the stylohyoid muscle becomes more vertical in adults.

The stylohyoid muscle can be palpated by placing the fingers along the direction of the muscle fiber under the chin and superiorly to the hyoid bone. Palpation is done laterally from the hyoid bone towards the ear lobe along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. At the same time, the patient is asked to swallow or place the tongue against the mouth roof, pushing against it.
