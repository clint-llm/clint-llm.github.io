Several disorders and environmental substances can influence the corneal blink reflex by altering the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve within the cornea. Glaucoma, for example, is a disorder that induces increased pressure in the eye. As this disorder progresses, trigeminal nerves in the cornea bend. These bends correlate with progressive ocular symptomology and decreased corneal blink reflex sensitivity.

Diabetes is another disorder that impacts corneal health, resulting in peripheral neuropathy in many patients. The unmyelinated C fibers and small A-gamma nerve fibers are most commonly affected. Research has shown that as the disease progresses, there are decreases in the density of nerve plexuses, decreased nerve branching, and increases in bending of the nerve fibers.

A disorder that influences the tear production circuits is Bogorad’s syndrome, “Crocodile tears syndrome.” This syndrome is resultant from improper connections that form during nerve regeneration in patients recovering from Bell’s palsy (i.e., damage to the facial nerve, VII). During recovery, efferent fibers from the superior salivary nucleus synapse with parasympathetic fibers of the facial nerve. This causes the patient to produce tears during salivation (e.g., when smelling or eating foods).
