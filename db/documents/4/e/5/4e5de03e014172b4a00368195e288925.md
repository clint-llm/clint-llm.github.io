While an array of more elaborate and expensive technologies for the diagnosis of chest diseases has emerged over time, auscultation of the lung still provides valuable, immediate and low-cost information to the experienced clinician. Lung sounds can be divided primarily into continuous sounds "wheezes," and interrupted (discontinuous) sounds Â "crackles." Wheezes are musical, and crackles are not. No lung sound is pathognomonic for any specific disease or anatomical site.

A good mnemonic to aid in the memorization of the lung exam steps is PIPPA:

- Positioning of the patient

- Inspection

- Palpation

- Percussion

- Auscultation
