Since ritonavir is a potent CYP450-3A4 inhibitor, clinicians must be cautious when adding it to a patient's regimen with multiple comorbidities and medications. Dosing, patient education, and subsequent monitoring should be the purview of an interprofessional healthcare team that includes clinicians (MDs and DOs), mid-level practitioners (NPs and PAs), nurses, and pharmacists. For instance, cobicistat and ritonavir are both used as pharmacokinetic boosters with similar inhibition of CYP450-3A4. However, in the presence of inducers such as rifamycin or anti-convulsants, the inhibition of CYP450-3A4 is markedly different.

In addition to standard drug monitoring for a particular regimen by the primary care provider/nurse practitioner, dose adjustment or additional monitoring might be necessary if a drug-drug interaction is suspected. The oncology pharmacist should assist the team in review and management.
