Patients typically present with persistent microscopic hematuria before the age of ten years. This is due to the defective glomerular basement membrane (GBM) permitting the passage of red blood cells.

Renal biopsy is indicated in the setting of abnormal UA, presence of acanthocytes, red blood cell casts, or abnormal renal indices. Any patient with suspected Alport syndrome should be referred to otorhinolaryngology for the evaluation of high-frequency hearing loss and ophthalmology for the eye examination. Due to the defective collagen, the lens lacks the integrity to maintain the normal shape leading to the anterior lenticonus into the anterior chamber.

Genetic testing can help establish the diagnosis and determine the inheritance pattern of an individual and their family members. Molecular genetic testing is non-invasive, accurate, and gives the prognosis as the underlying mutation can be revealed. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analyses of COL4A3, COL4A4, and COL4A5 are recommended in patients with no family history of Alport syndrome.

Patients without the characteristic GBM splitting can be identified by immunostaining the type 4 collagen of the alpha-3, alpha-4, and alpha-5 chains of the GBM. A less invasive procedure, a skin biopsy can be performed on a child with suspected XLAS using a monoclonal antibody against the alpha-5 of the type 4 collagen chain.
