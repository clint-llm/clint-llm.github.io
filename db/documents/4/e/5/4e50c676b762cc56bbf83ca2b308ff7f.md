There areÂ three common sites for the insertion of a CVC: the internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, and femoral vein. Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages. The common features between all sites are that all involve a skin puncture, dilated tract through the skin, subcutaneous and muscle layers, insertion into a proximal peripheral vessel, and a catheter that is fed into the vena cava. This procedure requires knowledge of the surface and ultrasound anatomy of these areas.Infection rates are known to differ between anatomical sites with significantly lower rates of infection in subclavian lines and significantly greater levels of infection in femoral sites.
