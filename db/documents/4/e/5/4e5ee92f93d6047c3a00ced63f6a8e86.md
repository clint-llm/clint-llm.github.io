Indications for NTI include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Impending airway compromise

- NTI is typically performed on the awake patient in this case to avoid loss of airway protection reflexes during the process of intubation.
- NTI causes less gagging and is better tolerated in awake patients than oral intubation.

- Intraoral and oropharyngeal surgery

- Complex intraoral procedures involving mandibular reconstruction

- Rigid laryngoscopy

- Dental surgery

- Maxillofacial or orthognathic surgery
