# Definition/Introduction

Work culture is an organizational management concept which deals with the attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions of employees relative to the principles and practices adhered to by the institution. In the healthcare setting, work culture determines how medical, nursing, ancillary staff and other professionals actually work together in the pursuit of achieving organizational goals -- whether they work in clinics, hospitals, health centers, and other health institutions.

Major components of the work culture as it applies in healthcare practice include the statement of its mission and vision, institutional policies, work procedures, and organizational rules. Additionally, the current state of organizational development is an essential element for every healthcare setting as it determines the maturity of the organization which could directly influence the work culture as a whole. Considering these essential elements, every member of the organization, both from healthcare managers and staff, expects that a strong work culture must exist to maximize potentials in serving patients. Positive work culture is geared towards progressive improvement for the individual staff and the organization while a negative work culture fosters disintegration, loss of cooperation and collaboration among staff. Thus, this will result in regressing organizational value and overall performance. With this, it is crucial that work culture is assessed and improved in every health organization as it will significantly impact healthcare staff, leaders and managers, the organization itself and more importantly patient outcomes in terms of health.

# Issues of Concern

The following factors have been described to be associated work culture of specific health care organization, dichotomized into positive and negative work cultures. Positive work cultures must be continually enhanced while learnings from negative work cultures must be sought and applied so as not to cause any further problems in the future.

- Positive Work Culture

To create a work culture that will bring about a significant positive change in an organization, good leadership behavior is essential in maintaining the relationship of the team. Leaders who can scan the situation and the needs of the individual staff is a necessary skill to identify and bridge possible gaps in work implementation. Aligning the members to the direction of the organization sets the tone of the work for every member. When each staff at every level of the organization becomes fully aware of the situation, it will then become more natural for the leaders to mobilize the whole team and to delegate appropriate tasks in carrying out individual functions. Lastly, a leader who can inspire his colleagues in the organization will develop a positive work culture for all. Emphasis on these essential roles must be well taught to healthcare managers since every organization or team is unique on its own. When members of the organization have established a harmonious relationship with its leaders and vice versa, performance and satisfaction at work will be enhanced.

Aside from leadership abilities, management skills require emphasis for all persons who are tasked to manage a unit, a section, a department or the administrative body of any healthcare organization. Managers must be well skilled in developing plans for the organization, organizing staff and attending to their needs at work. They should be able to have control of the organization especially to the implementation of the organization's mandate as a whole. Furthermore, managers who always monitor the progress of work implementation, and those who evaluate the organizational impact of its work on patients, do always have a more accurate view of the status of any healthcare institution. Managers and leaders can be two different things, but real leaders who strongly influence positive work culture always demonstrate both sets of skills. No employee could ever be more motivated and empowered to do the work when there are elements of trust and supportive supervision of one's performance and welfare at work.

Another critical aspect that mediates the positive culture at work is the value of teamwork. Teamwork is the union of individual members to achieve a specific goal. Every healthcare organization, just like in other business entities, usually conduct activities that will enhance teamwork in the organization. Regularly, team building activities can help with the primary goal of uniting the members and not for rest and recreation. Healthcare managers should be able to come up with strategies that will engage the participation of all members that would soon break barriers to a good relationship at work.

- Negative Work Culture

Excessive and prolonged stress among healthcare staff leads to burnout.

Another aspect related to the negative culture at work is absenteeism.

As both leaders and managers of a healthcare organization, it is imperative that these concerns receive proper attention other than just focusing on how to increase work output and profit. Leadership must remember that all healthcare staff, encompassing administrators, doctors, nurses, laboratory staff, pharmacists, technicians, hospital engineers, clerks, and housekeeping service personnel and other parts of the workforce are the essential resource of the healthcare system. Applying strategies that will work out a solution to sustain and continuously improve the positive work culture should always be a priority.

# Clinical Significance

Work culture whether positive or negative significantly impacts the quality of care and delivery of health services to patients.
