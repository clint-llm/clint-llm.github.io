Oral habits such as lip biting may lead to the formation of such lesions, and if that is the case, the patients should be advised against it.

The provider must inform the patient regarding all the treatment options in terms of success rate and complications and opt for what is in the best interest of the patient. The patient ought to be informed regarding the recurrence of the disease. Finally, the patient should be educated about the signs and symptoms of wound infection after the surgical intervention and advised to seek medical care if necessary.
