At a microscopic level, the neurons, glia, and blood vessels of the brain are stretched when imperiled by rapid acceleration, deceleration, and rotational forces. More specifically, it is believed that axonal injury, micro-hemorrhage with subsequent loss of blood-brain barrier integrity, and the inflammatory cascade caused by activation of glial cells ultimately results in the deposition of both tau protein and neurofibrillary tangles in specific regions of the brain characteristic of CTE. Thus, CTE is considered a tauopathy along with Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.
