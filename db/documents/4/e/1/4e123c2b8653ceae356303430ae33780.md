Surgical aortic valve replacement has been the standard treatment for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS). Previously, patients determined to be at high risk for surgery could only be offered diuretics and balloon valvuloplasty which served as palliative treatment and had no effect on long-term outcomes. The development of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a lifeline for patients considered to be inoperable providing both an improvement in symptoms and statistically significant mortality benefit. This activity reviews the evaluation and treatment of aortic valves using TAVR and discusses the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the anatomical structures involved in transcatheter aortic valve replacement. 
- Describe the technique involved in performing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
- Outline the potential complications of transcatheter aortic valve replacement. 
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for enhancing care coordination and communication to advance patients outcomes using transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
