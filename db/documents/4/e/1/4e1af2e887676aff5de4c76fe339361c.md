Measurement of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid levels is through a 24-hour urine sample; this requires the patient to collect all their urine produced over 24 hours. To prepare for an accurate urine sample of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid levels, ask your provider about food or medication restrictions needed before urine collection as well as any specific testing instructions. Testing instructions may include time collection strategies. For example, voiding one’s bladder in the morning after you wake up and mark that time, from then on, collecting urine until you reach 24 hours from that initial time mark.

The normal range for 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid measured in urine is 3 to 15 mg/24 hours. The upper limit of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid measurements may vary depending on the laboratory used in the analysis.

Urine 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid testing is useful for primary midgut carcinoid tumors, including jejunoileal, ascending colon, and appendiceal. In patients with primary midgut carcinoid tumors, 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid levels may decrease during treatment, which may reflect the patient’s response to treatment. Increased or increasing 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid levels indicate a non-response to treatment. Carcinoid tumors of the foregut and hindgut rarely secrete serotonin, so 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid urine testing is not as useful for their detection. Foregut and hindgut carcinoid tumors cannot convert 5-HTP to serotonin because of DOPA decarboxylase deficiency.
