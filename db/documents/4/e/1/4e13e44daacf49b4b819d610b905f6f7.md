Poorly controlled hypertension (HTN) affects several systems such as the cardiovascular, renal, cerebrovascular, and retina. The damage to these systems is known as target-organ damage (TOD). HTN affects the eye causing 3 types of ocular damage: choroidopathy, retinopathy, and optic neuropathy. This activity reviews the cause and pathophysiology og hypertensive retinopathy and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the stages of hypertensive retinopathy.
- Review the presentation of hypertensive retinopathy.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for hypertensive retinopathy.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and outcomes in patients with hypertensive retinopathy.
