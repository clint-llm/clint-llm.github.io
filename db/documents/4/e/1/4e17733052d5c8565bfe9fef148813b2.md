It is considered rare for patients over the age of 30 to have their first episode of Kleine–Levin syndrome. Events that have been documented to be closely associated with the onset of Kleine–Levin syndrome include infections such as a cold-like syndrome with a fever, alcohol use, sleep deprivation, head trauma, physical exertion, unusual stress, traveling, and marijuana use.
