Ubiquitination is a tightly regulated, highly specific, and ATP-dependent biological process carried out by a complex cascade of enzymes. Ubiquitination is an essential player in protein homeostasis, serving to rapidly remove unwanted or damaged proteins. The ubiquitination pathway is involved in the regulation of many basic cellular processes, including cell division and differentiation, response to environmental stress, cell differentiation, immune response, DNA repair, and apoptosis.
