The very complicated nature of the sudden onset of cardiovascular collapse and subsequent severe coagulopathy in the mother, as well as the need for neonatal resuscitation of the infant, make amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) challenging to any interdisciplinary team. Coordination between obstetricians, maternal-fetal specialists, anesthesiologists, labor and delivery nurses, neonatologists, intensivists, hematologists, perfusionists, respiratory therapists, and neonatal intensive care unit nurses is mandatory for successful maternal and infant survival outcomes.
