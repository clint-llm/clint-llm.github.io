Incomplete abortions are most commonly treated expectantly with frequent obstetrics follow-up and serial quantitative beta-hCG levels. Most of these women will expel the fragments of conception on their own without the need for further medical or surgical treatment.

In patients with conception fragments at the cervical os, a clinician can remove the fragments with forceps to help initiate the process of hemostasis, facilitate uterine contractions, and decrease vagal stimulation.

It is important to remember that females who are Rh-negative require RhoGAM. Some obstetricians will manage incomplete abortions medically with oxytocin to help control the bleeding and misoprostol to help the uterus contract and complete the process of abortion. Surgical management with dilation and curettage is another treatment modality that may be utilized but is normally reserved for unstable patients.
