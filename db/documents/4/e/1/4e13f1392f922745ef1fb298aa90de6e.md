Hyperactive deep tendon reflexes are seen in upper motor neuron lesions. Pathologically, hyperactive DTRs may be the earliest sign of corticospinal tract abnormalities or other descending pathways influencing the reflex arc due to a suprasegmental lesion, which means a lesion above the level of the spinal reflex pathways. Hyperactive DTRs can be evoked by a much lighter tendon tap than normal, have short latency, and reflex muscle activity may be seen in motor neuron pools of synergistic muscles. For example, a tendon tap to the biceps brachii may elicit wrist pronation.

Hypoactive or absent deep tendon reflexes are seen in lower motor neuron lesions. Hypoactive DTRs may be seen in disease states such as hypothyroidism, hypothermia, cerebellar dysfunction, or beta-blockade.

Absent DTRs indicate a lesion within the reflex arc. An absent reflex + sensory loss in the nerve distribution of the reflex indicates the presence of a lesion involving the afferent arc of the reflex, either the nerve or dorsal horn. An absent reflex + paralysis, fasciculations, and muscle atrophy indicate the presence of a lesion involving the efferent arc, either the anterior horn cells, efferent nerve, or both. Peripheral neuropathy is the most common cause of areflexia and is typically caused by diabetes, alcoholism, uremia, vitamin deficiencies, amyloidosis, or toxins.

While a bilateral absent ankle jerk usually indicates peripheral neuropathy, cauda equina syndrome can alsoÂ elicit this finding.
