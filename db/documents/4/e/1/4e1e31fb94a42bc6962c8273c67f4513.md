Xeroderma is caused by a lack of natural moisturizing factors (lactic acid, sugars, amino acids, urea), abnormalities in the stratum corneum (skin's superficial barrier), and impaired keratinocyte differentiation. Natural moisturizing factors are crucial for the skin's water-binding capacity. Moreover, the stratum corneum contains lipids (ceramides, cholesterol, free fatty acids) that play a significant role in maintaining hydration; Decreased lipid levels results in dry skin secondary to transepidermal water loss and dehydration. Xeroderma may also involve a reduction in keratinocyte proliferation. Clinically, dry skin will appear dull, rough, scaly, and tight, with associated fissuring, itching, and bleeding.
