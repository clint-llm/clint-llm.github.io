Although not often performed, the gold standard for the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders remains electrodiagnostic testing, which includes nerve conduction studies, needle electromyography, and repetitive nerve stimulation. This activity describes the invaluable electrodiagnostic findings of nerve conduction studies, needle electromyography, and repetitive nerve stimulation and highlights the role of the interprofessional team.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the indications for electrodiagnostic testing in a patient with a neuromuscular disorder.
- Describe the nerve conduction study findings in a patient with a neuromuscular disorder.
- Review the electromyographic findings in a patient with neuromuscular disorders.
- Outline the importance of communication among the interprofessional team to enhance the delivery of care for patients with neuromuscular disorders.
