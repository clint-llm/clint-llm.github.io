A thorough history that includes questions about asthenopia, headache, diplopia, dizziness, nervousness, imbalance, nausea, spectacle intolerance, distorted space perception, as well as previous ocular surgery and ocular disease, can alert the clinician to the presence of aniseikonia. Lensometry of the habitual spectacles, as well as a full refractive evaluation that includes both objective and subjective refractive data, can determine the presence of anisometropia.

Binocular testing, including tests of extra-ocular motility, ocular alignment, and stereopsis, can detect strabismus, ocular suppression, and amblyopia. Finally, a dilated fundus exam can rule out causes of optical aniseikonia, such as keratoconus and cataracts, as well as retinal aniseikonias, such as macula edema and epiretinal membrane.
