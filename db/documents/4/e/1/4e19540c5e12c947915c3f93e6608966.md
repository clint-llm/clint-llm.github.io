Urgent evaluation is crucial in dictating the success of therapy. Bronchoscopy, conventional angiography or computed tomography angiography can all be used in making the diagnosis of TIF. However, all of these imaging modalities have limited sensitivity in diagnosing the condition. Therefore, a high index of clinical suspicion is important as well. On bronchoscopy, direct visualization of the active bleeding site on the anterior wall of the trachea may be seen. Both conventional angiography and computed tomography angiography will reveal a blush from the innominate artery into the trachea.
