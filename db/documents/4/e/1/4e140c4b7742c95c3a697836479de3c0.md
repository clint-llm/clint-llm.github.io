Refraction under cycloplegia should be performed up to 20 years old to prevent myopia's over-estimation.

Cyclopentolate is the preferred cycloplegic for evaluating refractive error among children aged 5 to 13. Tropicamide chiefly acts as a mydriatic, but this is an effective agent for evaluating myopic children above 13 years of age.

Atropine ointment must be cautiously instilled to prevent systemic complications like facial flushing, fever, and tachycardia. The guidelines for spectacle prescription in myopic children have been summarized below (American Academy of Ophthalmology- Preferred Practice Pattern on Pediatric eye evaluations).

Similar refractive error (myopia) in both eyes (Isometropia)

A complete examination of the anterior segment and fundus evaluation should be done after refraction. Fundus evaluation in patients with pathological myopia can reveal degenerative changes, lattice degeneration, peripheral retinal holes, cobblestone degeneration, lacquer cracks, macular hole, and staphyloma.
