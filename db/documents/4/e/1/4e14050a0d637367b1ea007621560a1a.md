Bertolotti syndrome can cause chronic back pain in undiagnosed individuals. Conservative management, such as pharmacotherapy, physical therapy, and steroid injections, have been shown to have varying benefits and may provide temporary or potentially definitive relief.

Those who exhaust these conservative measures and undergo surgical treatment tend to report an improvement in their quality of life but may still have an incomplete resolution of symptoms.

Ultimately, each patient should be approached independently and have their treatment tailored to their lifestyle and needs.
