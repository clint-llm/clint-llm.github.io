The pituitary gland or the hypophysis cerebri is a vital structure of the human body as it performs essential functions for sustaining life. It has the pseudonym of "the master gland." The location of the gland is within the sella turcica of the sphenoid bone. It is made up of two distinct regions called the anterior lobe and posterior lobe, which are functionally active. There is an intermediate lobe in between them. The anterior lobe secretes the majority of hormones from the pituitary gland, which are under the regulation of the hormones secreted from the hypothalamus.
