Isolation is a salient feature in the history of a schizoid patient. Rarely do they maintain close relationships, and often they will choose to participate in occupations that are solitary in nature. They infrequently experience strong emotion, express little to no desire for sexual activity with a partner, and tend to be ambivalent to criticism or praise.

It is unlikely that a person with schizoid personality disorder will present in the clinical setting of his own volition unless prompted by family or some psychiatric sequelae precipitating from the disorder, such as depression. As with most personality disorders, the behavior is in synchrony with the ego, and thus the patient does not acknowledge the need to adapt his or her behavior. Individuals afflicted with personality disorders tend to externalize their problems, viewing others as the etiology of any conflict.
