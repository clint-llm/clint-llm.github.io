Anterior mediastinotomy is a surgical procedure performed in order to obtain a histological diagnosis of mediastinal tumors and enlarged AP lymph nodes in patients with metastatic disease or in patients who are unfit to undergo video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), thoracotomy or median sternotomy so as to radically resect the tumor or the lung cancer and concurrently perform extended lymph nodes dissection. Although it is a minimally invasive procedure, it is done under general anesthesia and has specific contraindications and complications.

In a study, anterior mediastinotomy was successful at sampling one or more lymph nodes in 67% of patients. Five patients (4.3%) who underwent mediastinotomy were spared a thoracotomy by the identification of metastases to AP lymph nodes.
