Dysdiadochokinesia (diadochokinesia) or diadochokinesis is the inability to defined as the inability to perform rapid alternating muscle movements. These can be quick, synchronous, and can include pronation/supination, fast finger tapping, opening and closing of the fists, and foot tapping. It is an essential component to evaluate in patients suspected to have a cerebellar disease. It affects speech, upper and lower extremities. This activity reviews the definition, evaluation, and treatment of disorders that manifest with dysdiadochokinesia and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating and treating patients with these symptoms and how it can provide clues to a narrowed diagnosis.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology of dysdiadochokinesia.
- Describe the physical findings expected in dysdiadochokinesia.
- Outline management options available for conditions that demonstrate dysdiadochokinesia.
- Summarize interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance dysdiadochokinesia and improve outcomes.
