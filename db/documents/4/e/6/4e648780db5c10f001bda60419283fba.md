There are multiple treatment modalities available for patients with toxicity from anxiolytics and sedatives. The first priority is to ensure the patient is hemodynamically stable, with specific attention paid to the airway, breathing, and circulation. Endotracheal intubation and subsequent mechanical ventilation are often necessary for patients at significant risk for respiratory failure and, ultimately, cardiopulmonary arrest.

Treatment should be targeted to the sedative, most likely causing the toxicity. Most treatments will involve supportive care and monitoring for deterioration. However, treatment for specific anxiolytics or sedatives exists. Some treatments are listed below.

BZD toxicity treatment mostly consists of supportive care and close monitoring unless the toxicity is severe. Airway protection is of the utmost importance. Endotracheal intubation, supplemental oxygen, and continuous cardiac monitoring should start for severe overdoses. End-tidal CO2 monitoring can be useful to monitor those at risk of hypoventilation. Decontamination with activated charcoal is NOT recommended in isolated BZD overdose as it can precipitate aspiration. The antidote flumazenil is a nonspecific competitive antagonist for the BZD receptor. It can reverse BZD-induced sedation following general anesthesia, procedural sedation, or overdose.

SSRI/SNRI treatment involves monitoring for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, seizures, cardiac conduction abnormalities, and QT interval prolongation. BZDs can be given or those with signs of serotonin syndrome or seizures. Sodium bicarbonate is an option for those with cardiac toxicity. Magnesium sulfate intravenously can be given to those with the risk of developing torsades de pointes. Additionally, immediate non-synchronized electric defibrillation is indicated for patients with hemodynamic instability.

TCA toxicity, as stated before, begins with the evaluation of ABCs as well as hemodynamics. Sodium bicarbonate is the initial treatment for cardiac toxicity in patients who have overdosed on TCAs and is indicated in patients who develop a widening of the QRS interval >100 msec or ventricular arrhythmia. Additionally, BZDs should be administered if the patient develops seizures. Gastrointestinal decontamination may be a consideration with the use of activated charcoal. Unless bowel obstruction, ileus, or perforation is suspected, the use of activated charcoal is recommended within two hours of ingestion.

Opiate toxicity has become an epidemic in the United States. As mentioned above, these patients require special monitoring of ABCs. If opiate toxicity is suspected, naloxone, which is a short-acting opiate antagonist, can be administered to reverse the effects of the opiates. Preferably it should be administered intravenously but can be administered nasally, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly as well. However, absorption time is different in those methods compared to intravenously.

Consultation with poison control can further assist in the management of these drug toxicities.
