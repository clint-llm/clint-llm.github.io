The pathogenesis of ICVT is similar to cerebral venous thrombosis in that the formation of thrombosis can occlude blood drainage from the cerebral cortex. This lack of blood drainage can lead to increased venous or capillary pressure, which can also increase intracranial pressure—increased venous and capillary pressure results in vasogenic edema.

With increasing vasogenic edema and intravenous pressures, venous or capillaries vessels can rupture, leading to hemorrhage and dysfunction. If the dural sinuses are specifically occluded, it can decrease cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption, which also increases intracranial pressure.
