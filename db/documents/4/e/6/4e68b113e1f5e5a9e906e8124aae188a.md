The hip joint is the connection that exists between the lower extremity and the axial skeleton. Its deep ball-and-socket construction allows for significant levels of stability, load transmission, and weight bearing while still being able to facilitate movement in three planes: flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, and internal/external rotation.
