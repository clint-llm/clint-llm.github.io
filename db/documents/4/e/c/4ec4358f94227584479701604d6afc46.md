Three different sets of kidneys develop consecutively from the urogenital ridges, and the last set persists to become the adult kidney. The first renal tubular system is called the pronephros. Pronephros develop during the fourth week of embryonic development but quickly degenerates as mesonephros appears. Mesonephric kidney degenerates as the metanephros develops through its remnant is incorporated into the male reproductive system. The metanephros begins its development around the fifth week of embryonic development as ureteric buds. As the ureteric buds develop, it induces the formation nephrons.
