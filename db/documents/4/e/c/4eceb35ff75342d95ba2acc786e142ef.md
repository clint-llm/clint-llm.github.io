Scopolamineâ€™s adverse effect profile is due to its antagonism of muscarinic receptors. The more commonly reported adverse effects are listed below, with xerostomia and CNS symptoms being significantly more common than ophthalmic symptoms. However, scopolamine non-selectively affects all five muscarinic receptor subtypes (M1 thru M5), and anticholinergic symptoms, or anticholinergic syndrome, are theoretically possible.

**Most Common**

- Xerostomia (dry mouth)

- Central Nervous System Symptoms:

- Dizziness
- Confusion
- Agitation
- Delirium

- Ophthalmic Symptoms:

- Visual impairment, including blurred vision
- Mydriasis

**Rare Adverse Effects**

- Acute angle-closure glaucoma

- Urinary retention

- Withdrawal symptoms upon cessation of scopolamine

**Discussion on Ophthalmic Symptoms and Glaucoma**

Mydriasis is a potential complication of scopolamine. Although reports exist of bilateral cases, the literature suggests that the majority of cases of mydriasis are unilateral and ipsilateral to the side of their scopolamine patch, caused by the patient self-contaminating by touching their patch and then touching their eyes.

There are case reports of acute angle-closure glaucoma after the administration of scopolamine. This complication is rare. Patients affected by this complication likely have underlying pathology or abnormal anatomy that predisposes them to acute angle closure in the event of mydriasis through at least two mechanisms. Aqueous humor becomes blocked from flowing from the posterior to the anterior chamber of the eye, building up intraocular pressure. Patients can present with the following signs and symptoms:

- Nausea and vomiting

- Severe headache

- Severe ocular pain

- Blurred vision

- Red-eye

- Dilation of pupil

Glaucoma is an ophthalmic emergency that can result in blindness if untreated promptly, and an ophthalmology consultation is important.

**Elderly Patients**

Elderly patients are at an increased risk of and are more vulnerable to adverse anticholinergic effects due to differences in metabolism, excretion of medications, and changes in the CNS. In the elderly, antimuscarinic medications may correlate with increased morbidity for several reasons, including increased risk of falls. Scopolamine and antimuscarinic medications should be used very cautiously in elderly patients.
