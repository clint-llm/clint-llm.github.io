Initial evaluation of a suspected elbow dislocation should begin with anterior-posterior and lateral plain radiographs with attention to joint congruency and potential fractures. Oblique views may be best to evaluate for periarticular fractures. Computerized tomography may be considered if there is a concern for a complex injury or to identify periarticular fractures not easily seen on plain radiographs. Repeat radiographs to ensure adequacy and maintenance of reduction should be obtained after manipulation. Attention should be paid to normal radiocapitellar alignment in values to demonstrate adequate reduction.
