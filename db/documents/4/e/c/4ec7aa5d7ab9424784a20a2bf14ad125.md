Most ovarian cysts are found incidentally, are asymptomatic, and tend to be benign with spontaneous resolution leading to an overall favorable prognosis. Overall, 70%Â to 80% of follicular cysts resolve spontaneously. The potential of benign ovarian cystadenoma to become malignant has been postulated but remains unproven. Less aggressive tumors of low malignant potential run a benign course. The overall survival in these cases is 86.2% at five years.
