Prior to deploying an intracoronary stent, the vessel is appropriately prepared with balloon angioplasty prior toÂ stent placement. Balloon angioplasty is utilized to assess if the lesion will expand and also to further determine lesion length. If the vessel is significantly calcified, the stent may not be amenable to maneuvering to the lesion in question. Rotational or orbital atherectomy may need to be performed to remodel the vessel architecture to facilitate stent delivery and deployment.
