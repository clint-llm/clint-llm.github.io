Schilling's test was named after Dr. Robert F. Schilling for his work on detecting radio-cobalt-labeled vitamin B12 in the urine. Despite this test being no longer used due to recent advances in laboratory techniques, it has been beneficial in the past as a means of detecting the absorption rate of an administered load of vitamin B12 in a patient and aiding in understanding the exact cause of the problem.
