Parkinson-plus syndrome (PPS), also called atypical parkinsonism, refers to a group of neurodegenerative movement disorders that resemble idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) with certain distinguishing clinical and pathophysiological features.

Unlike Parkinson disease, these conditions have a limited response to levodopa with a poor overall prognosis.

Less prevalent disorders are frontotemporal dementia, Pick disease, pallidonigral degeneration, parkinsonian-dementia complex of Guam, Wilson disease, and a rigid variant of Huntington disease.
