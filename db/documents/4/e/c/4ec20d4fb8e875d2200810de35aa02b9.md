**Limitations**

The ACTT-2 study was well designed and provided valuable data, however, it was not powered to evaluate a mortality benefit associated with combination therapy of Remdesivir and Baricitinib. This proves to be a limitation in making this combination a standard of care. It will be interesting to see the results of the next phase of the Recovery trial, which will shed light on the concurrent use of steroids with Baricitinib.
