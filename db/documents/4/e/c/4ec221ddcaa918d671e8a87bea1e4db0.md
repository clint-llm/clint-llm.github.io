Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Approximately half of the patients with coronary artery disease can have dysfunctional hibernating myocardium that is potentially reversible with restoration of blood flow. Earlier identification of these areas can have profound prognostic implications. This activity reviews the role of both invasive and noninvasive imaging techniques in the evaluation of coronary artery disease.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the role of infarct-avid imaging techniques in the evaluation of coronary artery disease.
- Review the indications of both invasive and noninvasive imaging techniques in the evaluation of coronary artery disease.
- Describe additional information that can be obtained from infarct-avid imaging techniques that can further guide diagnostic testing and therapeutic strategy.
- Outline and explain different characteristics and limitations of individual infarct-avid imaging techniques.
