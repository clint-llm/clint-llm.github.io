Biofeedback is a very safe and well-tolerated procedure that has minimal complications. If biofeedback is used at all times during therapy, there may be a drop in the performance following its discontinuation. It is, therefore, beneficial to practice the same techniques without the biofeedback equipment as part of the overall treatment for sustained improvement.
