Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) invariably affect multiple organs. Even within the same disease, the clinical picture can be heterogeneous. Some LSDs present prenatally or very early after birth. Others present in childhood or adulthood. Infant phenotypes have much more severe disease than adults. Certain organs like the central nervous system are more affected in early life. If a prenatal diagnosis of an LSD is available, careful postnatal vigilance can detect symptoms early to enable treatment. Recurrent fetal or neonatal deaths in older siblings or other relatives should herald warning signs to search for an LSD as a probable cause. Some LSDs that present late in life are serendipitously detected in specialty clinics of ophthalmologists, lipidologists, and dialysis centers.

Barring a few conditions, the majority of infants born with an LSD are normal at birth.
