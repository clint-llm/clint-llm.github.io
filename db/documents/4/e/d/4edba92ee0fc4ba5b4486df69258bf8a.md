MODY is caused by defects in pancreatic islet cell development that impairs insulin secretion. It is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, and patients generally have heterozygous mutations. Penetrance and expressivity can vary immensely, even among family members, and the phenotype is largely dependent on the gene involved.
