Estrogen stimulation is responsible for maintaining the normal anatomy and physiology of the urogenital system. There are receptors in the vagina, vulva, urethra, and trigone of the bladder that respond to estrogen stimulation to maintain normal blood flow, tissue thickness, tissue rugate, tissue elasticity, and keeps the epithelial surfaces moist. This healthy tissue is rich in glycogen, which the normal flora Lactobacilli convert to lactic acid. This creates an acidic environment with a pH of 3.5Â to 5.0, which the lactobacilli continue to thrive and protect from vaginal and urinary tract infections.

Concurrently, sexual activities promote epithelial turnover and elevated vaginal lubrication. Vaginal atrophy is most commonly caused by a decreasing or lower estrogen state. As production and amount of total body estrogen decreases, secretions diminish, and the genitourinary tissues become atrophic, causing the many symptoms associated with this condition. Other causes of vaginal atrophy include lactation, hypothalamic amenorrhea, and anti-estrogen medications such as those used to treat uterine fibroids and endometriosis.
