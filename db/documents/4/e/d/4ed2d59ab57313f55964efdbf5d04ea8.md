The development of the BCG vaccine and its utilization in underdeveloped countries have helped in decreasing pediatric tuberculosis. However, we still need to develop newer drugs and ways to fight the disease and its ever-growing drug resistance and associated complications. Awareness campaigns regarding the disease symptoms and its adequate treatment aimed at sensitizing the general population, along with the proper handling of patients and their samples by healthcare professionals, are of utmost importance for the effective handling of the disease burden. Proper screening of latent tuberculosis is necessary for susceptible populations to decrease disease incidence. Newer strategies need to be envisaged for early detection, adequate treatment, and proper management of the complications.
