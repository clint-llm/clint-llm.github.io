This activity discusses why ACO diagnosis and management are challenging to healthcare providers, as there are no specific guidelines for diagnosis. The disease is underdiagnosed and not adequately managed. Strategies exist that can prevent leaving patients with ACO undiagnosed and untreated. Therefore, an interprofessional healthcare team approach is crucial to proper patient management. Family clinicians should consult a pulmonologist to evaluate the patient more thoroughly. Clinicians should routinely check COPD patients for eosinophilia and ask them about other symptoms associated with asthma and ACO.

Respiratory therapists are essential team members and will often perform lung function tests and respiratory therapies. Nurses may assist in the patient workup, counsel on the condition, and help coordinate the activities of various team members. Collaboration with clinical pharmacists is essential. They can teach patients the proper inhaler techniques and increase compliance, answer patient questions about their medication regimen, and perform medication reconciliation. All team members should report any findings, new symptoms, or concerns to the clinicians and the rest of the team for further evaluation and possible corrective action.

These examples of interprofessional care highlight how this model can drive improved patient outcomes. [Level 5]
