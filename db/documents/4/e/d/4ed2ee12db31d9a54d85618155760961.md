Familial hypertriglyceridemia (type IV familial dyslipidemia) is a disorder characterized by the overproduction of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) from the liver. As a result, the patient will have an excessive number of triglycerides and VLDL on the lipid profile. This disorder typically follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern.

When discussing familial hypertriglyceridemia, it is pertinent to discuss Fredrickson-Levy and Leeâ€™s (FLL) phenotypes. The described phenotypes include types I, IIa, IIb, III, IV, and V.
