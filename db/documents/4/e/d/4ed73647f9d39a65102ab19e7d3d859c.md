Treatment of gyrate atrophy consists mainly of dietary modifications to help lower the elevated systemic ornithine levels. The restriction of arginine in the diet, the precursor amino acid for ornithine, has been found to effectively lower plasma ornithine levels and to retard the progression of chorioretinal degeneration in both human and GA mouse models.

Some patients may also benefit from vitamin B6 supplementation in lowering their plasma ornithine levels, which acts by increasing the activity of the pyridoxine-dependant OAT enzyme, while other patients do not.

Creatine supplementation may also have a role in retarding the chorioretinal degeneration and in improving neurological and muscular manifestations.

Examination of the fundus of the family members is very crucial to detect the disease in an early stage and to start intervention early so that the methods to reduce progression can be tried.

Refraction and low vision aid form an important part of management and may improve the quality of life of the patient.

Treatment of cystoid macular edema and intraretinal cystic spaces associated with GA includes restriction of arginine in diet, vitamin B6 supplementation,

Treatment of ocular complications of GA includes cataract surgery for visually significant cataract which may also be associated with zonular weakness,
