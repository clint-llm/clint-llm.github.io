The forearm has a vast vascular network. The brachial artery divides at the elbow giving rise to the ulnar and radial arteries which are located along the ulnar and radial aspects of the anterior forearm compartment. The radial artery supplies the posterolateral forearm and courses lateral to the flexor carpi radialis. The ulnar artery supplies the anteromedial aspect of the forearm and gives rise to the anterior and posterior interosseous arteries which course in the deep anterior and posterior compartments respectively bringing supply to deeper structures of the forearm.

The venous drainage of the arm consists of 3 superficial veins. The dense vascular network found in the forearms drains towards these 3 main veins. The cephalic vein is found on the lateral aspect of the arm. The basilic vein is located on the medial aspect of the arm. The median cubital vein connects the two structures and is commonly found in the antecubital fossa.

The lymphatic drainage of the forearm uses a lymphatic plexus which originates on the distal extremity that flows proximally to superficial lymphatic vessels towards the axillary lymph nodes.
