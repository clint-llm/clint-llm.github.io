**Clinical Considerations**

Patients usually undergoing single-lung ventilation have underlying pulmonary disease. Patients should be evaluated comprehensively for their primary disease before performing the surgical procedure. Echocardiography may be useful in patients with cor pulmonale and may provide information about baseline cardiac function and reserve.

Reviewing the relevant radiological anatomy on a case-to-case basis may help plan anesthetic management for single-lung ventilation. This review will also allow proper preparation for patients who require specialized airway management. Decreased baseline function due to large effusions, consolidations, and atelectasis predisposes patients to hypoxemia during the procedure, which may obviate the need to use higher fractions of inspired oxygen.

The presence of any bullae on the nonoperative lung may provide clues to patients more likely to develop a pneumothorax in the perioperative period. Tumors must be evaluated for paraneoplastic syndromes, as their presence may guide anesthetic management.

Special considerations must be placed on patients' age, as it is an independent risk factor related to complication rates in patients undergoing pulmonary resection using single-lung ventilation. Elderly patients have higher morbidity and mortality from pulmonary resections. Patients undergoing lung resections need additional testing to predict the risks involved in lung resection besides age. The most common tests for such an assessment are FEV1 (forced expiratory volume of one second) and DLCO (diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide).

FEV1 is a predictor of postoperative complications, including death that may arise from undergoing pulmonary resection. Multiple authors found a reduced preoperative FEV1 (less than 60% predicted) to be the strongest predictor of postoperative complications.1 and DLCO is used to determine postoperative risk.

The current ACCP guidelines do not provide numerical cutoffs for DLCO below which pulmonary resections should not be performed on patients. Instead, they give importance to determining the predicted postoperative (PPO) values. Assessment of the postoperative predicted values is the deciding factor in such cases and predicts the success of single lung ventilation. The interpretation of postoperative values is as follows:

- Patients with PPO FEV1 and PPO DLCO greater than 60% do not need further testing to undergo pulmonary resection.

- However, patients with PPO FEV1 or PPO DLCO less than 60% but greater than 30% need additional testing with stair climbing or a shuttle walk test.

- If both values are less than 30%, patients should undergo cardiopulmonary exercise testing with additional measurement of the maximal oxygen consumption.

The cutoff for the stair climb test is 22 meters. Using the Incremental Shuttle Walk test, a distance greater than 400 meters denotes a maximal oxygen uptake of (VO max) greater than or equal to 15 mL/kg/min. Such information may help the physician interpret the procedural risks and better clinical outcomes for patients undergoing single-lung ventilation.

**Lung-Protective Strategy**

This strategy is used for patients with an increased risk of developing acute lung injury (ALI) or progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

- Tidal volume should be initially set at 4 to 6 mL/kg based on ideal body weight (a lower dose than 6-8 mL/kg is recommended for mechanical ventilation using bilateral lungs).

- A respiratory rate (RR) of 16 breaths per minute is appropriate initially for most patients to achieve normocapnia.2 is significantly greater than 40 mm Hg, then the RR should be increased. If the PaCO2 is significantly lower than 40, then the RR should be decreased.

- The inspiratory flow rate should be set at 60 L/min. If the patient appears to be trying to inhale more during the initiation of inspiration, it can increase.

- Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is usually set at 5 to 10 cmH2O depending on hemodynamic status, oxygenation (FiO2 requirement), and the presence of obstructive lung disease or auto-PEEP.

- The oxygenation goal of 88%- to 95% should follow the ARDSnet protocol.
