Long term complications from hyperkalemic periodic paralysis can range from minimal to severe life long symptoms that can decrease quality of life. They can include pain, fatigue, stiffness, weakness, injuries, and depression.

Secondary complications are of concern for general anesthesia as commonly used drugs can causeÂ depolarizing effects on the musculature, which can worsen myotonic reactions inducing spasms and stiffness. This can have detrimental effects on respiratory muscles. Glucose infusion, maintenance of normal body temperature, and low serum potassium should be maintained to prevent these complications.
