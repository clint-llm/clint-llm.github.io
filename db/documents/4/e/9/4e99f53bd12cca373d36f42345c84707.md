Portal hypertension is increased pressure within the portal venous system. It is determined by the increased portal pressure gradient (the difference in pressures between the portal venous pressure and the pressure within the inferior vena cava or the hepatic vein. This pressure gradient is normally less than or equal to 5 mmHg. A pressure gradient of 6 mmHg or more between the portal and hepatic veins (or inferior vena cava) suggests the presence of portal hypertension in most cases.
