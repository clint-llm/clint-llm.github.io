Pertussis vaccine exists in both whole-cell (DPT) and acellular (DTaP) forms. In 1991, the acellular formulation largely replaced the whole-cell vaccine, which had been associated with acute encephalopathy and prolonged seizures. The acellular form has fewer adverse effects and is as effective as the whole-cell formulation. As a result, the whole-cell preparation is only recommended when the acellular form is not available. Common adverse effects are mild and include fever, irritability, behavioral changes, and pain at the injection site. Less commonly, moderately severe reactions, including fever over 40 C, persistent and high-pitched crying, and seizures may occur. A recent study of over 50,000 patients vaccinated from 1981 to 2016 did not detect any new or unexpected adverse effects.
