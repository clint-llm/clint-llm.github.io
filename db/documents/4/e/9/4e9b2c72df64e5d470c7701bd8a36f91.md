Pain is the most common symptom of a vulvar hematoma. Patients can describe it as perineal, abdominal, or buttock pain.

If a vulvar hematoma is suspected, a detailed history should be taken to elicit possible causes associated with it. They include preceding coitus, accidents involving injury to their perineum, and recent deliveries or operations. It is also important to inquire about sexual assault in a sensitive manner.

As bleeding into the vulva is largely restricted only by the Colles fascia and the urogenital diaphragm, a hematoma in this area will be visible on physical examination.

During the examination, a thoroughÂ inspection should be performed for pelvic fractures and genital lacerations, especially if there is a history of significant trauma.
