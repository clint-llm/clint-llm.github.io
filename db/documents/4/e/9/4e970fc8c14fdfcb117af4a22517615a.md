Knowledge of the internal iliac artery and its branches is of critical importance in a variety of pelvic procedures due to the IIA's primary role in blood supply to the pelvic viscera and its potential for ligation or compression at times of massive pelvic hemorrhage. Moreover, the surgeon should be very familiar with how the internal iliac artery is closely situated to a number of musculoskeletal and neurovascular structures within the pelvis, including the ureter, anteriorly; the internal iliac vein, posteromedially; the external iliac vein, obturator nerve, and obturator vein, posterolaterally; the ileum and cecum, anteromedially on the right; and the psoas major and internal obturator muscles, laterally.

In acute situations involving the pelvic region, knowledge of the level of the bifurcation of the common iliac artery and the level of division of the internal iliac artery is of paramount importance. Unilateral or bilateral ligation of the internal iliac artery can be lifesaving for patients experiencing such conditions as massive pelvic hemorrhage, hemorrhage after a vaginal and abdominal hysterectomy, massive broad ligament hematoma, cervical carcinoma, peripartum bleeding, intraperitoneal bleeding of indeterminate origin, and retroperitoneal bleeding following a pelvic fracture.****

Following long-term bilateral ligation of the internal iliac artery, collateral circulation largely supplied by the deep femoral artery will contribute to the revascularization of the internal iliac artery. This process is primarily achieved via anastomoses of the superior gluteal artery with the lateral femoral circumflex artery and the obturator artery with the medial femoral circumflex artery.

It is critical to be mindful of the ureter during pelvic surgeries involving the internal iliac artery and its branches, particularly given the close proximity of the ureter to the bifurcation of the common iliac artery into external and internal iliac arteries. The ureter crosses into the pelvis around the bifurcation of the common iliac artery and runs along the medial aspect of the internal iliac artery. During a hysterectomy, surgeons must be careful when ligating the uterine artery, given that the ureter crosses deep to it and is at risk of injury at this site.

Knowledge of the branches of the internal iliac artery is critical in a variety of pelvic procedures. For instance, the aberrant obturator artery traverses over the superior pubic ramus, where it is at risk of injury from pubic fracture or inguinal hernia repair.

Careful consideration of the many anatomic variants of the internal iliac artery is important in reducing a variety of potential surgical complications. As an example, it is important to note in individuals with corona mortis that compression of the internal iliac artery will not completely stop bleeding from its contributing arteries since the external iliac artery also supplies this vascular loop. However, compression of the internal iliac artery will control the blood flow contributed by the IIA to the corona mortis.
