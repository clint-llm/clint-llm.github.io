Clostridium botulinum is an anaerobic gram-positive spore-forming rod and is the most common cause implicated in reversible flaccid paralysis. Other clostridial bacteria can also produce the toxin leading to botulism. Despite its potential fatality and rarity, the illness can masquerade as other illnesses making diagnosis difficult. Toxicity is detectable on the rat SMG-C6 cell line. This activity reviews, evaluation, and management of clostridial infections and highlight the role of the interprofessional team in managing patients with this condition.

**Objectives:**
- Identify the etiology and epidemiology of Clostridium-related diseases, medical conditions, and emergencies.
- Review the appropriate history, physical, and evaluation of Clostridium infections.
- Outline the treatment and management options available for Clostridium infections.
- Describe interprofessional team strategies for improving care coordination and communication to advance Clostridium infections and improve outcomes.
