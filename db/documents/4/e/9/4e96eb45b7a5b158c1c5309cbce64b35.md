The VB system provides circulation to the cervical spinal cord, cerebellum, brainstem, and posterior cerebrum via its major branches:

- Vertebral arteries

- Anterior spinal arteries supply the cervical spinal cordÂ 
- Muscular branches supply the deep cervical musculature
- Posterior inferior cerebellar arteries supply the cerebellum and the choroid plexus of the fourth ventricle

- Basilar artery

- Anterior inferior cerebellar arteries supply the inferolateral pons, anteroinferior cerebellum, and the middle cerebellar peduncle
- Paramedian arteries supply the thalamus and pons
- Superior cerebellar arteries supply the superior cerebellum and parts of the midbrain

Venous drainage from the territory supplied by the VB system is mainly via the vertebral venous plexus surrounding the vertebral arteries within the transverse foramina and the dural venous sinuses, which drain into the internal jugular veins.
