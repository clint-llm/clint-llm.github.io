Blunt force trauma can cause spinal column injury and, consequently, spinal cord damage that can result in serious morbidity and mortality. In the 1960s and 1970s, spinal motion restriction was employed to reduce or prevent neurological sequelae thought to be secondary to spinal column injuries. Though widely adopted as the standard of care, the literature lacks any high quality, evidence-based research that investigates whether or not spinal motion restriction has any impact on neurological outcomes.

Consequently, newer guidelines have recommended that spinal motion restriction be utilized judiciously in specific patient populations.
