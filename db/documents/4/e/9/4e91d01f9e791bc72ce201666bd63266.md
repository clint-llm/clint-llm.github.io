Histologically, LP is characterized by hyaline-like periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, diastase-resistant deposits within the papillary dermis and at the dermal-epidermal junction (DEJ).

Immunolabeling can be a useful diagnostic tool, especially early in the disease course. Reduced ECM1 protein in conjunction with characteristic clinical findings should heighten suspicion for LP.
