The quadriceps femoris is the most voluminous muscle of the human body.

From a sporting point of view, it is an extraordinarily important muscle, but it is often subject to trauma due to the stress it receives. The quadriceps is essential for daily activities, such as climbing stairs or getting up from a chair. Quadriceps can become a diagnostic tool in some pathological conditions, studying the intrinsic adaptations of muscle tissue. Some muscle tissue flaps can be used to repair parts of the skull or other contractile districts.

Recent information on the function and anatomy of this muscle will improve the understanding of the functional coordination between the different vasti and allow the implementation of a clinical and rehabilitative approach. Its functions affect the knee joint, hip joint, posture, walking, and the relationship between the pelvis and the spine.
