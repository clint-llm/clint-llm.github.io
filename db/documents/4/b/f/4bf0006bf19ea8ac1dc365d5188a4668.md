**Dermoscopy**

Polarized videodermoscopic evaluation of the affected areas of the thumbs and index fingers shows focal clusters of pale-to-yellowish colored papules with slight umbilication in a few of them, interspersed with pale yellow-colored structureless areas **[Figure 1 (C)]**.

**Histopathology**

The gold-standard technique of diagnosis of acrokeratoelastoidosis remains histopathology. Apart from various epidermal alterations (vide infra), the presence of a reduced number of thick and fragmented elastic fibers in the dermis ('elastorrhexis') is the diagnostic hallmark; the latter feature is observed even on a routine hematoxylin-eosin (H & E) section **[Figure 1 (D)]**.but better appreciated with special stains for elastin such as Verhoeff’s-Van Gieson (VVG)**[Figure 1 (E)]**, Weigert and Orcein.

**Ultrasonography:****Doppler Study**

In a recent study, the use of Doppler ultrasound (USG) examination was reported to be a useful non-invasive adjuvant investigation for confirmation of diagnosis and benignancy of the condition (lack of protrusions of fat lobules) and ruling out the presence of piezogenic pedal papules and granulomas.
