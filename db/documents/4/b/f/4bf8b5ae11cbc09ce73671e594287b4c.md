Breast fat necrosis is a non-suppurative inflammation of adipose tissue caused by the disruption of oxygen supply to fat cells, ultimately leading to cell death. It is commonly present in female patients who undergo breast procedures, although it can also be associated with malignancy. In non-surgical patients, the most common etiology is trauma. This activity reviews the etiology, pathophysiology, evaluation, and management of breast fat necrosis in surgical patients.

**Objectives:**
- Review the etiology of breast fat necrosis in surgical and non-surgical patients.
- Identify the patient history associated with breast fat necrosis.
- Describe typical imaging findings associated with breast fat necrosis.
- Review the importance of collaboration and communication amongst interprofessional team members and patients to improve outcomes for surgical patients who develop breast fat necrosis.
