The fossa ovalis may be a frequent site of cardiac pathology. Known pathologies involving the fossa ovalis include:

- Premature closure of the foramen ovale & Patent foramen ovale (PFO)

- Atrial septal defect (ASD)

- Rheumatic heart disease

- Amyloidosis

- Tumors: Prichard’s structures, myxomas, lipomatous hypertrophy of the cardiac interatrial septum

- Fossa ovalis membrane aneurysm (FOMA)

- Cardiac arrhythmias

Patent foramen ovale and atrial septal defect represent functionally similar pathologies; however, they differ in their etiology as well as clinical severity. ASDs are the result of the failure to form either of the interatrial septa (septum primum, septum secundum) or sinus venosus, whereas PFOs result when, in approximately 25% of the population, there is a failure of closure of the foramen ovale created by the septa.

Atrial septal defects may occur in isolation or as part of a syndrome. Several genes have been implicated in the development of atrial septal defects. NKX2.5 gene is known to produce secundum type defects, TBX5 gene mutations result in Holt-Oram syndrome which features ASD.

The structure and dimensions of the fossa ovalis are altered in the course of rheumatic heart disease.

Amyloidosis, characterized by diffuse thickening of heart valves, does not spare the interatrial septum. Thickening of the interatrial septum is 100% specific for amyloidosis

The fossa ovalis is a frequent site of atrial myxomas. Atrial myxomas are true neoplasms, appearing as pedunculated friable masses attached to the interatrial septum.

Prichard's structures are also benign structures derived from mature endothelial cells, they are more frequently found in individuals beyond 60 years of age and are unrelated to cardiac myxomas.

Lipomatous hypertrophy is fat accumulation greater than 2cm located on the interatrial septum. The mass characteristically spares the fossa ovalis. Arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death may be accompanying complications.

The fossa ovalis is found to be aneurysmal in some cases but is present with increased incidence in patients with stroke.

Electrophysiological studies may reveal increased automaticity in the region of the limbus fossa ovalis. Such automaticity may manifest as reversible focal atrial tachycardia and chaotic atrial rhythm and is responsive to focal radiofrequency ablation of the limbus with the restoration of cardiac function.
