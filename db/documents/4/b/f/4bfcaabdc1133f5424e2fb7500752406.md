An intention, rubral, cerebellar, or course tremor is defined as aÂ rhythmic, oscillatory, and high amplitude tremor during a directed and purposeful motor movement, worsening before reaching the target.

Intention tremor was first described by Jean-Martin Charcot in 1868, who noticed that multiple sclerosis (MS) patients could be differentiated from Parkinson disease (PD) patients by the type of tremor they present. MS is the most common cause of intention tremor. MS patients had intention tremors along with nystagmus and scanning speech, bearing his name as the Charcot's triad.
