Patients that have irritable bowel syndrome have been shown to have a heightened gastrocolic response to ingested food. A common symptom of patients with IBS is the urge to defecate following a meal and the relief of symptoms like tenesmus, distension, and abdominal pain following defecation. This phenomenon is believed to be due to, in part, a heightened gastrocolic response. As discussed previously, any impairment of the neural or the hormonal mechanisms leading to decreased or absent gastrocolic reflux will result in decreased colonic transit of fecal matter and will lead to functional constipation. This presentation is more prevalent in older patients with spinal cord problems, and also diabetic neuropathy patients with gastroparesis.
