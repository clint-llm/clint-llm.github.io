There are no absolute contraindications for amniocentesis.

Relative contraindications for amniocentesis are:

- Hepatitis B and HIV infections can be transmitted from maternal circulation to the fetus during the procedure. It should be deferred in HIV-infected patients until antiretroviral treatment is started and the viral load substantially decreases. Highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV greatly reduces maternal to fetal transmission rates.

- Decreased amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios)

- Oral anticoagulation therapy must be stopped 48 to 72 hours before the procedure, and patients may be shifted to low molecular weight heparin.
