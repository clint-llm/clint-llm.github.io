Acute rejection occurs in all transplants, except between identical twins. Acute rejection begins as early as one week after transplant, with the risk being highest in the first three months. After clinical suspicion or histologic confirmation of acute renal rejection, therapy should start within a 3-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone, and periodically testing of serum creatinine levels. Subsequently, if the patient has similar rejection episodes post-operatively, the practitioner should treat with intravenous corticosteroids. In a patient that does well, cyclosporin-A should be discontinued after 9 months, but the patient still should take a daily maintenance dose of immunosuppressive drugs, for example, 50-mg azathioprine and 5-mg prednisolone.

Retransplantation should be considered on a clinical basis where there is not a definite improvement despite all efforts. Primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in the recipient due to transplantation of a CMV-positive kidney into a CMV-negative recipient can be treated with a combination of ganciclovir and CMV-specific immune globulin.Â Cases refractory to immunosuppressive therapy or intravenous antibodies can be treated with extracorporeal photoimmune therapy to inactivate graft-specific immunoglobulins.
