Laboratory testing is indicated when information gathered during the history and physical exam suggests an underlying comorbidity or the cause is unclear. Generally, tests may include a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, iron studies (serum ferritin, serum iron, and total iron binding capacity), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and vitamin D 25OH. Ferritin and vitamin D 25OH are essential for a normal hair cycle.

Scalp biopsy offers additional information in nonscarring alopecias and is essential in scarring alopecias. Generally, 1 or 2 4-mm punch biopsies are taken in the direction of the hair shaft down to the subcutaneous fat, allowing for horizontal and/or vertical sectioning. Horizontal sections have the advantage of facilitating the assessment of many follicles for hair density, anagen-to-telogen hair ratios, terminal-to-vellus hair ratios, and the extent of inflammatory infiltrate when present.

Androgenetic alopecia (male and female pattern hair loss) is most commonly diagnosed clinically. A complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, iron studies, TSH, and vitamin D 25OH may be helpful. Laboratory testing is recommended for females presenting with signs and/or symptoms of hyperandrogenism, such as hirsutism, menstrual irregularities, acanthosis nigricans, and adult acne, including free or total testosterone with or without dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS).

Alopecia areata is usually diagnosed based on the history and physical (see History and Physical section for details). When clinically uncertain, additional evaluation may include serology for other autoimmune disorders or infectious diseases (eg, syphilis), a fungal culture, and a scalp biopsy.

Telogen effluvium is typically diagnosed clinically. If needed, additional investigations may include a complete blood count, iron studies (serum ferritin, serum iron, and total iron binding capacity), TSH, T3, and T4 because 2 common conditions associated with telogen effluvium are iron deficiency anemia and thyroid disorders.

FFA and LPP share many histological features; however, differences have been found, which support FFA as a specific type of lymphocytic cicatricial alopecia rather than an LPP variant.

FFA lesions are characterized by a dense lichenoid lymphocytic infiltrate around the infundibulum and isthmus of the hair follicle. An absence of sebaceous glands is an early finding. Additional features may include vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer of the follicular epithelium, keratinocyte necrosis, apoptosis in the outer sheath, fibrous tracts, and elastin fiber loss.

There are no specific laboratory tests for FFA or LPP. Basic serology, thyroid function tests, antinuclear antibodies, and sex hormone levels may be ordered, but findings are usually normal. Currently, there is no consensus on whether or not to screen all patients with FFA or LPP.

As with FFA, LPP lesions are characterized by a lymphocytic infiltrate around the infundibulum and isthmus of the hair follicle. A lichenoid pattern may be present; the epithelium-stroma junction will likely show necrotic keratinocytes, and the lower portion of the hair follicle may demonstrate inflammatory cells. Sebaceous glands are usually totally destroyed, and destroyed hair follicles are replaced by connective tissue or sclerotic fibrous tracts.
