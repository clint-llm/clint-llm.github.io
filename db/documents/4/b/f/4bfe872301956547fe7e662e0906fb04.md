The differential diagnosis for pulsus alternans is varied depending upon the potential underlying etiology. Pulsus alternans of the left ventricle should raise concern for reduced ejection fraction, cardiomyopathy, aortic stenosis, coronary artery disease, or cardiac ischemia. Pulsus alternans of the right ventricle should raise concern for pulmonary embolus, pulmonary hypertension, reactive airway disease, or mitral stenosis.
