**Kinetics**

Procalcitonin (PCT) serum levels have been shown to increase 6 to 12 hours following initial bacterial infections and increase steadily in the two to four hours following the onset of sepsis.

**Chemical Assays**

In current clinical practice, several chemical assays have been developed to detect PCT serum levels at varying sensitivities, most displaying functional sensitivity around 0.06 ng/mL.
