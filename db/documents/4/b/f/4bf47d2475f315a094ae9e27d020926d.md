The pressure in the cranial vault is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and is normally less than 20 mm Hg. The cranium is a rigid structure that contains 3 main components: brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and blood. Any increase in the volume of its contents will increase the pressure within the cranial vault. An increase in the volume of one component will result in a decrease in volume in one or two of the other components. The clinical implication of the change in volume of the component is a decrease in cerebral blood flow or herniation of the brain. This activity reviews the cause, pathophysiology, and presentation of increased intracranial pressure and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in its management.

**Objectives:**
- Describe the causes of increased intracranial pressure.
- Review the clinical presentation of a patient with increased intracranial pressure.
- Summarize the treatment of increased intracranial pressure.
- Explain modalities to improve care coordination among interprofessional team members in order to improve outcomes for patients affected by increased intracranial pressure.
