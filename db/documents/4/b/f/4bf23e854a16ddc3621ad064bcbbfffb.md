In the vast majority of cases, trombiculiasis will resolve spontaneously within a few weeks as long as there is noÂ re-exposure. The risk of super-imposed bacterial infection or transmission of other bacterial diseases is generally quite low. Therefore, the prognosis of chigger bites is almost invariably good. If there is a possibility of re-infection, the provider should counsel the patient on avoiding chigger habitats, covering the skin when passing through infested areas, or using repellents and insecticides to avoid exposure.
