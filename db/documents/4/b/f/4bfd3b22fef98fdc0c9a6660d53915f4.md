One of the most well-known adverse effects is optic neuritis. The effect of neuritis is dose-related, with greater than 40% of adults developing toxicity at doses greater than 50 mg/kg and around 0 to 3% of adults developing toxicity at 15 mg/kg/daily.

The manifestation of EMB-induced optic neuropathy appears to be from EMBâ€™s chelation of copper. A study with 60 patients undergoing treatment with ethambutol monitored their serum copper levels. Statistical analysis confirmed a significant change in copper concentration, supporting the copper chelation effect by EMB.

Patients that experience any visual symptoms should discontinue the drug immediately and consult their doctor.
