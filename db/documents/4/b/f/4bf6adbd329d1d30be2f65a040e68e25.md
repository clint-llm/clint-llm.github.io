A diverse, interprofessional team of care providers is required to prevent and manage contrast toxicity. Both the clinician ordering the imaging and the radiologist performing the imaging have critical responsibilities in assessing the patient's appropriateness for the receipt of contrast. The American College of Radiation Manual on Contrast Media provides evidence-based, standardized guidelines for safe practices in the use of contrast agents. The nursing staff ensures patient safety by monitoring their vital signs and presentation before, during, and after contrast administration. Pharmacists may be involved to protect against drug interactions and coordinate appropriate dosing of contrast agents. An interprofessional team approach will provide the best outcomes.
