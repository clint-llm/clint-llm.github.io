Inner ear decompression sickness is extremely rare. Although the total number and frequency of IEDCS in divers is unknown, one source reports an incidence of 0.2 to 0.3% per recreational dive, though this is higher than that described in other sources.

Approximately one-quarter of recreational divers presenting with neurologic decompression sickness will have vestibular-cochlear involvement.
