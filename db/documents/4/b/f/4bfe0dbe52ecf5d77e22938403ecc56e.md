Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) is a commonly ordered test that measures the level of urea found in blood and can assess how well the kidneys are functioning. This range may vary slightly in different healthcare settings, but a normal BUN is generally 8 to 20 mg/dL. In patients with kidney dysfunction or a high-protein diet, one can expect the BUN to be elevated. In patients with liver disease or urea cycle deficiency, one can expect the BUN to be decreased. It is important to take note of a patient’s clinical picture before assuming a patient may have renal or hepatic dysfunction.

Serum ammonia can also be measured and used to assess hepatic functioning. Normal serum ammonia generally ranges from 15 to 45 m/dL. The serum ammonia level may be elevated in a patient with hepatic dysfunction, urea cycle deficiency, overgrowth of gut flora, protein catabolism, and many other causes. Again, it is important to assess the patient’s clinical picture to identify the cause of elevated serum ammonia.
