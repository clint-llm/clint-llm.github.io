The nasal structures are derived primarily from the ectoderm and neural crest. The ectoderm provides a pattern for developing structures and interacts with facial mesenchymal layers derived from neural crest cells.

During the fifth gestational week, the proliferation of the ectodermal placodes and the surrounding mesenchyme create a pair of depressions called the nasal pits. These pits continue to expand until fusing with the oral cavity, ultimately leading to the formation of the primordial choanae and the creation of a junction between the nasal cavity and the oropharynx.

The inferior surface of the nasal cavity is formed by the junction of the maxillary processes and medial nasal processes as the maxillary processes grow medially. The nasal septum grows inferiorly until it meets the newly formed palatal shelves.

The preturbinates form at the eighth week of gestation as three soft tissue elevations that are eventually replaced by a cartilaginous capsule. The superior, middle, and inferior turbinates are usually well-formed by 16 weeks gestation. The superior and middle turbinates are ossified by outgrowths from the ethmoid bone and the inferior turbinate by the maxilla.

Dysfunctions in development can lead to a deviated nasal septum, inferior turbinate hypertrophy, a paradoxical middle turbinate, concha bullosa, and choanal atresia, among others.
