Epicondylitis is a common cause of elbow pain in athletes and the general population. It can occur both at the medial and lateral epicondyle with medial epicondylitis occurring less frequently than lateral epicondylitis.

Although termed epicondylitis, a more appropriate description, especially in a chronic setting, would be epicondylosis or epicondylalgia. Current literature shows that the underlying process appears to be degeneration and granulation tissue formation that is referred to as “angiofibroblastic hyperplasia or tendinosis” without the presence of a definitive inflammatory process. However, it should be noted, that there is no clear evidence that the early stages of the condition do not have an inflammatory component.
