The most important consideration in preventing PDPH is the use of a small gauge, pencil-tipped, non-cutting spinal needle. There is no evidence to support supplemental fluid or bedrest following procedure to prevent PDPH.Â  Intravenous aminophylline, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), or epidural morphine may reduce the incidence of PDPH, but further investigation is needed to prove efficacy.
