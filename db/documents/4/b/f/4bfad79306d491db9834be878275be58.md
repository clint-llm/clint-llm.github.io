A detailed review of individual white dot syndromes is beyond the scope of this article. The following pearls highlight several key distinguishing clinical features of several of the white dot syndromes.

- Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS): young patients (age 20 to 50 years), women > men, often viral prodrome, typically unilateral, good visual prognosis, small white dots in the outer retina, “wreath-like” pattern of hyperfluorescence on FA

- Acute retinal pigment epitheliitis (ARPE): young patients (age 10 to 30 years), women = men, most often unilateral, small hyperpigmented lesions, excellent visual prognosis

- Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE): young patients (age 20 to 30 years), women = men, typically bilateral, flat gray or white placoid lesions at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and inner choroid, good visual prognosis

- Acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR): young patients, often myopic, women > men, typically bilateral (though asymmetric), initially normal-appearing fundus followed by zonal RPE atrophy and pigmentary changes, no clear benefit from treatment, good visual prognosis, though may progress or recur

- Multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis (MCP): young to middle-age patients (age 20 to 60 years), women > men, bilateral, presence of anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation along with multiple yellow-white chorioretinal lesions with subsequent atrophy and scarring, complicated by CME and CNV, poor visual prognosis, treatment generally required

- Birdshot chorioretinopathy: middle-aged patients (age 40 to 60 years), women > men, bilateral, difficulty with night vision, multiple cream-colored lesions in a birdshot style, radiating pattern nasally predominant, associated vitritis, CME, and retinal vasculitis, highly correlated with the presence of HLA-A29, “quenching” on FA, guarded visual prognosis, treatment generally required

- Serpiginous choroiditis: middle-aged patients (age 30 to 60 years), men > women, bilateral (asymmetric), the geographic pattern of chorioretinal scarring, guarded to poor prognosis, treatment may require alkylating agents

- Punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC): young patients (under 40 years of age), women > men, bilateral, small punctate gray or yellow lesions in the posterior pole evolve to atrophic scars, absence of vitritis, associated with CNV, good visual prognosis though more guarded with the development of CNV
