The classic presentation is that of a slow-growing, painless nodule in the medial or central plantar aponeurosis of the foot that is about 0.5 to 3 cm in diameter. Smaller nodules can present as local pressure points or areas of plantar distension. As theÂ nodules become more locally invasive, they can lead to pain and swelling and eventually lead to trouble with ambulation. Patients commonly present after experiencing increased pain in the plantar surface of the foot after long walks. Specific activities, such as long walks, standing for long periods, specific shoe wear, and walking barefoot, can exacerbate the symptoms.

The foot should be examined for tenderness over bony prominences and tendon insertions. Hindfoot alignment, as well as the presence of an Achilles or gastrocnemius contracture, should be evaluated as these can contribute to symptoms.
