To achieve weight loss, people reach a point where their energy expenditure is lower than it used to be. Research shows that people who lose weight secrete higher levels of ghrelin, a hormone known to increase hunger, opposite of the effect of the hormone leptin involved in satiety. These hormones can also impact and increase fatigue.

The combination of increased hunger, increased fatigue, and stalling in weight loss can be very discouraging for people, leading them to quit their diet. Not only is the diet terminated, but the increase in hunger often leads to regaining weight. The weight loss plateau period can be an important period where hormone levels and/or metabolic rate are readjusted.

It is essential to be mindful of the hormonal and psychological impact of this plateau. If weight loss is not accomplished in a calculated manner, a large amount of lean mass may be lost compared to fat loss. An increase in hunger and an increase in ghrelin can cause rapid weight gain. Although an individual may return to their original starting weight, they could have more fat and less muscle mass than starting if weight loss is not accomplished in a safe calculated way. This can lead to a detrimental effect where hunger levels increase, fatigue increases, weight is regained, and individuals are left feeling worse psychologically and gain weight compared to their starting point.
