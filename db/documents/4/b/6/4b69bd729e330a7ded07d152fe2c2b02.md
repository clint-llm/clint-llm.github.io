Bursitis is very common in clinical practice and managed by many clinicians. However, to have uniformÂ treatment and outcomes, the condition is best managed by an interprofessional team that includes a nurse practitioner, a sports physician, primary care provider, an emergency department physician, a rheumatologist, and an orthopedic surgeon.

Once the diagnosis is made, the treatment in most cases is supportive. Most cases of non-infectious bursitis resolve on their own in a few weeks. However, if the fluid is infected, a consult should be obtained from the infectious disease specialist and orthopedic surgeon.

After treatment, to restore functionality some patients may benefit from physical therapy. Patients should be educated to refrain from the same activities that triggered bursitis.

Patients not responding to conservative measures may require steroid injections for pain relief. However, orthopedic specialty nurses and physical therapy should assist in teaching range of motion exercises which play a role in increasing the strength of the muscles that support the area around the bursa. During follow up, the nurse practitioner, primary care provider, and nurse must monitor the patient for improvement in symptoms.

Surgery is the last resort and only recommended for cases that fail conservative treatment.

**Outcomes**

The outcomes in most patients with bursitis are good.
