As with any surgical procedure, there can be possible complications. One of the most common complications is portal vein thrombosis. Thrombosis can lead to complete loss of the graft; however, since the addition of heparin in the infusion process, life-threatening thrombosis is rare.

Bleeding is another among the most frequent complications, occurring in up to 8% of islet transplant procedures. Mycotic aneurysms, infections, pancreatic fistulas, bile leak, and pancreatitis are some of the other complications that may occur with islet cell transplantation. As many as 30% of patients that undergo the procedure will need a repeat operation.
