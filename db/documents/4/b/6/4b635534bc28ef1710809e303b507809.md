**Extraction of Plasma**

It can be separated from whole blood by the process of centrifugation, i.e., spinning whole blood with an anticoagulant in a centrifuge. Plasma is lighter, forming the upper yellowish layer while the denser blood cells fall to the bottom. The plasma collected is frozen within 24 hours to preserve the functionality of the various clotting factors and immunoglobulins; it is thawed before use and has a shelf life of 1 year. Interestingly, while O- is the preferred universal donor for blood, the plasma of AB blood groups is the most preferred because their plasma does not contain antibodies, making it acceptable for everyone without fear of an adverse reaction.

Plasma, like whole blood, is initially tested to ensure the safety of recipients. As per the FDA regulations, the collected plasma undergoes a battery of tests to identify transmittable diseases, mainly hepatitis A, B, and C, along with syphilis and HIV. The process of fractionation separates individual plasma proteins.
