As with any viral or bacterial infection, isolation and avoidance of exposure are essential to avoid contracting the infection. This is especially true in cases of impetigo and strep pharyngitis, as these infections are much more common in children. As such, children have a higher propensity to spread this infection through close contact with other children. Therefore, isolating known infections from close contact with others is important by having them remain home from school, daycare, etc. However, because GAS is ubiquitous in our environment and part of our normal skin flora, very little can be done to avoid infection with GAS altogether.
