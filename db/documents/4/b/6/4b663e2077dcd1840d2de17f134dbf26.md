Since cystine contains sulfur, the urine of hypercystinuric individuals may have a rotten egg odor. Typical hexagonal cystine crystals can sometimes be seen on urinalysis in affected patients. When these hexagonal crystals appear on urinalysis, it suggests supersaturation of the urine with cystine.

The sodium cyanide-nitroprusside test is often the initial laboratory screening test for cystinuria as it is fast, simple, and provides a reasonably reliable, qualitative assessment of urinary cystine levels. The cyanide converts cystine to cysteine, which then binds to the nitroprusside creating an intense purple color in just a few minutes. The test typically turns positive at cystine levels above 75 mg/gm creatinine.

A definitive diagnosis of cystinuria requires a quantitative 24-hour urine test for cystine and a positive stone chemical composition analysis (preferably using X-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopy).

- Age <1 month: <80 mg cystine/gram creatinine

- Age   1 month - 1 year: <52 mg cystine/gram creatinine

- Age >1 year:    <35 mg cystine/gram creatinine

Regular 24-hour urine tests are recommended to monitor therapy results and modify treatment as a change in stone composition is common.

**Cystine Supersaturation**is a very useful laboratory measurement that evaluates the cystine crystallization potential as well as the efficacy of prophylactic therapy, except for those on thiol-based medications where the test is not considered reliable as it looks at total cystine whether complexed with thiol or not. To perform this test, the patient's urine sample is incubated with additional cystine crystals for 48 hours at 37 degrees C. At this point, the urine is completely saturated with cystine. Dividing the original sample's cystine concentration by the concentration of the fully saturated sample provides a supersaturation ratio. The optimal ratio to prevent cystine stone formation is not known, but a supersaturation ratio of 0.6 or less has been suggested as a goal.

**The "Cystine Capacity"****test**is recommended for cystinuria patients on thiol-based medications where the supersaturation test cannot be used reliably. The "cystine capacity" test measures the ability of a patient's urine to dissolve a solid cystine sample. A pre-determined amount of solid cystine is added to a measured sample of the patient's urine. The sample is incubated for 48 hours at 37 degrees C, and then all solid cystine is removed. If the recoverable solid cystine weighs less than the original sample, the urine is undersaturated. If it weighs more, then it is supersaturated. A "positive" test means that the solid cystine sample has gained additional cystine after incubation, so the test urine was supersaturated. A "negative" test indicates that the solid sample has partially dissolved, and therefore the test sample was undersaturated with cystine. While "cystine capacity" is a very reasonable test for cystine saturation, it is relatively insensitive and somewhat labor-intensive, which limits its practicality and availability, although it does allow an accurate determination of cystine saturation even for patients who are on medical (thiol) therapy.

The definitive diagnosis of obstructing cystine calculi will require imaging, including plain abdominal X-rays (KUB), ultrasound, and CT scans.

**Plain X-rays**of the abdomen will not show cystine stones well as they are only faintly radio-opaque. If visible, they will tend to have a ground-glass appearance.

**Ultrasound**can identify cystine stones in the kidney if they are sufficiently large (usually >4 mm) and can detect hydronephrosis, but it cannot distinguish cystine from other stone chemical compositions. It is the preferred initial imaging study for stones in children and in pregnancy. Ultrasound can measure the renal resistive index, which is elevated in cases of obstruction. The resistive index is defined as (peak systolic velocity - end-diastolic velocity) / peak systolic velocity.  This value is usually 0.50 to 0.70. If one side has a higher resistive index, it suggests obstruction on the affected (elevated) side.  (In medical renal disease, the resistive indices on both sides are elevated equally.)

The finding of a hyperechoic fetal colon on routine ultrasound at <36 weeks gestation has been shown to indicate fetal cystinuria with a very high positive predictive value of 89%.

**CT scans without contras**t remain the "gold standard" for diagnosing urolithiasis and will show cystine stones clearly. Such calculi will typically demonstrate a relatively low density of <800 Hounsfield units.
