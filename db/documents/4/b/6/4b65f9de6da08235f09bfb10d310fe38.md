Fractures of the orbital floor and the medial orbital wall (blowout fractures) are common midface injuries. Orbital fractures have a distinct trauma mechanism and are complex due to the complex anatomy of the bony and soft tissue structures involved. Knowledge of anatomy is mandatory when dealing with patients presenting with trauma to the orbit. The frontal, ethmoidal, sphenoid, zygomatic, and lacrimal bones form the bony structures of the orbit. This activity reviews the etiology, presentation, evaluation, and management of fractures of the orbital floor and reviews the role of the interprofessional team in evaluating, diagnosing, and managing the condition.

**Objectives:**
- Outline the osseous anatomy of the orbit of the eye.
- Review the procedure for a proper history and physical examination to address a potential orbital floor fracture, including potential differentials.
- Describe the treatment and management of orbital floor fractures, including potential complications after initial treatment or surgery.
- Summarize the role of improving coordination among the interprofessional team to streamline diagnosis and treatment for patients with orbital floor fracture.
